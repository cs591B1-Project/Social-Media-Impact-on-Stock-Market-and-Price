      "text": "Facebook wants a piece of LinkedIn's job recruiting features The social network is experimenting with a new 'Jobs' tab on business pages. Save REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \nAfter seeing businesses and employers post ad hoc job openings on their Facebook pages, the massive social network is finally experimenting with job recruitment tools in earnest. As TechCrunch reports today , Facebook is testing out a new \"Jobs\" tab for business pages alongside an \"Apply Now\" button for applicants that will start filling out a job application with information from the user's Facebook profile. \nThat Jobs tab acts as a landing page where businesses can send potential new hires and interested folks rather than directing them to a jobs page on their own website or a third-party job board. Users looking to get their foot in the door at a specific company could also subscribed to that company's Facebook page to get notified about future openings. Businesses will also be able to pay to post their openings in the News Feed for additional reach or laser-focused targeting to reach people with the right credentials. \nFrom the job applicant's side, the \"Apply Now\" button will save users the trouble of entering resumé details and job history information, similar to how other job board sites already use Facebook Connect. On the other hand, that feature might be less appealing to users who like to keep their professional and personal lives separate on social media. When a user does apply, the application is sent in to the business in the same way as a normal Facebook message, which could get a little messy for companies that handle a large volume of customer support requests through Facebook. With nearly four times as many users as LinkedIn, Facebook offers a much larger pool of potential applicants -- many of whom might not even know their next job was out there looking for them .",

      "text": "The humble pantsuit is getting its moment in the sun. A secret Facebook group called “Pantsuit Nation” that began as 50 Hillary Clinton supporters who decided to wear the outfit to the polls to show their support for the Democratic nominee has blown up into an online phenomenon in recent days. The invitation-only group now has 2.7 million members and counting.\nAccording to US media reports, Pantsuit Nation was started by Libby Chamberlain, a Clinton supporter in the northeastern state of Maine.\n“We talked about how beautifully and stoically Hillary embodies women’s fight for equality, and how the pantsuit is an emblem of that struggle,” she told CNN.\nClinton has been variously skewered and celebrated for her ubiquitous pantsuits, and in the waning days of the bruising presidential campaign, it’s become a quirky symbol for the former secretary of state, first lady and senator.\nHillary Clinton (C) stands with Beyonce (L) and Jay Z during a Get Out the Vote (GOTV) performance in support of the Democratic presidential nominee at the Wolstein Center in Cleveland, Ohio on November 4, 2016. Beyonce and her backing dancers donned pantsuits for their performance (AFP/Brendan Smialowski)\nPop star Beyonce traded her usual curve-hugging costumes for a pantsuit when she performed at a Clinton rally in Cleveland on Friday. Her backup dancers wore pantsuits in blue, the color of the Democratic Party.\nThe Facebook page brings together Clinton fans who share personal and often touching stories about why they are voting for her.\nOne pregnant woman posted a photo from a polling site, saying she was in labor but made sure to vote before going to the hospital to deliver her daughter.\nThe popularity of the Pantsuit Nation page has now spawned a website – www.pantsuitnation.org , accounts on Twitter and Instagram and a public Facebook page.\n ",

      "title": "Facebook agrees to suspend using WhatsApp users’ data in UK | The Indian Express",
      "text": "Updated: November 8, 2016 7:03 pm Facebook has agreed to suspend data sharing with WhatsApp after UK Privacy watchdog raised concerns. \nBritain’s privacy watchdog said on Monday that Facebook has agreed to suspend using data from UK users of its WhatsApp messaging app for advertisements or product-improvement purposes after the watchdog said consumers weren’t properly protected. The watchdog said the social media giant faces action if it uses such data without valid consent. \nThe Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) had said in August that it would monitor WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, after WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, said it would share user data with its parent company to better fight spam and improve users’ experiences of both services. The two companies have also come under scrutiny from the European Union’s 28 data protection authorities, who last month requested that WhatsApp pause sharing users’ data with its parent company until the appropriate legal protections could be assured. \n“We’re pleased that they’ve agreed to pause using data from UK WhatsApp users for advertisements or product improvement purposes,” the head of the ICO, Elizabeth Denham, said in a statement. “If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, they may face enforcement action from my office.” \nThe regulator said it had also asked Facebook and WhatsApp to sign an undertaking committing to better explaining to customers how their data would be used and to give them ongoing control over that data. So far, the companies have not agreed. \n“We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook hasn’t agreed,” Denham said. \nAlso read: New privacy policy: Should you worry about WhatsApp’s new info-sharing with Facebook? \nA Facebook spokeswoman said WhatsApp “designed its privacy policy and terms update to give users a clear and simple explanation of how the service works, as well as choice over how their data is used. \n“These updates comply with applicable law, and follow the latest guidance from the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. We hope to continue our detailed conversations with the ICO and other data protection officials, and we remain open to working collaboratively to address their questions.” \nDenham said she did not think users had been given enough information about what Facebook would do with their data and that WhatsApp had not obtained valid consent. Several other European privacy watchdogs, such as Spain’s, have said they intend to contact Facebook about WhatsApp’s privacy policy change but have not yet done so. \nFacebook suggested it would be inappropriate to agree on a specific solution with one regulator before receiving all the others’ questions. Enforcement action could ultimately lead to fines. Such fines are small compared with the revenues of the companies concerned. However, a new EU-wide data protection law coming into force in 2018 would change that with fines of up to 4 percent of global turnover. \nDenham said she would keep pushing the issue along with other privacy watchdogs, notably the Irish authority. It has the most sway over Facebook, since the US company’s European headquarters are in Ireland. Facebook says the data WhatsApp collects is extremely limited and only a part of that is then shared with Facebook. ",

      "text": "\nAnyone who’s ever sent out a tweet or posted on Facebook thinks that they are a social media expert.\nThe medium is deceptively simple. Once people know how to interact on social media, they think they know all there is to know.\nThe reality is that social media is much more complex than it seems and mastering it takes time and skill. Whether you want to work as a social media consultant or you want to master social media for your own brand, you need to have knowledge of how business works, how digital marketing works, and how the two come together in order to be a true social marketing leader.\nUnderstand Business How can you create a great social media plan if you don’t understand business?\nDo you know what a sales funnel is? Do you know what a lead is or why it’s important? Do you understand how customer relation management affects both?\nThese are just some basic concepts that you should know well before you can start creating a social media marketing plan.\nThe best way to understand business is to get experience with business. If you haven’t worked much in the corporate world, you might want to consider working for a few years in some key positions. Pay attention and ask as many questions as you can.\nUnderstand Marketing Marketing is about much more than just advertising.\nYou can’t just create some flyers or pay for some ads and expect to get the results you need. Just like you can’t just post a few status updates or send out a few retweets and expect to get more followers on social media.\nYou need to have a good understanding of marketing beyond just social media if you want to be successful.\nYou need to understand how marketing can create brand awareness, build trust and authority, generate leads and sales, nurture customer loyalty and more. And then you need to understand how different strategies can influence those different goals.\nOf course, that means you’ll also need to know about what all the different strategies are. What’s important in web design? How does email marketing work alongside social media marketing? When would you need to convene a focus group?\nSome of this knowledge is earned through trial and error, but again, experience is key. Work on your own projects before you try to get paid to work for someone else. Read as much as you can online. Take courses. Study examples.\nDo as much as you can and stay current. Digital marketing is a rapidly evolving field.\nUnderstanding the Convergence of Business and Marketing The most important way that you need to understand how business and marketing converge is in meeting business goals.\nThe first question you should be asking when you are tasked with creating a social media marketing campaign is what the business’ goals are – not only for the business in general but also for the social media campaign in particular.\nFor example, if the goal is to create more leads , how will that influence what you post on Twitter? Or what kind of content you share on Facebook?\nDo you know what needs to be in place on the business web site to handle the traffic that comes in from social media? Do you know how the sales team needs to be prepped in order to nurture those leads?\nYou need to understand how the two worlds come together in order to meet your goals. This will help you to coach the business or make the appropriate changes in order to be successful.\nFor example, if you are hired to increase sales for the company but there is no conversion funnel in place, you are guaranteed to fail. Knowing this means that you can identify the problem before you even get started and you can help the company to put the proper measures in place for success.\nIt is important that you recognize that social media is just one part of a much larger marketing plan. You need to build an integrated strategy that includes that larger plan and the larger business goals.\nOf course, you won’t be able to influence every aspect of the marketing plan or the business, but you need to be able to understand how your work fits into the larger whole. Otherwise, you will be working in a vacuum, and your success or failure will be the result of chance and not your skill.\nNot just anyone can build a successful social media campaign, and if you want to be a social marketing leader, you need to understand how to create an integrated strategy that reflects the business structure and its goals. When you can do that, you’ll be able to build a tailored strategy that will not only help the business to be successful, but will also ensure your own success.\n",

      "text": "Kourtney Kardashian is with her. \nIt all finally ends tonight. \nThe campaigning, Facebook memes, flame wars, open letters on Reddit and getting text messages from numbers you don’t recognize asking you to vote all ends some point later tonight when our country decides who they want to know our nuclear codes. \nAside from who takes the swing states, one of the bigger questions of this election is which candidate gets the coveted Kardashian electoral votes — which, according to this fact I just made up, is more votes than New Hampshire has but less votes than Utah. Kourtney Kardashian posted a picture of her Election Day routine. \nA few things about this: \n1) I refuse to dress my future child in anything but merchandise from Kanye’s Life of Pablo Tour. Kourtney apparently does it, and it looks amazing. \n2) THIS IS THE SWEETEST EFFING POST. Who would have thought Kourtney, out of all 50 of the Karadshians, would be the one to make me cry first on this sacred and historic day. \nUnfortunately for Donald Trump , it appears the Kardashian family is swaying more blue than red this election. \nVarious other members of the family have posted to their social media accounts support for *cough* future president *cough* Hillary Clinton . Earlier this week, Kris made sure to remind everyone that at some point, she was in a room with Hillary. Like all American families we know that we are Stronger Together. Our country needs love not hate… pic.twitter.com/D7azbI57s1 \n— Kris Jenner (@KrisJenner) November 7, 2016 She even posted a cute side-by-side of her and Kendall, professing her support for Hill. \nKendall also clearly supports Clinton. Kendall posted the following to her Instagram with the simple caption “her her her her.” \nThe rest of the family has been kind of quiet today. Kim is continuing her social media hiatus, Kylie hasn’t updated her various platforms and Caitlyn probably just hasn’t gotten around to posting something Pro-Trump yet. \nMeanwhile, Rob spent the day shooting stuff in the desert.

      "text": "Will Facebook Eat LinkedIn's Lunch? Facebook's getting into the jobs and recruiting business, something that could infringe on LinkedIn -- and Microsoft. Bret Kenwell Nov8,20164:58PMEST \nFacebook ( FB ) is quickly transforming its platform to include more than keeping up with friends and family. In just the past few months the social media company has made it easy for users to post things for sale (You hear that, Craigslist?), communicate with co-workers and work teams, purchase tickets to movies or events and find local events in their communities. \nWell, here's one more feature for the Facebook platform: Finding a job. \nFacebook has confirmed that it's working on recruiting features for its business users. If that's the case, it could be a big red flag for LinkedIn ( LNKD ) , soon to be bought by Microsoft ( MSFT ) in a $26.2 billion deal. \nSo if Facebook is going to make a push against LinkedIn's business and market share, Microsoft may have to flex its financial and creative muscles in response. \nNot to say that Facebook will overthrow LinkedIn by any means, because of LinkedIn's ability to allow users to have a professional profile. However, Facebook's huge user base could give it an advantage in future. \nShares of Facebook closed at $124.22 Tuesday, up 1.7%. \nMore on Facebook: It is being sued by a group of users because of the company's ability to send ads to users based on \"ethnic affinity .\" \nFacebook came under fire once users realized advertisers could sort out its targeted audience by ethnic-based demographics. Even the U.S. Congress jumped in , with various members blasting Facebook. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "“Make me pleasure.”\nThat Facebook message was directed at Bill Kintner, a 55-year-old Nebraska state senator, while the politician was in Boston for a conference last July. In his hotel room, Kintner had started chatting online—using a state-supplied computer—with a woman who went by “Vinciane Diedeort.” Her English was not idiomatic, but she looked good. And she wanted Kintner to masturbate with her on Skype.\n“I don't want to sneak behind my wife's back,” he wrote. “It's not about you, it is about me. You are smoking hot.”\nSo Kintner broke it off. “Let's end this, before I get in trouble,” he wrote.\nHis willpower lasted for seven hours. At midnight, Kintner returned to Facebook and resumed his conversation with Diedeort. He agreed to her plan. He fired up Skype. And he removed his pants.\nEnlarge / Nebraska State Senator Bill Kintner. Bill Kintner The scam According to the Lincoln Journal Star , the pleasure ended almost immediately.\nWithin minutes, [Diedeort] threatens to post the video on YouTube and share it with [Kintner's] Facebook friends if he doesn't wire $4,500 to an account in the Ivory Coast, which she claimed was for a deaf child.\nKintner reported himself to the [Nebraska] State Patrol that day, telling investigators he'd fallen victim to a scam.\nKintner knew his life was about to get complicated. Not only was the incident likely to come out now that he had involved the state patrol, but his wife Lauren was a key policy aide to Nebraska’s governor. And it didn’t make Kintner himself look any better when, a few days after returning from Boston, Lauren was found to have ovarian cancer.\nStill, the sordid story stayed under wraps until this summer, when the investigation finally concluded. In an August 5, 2016 statement, Kintner wrote, “Humbled by the reality that after initially resisting the overtures from a woman who had found me on Facebook, I caved to her temptation to engage in cybersex via her invitation over Skype... I was most likely the target of a foreign criminal extortion ring.”\nAccording to the Journal Star , Kintner claimed that investigators had “traced the scam to a small crime syndicate based in the Ivory Coast and using Russian computers. Recorded video of the exchange was never saved on his computer, Kintner said. The scammer posted a brief clip, or GIF, of the recording online, but it has since been deleted.”\nThe aftermath Kintner was hauled before the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission and fined $1,000 for improper use of state-owned equipment. Many legislators—along with the governor—called for him to resign, but Kintner refused, saying he had already apologized to his wife and to God. The best way for him to continue serving God, he added, was to stay in office. (A fellow state legislator quipped , “Whatever phone number he's using to talk to God, I want it.”)\nOn August 10, State Senator Ernie Chambers of Omaha—a legendary figure in local politics and the only black legislator in Nebraska—decided to up the pressure.\n\"If Sen. Kintner is a member of the body in January [2017],\" he wrote, \"I plan to use him and his illegal, scandalous, vulgar behavior as source material for rhymes throughout the 90-day Session. Be prepared for the pun, the double entendre, and other verbal techniques to 'keep the issue alive.'\"\nChambers then offered up a free sample:\nKintner's free to masturbate on his own time,\nBut not free to masturbate on Taxpayers' dime.\nOn August 11, Chambers released a multi-page poem called \"The Sordid Saga of Bill Kintner's 'Guttersnipery'\" that began:\n\"Who is Bill Kintner?\" asked the Town Crier.\nA masturbating, would-be thief, and a liar—\nA hypocrite—doing not what he ought,\nWho never \"comes clean\" till after he's caught.\nThe Legislature’s executive board considered plans to oust Kintner. As the Journal Star reported on August 19, however, this would require a special session that could cost more than $75,000 in a state where legislators make just $12,000 a year . Kintner argued that this would be a waste of money, “especially at a time when our state is facing current and projected tax receipt shortfalls.”\nOn September 6, Chambers released another \"Kintner-gram\" that got weirdly personal about the whole mess. It began:\nStuck at home with WIFEY, he's CLARK KINTNER, flaccid to the touch;\nOn the other hand(s), with SKYPEMATE, who excites him O! so much,\nHe tells her, \"I'm Superman! because of how you make me feel!\"\n\"If so, take your pants off,\" coos she, \"show me you're a man of steel.\"\n(She's his Wonder Woman, with her super powers, hot and stacked;\nCould it be Clark Kintner sought from her the OOMPH! that Wifey lacked...?)\nKintner fired back , telling the local paper that the rhymes were a \"new low.\"\n\"This is beyond two politicians arguing over policy or personal differences,\" Kintner told the Journal Star on Thursday. \"This is a politician going after another politician's wife.\"\n\"I expect Chambers to be a man and apologize to my wife,\" he said in the news release.\n(Chambers did respond in an October 8 op-ed , which concluded: \"I shall remain as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar in my quest to remove the 'Kintner blight' from the Legislature by my choice of means. If others know a better way, come on with it.\")\nOne of Kintner's supporters filed an ethics complaint against Chambers over his rhymes (which now total more than 25 separate pieces). But on October 21, the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission tossed the complaint against Chambers , saying that his poems had been \"part of a broader public discussion about how to handle the matter\" and were not unethical.\n“We’re not the etiquette police,” the Commission's vice chairman told a local paper.\nEnlarge / One of Ernie Chambers' \"Kintner-grams.\" Webcams: For state business ONLY! As voters nationally go to the polls to pick the future direction of the country, Nebraska's legislature remains consumed with Kintner. He remains in office, and lawmakers are still debating various forms of censure or impeachment.\nOne positive has emerged from the whole mess, though—more awareness of \"personal use\" rules for state-owned technology. Lawmakers will have new HP computers when they return to work in 2017, and last week, the legislature passed a new set of policies to go with the machines.\nIn a November 5 editorial, the Omaha World-Herald praised the move . \"By adopting a policy against misusing state-owned technology for personal or campaign purposes,\" it wrote, \"the board removed any doubt about where the Legislature stands on policing its own.\"\nThe 2016 election has shown us a world where Donald Trump's tweets, Hillary Clinton's e-mails, and even (alleged) Russian hackers have all played key roles. But tech is altering politics at every level, and somewhere in the Ivory Coast, using a \"Russian computer,\" lives a woman whose brief connection with a middle-aged man half a world away has roiled Nebraska state politics for months.\nTruly, we live in the future.",

      "text": "A \"secret\" Facebook group for Hillary Clinton supporters went viral this week, bringing its roughly 2 million members into the mass media spotlight.\n\"Pantsuit Nation,\" an invite-only group created just over two weeks ago, began as an effort to get Clinton fans to wear the Democratic nominee's signature pantsuit look to the polls. But in the weeks since its inception, its original members say, the group has transformed into a \"safe space\" of sorts for Clinton supporters to coalesce and celebrate their candidate without negative feedback from non-supporters.\n\"I think the real feat of this group has been its ability to honor each member's personal story and celebrate all the reasons why this election is the most important of our lifetimes without resorting to the usual vitriol that seems to plague many other spaces these days,\" the group's creator, Libby Chamberlain, told Buzzfeed News.\nRecommended: How much do you know about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Take our quiz. Pantsuit Nation and its strictly enforced rules, which include no negative posts about Mrs. Clinton or her opponents, no debating political matters, and no sharing news articles, speak to a growing demand for, and shift toward, enclosed online communities that function as \"safe spaces\" for political discourse in an increasingly polarized political climate, experts say, reflecting widening divisions along partisan lines in all facets of life.\nTest your knowledge How much do you know about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Take our quiz. As one of the most divisive presidential elections in US history reaches its climax, surveys show that animosity between members of opposing political parties is the highest it's been in decades . Add that to the fact that political discourse on social media has been \"pretty negative and vitriolic for quite some time,\" and you've got an online environment in which polarization often takes the form of personal attacks, says Kevin Arceneaux, a professor of political science at Temple University in Philadelphia, Penn.\n\"Social media is kind of a canvas, and the divisions that we have in society get thrown on that canvas and we can see that more sharply,\" he tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview.\nNow, as a result, we've begun to see a shift toward \"walled garden\" communities such as \"Pantsuit Nation\" on Facebook and other social networking sites, says Itai Himelboim, an associate professor of advertising at the University of Georgia. This shift, he says, reflects a natural, age-old tendency to associate ourselves with others who hold similar views.\n\"Groups like 'Pantsuit Nation' simply capture the same behavior that people were exhibiting much before the internet,\" he says. \"People will create subgroups of likeminded others online and offline. It's human nature.\"\nBut as we grow more polarized politically, that tendency has grown stronger in all aspects of life, political scientists say.\n\"People are associating more with their own types , so there is less knowledge and less connection,\" John Fortier, the director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., told the Monitor in June. \"Marriages, neighborhoods, churches – more of the same people are associating with each other than ever before. The other party seems more alien…. There is much more self-selection.\"\nPartisan polarization and animosity, both in real life and on social media, tend to correlate with consumption of partisan media, Natalie Jomini Stroud, an associate professor of communication studies at the University of Texas at Austin, tells the Monitor in an email: \"Those using more likeminded political media tend to be more politically polarized, feeling more favorably toward their own side and more unfavorable toward the political opposition.\"\nBut while online communities such as \"Pantsuit Nation\" can similarly serve as an echo chamber, experts say, they aren't inherently damaging to nationwide political discourse across parties, and can be a healthy forum for people to share ideas and personal experiences with likeminded strangers without fear of personal attack.\n\"Being a member of Pantsuit Nation does not necessarily feed polarization if the members of the group make the effort to seek out diverse views elsewhere, online or offline,\" says John Parmelee, a professor of communication at the University of North Florida, in an email to the Monitor. If they don't, he adds, \"That's bad for democracy.\"",

      "text": "Charles David Carver, 32, of Anderson is shown in a Facebook photo provided by his family. Carver had been missing for more than two months before his body was discovered and identified just days ago. (Photo: Independent Mail/photo courtesy Nathan Shiflet) \nANDERSON, S.C. — The estranged wife of a man whose body was found on property where a kidnapped woman was rescued last week was arrested Tuesday and charged with impersonating a police officer .\nNichole Ellen Nunes Carver, 35, is accused of pretending to be an Anderson police officer to try to get a service provider to tell her where estranged husband Charles David Carver’s cellphone last pinged. The arrest warrant says she identified herself as Detective Charlynn Ezell, the lead investigator in Charles David Carver’s case.\n\"Basically, she was talking to AT&T trying to get phone records,\" said Capt. Mike Aikens of the Anderson Police Department.\nThe body of Charles David Carver was found Friday on property owned by Todd Kohlhepp, a real estate agent and convicted sex offender. Carver’s girlfriend, Kala Brown, was found alive and chained Thursday in a metal container on the same 95-acre property in Woodruff. They had disappeared from Anderson at the end of August.\nUSA TODAY\nKohlhepp recalled as great salesman with chilling quirks\nKohlhepp has been charged with kidnapping Brown.\nAnderson police say they do not know if Nichole Carver is linked to the Kohlhepp case.\n\"As of now, we cannot establish a connection, but this is an ongoing investigation,\" Aikens said. \"We are looking at every possibility.\"\nAikens said Anderson police have not ruled out filing other charges against Nichole Carver. Investigators are still trying to determine who is responsible for at least some of the odd social media postings that began appearing on her husband’s Facebook page weeks after he vanished.\nIn September and October, several postings appeared on Facebook, including one that announced Brown and Charles David Carver had married. Other postings were more cryptic.\nThe odd Facebook posts gained some national attention, and multiple media outlets reported that one post on Carver's Facebook page included lines from the Eagles’ song “Hotel California”: “Last thing I remember, I was running for the door. I had to find the passage back to the place I was before. ‘Relax,’ said the nightman. ‘We are programmed to receive. You can check-out any time you like, but you can never leave.’”\nRecords indicate that Nichole Carver was living in Florida before she met Charles David Carver. The couple had been married about three years.\nAccording to neighbors at Anderson Crossing Apartments, the Carvers broke up and Brown moved into the apartment with Charles David Carver after that. The Carvers had not filed for divorce in Anderson County at the time of his disappearance at the end of August, according to court records.\nLate Monday afternoon, the day before she was arrested, Nichole Carver filed a police report in Anderson claiming she was being harassed on Facebook. Officer Kristin Brady wrote in the police report that the comments were \"ugly, vulgar and possibly lies\" but were not criminal and did not constitute a threat.\n“I explained to Ms. Carver that the best thing to do is to ignore the comments,\" Brady wrote. \"It was a high-profile case, people will talk, and maybe to take her Facebook down. Nothing I saw was criminal at this time, nor did I see anything that was actually from Facebook.”\nSpartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said Kohlhepp has confessed to the long-unsolved 2003 quadruple homicide at Superbike Motorsports in Chesnee. Investigators have recovered two other bodies besides Carver’s on the Woodruff property. Those remains have not yet been identified.",

(Facebook) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:56 PM \nAn anti-abortion Catholic priest in Texas has received backlash for posting a video of himself on Facebook placing a fetus on an altar to make a political statement about the presidential election. \nFather Frank Pavone, who belongs to the Diocese of Amarillo, said in the Sunday Facebook video he was given the fetus to give it a proper burial and to show the public where Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stand on abortion issues. \n“I am showing you a child who was killed by abortion and entrusted to us by a pathologist for burial ... I am showing him to you because in this election we have to decide if we will allow this child killing to continue in America or not,” Pavone said in the video. \nPavone’s graphic video has garnered more than 370,000 views and angry comments from users saying he exploited the fetus. \nVoter intimidation reported in parts of Florida on Election Day \n“Using this little baby's body in this stunt is absolutely unacceptable,” one Facebook user wrote. \n“This is the wrong way to make a point. Let the baby rest in peace. I thought priests were smarter than this!” another user wrote. \n“Now you know why parishioners are leaving the church for reasons like this,” said another commentator. \n“Part of my mission all year long was to expose abortion for what it is and I’m convinced that America won’t reject abortion,” Pavone told the Daily News. \nTrump Hollywood star vandal unsuccessfully planned L.A. protest \n“I don’t see the exploitation here. We’re honoring the body,” he said. \n“These children are being killed by the abortion industry and their bodies are literally thrown away in the garbage. This baby’s body would have been further exploited if had I not made myself available to receive it,” he continued, and saying the fetus has been buried. \nHe says Catholics should be educated on abortion issues before siding with the Democratic Party and Clinton, who are in favor of legal abortion. \n“Shame on Catholics who don’t recognize that,” he said. \nSan Diego church flyer says voting for Democrats is a mortal sin \nClinton has said politicians shouldn’t interfere with a woman’s personal health issues and that it’s a choice between them and their doctors. \n“I’ve been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time. And as president, I will always have your back,” Clinton said in a June speech . \nPavone acknowledged that he’s a Trump supporter and has met with the GOP candidate on several occasions throughout the campaign trail to discuss Supreme Court judges who would lean toward pro-lifers and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. \nHe noted that doesn’t take Trump’s flaws into consideration, but what he plans to do in office if he becomes President. \nPlanned Parenthood celebrates 100th anniversary \n\"As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life,\" Trump said at the University of Houston during the 10th Republican debate in February . \"I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood.\" \n“I believe he is the right candidate,” Pavone said. “He’s giving more churches the opportunity to speak their mind.” \nAccording to a Washington Post/ ABC News poll , Catholics have been divided this campaign season. While 48 percent of Catholics favor Clinton, 44 percent are supporting Trump. \nNeither the Archdiocese of Amarillo nor Planned Parenthood immediately responded to requests for comment. Tags:",

(Photo: Tony Gutierrez, Associated Press) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Public service announcement on election day: Don't believe everything, or maybe anything, you read on social media. \nFake social media accounts are spreading misinformation to suppress voter turnout or to influence how people vote, keeping social-media companies busy trying to delete them all. \nPeople are advising each other to double-check the source of information and to be careful what they share with friends and followers. \n\"Believe NOTHING from social media 'breaking news' today, at least not until you've checked further. Again nothing,\" tweeted Dan Gillmor, who teaches digital media literacy at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication: \nA prime example: A fake Twitter account masquerading as CNN politics tweeted that Trump was leading in the first Florida exit polls. \nOther fake Twitter accounts encouraged minorities and immigrants to avoid polling places because of round-ups for outstanding warrants or raids by immigration officials. Twitter, which says it had counted 25 million election-related tweets by 6 pm ET, quickly deleted the accounts. 🚨 This is from a fake Twitter account pic.twitter.com/WIoHXtyQs4 — BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) November 8, 2016 Watch out for fake claims by pro trump trolls on #ElectionDay . #GOTV instead and read the facts: https://t.co/mtumW3lvmo pic.twitter.com/nJrDXwZ5P1 — Maks Czuperski (@MaksCzuperski) November 8, 2016 Talking to family about the election really underscores just how problematic fake news on Facebook is. — Selena Larson (@selenalarson) November 8, 2016 \nIt's common for fake news to bubble up during major news events. But the spread of false information during this tumultuous election season has accelerated. \nLast week Buzzfeed reported tweets that appeared to show the Hillary Clinton campaign encouraging people to vote by text, which is not possible. Twitter deleted the accounts from Donald Trump supporters. CEO Jack Dorsey told a BuzzFeed reporter in a tweet that he was \"not sure how this slipped past us.\"  ",

      "text": "A Lauderdale man thought he had hit it off with a woman he recently met through Facebook and who had come over to his place for drinks.\nBut while the 22-year-old man went to his bedroom to prepare for a romantic evening, the woman was letting two masked men into his home, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday in Ramsey County District Court.\nThe men hit him with a revolver, shot him in the leg and robbed him of $160, the complaint said.\nThe complaint charged a woman from Spencer, Iowa, Aynslie Ladon Thorman, 22, with being the woman who set up the victim. She was charged with two counts of aggravated first-degree robbery and two counts of first-degree burglary involving a dangerous weapon and an assault on a person.\nAccording to the complaint:\nThe victim, identified as DA, received a Facebook friend request from Thorman on Nov. 4. DA didn’t know who Thorman was but accepted the friend request and they began to chat online.\nThorman said she was new to the area and looking for new friends, and she suggested they get together that night for drinks.\nDA invited Thorman over to his home on the 1700 block of Eustis Street in Lauderdale. The two drank and watched television, until the woman went out the front door to make a phone call.\nDA, “thinking he had developed an intimate rapport with Thorman, left the living room to place a condom by his bed.”\nWhen DA came back into his living room about 1:30 a.m. Nov. 5, he saw two strange men standing side-by-side in the doorway. One man had covered his face with a blue bandanna and the other was holding a revolver and wearing a mask with a skeleton design.\nThe gunman fired a bullet into the floor and both men yelled, “Where is the money?” DA told the men there was no money.\nThe men searched the home and continued to demand money until DA gave them $160. He told the men that was all he had.\nThe men hit DA in the head with the gun, forced him to lie down on the floor, pointed the gun at his chest and cocked it, and eventually shot him in the leg before fleeing the house.\nThe gunman also woke up DA’s roommate, who was sleeping in another room with his girlfriend. The gunman asked the roommate where the money was, and the roommate said, “I have no idea about anything that’s going on right now.”\nThe gunman replied, “Oh, sorry to bother you. I’ll let you carry on,” and then left the room.\nThe roommate later drove DA to the hospital.\nDA picked Thorman out of a photo array as the woman who came to his home and set him up, the complaint said.\nA warrant is out for Thorman’s arrest.",

The social network confirmed to TechCrunch yesterday (Nov. 7) that it has been experimenting with letting employers post job listings on their own Facebook business pages. TechCrunch queried Facebook after it noticed job-listing options on its own Facebook business page, including fields for salary, job title and full-time or part-time status.\nView photos\nCredit: aslysun / Shutterstock More Credit: aslysun / Shutterstock\nInterested job candidates will be able to hit an \"apply now\" button that will pre-populate fields with information from their own Facebook profiles. Employers will get a Facebook Messages for each submitted application.\nThis all makes sense, as many Facebook users have extensive employment information attached to their personal profiles. (However, there's no hint of a corresponding professional section for Facebook personal pages that would approximate a LinkedIn profile.) It would also make it easy for recruiters to give applicants a cursory social media once-over. Add in Facebook's healthy advertising platform, and the job-listings feature may have some serious reach to pinpoint potential employees.\nMORE: Why I Stopped Using Facebook, And You Should Too\nAccording to LinkedIn's own numbers , it has 467 million users, while Facebook claims more than 1 billion . If the Facebook job-listings feature takes hold, LinkedIn could be in trouble. Yet some Facebook users may be resistant to tying up work and play. Otherwise, they'll have to be extremely careful about posting photos of drinking and partying and status updates that include political diatribes and crude jokes.\nMicrosoft acquired Linkedin for $26.2 billion earlier this year.\n[via TechCrunch ]\nSee also : Best Messaging Apps How to Check If Your LinkedIn Was Hacked Facebook Live Video vs Periscope: What's Right for You? 10 Offbeat Social Networks",

      "text": "Previous Next \nElection Day can be a lose-lose situation for many brands. It's arguably the most important day in American culture but if they aren't careful with their wording and imagery in promoting the event, popular brands risk angering about half of the people who may consider using their products. \nThat's why a quick look around social media shows many businesses acting like Nov. 8 is just another Tuesday. \nBut some big brands are using Election Day 2016 as a chance to reach their customers and promote democracy without being political. Some have tried to be helpful to voters, some have presented a choice of their own and others have tried to make people laugh. \nTake a look below at some of the various Facebook posts from notable brands on Election Day. \nJetBlue gave kudos to Election Day volunteers and poll workers for their hard work. They shared a piece of artwork that plays off of their service as an airline. \nBoston Market gave its fans a poll between two worthy dessert choices: Pumpkin pie and apple pie. It called the choice the \"second-most important poll you'll vote in today.\" \nTarget took a lighthearted approach and showed off a patriotic pooch who would definitely have voted if it was allowed. \nOld Navy urged its fans to \"vote 'yes' on great style.\" The company suggested pairing an iconic \"I voted\" sticker with red, white and blue clothes. \nAmerican Apparel didn't offer tips on how to dress for Election Day but the company subtly celebrated patriotism with a model standing near the Washington Monument. \nDelta also went patriotic by showing a pilot with an \"I voted\" sticker on their uniform. \nMcDonald's showed off a pair of running mates that likely would have won this election in a landslide: Big Mac & fries 2016. \nPepsi tried to help voters figure out where to go on Election Day with a bot that supposedly points people to their local polling place. \nGoogle offered a similar service to its users by sharing a link to its own Election Day website. \nMarvel urged its fans to vote with the help of one of its fan-favorite comic characters. \nReebok embraced the spirit of athletic competition by having a day-long series of contests between a red team and a blue team of employees. Facebook followers of Reebok are able to vote on which team should lose competitors as the day goes on. \nFinally, Royal Jordanian Airlines — based firmly outside the United States — threw caution to the wind and dissed Donald Trump in a satirical post urging its fans to fly to America now, while they're still allowed. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "A \"secret\" Facebook group for Hillary Clinton supporters went viral this week, bringing its roughly 2 million members into the mass media spotlight.\n\"Pantsuit Nation,\" an invite-only group created just over two weeks ago, began as an effort to get Clinton fans to wear the Democratic nominee's signature pantsuit look to the polls. But in the weeks since its inception, its original members say, the group has transformed into a \"safe space\" of sorts for Clinton supporters to coalesce and celebrate their candidate without negative feedback from non-supporters.\n\"I think the real feat of this group has been its ability to honor each member's personal story and celebrate all the reasons why this election is the most important of our lifetimes without resorting to the usual vitriol that seems to plague many other spaces these days,\" the group's creator, Libby Chamberlain, told Buzzfeed News.\nRecommended: How much do you know about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Take our quiz.\nPantsuit Nation and its strictly enforced rules, which include no negative posts about Mrs. Clinton or her opponents, no debating political matters, and no sharing news articles, speak to a growing demand for, and shift toward, enclosed online communities that function as \"safe spaces\" for political discourse in an increasingly polarized political climate, experts say, reflecting widening divisions along partisan lines in all facets of life.\nAs one of the most divisive presidential elections in US history reaches its climax, surveys show that animosity between members of opposing political parties is the highest it's been in decades . Add that to the fact that political discourse on social media has been \"pretty negative and vitriolic for quite some time,\" and you've got an online environment in which polarization often takes the form of personal attacks, says Kevin Arceneaux, a professor of political science at Temple University in Philadelphia, Penn.\n\"Social media is kind of a canvas, and the divisions that we have in society get thrown on that canvas and we can see that more sharply,\" he tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview.\nNow, as a result, we've begun to see a shift toward \"walled garden\" communities such as \"Pantsuit Nation\" on Facebook and other social networking sites, says Itai Himelboim, an associate professor of advertising at the University of Georgia. This shift, he says, reflects a natural, age-old tendency to associate ourselves with others who hold similar views.\n\"Groups like 'Pantsuit Nation' simply capture the same behavior that people were exhibiting much before the internet,\" he says. \"People will create subgroups of likeminded others online and offline. It's human nature.\"\nBut as we grow more polarized politically, that tendency has grown stronger in all aspects of life, political scientists say.\n\"People are associating more with their own types , so there is less knowledge and less connection,\" John Fortier, the director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., told the Monitor in June. \"Marriages, neighborhoods, churches – more of the same people are associating with each other than ever before. The other party seems more alien…. There is much more self-selection.\"\nPartisan polarization and animosity, both in real life and on social media, tend to correlate with consumption of partisan media, Natalie Jomini Stroud, an associate professor of communication studies at the University of Texas at Austin, tells the Monitor in an email: \"Those using more likeminded political media tend to be more politically polarized, feeling more favorably toward their own side and more unfavorable toward the political opposition.\"\nBut while online communities such as \"Pantsuit Nation\" can similarly serve as an echo chamber, experts say, they aren't inherently damaging to nationwide political discourse across parties, and can be a healthy forum for people to share ideas and personal experiences with likeminded strangers without fear of personal attack.\n\"Being a member of Pantsuit Nation does not necessarily feed polarization if the members of the group make the effort to seek out diverse views elsewhere, online or offline,\" says John Parmelee, a professor of communication at the University of North Florida, in an email to the Monitor. If they don't, he adds, \"That's bad for democracy.\"\nRelated stories\nHow much do you know about Hillary Rodham Clinton? Take our quiz.

      "text": "Previous Next \nElection Day can be a lose-lose situation for many brands. It's arguably the most important day in American culture but if they aren't careful with their wording and imagery in promoting the event, popular brands risk angering about half of the people who may consider using their products. \nThat's why a quick look around social media shows many businesses acting like Nov. 8 is just another Tuesday. \nBut some big brands are using Election Day 2016 as a chance to reach their customers and promote democracy without being political. Some have tried to be helpful to voters, some have presented a choice of their own and others have tried to make people laugh. \nTake a look below at some of the various Facebook posts from notable brands on Election Day. \nJetBlue gave kudos to Election Day volunteers and poll workers for their hard work. They shared a piece of artwork that plays off of their service as an airline. \nBoston Market gave its fans a poll between two worthy dessert choices: Pumpkin pie and apple pie. It called the choice the \"second-most important poll you'll vote in today.\" \nTarget took a lighthearted approach and showed off a patriotic pooch who would definitely have voted if it was allowed. \nOld Navy urged its fans to \"vote 'yes' on great style.\" The company suggested pairing an iconic \"I voted\" sticker with red, white and blue clothes. \nAmerican Apparel didn't offer tips on how to dress for Election Day but the company subtly celebrated patriotism with a model standing near the Washington Monument. \nDelta also went patriotic by showing a pilot with an \"I voted\" sticker on their uniform. \nMcDonald's showed off a pair of running mates that likely would have won this election in a landslide: Big Mac & fries 2016. \nPepsi tried to help voters figure out where to go on Election Day with a bot that supposedly points people to their local polling place. \nGoogle offered a similar service to its users by sharing a link to its own Election Day website. \nMarvel urged its fans to vote with the help of one of its fan-favorite comic characters. \nReebok embraced the spirit of athletic competition by having a day-long series of contests between a red team and a blue team of employees. Facebook followers of Reebok are able to vote on which team should lose competitors as the day goes on. \nFinally, Royal Jordanian Airlines — based firmly outside the United States — threw caution to the wind and dissed Donald Trump in a satirical post urging its fans to fly to America now, while they're still allowed. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "Jessica Vomiero \nNovember 8, 2016 4:59pm \nWhen it’s not competing with Facebook’s Instagram, Snapchat’s augmented reality game is actually really strong. \nSnapchat unveiled a new feature today called World Lenses, which unlike it’s popular Selfie Lenses, change a user’s surrounding environment. The new feature is activated when you tap anywhere on the screen with the rear camera running. \nCurrently, there are only seven new filters available, including an election filter for those in the United States. Some of the others include a rainbow cloud, a fish frozen in ice, exploding hearts, a disco scene and butterflies. \nReports indicate that these augmented reality specs could potentially work on the company’s Spectacle glasses, which allow users to record video clips to share on the app. \nWhile there isn’t a set release date for Spectacles, today’s update also added a page in the app to pair Spectacles with the app.",

(Photo: The News-Press staff) \nHere are some of the top quotes from voters and volunteers on Tuesday at different precincts in Lee County: \n\"I don't want another four years of the government spending my money. As if they know how to spend it better than I do. Donald Trump is a really bad choice to have to make, but it's all I had left.\" — Pail Eidsness , 57, of Cape Coral \n\"I don't trust Trump at all. If he gets into office, he'll start a war. Hillary Clinton has her problems, but I think she's the better candidate.\" Jackie Woodard , who voted for Obama in 2012 \n\"For him to say he wants to deport all illegal immigrants... The Hispanics... we moved here from Mexico to have a better life. We are all the same and I feel like he looks at all of us different. It's either a vote for a liar or a vote for the devil, \"I voted for the devil.\" 23-year-old Carlos Palacio voting in Lehigh Acres \n“A lot of people don’t get this opportunity, and I did. The first thing I did after becoming a citizen was register to vote. In Jamaica, you can’t tell people who you voted for, you can’t tell them what you really think for fear of repercussions. Here you can speak your mind, say what you really think, and no one will come after you. That’s what makes this country great.” — Khris Edwards , 35, who earned his U.S. Citizenship just before the 2000 election. \n“It is very tough and critical about how everyone perceives who you are voting for. It was hard to make the choice because both my parents are voting for Trump and my brother is in the military.” — Brooks LaChapelle of North Fort Myers who turned 18 in September and voted for Hillary Clinton. \n“Yes, he says derogatory things, but, in my opinion, what guy doesn’t say that?” — Rylee Fox , 23, an FGCU student who voted for Donald Trump. SWFL Election updates: 'I'm feeling especially American today' \n\"I voted for Hillary because she asked about a lot more important subjects than Trump: the economy. Global warming.\" — Daniel Slaughter , who voted at the East Lee County Regional Library. \n“This has been way too long. It needs to start in the calendar year of the election. It just gives you a headache. I’m glad it’s over and we can get back to normal.” — James Deantonio , 64, who lives in Lee County and voted for Trump. \n“It is a sad state of affairs where we are at. The election process is incredibly important. If we lose that we’ve lost everything.” —​ Martin Lunn from south Lee County. \n“It was great. Everybody was friendly, no hassles, everything worked just right… everybody’s smiling.\" — Cattlemen David Eric Widener voting in Buckingham. \n“I think Trump is unhinged. Lie after lie. The campaign was like water torture. After a while you’ll say anything for them to leave you alone.” — Gene Montooth , whose first voting experience was in the Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960. He voted at Precinct 36, the largest in Lee County. \n\"I just wish the candidates would've been more professional and spent more time debating the issues. This election has sunk to a new low.\" — Bob DeMarco , 63 \n“We don’t get paid. We take all the money we would have earned and donate it towards scholarships and programs for women and children,” — Judith Sims , a precinct worker and chairman of scholarships for the AAUW’s Fort Myers/Lee County branch. \n“I vote every time. This year I vote for Trump. He’s the name I know.” — 92-year-old Monique Herzig, who called herself an independent and voted alongside her husband, 90-year-old Joseph Herzig . 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://newspr.es/2fe5yWT TOP VIDEOS",

Rubio wins re-election over Murphy \nMilton’s current ordinance does not allow any alcohol sales on Sundays within city limits which is consistent with the rest of northern Santa Rosa County. \nThe city council has the final say on changing the ordinance, making the referendum nonbinding. A binding referendum is where action is taken immediately following a vote. \nThe city council in June 2015 considered resident views on adding the referendum to the ballot. Two months later, the city council approved the referendum and decided to add it on the 2016 general election ballot.",

      "text": "MIDDLETOWN, DE (CBS) — A Maryland man has been arrested and charged in connection to a social media post threatening Delaware Gov. Jack Markell.\nRoger Matthews of Warwick, Md. is accused of threatening Gov. Markell in a Facebook post.\nThe investigation began on Sunday night after troopers responded to a residence on the 300 block of Pheasant Drive in Middletown. Officials say a woman told arriving officers that she, as well as Gov. Markell had been threatened in a Facebook post by a man she identified as Matthews. The female victim told police that Matthews was a relative of one of her family members.\nMatthews was taken into custody on Tuesday without incident and charged with Threatening the Life of a Public Official.\nHe was arraigned and committed to the Howard R. Young Correctional Institution in default of $4000 cash bond.\nAuthorities have not released specific details about the threat due to the sensitive nature of the incident.\nAnyone with more information about this incident is being to contact Detective William Harris at 302-365-8428.\n \n ",

      "text": "Facebook built another Snapchat clone specifically for emerging markets Can Facebook beat Snapchat to its future growth markets? share David Ramos / Getty Images Facebook is launching another Snapchat clone, a standalone ephemeral picture and video messaging app — complete with face-distorting masks — that looks almost identical to Snapchat. We’ve seen this play out before. Twice, in fact. In both instances — first with Poke , then with Slingshot — Facebook’s attempt to create a legitimate Snapchat competitor flopped. But this time Facebook is trying something different: Its new app, Flash, was built by Facebook’s growth team specifically for emerging markets where Wi-Fi is scarce and connectivity is weak. Facebook boasts that Flash is “less than 25 MB” in size, or roughly one third as big as Snapchat’s Android app on Google’s new Pixel phone. (Facebook’s core app, for comparison, was 54 MB on the same phone, though app sizes usually differ by device and software version.) Regardless, this much is clear: Facebook is trying to beat Snapchat to emerging markets, where it doesn’t already have a stranglehold on potential users. Facebook may not be able to win over American teens this late in the game — Snapchat already has 60 million daily users in the U.S. and Canada. But what about those in Brazil? Or Indonesia? Or India? If teenagers in Brazil can get a lightweight version of Snapchat (Flash) that doesn’t take up much data or storage, perhaps they won’t need Snapchat at all. At least that’s Facebook’s hope. Facebook It’s an interesting strategy. Flash launched late Tuesday on Android in its first market, Brazil, and Facebook has plans to bring it to other markets, but hasn’t yet decided where (or just won’t share that info publicly), according to Product Manager George Wang. But its clear the company is gunning for Snapchat, even if Facebook won’t say it quite so bluntly. Instead, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hinted at the company’s Snapchat envy by commenting on the success of Snapchat-inspired products like Stories or opening the app directly into the camera versus, say, a user feed, which has been Snapchat’s calling card since launch. “In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share,” Zuckerberg said on the company’s earnings call last week. “Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share.” Zuckerberg is clearly trying to cut Snapchat off on all sides — it’s testing camera-first features in Facebook’s core app , copied Snapchat Stories inside of Instagram , and now it’s racing Snapchat to emerging markets, where Facebook has already proven it knows how to grow a user base. It’s been fascinating to watch Zuckerberg’s assault on Snapchat unfold. When Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel turned down Zuckerberg’s $3 billion acquisition attempt almost four years ago, he recalled Facebook changing the iconic Like button on the sign in front of its headquarters to the logo of its original Snapchat “killer,” Poke. “It was basically like, ‘We’re going to crush you,’” Spiegel told Forbes . That feeling clearly hasn’t disappeared. recode_divider",

      "text": "× Like Love Meow on Facebook \nA tiny one-day-old orphaned kitten, the only survivor from her litter, refused to give up and fought hard to live. Five weeks later... \nMeet Nala the little fighter! Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \nTiny Nala and three of her siblings came to the Nevada SPCA No-Kill Animal Shelter right after they were born. \"Two ladies brought them in saying they found them with no mother in sight,\" Patricia Rusek, foster mom, told Love Meow . \nThey waited for the mother cat to return, but she never did. \nDespite their tireless efforts to save the litter, three babies didn't survive. \"They were extremely tiny and just couldn't pull through. Nala is the only one who made it.\" \nA week later, Patricia began to see strength in the tiny little body. \"She was really gaining strength and starting to grow more. When she began to eat more and get rest, I knew she was going to be ok.\" Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \nPatricia bottle fed her around the clock, and Nala didn't waste a drop of the formula. \nShe fought hard to live. Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \nNala opened her eyes in the warmth of her favorite blanket that had accompanied her during her early days as a tiny baby. \nIt was time for her to begin to explore! \nA tiny purrito! \nNala enjoys every mealtime and is very appreciative of all the love and care. She purrs in the loving arms of her foster mom. Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \nThey give her a big snuggly buddy to cuddle with, and Nala loves her. \nAt a young age, a cuddly toy can make a huge difference in the health of a neonatal baby's growth as it reminds them of their mama. Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \nNala checking out all the different blankets surrounding her. She loves anything soft and warm. Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \n\"She is now five weeks old! I'm beyond happy,\" Patricia told Love Meow. \n\"She is a darling, so sweet and precious.\" Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas \nThe little fighter has come a long way! \nSince the day they found her, Nala hasn't stopped fighting to grow bigger and stronger. Now she's thriving and can't wait for her forever loving home. Courtesy: Patricia Rusek @ fosterkittensvegas ",

      "title": "Canon employee gets fined for LGBT comment: Should the brand take action?",
      "text": "Earlier this year, Bryan Lim Sian Yang , an employee from Canon, took to Facebook put up a post where he stated that he wanted to “open fire” on the LGBT community. This was reported by local newspaper Today , which also stated that he was fined by the district court for the post being threatening.\nAccording to the article, his post was in response to the LGBT event held annually at Speakers’ Corner in Singapore, which in a matter of hours went viral. Despite having apologised publicly, 13 individuals, including Leow Yong Fatt, the executive director of LGBT counselling group Oogachaga – lodged police reports over the inflammatory remarks.\nWhile the issue doesn't intrinsically reflect the employer brand, we all know how important employee branding is. Marketing has reached out to Canon for its thoughts on the matter.\nIn recent times, Sonny Truyen, an employee from the property portal, 99.co, was fired for his post on Facebook where he used derogatory terms in relation to Singapore for not being one of the first nations to launch Pokemon Go, despite him apologising. Also in 2012, Cheong, former assistant director, membership department at NTUC was let go for complaining about Malay weddings being conducted at void decks and made offensive comments about the Malay community. She too apologised soon after.\nIn all these instances, clearly saying sorry was not enough. Marketing reached out to a few industry experts to understand the effects of such statements on the image of the company and the steps required to prevent such instances.\nLars Voedisch, managing director, PRecious Communications said such instances definitely impact the image of the company the employees are from. He said:\nIt is tricky situation for companies to be in. But, the solution is to analyse how the remarks are in sync with the brand’s image and values and take steps accordingly.\nManaging director of The Edge Partnership, Priya Bala, who was previously heading up marketing recruitment firm Font , said it is hard to expect that every employee will have the common sense not to post anything negative.\n\"These include rants, racial or other discriminatory remarks against minority groups,” said Bala. She added that if an individual crosses the line and makes a statement that is insensitive or offensive to others, it is more a reflection of their own character and prejudices and \"not of the company they represent\". Bala added, however, that a company may choose to take action against someone who expresses negative views, because the person’s views are not in line with the company’s corporate values.\nCompanies must make it clear that it is their own opinion and not of their company; suspension or even termination may result from these remarks in extreme cases, she added.\nAs part of preventive measures, Bala said:\nBrands must make it clear what the rules and expectations are from the start - just flag it up front and employees are likely to exercise a little more caution. It needs to be very clear about the policy surrounding social media at work.\n“Companies must encourage their employees to promote their brand and share information on their personal social media channels and engage in positive ways. By having a social media code of conduct drawn up and educating every employee about it can help to minimise any errors of judgement,” she said.\nAlong similar lines, Mike Parsons, marketing director APAC, Universum Asia said isolated incidents like these would not necessarily damage the company’s employer brand.\n\"People are generally smart enough to see the incident for what it is,” he said. However, when an employer is seen taking a disciplinary action with an employee who is clearly in violation of that employer’s values, there is a chance that this will reflect well on the employer and it may highlight to people that they are fair and inclusive, he added.\nJonathan Sanchez, former PR lead for Unilever, and currently managing director of Hive said, “There’s no magic bullet for a situation of this nature, there will always be disenfranchised communities who feel underrepresented. However, it our responsibility as a society and indeed humanity to look out for each other and ensure people take responsibilities for their actions.”",

(Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) \nLAFAYETTE, Ind. — In a landslide win, incumbent U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita took District 4 on Tuesday. \nThis is the fourth term win for the Republican candidate, who had received 193,272 votes of of midnight, with 97 percent of precincts reporting. \n\"It was gratifying, it was humbling. I’m trying to fight for all Hoosiers so that they can build their lives for themselves and their families,\" Rokita said. \"And when I say all, I mean all – whether you voted for me or not.\" \nHe said he plans to work with Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which was enacted in 2010 under President Barack Obama. \nRokita also noted that he'll push the Promote Accountability and Government Efficiency Act he introduced in September. The act, as described on his website, would \"create at-will employment status for new federal employees, immediately suspend employees due to misconduct or poor performance, and ensure that taxpayers are only paying for official work activities.\" \nThe night was a disappointment to opponent John Dale, a Democrat, who had received 91,153 votes as of midnight. Dale also ran against Rokita in 2014, when Rokita defeated him with 66.9 percent of the vote. \n\"These results, to me, are upsetting. I’ve been campaigning, he’s done nothing. He refuses to debate me,\" Dale said. \"But this is how it is. Running as a Democrat in a Republican area is difficult.\" \nSteve Mayoras, who ran as the Libertarian candidate, received 14,758 votes as of midnight. \nContact J&C higher education reporter Meghan Holden at mholden@jconline.com.

Trump late Tuesday night appeared poised to win a stunning upset in Wisconsin that would put him on the brink of the presidency. \nIf Trump wins the state, it would come after never leading in a single public poll all year, and despite his own persistently negative image here. According to exit polls, 63% of the state’s voters have an unfavorable view of him. But 21% of those voters who dislike him still voted for him — a testament to their hunger to shake things up. \nThe race featured a massive education gap among white voters, perhaps the biggest demographic story of the 2016 race across the country. \nWhile Clinton never campaigned here during the general election, Trump made repeated visits to the state, drawn by its large pool of white blue-collar voters, the demographic core of his support nationally. \nExit polls Tuesday showed Trump performing extremely well with those voters in Wisconsin, winning white “non-college” voters by a far, far bigger margin (31 points) than Republican Mitt Romney did in 2012 (8 points). \nWhile blue-collar whites made up just a third of Clinton’s support in Wisconsin, they represented roughly 60% of the Trump’s vote, according to the exit polls. \nThe most staggering divide Tuesday was the one between white college women (Clinton won them by 21 points) and white non-college men (Trump won them by 44 points). \nThat gap was twice as big as it was in the 2012 presidential race. Trump also won rural voters by 29 points — far more than Romney four years ago, capturing a long list of small counties that Democrat Barack Obama won in both of his elections. \nJust eight years ago. Obama won the rural vote in Wisconsin. \nAll of these patterns point to a class and geographic divide between the parties far larger than any in recent memory. \nWisconsin had voted Democratic for president in every contest stretching back to 1988, a painful record of futility for Republicans in the home state of the party’s national chairman, Reince Priebus, and its highest elected official, House Speaker Paul Ryan. \nIn some cases, those margins have been large: Democrat Barack Obama won here by 14 points in 2008 and 7 points in 2012. And in other cases, the margins have been tiny: Republican George W. Bush lost by less than half a point in both 2000 and 2004. But the result has been the same in every cycle since Ronald Reagan’s 1984 re-election victory. \nIn this case, Trump’s performance probably came as a surprise even to his own campaign, which had cancelled its final planned visit to the state last weekend. \nThe exit polling in Wisconsin showed a vast gulf in attitudes and perceptions between Trump and Clinton voters. \nA majority of Trump voters said immigrants today do more to hurt than help the country. Clinton voters overwhelmingly said immigrants do more to help the country. \nAbout one in 10 Clinton voters said illegal immigrants should be deported, compared to about four in 10 Trump voters. \nTrump voters were more likely than Clinton voters to say trade with other countries takes US jobs away, a statement half the state's voters agreed with Tuesday. \nA large majority of Trump voters said the criminal justice system treats all people fairly, while a large majority of Clinton voters said it treats blacks unfairly. \nAbout eight in 10 Trump voters said the president’s health care law, known as Obamacare, goes too far. About half of Clinton voters said it doesn’t go far enough. \nNine in 10 Trump voters said they were angry or dissatisfied about the way the federal government is working, compared to a little over half of Clinton’s voters. \nClinton had led Trump in all the Wisconsin polling. One reason: she enjoyed a higher level of support from Democratic voters than Trump did from Republican voters. \nBut the exit polls Tuesday suggested that at the end, Trump had closed that partisan “loyalty gap” at the end. He got 90% of Republican voters, while Clinton got 91% of Democratic voters. \nIndependents favored Trump by 13 points.",

      "text": "0 \nLeigh Stein remembers 2014 well. Sometime in the summer, she had joined a private Facebook group for women writers, and she was mesmerized. It didn’t matter that she was about to go on vacation in Budapest; she brought her laptop with her for the sole reason of keeping up with the group. “I felt like a teenager again, forming intimate alliances with women I’d never met, typing little messages of courage and hope and sympathy at all hours of the day and night,” she writes in her memoir Land of Enchantment , which was published this August. The day after she returned home in July, she posted to the group, asking “What if we had a conference?” Leigh’s ambitions didn’t account for what BinderCon would become. “At the time I was working at a non-profit teaching theater to children in Brooklyn, and the organization had a black box theater that could fit 70 people. I thought we could all just meet up there,” she told me by phone earlier this month. \nIt’s funny to think of while sitting with 550 attendees in Cooper Union’s Great Hall, the same room where, nearly 100 years ago, the victory of New York State’s “ Votes for Women ” referendum was celebrated; where Abraham Lincoln gave a historic speech calling for the end of slavery; where the NAACP was born . \n*** \nI remember where I was when I received an invitation on Facebook to join the private group that would eventually spin off into the real life BinderCon. While the Facebook group name remains private, the name of the conference points to the inspiration: in 2012, during the second “town hall” style debate of the election season, Mitt Romney said he had “binders full of women” to consider for cabinet positions. \nIt was also in the summer of 2014, and I was working as an “e-commerce customer support specialist,” which is a fancy way of saying I sat in a windowless room talking on the phone with disgruntled customers. It wasn’t where I envisioned myself a year out of college : I majored in literature and wanted to write. But aside from some small unpaid pieces online, I wasn’t going anywhere. \nMaybe this is why I remember the invitation so clearly — someone I knew on Facebook thought I was good enough to add to a private group largely concerned with writing. I mostly observed : reading posts and comments, and following other writers on Twitter. I snuck glances at my phone during my job, and it was there that I saw Leigh Stein’s post about starting a conference. \nLux Alpatraum saw it too. She had recently sold her website Fleshbot, a blog on the adult entertainment industry, and was looking for a new opportunity. “I was interested, but a little anxious,” she explained to me over the phone in September. “ A lot of times people say they want to do things and not only do they understand how hard it’s going to be, but they are actively against taking the steps that they need to take.” \nThe first person to post a thread in the newly formed Google Group dedicated to the yet-to-be-named-conference, Lux asked the hard questions. If the conference was going to happen, there needed to be money; for there to be money, there needed to be sponsors. Shortly after, Lux was asked by Leigh to be her co-chair. \nA Kickstarter began, money was raised, sponsors were found, and the first conference happened on the campuses of New York University and Cooper Union in fall 2014. The nonprofit Out of the Binders was formed, and plans began for the Los Angeles conference, which aimed to focus more on screenwriting. \nBut the price tag of $80,000 per conference, an expense that has remained consistent for each subsequent year, is high for a nonprofit that is largely run by volunteers. The initial Kickstarter set out to raise $40,000, pulling in $55,393; additional money came from sponsors such as the Harnisch Foundation and Mailchimp. Lux did not shy away from mentioning that Out of the Binders is still trying to raise enough money to pay Leigh a salary so she can commit to the organization full time. \n“ If she were able to do it full time, we’d be able to do even more amazing things,” Lux explained. \n“People don’t understand how difficult it is to get funding for conferences,” she continued. “Foundations won’t pay for operating costs a lot of the times, which makes it difficult to pay staff. \n“You can’t have the programming if you don’t have the people doing the programming.” \nIn it’s second year, and at its fifth conference, Out of the Binders, and especially its finances, were thrown into the spotlight as issues of childcare and accessibility were raised — a conversation that at times threatened to overshadow the event itself. \n*** \nWhen freelance writer Britni de le Cretaz was asked to be part of a panel earlier this year, she said yes. She was pregnant, but at the time the thought that an infant would not be allowed “didn’t even cross her mind,” Britni explained to me on Saturday. We sat outside the Great Hall while a friend watched her baby. Since she began freelance writing after her first pregnancy, Britni has accumulated an impressive number of bylines in the past year and half: she’s written for Rolling Stone , The Atlantic , and The Guardian , to name a few. For her, attending BinderCon presented an important opportunity to continue advancing her career and further engage her online community IRL. \nUpon the panel’s acceptance — coincidentally enough titled “Body Politics: Writing Reproductive Rights and Justice During the War on Women” — she emailed the conference organizers to request accommodations for herself and her infant. Emails were exchanged, and conference organizers emphasized the event’s 18+ policy . Instead, a childcare stipend of $250 was offered. \nBinderCon’s ticket sales page states , “Please note that, as a professional development conference, BinderCon attendance is limited to those above the age of eighteen (21 for events where alcohol is available). If you require childcare assistance, please contact the organizers for information about our childcare stipends.” But as BinderCon champions inclusivity, with measures such as including preferred pronouns on name badges to fine-tuning the website to be more accessible for visually-impaired users to including a glossary of definitions for terms ranging from feminism to columbusing to microaggressions, the assumption that BinderCon could potentially accommodate a weeks-old infant isn’t unwarranted. \nWhile Britni made a point of not publicly discussing the issue, except to ask on her personal page for help watching her infant during the conference, other BinderCon attendees began tweeting the night before the conference to highlight her situation, using the conference hashtag. When searching #BinderCon on Twitter, the first trending tweet that appears concerns Britni’s situation. \nOn Saturday, October 29th — the issue now public knowledge — Jenny Lumet, screenwriter and member of Out of the Binders’ board of directors, announced, before the Q&A portion of the panel that Britni presented on, that a moderated discussion would be held on the topic the following morning. Minutes before, Britni had noted that while the 18+ policy was inconvenient for her, it could be devastating for others without the proper resources. \nWhen Britni asked Jenny — on stage — whether she could bring her infant to the 9:30 AM discussion on Sunday, October 30th, she was met with a simple, “Probably not.” \nI spoke with Britni after her panel. She was frustrated by how the conference was handling the issue. \n“I’m disappointed. I wish they had taken the feedback or even said they were working on it,” Britni told me, referring to the emails she had sent in the months beforehand. “You know, they can bring up their financial thing, but letting me bring my nursing infant costs nothing, literally nothing.” \n*** \nThe next morning, I arrived a few minutes early to the moderated discussion. Leigh, Lux, and Jenny were there, among a group of about twenty. By the end of the discussion, the crowd had doubled. Discussion notes — with names of speaking attendees left anonymous — were made available later in the day. \nThe financial component wasn’t the only point of discussion, but it was a central one. Some numbers: each BinderCon costs $80,000 to put together; childcare for 12 children over the course of a two day conference costs $5,000; there are approximately 550 attendees at each conference. \nSee how this gets complicated? While $5,000 may not sound that large when compared to the total cost of the conference, it only covers 12 children. The expenses only rise from there. \nBut we’re discussing nursing parents, one attendee noted. Jennie Baird, who acted as moderator and sits on Out of the Binders’ Board of Advisors, noted that not all nursing parents define a nursing child the same way. For some, the child is a six-week old infant; for others, the child is a two-year-old. As Jenny Lumet later noted, she wants to be mindful of “parsing parents’ decisions.” \nNo conference can purport to make these distinctions for parents. And it’s tough. It was tough to listen to, even as a non-parent, as attendees explained how a policy allowing for nursing parents would be triggering and hurtful since they themselves were unable to nurse their children. It was important to listen to the attendee who noted that because she is hard of hearing that attending a conference with children would impede her experience. \nAnd despite the united front Out of the Binders presents, Leigh noted that any time the issue of childcare or nursing parents has come up, she has asked the organizing committee to revisit. There hasn’t been agreement, but the consensus has remained the same. \n*** \nIt isn’t the first time BinderCon has dealt with the issue. Earlier this year, Jade Sanchez-Ventura wrote in Mutha Magazine that the policy effectively prevented her from attending the 2015 BinderCon in New York. “I wanted to be welcomed as I am, a mother and a writer able to participate in her own field,” Sanchez-Ventura wrote. BinderCon issued a response . On behalf of the organization, Lux wrote, “For our most recent conference, we looked into the possibility of providing on-site childcare; regrettably, the quotes we received were far outside our budget, and required much more space than our venue could provide us with.” \n“As a conference focused on women writers, driven by a feminist mission, we are held to a much higher standard than other conferences, even as we work within an incredibly limited budget,” she continued. \nThis may be true, but it serves to highlight the difficult nature of claiming a feminist mission. There are financial considerations and bottom lines to consider. And as both Britni and Lux noted to me — in separate conversations, each using their term of choice — we live in a patriarchal and sexist society \nAnd yet if a contingent of attendees (especially those who are active members of the community) are asking for accommodations, their voices need to be heard and heeded. Yes, Out of the Binders is young, and yes, there may be limits on immediate actionability. But in order to truly grow, thrive, and fully embrace a feminist mission, organizers and policies must reach for more and not settle. \n*** \nOn Sunday afternoon, I briefly caught up with Lux. Was the backlash expected? \n“We knew there was a possibility,” Lux replied. “But I’m really glad that people were passionate about BinderCon to feel that what we’re doing is valuable enough that it is worth being angry about our policy.” \nIt goes back to the idea of community that Britni praised when we spoke. Despite her experience, she applauded attendees who reached out and offered to help her. \n“I had more people willing to watch my baby than I needed, which has been amazing,” she said. “People were willing to walk out of panels when I need childcare and make themselves available so that I could come. I wouldn’t be here if they didn’t.” \nPhotos courtesy of Max Kristula-Green TAGS ",

      "text": "Previous Next \nElection Day can be a lose-lose situation for many brands. It's arguably the most important day in American culture but if they aren't careful with their wording and imagery in promoting the event, popular brands risk angering about half of the people who may consider using their products. \nThat's why a quick look around social media shows many businesses acting like Nov. 8 is just another Tuesday. \nBut some big brands are using Election Day 2016 as a chance to reach their customers and promote democracy without being political. Some have tried to be helpful to voters, some have presented a choice of their own and others have tried to make people laugh. \nTake a look below at some of the various Facebook posts from notable brands on Election Day. \nJetBlue gave kudos to Election Day volunteers and poll workers for their hard work. They shared a piece of artwork that plays off of their service as an airline. \nBoston Market gave its fans a poll between two worthy dessert choices: Pumpkin pie and apple pie. It called the choice the \"second-most important poll you'll vote in today.\" \nTarget took a lighthearted approach and showed off a patriotic pooch who would definitely have voted if it was allowed. \nOld Navy urged its fans to \"vote 'yes' on great style.\" The company suggested pairing an iconic \"I voted\" sticker with red, white and blue clothes. \nAmerican Apparel didn't offer tips on how to dress for Election Day but the company subtly celebrated patriotism with a model standing near the Washington Monument. \nDelta also went patriotic by showing a pilot with an \"I voted\" sticker on their uniform. \nMcDonald's showed off a pair of running mates that likely would have won this election in a landslide: Big Mac & fries 2016. \nPepsi tried to help voters figure out where to go on Election Day with a bot that supposedly points people to their local polling place. \nGoogle offered a similar service to its users by sharing a link to its own Election Day website. \nMarvel urged its fans to vote with the help of one of its fan-favorite comic characters. \nReebok embraced the spirit of athletic competition by having a day-long series of contests between a red team and a blue team of employees. Facebook followers of Reebok are able to vote on which team should lose competitors as the day goes on. \nFinally, Royal Jordanian Airlines — based firmly outside the United States — threw caution to the wind and dissed Donald Trump in a satirical post urging its fans to fly to America now, while they're still allowed. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "Nine months since Facebook introduced live video, publisher adoption is climbing. But questions remain about how to get the most out of the feature — and how much to invest in a feature whose ability to monetize is still limited .\nAccording to Socialbakers, 51 percent of the top publisher companies posted to Facebook Live in September, up from 10 percent in January. At the same time, use of Twitter’s live video service Periscope has declined, with just 10 percent of publishers using it in September, down from 14 percent in January.\nSome publishers seem unconcerned about the lack of dollar signs they’re seeing in the service. The Washington Post is publishing 175 or more live videos a month, to showcase everything from its weekly political fact-checking series to artistic pumpkin-carving demonstrations, said Micah Gelman, director of video at the Post. The Post views live video as it does the many other platforms it distributes to, as a way to expose the Post’s journalism to new audiences. “We’re optimistic the monetization will follow,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nUSA Today takes a similar position. It’s publishing a handful each day, and it doesn’t plan to let up, although it has been more actively sharing live video across its 100-plus newspaper network and repurposing live video in the form of shorter clips and text-based articles. For the election, USA Today planned to cross-post and simultaneously stream its coverage across all the network’s Facebook pages. “There are a number of things we don’t make direct revenue from, [that] we do because it helps our brand,” said Jamie Mottram, senior director of social content for the USA Today Network. “Facebook Live is one example of that.”\nOther publishers are more circumspect. With the promotional push Facebook is giving live video and its potential to reach huge audiences, it’s hard for publishers to completely ignore Facebook Live. But it was one thing when Facebook was rewarding publishers who actively posted there by sending traffic to their sites; today, Facebook Live is another format demanding publishers’ resources even as Facebook cuts back the traffic it’s sending publishers. (Facebook is running a small test whereby publishers can insert an ad break in their live videos; it’s expected to expand the test to more publishers in the coming months.)\nThe Wall Street Journal is just posting one original live video a week and doesn’t plan to ramp up beyond that. It sees the feature as a way to reach new audiences and deepen its relationship with existing ones. But the monetization limits are “something we’re always thinking about,” said Carla Zanoni, executive emerging media editor there. “That’s really why we’re cautious as we experiment with this format.”\nCBS News, similarly, treats Facebook Live as supplemental to its streaming activities on its own properties, using Live to get extra exposure for big news stories that it’s already streaming to its other platforms, said Christy Tanner, svp and GM of CBS News Digital. “We are very focused on growing CBSNews with our 24/7 live because the monetization opportunities with Facebook Live are limited,” she said. “Therefore, our Facebook Live distribution is limited.”\nEven among those that are committed to the format struggle with how to get the most out of it. Most people are watching live video on their mobile devices and are likely to be on the go and have the sound muted, which makes capturing their attention on the small screen tricky. Justin Choi, CEO of native ad platform Nativo and a Facebook critic, said most live video would do better as an edited product. “It has limited use cases,” he said.\nWhile publishers have learned that having panels and talking heads can fall flat, videos with a suspense or explainer element or lend themselves to watching with friends do well. Among CNN’s best-performing live videos was one of a man climbing Trump Tower , which has gotten 8.1 million views. USA Today Network’s Arizona Republic did well with a video that explored the issue of legalizing recreational marijuana by showing how smoking affects a person’s sobriety. The video did well by the Republic’s standards (it got 221,000 views) because it tapped into an issue of national interest in an entertaining way. “It was somewhat of a clever stunt but it also had a greater purpose,” Mottram said.\nGetting the format right is only part of the battle. A common complaint is that Facebook doesn’t make it easy for people to discover live video unless they happen to be following a publisher’s page already, or to resurface videos that have already aired but have a potential long shelf life. ( Facebook is starting to address these issues , with scheduling options that let publishers plan and promote broadcasts ahead of time.)\n“As a pure user, I wonder about the discoverability of live,” said Samantha Barry, director of social news at CNN, one of the publishers that’s getting paid by Facebook to produce live video, so it’s more committed to the format than other media companies might be. “How are new audiences going to stumble upon it if you’re not a follower? How are we getting it in front of you?”\nImage courtesy of USA Today Network.",

      "text": "Courtesy of Rare.us NEW YORK — \nSocial media friendships suffered during the combative presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton , and some Facebook users unfriended those who had opposing political views. \nNow that Election Day is over, are those friendships worth rekindling? \nFriendship expert Dr. Irene Levine said tumultuous election cycles can permanently alter the dynamic between friends. \n“It can do irreparable harm to relationships,” the psychologist told the New York Post . “I think some people learned their friends’ values and positions in a way that wasn’t apparent before, so it can really affect the relationship going forward.” \n>> Read more trending stories \nA Monmouth University Poll attests to that. Researchers found in September that more than 2 in 3 voters believed that this year’s presidential race brought out the worst in people. Seven percent of voters admitted to losing friends as a result. \nWhen asked about refriending certain individuals who showed obvious favor for either Clinton or Trump, Levine said it comes down to how serious the differences are and how strong the relationship was before the election season. \n“It depends on how objectionable their comments were. If it were merely supporting a candidate then it’s easy to forgive, but if it’s values that are so discrepant from your own, it can be hard to reconnect, and why would you want to reconnect?” she said. \nOpinions on sensitive issues, such as abortion and gun control, could cost a friendship. Levine said Facebook users should think twice before refriending people with whom they strongly disagree. \n>> As votes roll in, Canada's immigration website crashes \n“If it’s a person that’s into gun control and the other person is a gun advocate and the gun advocate is always talking about guns, why would you refriend the person? You should probably assess why you unfriended them to begin with and decide if there’s other things that are important,” she said. \nWhen dealing with family relationships, George Washington University social media guru Dave Karpf said users should “tread lightly.” \n“If this is your brother-in-law, then you should probably refriend him after tempers have cooled because if they don’t, Thanksgiving will probably be a little more awkward,” the political scientist and associate professor said. \nKarpf agreed with Levine that, depending on the length and strength of the friendship, refriending could be either worth the fight or completely useless. \n“If this is someone you met once at a party or knew in high school that you haven’t seen in 20 years, it’s OK to let that social network tie go,” he said. “But if you unfriended someone because once a month they were posting something about Clinton, the election’s over. Take a deep breath and reconnect with that person.” \nThere are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts. Sign in or register .",

      "title": "Will Facebook’s ad revenue spike, innovative solutions be enough for marketers?",
      "text": "By Brielle Jaekel \nDuring last week's earnings call, Facebook detailed a slew of its innovative products for marketers and itself, such an AI solution to shape users' newsfeeds, but its major fail with reporting video views still leaves them wary. \nFacebook is introducing an artificial intelligence solution that will look out for terrorist activity as well as filtering out click-bait articles, which help become more user friendly. The social media giant will be focusing on more user helpful features, and its ad revenue has dramatically increased by 59 percent but marketers are still cautious after recent news that Facebook’s insights on video views were not accurate. \n\"On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of what they care about,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of Facebook during the call. \"More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% of our engineers are already using AI to power the products and services they build. \n\"We've made changes and improvements to our AI in order to filter out misleading clickbait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook,\" he said. \"It's still early, but we think that AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our platform.\" \nFacebook advertising success \nThe social media platform is putting significant stock into video and visual features. Facebook believes that visual messaging will be the future and is testing out features that could eventually lead to a camera instead of a text box. \nFacebook's current app \nFacebook is also hoping to introduce easier ways to capture and view video, recently introducing an option that allows users to access their camera from their newsfeeds with one swipe on the app. Facebook Messenger will also see new camera features as well. \nThe focus on video is being supported by the increase in popularity of Facebook Live. Mark Zuckerberg reported that the number of users on Facebook Live at any given time has seen an increase by four times. \nAd revenue for Facebook increased by 59 percent up to $6.8 billion, which leads experts to believe that marketers are seeing results and engagement from users. Mobile ad revenue alone generated $5.7 billion, increasing 70 year over year. \nCurrent newsfeed in Facebook app \nFacebook will be increasingly invested with Facebook Live, especially now that it has been popularized with users and important events are unfolding on the platform such as Michael Phelps announcing his retirement. \nFacebook testimonials \nAn example of quality use of Facebook’s advertising is the Burger King McLamore Foundation as it unveiled an innovative new awareness campaign that universalizes the experience of illiteracy through the use of illegible packaging, auto-translatable Facebook ads and a mobile-optimized video. \nBurger King’s campaign brought attention to the plight of illiteracy— which affects 20 percent of the world’s population— with branded menu cards and packaging that features unintelligible gibberish in place of English description. The images are meant to relate the difficulty in completing even the simplest tasks, such as ordering food, when literacy is an issue ( see more ). \nAlso, Disney’s The Muppets lent one of its iconic characters to music festival Outside Lands, following the cancellation of its show on ABC by sharing an episodic experience with Facebook Messenger users that opt in to talk with Miss Piggy. \nMiss Piggy was available for chatting at limited times on Facebook Messenger, and recently drummed up excitement for the San Francisco music festival during her latest message thread. The character interacted with users in a chat format version of a fictional online lifestyle magazine, which continued The Muppets' legacy after ABC’s cancellation but also incorporates brand-related content, most recently referencing Outside Lands ( see more ). \n\"We had a great third quarter,\" said Sheryl K. Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook during the call. \"Q3 ad revenue grew 59 percent. \n\"Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 7 percent year-over-year, and was approximately 84% of total ad revenue,\" she said. \"Our growth was broad-based across all regions, marketer segments, and verticals. \n\"In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram. The number of advertisers on both platforms continues to grow quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full range of our ad products.\" \nThis article was originally published on Mobile Marketer , Luxury Daily's sister publication",

      "text": "Few people could have guessed that one-day the little friend counter on your social media profile could play an important role in your finances. However, that is increasingly the case today. An increasing number of firms are turning to alternative data sources to determine an individual’s credit worthiness. This can include, among other things, a person’s social media profiles. As more data is collected on consumers, companies are getting better and better at using it to build complicated models that try to assess the risk of lending to a particular individual.\nTo say these models look at social media profiles is an oversimplification. These types of scores look at a number of features, including things like utility bill payments. Together, all these factors help companies paint a financial picture of their customers.\nWhere Alternative Scores Help There were roughly 26 million people in the United States without a credit score as of 2015. As a result, these individuals cannot get approved for loans, competitive interest rates, or even the increasingly lucrative mile cards . People in this group who want to start a new business, may also have difficulty obtaining small business loans. Both traditional and alternative lenders often base their decision on the owner’s credit score. Alternative scores, however, can provide a solution for these people, who have thus far been labeled as “credit invisible”.\nRecommended: Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. One group particularly affected by traditional scores is millennials. Research by ID Analytics has found that 18 to 34 year olds make up the biggest portion of new credit card applicants. However, they are also denied credit cards at a high rate, in many cases due to a lack of a credit file. What’s more astounding, is the fact that many of these individuals are thought to have solid financials, ones that would allow them to pay back any credit card debt . They find themselves in a classic catch-22. They cannot obtain a credit card because they do not have a credit history. At the same time, they cannot start building a credit history without a credit card. Alternative lending and scoring provides a potential way out of this predicament.\nTest your knowledge Do you speak start-up? An entrepreneurial vocab quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/08 Some Major Problems Still Exist When lenders begin to use your social media profiles to make lending decisions, a natural question to ask is: should they be? It’s easy to see how traditional credit scores can correlate to an individual’s credit worthiness. If a person has consistently failed to pay back loans in the past, it is not far-fetched to say they may do so again in the future. While there is room to argue the accuracy of that statement, it may be even more difficult to defend the use of things like social network profiles. Lenders may feel as though they developed a novel way to determine a borrower’s credit worthiness, though it may not work quite as well – to the detriment of both camps. Not enough data exists yet to see whether the use of these techniques will leave another group of people at a disadvantage.\nPerhaps the biggest problem with alternative credit scores is that they aren’t mainstream. That means they will still not allow consumers to obtain credit from the nation’s largest organizations. This is problematic because large organizations are often the ones capable of delivering users with competitive interest rates and rewards. Alternative lending and scoring opens the door for people to seek out business with less-than-amicable motives.\nThis story originally appeared on ValuePenguin .",

      "text": "Nov 8, 2016 at 7:12pm PST I haven’t even read the news yet. \nFacebook tends to handle that for me. I feel somewhat spared and also somehow involuntarily injected with a lot of anger, most of which I completely understand. \nI have yet to see anyone celebrating and I’m clear that’s not because it’s not happening, but rather because at one point I opted out of connecting with people who might support Trump. I actually unfriended my cousin a month ago because he posted his support for Trump and the justifications were so horrifying. I didn’t want to see it. \nThings like this happen, and then a lot of people talk about leaving the country. The Canadian immigration website crashed last night from getting overloaded with too much traffic. \nI want to say, “Hello from the other side.” My name is Antesa and I’m a professional artist, and I live in the world’s supposed utopia: Denmark. \nLeaving the country doesn’t work the way we think it does. And neither does unfriending distant family members on Facebook. \nLet me tell you about disconnection and disassociation. This notion that we can’t get our needs met while staying associated and connected to a thing or a person or a place. Instead of taking a hard long look at why we believe that, we cut and run. \nChange doesn’t happen when all of us believe we have two choices: stay and suffer, or leave and be happy. It doesn’t work in institutions, it doesn’t work with our parents and extended family, it doesn’t work at our jobs, it doesn’t work in relationships, and it doesn’t work with physical residence. \nWe say we care about our country the way we say we care about our abusive relatives who we have never reconciled with: we want most of all to demonstrate that we are better than them. We pretend to have forgiven them for their horrible treatment of us and then we separate ourselves and forget it ever happened. \nAnd then we cleverly set up our whole lives to avoid the thing that triggers us. The overt loose cannon drunken behavior. The erratic reactivity, the irrational statements, the bigotry. Seeing those things causes us pain, and so we separate ourselves from them. We make our viewpoints right and theirs wrong—and we justify our separateness. \nWe pretend it doesn’t exist until once every four years we realize they’re still there, and they’re still erratic and irrational and bigots. And we had forgotten all about them. And now we need them to help pay our rent. And while we’ve disconnected and opted to stay surrounded by other like-minded people to avoid the pain and discomfort, so have they. Both ends perpetuate further and further into the extremes. \nThis is what disconnection on a large scale looks like. \nWake-up happens when we realize that all the tools we’ve tried no longer work and we realize we gotta actually look at ourself and stop pointing at everyone else to handle it. People go into recovery and start working the steps when they can finally admit that they have a problem. That’s step one. And we aren’t even close to there yet with our country. \nWe think we can fix it with one woman or one man. We think we can numb it with alcohol and television and legalizing marijuana and loading up our lives with so much compression that we won’t notice it’s starting to rot. We think to ourselves, “well, if it really gets bad, I’ll just leave the country.” \nAs a person who has spent most of her life running I’m gonna tell you the unfortunate truth: this is the point where our monsters catch up with us. And we can’t outrun it anymore. Trump is our shadow, and if we can’t find our power here, we are f***ed. Escape and continued separateness is no longer working. It’s time to admit we have a problem. \nAnd even though I live in Denmark now, I’m willing to admit that. I’m willing to admit I shouldn’t have unfriended my cousin and I shouldn’t have left five and a half years ago under the guise of trying to build myself a better life than the one I thought was available to me in the U.S.. \nI’ve learned a lot of things on this journey and the biggest one is that we are the masters of our own fate. A good life isn’t something we go pick up at the office vending machine once we pay our taxes, and it’s not something that has as a prerequisite a healthy and stable government. \nIt’s something we create . And it requires looking at all the pieces, and especially, the ones we feel most compelled to disconnect and disassociate from. Those pieces are our greatest teachers. That’s where all our power is locked up. \nSo I’m gonna ask: what story are you telling yourself that has it so you feel helpless and hopeless this morning? And how can you reframe that story? \nDo you want to change the world? It’s time to actually opt in to being the face of that change. \nAnd it starts here and now.",

(Photo: Tania Savayan/The Journal News) Buy Photo 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump, you may recall, used to be friends. The ease of a nasty tweet or a poison social media post have had a trickle-down effect; neighbor-against-neighbor exchanges have often been as bitter as the slings from the top of the ticket. \nEven after Clinton has conceded, recriminations and doubt are likely to linger. \nAs Tuesday evening progressed, and the pundits updated with \"key alerts\" for every incremental change, social media documented the dread, and the divisiveness. What the nation will need was sorely lacking during the dwindling days of the campaign: a path to reconciliation and reunion. \nHow could two candidates be more different? Clinton, before the sullying of email scandals and blame for every misstep of every administration for the last three decades, represented a moderate Democratic tradition, challenged only from the Left for the party's helm. Trump swam right of a wide pool of the most conservative the GOP had to offer. \nWhat a victory means for one side, and what it means for the other, could not be more different. Nor could it point to a deeper divide. \nOne upside to Election 2016? The turnout. Voters exercised the franchise. Poll workers, sometimes overwhelmed, said at numerous spots that they couldn't remember an election with so many voters, willing to wait. Were that more voters had cast their presidential ballot for someone, rather than against. \nTUESDAY: Susan B. Anthony grave draws huge crowds \nYet many found it thrilling — and empowering — to cast a vote for their candidate. \nMany were invigorated by a woman at the top of a major ticket. The 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920; less than a century later, a woman led a major ticket. At Susan B. Anthony's grave in Rochester, from early morning to night, people lined up to pay respects, and place their \"I voted\" stickers. Anthony, who was arrested in 1872 for voting in Rochester, did not live to see the success of the Suffrage movement. \nMany were energized by a political outsider who threw out the rule book and led a bare-knuckled revolution to change course. Trump's platform — America first, America only, America great — simultaneously spread feelings of past disenfranchisement and current empowerment. \nTrump and Clinton offered drastic differences (with Green Party's Jill Stein and the Libertarians' Gary Johnson hardly filling out a middle field). What comes next? How can a country so split in its choices be governed? How can shredded fences be mended? These are questions for the next president, and for us all. 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/2feQOqM TOP VIDEOS",

Post to Facebook Brunner: Bite-size comfort food Cookies are perfect for bringing back holiday memories.  //noconow.co/2feTHI0   Brunner: Bite-size comfort food Ruth Brunner 4:02 a.m. MST November 9, 2016 Ruth Brunner (Photo: Courtesy photo) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCookies are bite-size comfort foods. Each bite takes us back to childhood memories of warm kitchens filled with whiffs of cinnamon and sugar from the oven. As Regina Brett describes, “Baking magic happens with ingredients that last for months and come to life inside a warm oven. Baking is slow and leisurely.” \nMaking cut-out cookies is a leisurely labor of love. Lupe Urbieta-Hernandez baked up love in her biscochos cookies using pumpkin holiday cut-outs. She credits “Muy Bueno Cookbook” for this authentic Mexican recipe in which you knead anise seeds into the dough for a distinct flavor. \nThe warm, baked cookies are then coated with cinnamon and sugar. As the recipe makes 300 cookies, you could use your fall cookie cutters for part of the cookie dough and then bake up the rest using Christmas cookie cutters. Biscochos freeze well, providing holiday cookies ready to enjoy during the busy month of December. It is never too early to start your cookie baking for the holidays. Thanks Lupe for sharing a recipe sure to brighten our holidays. \nClosing thought: “I think baking cookies is equal to Queen Victoria running an empire. There's no difference in how seriously you take the job, how seriously you approach your whole life.” – Martha Stewart \nRuth Brunner is a Windsor Middle School teacher.

      "text": "Facebook has its sights set on poaching LinkedIn’s 467 million users with the limited launch of its latest feature aimed at businesses and job seekers.\nThe new test sees select Facebook Pages receive access to a “jobs” tab which can be used to advertise new positions, and actively recruit workers. The section, first spotted by TechCrunch , marks the start of an experimental stage that could eventually see the company roll out a number of new recruitment features. If LinkedIn wasn’t worried about the social network in the past, it has every reason to be now.\nMore: Facebook battle-testing the placement of Instant Games within Messenger\n“Based on behavior we’ve seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,” said a Facebook spokesperson.\nFacebook broke down the new features for Digital Trends in an emailed statement. Page admins that have access to the jobs tab can now create a job posting using the Page composer. Job post details can include job title, job type (i.e. full-time, intern, part-time), salary info, and more. Job posts will appear along with other Page posts in the News Feed of followers, and within the jobs tab itself.\nFacebook users can apply for a job by clicking “apply now,” which opens a standard application document complete with pre-populated information from the user’s public profile — meaning it would be handy to update your bio with your work history, if you haven’t done so already. Once submitted, the application will be received by the employer as a message.\nThe advantage of using the feature for businesses of all sizes is quite straightforward: access to an audience of 1.75 billion monthly active users. Facebook itself, of course, stands to reap extra revenue from employers looking to promote their openings in order to attract more eyeballs.\nIt could also potentially lead to more activity on the site, with users adding more personal info to their Facebook profiles (in the vein of a résumé), and businesses running multiple accounts to separate customer service from recruitment.\nAdditionally, the messaging aspect could prove a boon for Facebook Messenger. Despite boasting a huge user base of 1 billion members, Messenger could still do with a boost when it comes to its bot platform . It wouldn’t be hard to imagine bots handling the initial application process (for corporations at least), providing another use case for the burgeoning technology.\nLinkedIn now lets you find work without the fear of getting caught by your boss LinkedIn undergoes big redesign in bid to become your new favorite social network LinkedIn strips down its social network to target mobile users in India",

      "text": "I posted the above meme to Facebook on election morning. \nIt was received without much fanfare. \nI think 3 people “liked” it. That’s one of my most popular personally creations ever. 🙂 \nUnlike my good friend Chad Miller, I am not very adept at making catchy pics that go viral. He has had some seen by millions. \nI was however very serious and quite worried. I knew what the mainstream press was reporting and I knew what the true numbers were . I had a sneaking suspicion that they would try to steal this election from Donald Trump. \nI think in the end our voices were just too loud this time and millions of deplorables scared the establishment to death. \nSo for now, we can put down our muskets . \nBut stay vigilant America because these people do not accept defeat easily. \nWe begin today with new hope and prospects for a peaceful revolution, but things can change in a hurry. \nLet’s not forget the promised riots after a Trump win or the way an apparent victory turned into a nightmare for the Cliven Bundy family. \nThings could still take a turn for the worse. \nBe ready.

Local news agencies report 29-year-old Carl V. Hughes IV was sentenced to 150 years in prison with 60 years suspended after pleading guilty Monday to three counts of first-degree murder. Police discovered Hughes' father, 71-year-old Carl V. Hughes Jr.; his mother, 54-year-old Angela Hughes; and his sister, 22-year-old Bianca Hughes stabbed to death in the family's home on Sept. 23, 2015. Attorney John Rockecharlie says his client was not in his right mind while on a three-to-four-day crack binge and had convinced himself that he had to kill his family members. Rockecharlie says Hughes has expressed remorse for his actions. Editors' Picks ",

Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points .

      "text": "A mom might end up in jail for selling the *weirdest* thing on Facebook Well, damn. Who in the world knew that selling ceviche on Facebook was illegal? A quick perusal of the web will reveal all sorts of crazy stuff being hawked by would-be entrepreneurs taking advantage of features like Facebook’s Marketplace . But as Eater reports, a Sacramento mother of six is facing time in jail after her black market seafood appetizer enterprises were found to be in direct violation of San Joaquin County law.\nAccording to ABC 13, Mariza Reulas belongs to Facebook food group 209 Food Spot where North California members buy and sell food from one another. But operating like food stores requires a permit, something many of the members apparently did not have. This led to an undercover sting operation that charged Reulas and over a dozen other people with operating a food facility and doing business without a permit.\n\nReulas rejected a plea deal for three years of probation, instead choosing to stand trial where she could be sentenced to up to a year in jail.\nSheesh. This seafood-selling smackdown sounds way harsh, but San Joaquin County maintains its stance that selling food without a health department inspection poses a danger to consumers.\nThe post A mom might end up in jail for selling the *weirdest* thing on Facebook appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

In addition, Facebook saw an increase of almost 30% on Tuesday night, while Twitter traffic more than doubled, according to new data published by broadband network company Sandvine this morning, which tracked impact the election had on internet usage. \nMeanwhile, Netflix – which is typically the largest source of internet traffic in North America – saw a huge decline. Its traffic levels dropped by 25% compared with the previous day. However, Sandvine believes that those levels will return to normal tonight. \nThe findings are based on a sample U.S. fixed access network on the East Coast that has been fairly representative of national traffic in the past, notes Sandvine. But these figures are still preliminary for the time being, and may be updated later in the day. \nAlso during election night, total peak internet traffic was down by roughly 15% as people watched the results, instead of surfing the web, as usual. \nThis figure also speaks to the fact that when it comes to following breaking news across the U.S., many are still turning to television over web news sources, live streams, and online TV services. \nThat being said, even when web surfing is down, people were using their “second screens,” like tablets and smartphones, to engage with the news they were watching. The spikes in social media usage came from people reading and sharing their thoughts and feelings about the election across sites like Facebook and Twitter. \nThese metrics indicate the larger role that social media platforms have on today’s web: they are increasingly the portals where users are getting their information when they’re online. They are places where news – and fake, viral, clickbait masquerading as news – also spreads. \nIn fact, almost half of adults get news on Facebook, a report from earlier this year said. \nThis has led to some questioning whether or not these networks have a responsibility to act more like media organizations , in terms of cutting down on the spread of disinformation. Given the amount of fake news stories that circulated on Facebook during this election cycle, it’s hard to ignore the impact Facebook’s decision on the matter had on American politics.",

      "text": "Share on Facebook 6 Representing three generations of the Boston underground music scene, E brings together Thalia Zedek from Uzi and Come on guitar and vocals, Karate's Gavin McCarthy on drums and Jason Sanford of Neptune on additional guitar and vocals. Although Zedek and Sanford combine their noise rock credentials with McCarthy's precision-sharp drumming, much of the trio's debut self-titled album comes off comfortable and familiar sounding, which simultaneously works in and against the trio's favour. Over the album's 10 tracks and 35-minute runtime, E seem more like a musical experiment than a fully realized group, as Zedek and Sanford's scratched and hammered guitars explore far more interesting ideas and cover much more artistic ground than their oft-uninspired vocals melodies do. Luckily, the three-piece have so much experience that E can't help but sound sonically titillating, especially on tracks like the '90s post-punk/no wave-indebted opener \"Great Light\" (a track that properly showcases Zedek's scorched guitar playing), the Fugazi-esque \"Candidate\" (featuring Stafford's most urgent vocals to date) and the surprisingly tender \"Fissure\" (which manages to demonstrate exactly the type of personality McCarthy's drumming can bring to a song). On their self-titled debut, E focus on each member's strength, leaving listeners with an album that's at times more combative than it is collaborative. ( Thrill Jockey ) Get It",

      "title": "David Bazan - Dark Sacred Night",
      "text": "Share on Facebook 7 Don't be misled — this is not the album to listen to while finishing your Christmas baking or while trimming the tree. This isn't Burl Ives, nor is it Nat King Cole. This is Seattle native David Bazan, and with his experiences, you can bet on a provocative and inspiring, if at times dark and solemn, collection of songs, Christmas album or not. Bazan describes the impetus for the songs as follows: \"There is something dark and underrepresented in Christmas music, and that's just how uncomfortable the holidays can be for a lot of folks.\" Dark Sacred Night is a compilation of Christmas-themed music plucked from Bazan's time with Christian rock/indie outfit Pedro the Lion as well as from his various solo forays. The compelling part is that some of these songs were written and/or recorded when Bazan was a practicing Christian, and some after he had denounced his faith — roughly around the time of his first full-length solo record, Curse the Branches , in 2009. The album doesn't break new ground from an instrumentation perspective, sticking mainly to guitar/piano/vocals and the odd flourish of bells or reverberation, but it's in the lyrical content and the vocal delivery where the album really bears fruit. There are a couple of no-frills standards on here, such as \"Away in a Manger\" and \"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\" that mirror the original versions, but Bazan chooses to customize the lyrics on a couple of other tracks, including \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\" (\"Sipping Christmas whiskey, wondering if I still believe\") and \"Silent Night\" (\"Isn't it strange how many were beaten and maimed...in this baby's name?\"). There's a version of John Lennon's \"Happy X-Mas (War is Over)\" on here, as well as a beautifully poignant carol based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem \"Christmas Bells,\" called \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.\" Bazan also covers Minnesota band Low's \"Long Way Around the Sea.\" For the final track, \"Wish My Kids Were Here,\" Bazan tells the story of a father who, for legal reasons, is unable to spend Christmas with his children, a very personal song on an album that otherwise deals with more universally existential themes. Dark Sacred Night is a non-traditional Christmas album, but one of great import nonetheless. It makes a perfect companion for those of us whose Christmas experience is absent of the typical festivities and jubilation. ( Suicide Squeeze ) Get It",

      "text": "How to Dress Well for Work When Your Office is a Jeans-and-Sneakers Kind of Place By Facebook WireImage \nMonochromatic layers are a standard move for well-dressed men for a reason: the look is relatively easy to pull off and instantly reads as modern, elegant, and expensive. Miles Teller is the latest stylish dude to use this trick. Teller wore a tonal blue outfit yesterday to promote his new movie “Bleed for This” and looked damn good as a result. If you work in a casual office but don’t want to wear jeans every day (or are reeling from Trump’s win and want to show your support for the Democratic party) this is a move well worth copying. \nStart with a pair of navy trousers or chinos (Miles’ are quite slim but you could go a bit slouchier if you wanted) then add a non-pique polo shirt in a slightly lighter shade of blue. Finish things off with a navy bomber in suede or another rich-texture material that keeps from looking exactly like the trousers. Then finish things off with some clean-and-simple shoes. Miles took the color all the way through to his lace-ups but a pair of black leather oxfords or spare white sneakers would work fine here too. \nAnd there you have it. So much cooler than jeans and a basic button-down, yet just as easy to reach for before you’ve had a cup of coffee. Up Next: Steven Yeun’s Guide to Surviving a Zombie Apocalypse (at the Office)",

      "text": "Published Nov 09, 2016 at 11:56AM EST by Don . Like us on Facebook! M \nartin Shkreli, a 33-year-old entrepreneur from Brooklyn, New York, is no stranger to online controversy. In September of last year, he found himself transformed into a kind of internet supervillain after it was reported that his company Turing Pharmaceuticals had increased the price of the medication Daraprim by 5000%. Dubbed “Pharma Bro” by news outlets, Shkreli enthusiastically embraced his status as the internet’s public enemy, launching a YouTube channel, Periscope feed and diving head first into meme culture. We reached out to Shkreli to find out about his experiences with online fame and what plans he has for the future. Interview \nQ: How are you? What have you been up to lately? A: Everything is great! I started a new software company to try and challenge myself in a new industry. That’s what I’m spending most of my time on. \nQ: Let’s get the elephant in the room out of the way. Just over a year ago, you skyrocketed to online notoriety in the wake of the Daraprim price hike scandal, with news outlets and people on the social media calling you “the most hated man in America.” Without prejudice, when you look back at it now, has this experience changed you in anyway? A: I’ve learned a lot about the media, how people perceive and receive news. \nQ:Clearly, you are not the first corporate executive to be vilified as a “public enemy” on the Internet, but what set you apart from many others who had gotten on the wrong side of social media is that you didn’t go off the grid or hide away from the criticisms, as many tend to do. What drove you to embrace the attention? A: I believe in honesty and transparency. I’m a capitalist, and a ruthless and determined one, at that. I think it’s dishonest to pretend otherwise. That disgusts some people, but it is immensely attractive to others. I don’t see any problem “being myself” and being honest about it.. \nQ: Since the scandal broke, you’ve kept yourself pretty busy on social media, from hosting video lessons on finance and live streams to offering commentaries on hip hop music and internet meme culture. Which brings us to this question: how long have you been following memes and how were you introduced to it? Is this a recent development or is it something you’ve been casually into before you became famous? A: I love memes! I’m a creature of the Internet, having spent most of my waking life online, starting with AOL in 1993. I started with icanhascheezburger / LOLcats . We’ve come a long way, but I still like cat memes. \nQ: Last year, you reportedly spent $2 million to obtain Wu-Tang Clan’s album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. Was it worth it? A: I thought it was important to make a statement about the value of music. Rich people love buying paintings and homes as trophies, but when I got wealthy, this purchase made way more sense to me. Music is so important to us but we are reluctant to consume it the same way we view fine art. \n[Note: Shortly after our e-mail correspondence, Shkreli release excerpts of tracks from the album via livestream , which he had promised to deliver if the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election.] \nQ:More recently, you made the headlines for expressing interest in buying 4chan . What happened with that? A: The 4chan people have a price in mind for their business that is different from mine. I am a very, very cheap investor--they are too smart to be taken advantage of by me. Having said that, a good deal exists for the right investor/buyer. I just like great deals and they were not willing to sell themselves as short as I would have liked. \nQ: We’ve noticed you like to play League of Legends . What is your current rank? Who are your favorite competitive teams? A: I’m Platinum on my main account--I hit diamond and stopped playing. I don’t follow the pro scene too much. \nQ: Who did you vote for in this year’s presidential election? A: I don’t vote--it’s too much work and I’m too busy. But I would’ve voted for Trump. \nQ: What’s next? Do you have any new projects in mind for 2017? A: My biggest project is getting a “not guilty” verdict in my jury trial! Other than that, launching the software company, dropping a sick album would be the other two main goals. \nQ: Finally, what is your favorite internet meme? A: My favorite meme is this really stupid Chris Brown (I think) photo that is captioned “after you get a free sample and you pretending you might actually buy it”. I also love Vince McMahon memes and any “urban” or hood meme. \nMartin Shkreli is an American entrepreneur and pharmaceutical executive who is the founder and former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, the co-founder of MSMB Capital Management and the co-founder and former CEO of Retrophin.

      "title": "Volcom's beautiful new swimsuits are made from recycled fishing nets",
      "text": "Share on Facebook © Courtesy of Volcom \nThe sporty fashion retailer has made an impressive effort to repurpose ocean waste into swimwear that people will want to buy. \nVolcom has launched a new line of swimwear made from recycled fishing nets. It is a fascinating and admirable attempt to rescue some of the waste floating in our oceans and put it to good use. “Caught up in a good thing” is the catchy tagline that accompanies the launch of the Simply Solid line, and it sounds like an accurate description. \nVolcom has partnered with Italian fabric company Aquafil to create Simply Solid. Aquafil manufactures a product called Econyl, composed of 100 percent regenerated nylon waste, such as abandoned fishing nets, production scraps, and carpet fluff. The waste is transformed into a durable, lightweight, and breathable textile. From the press release: \n“The recovered nylon waste is made new through Aquafil’s cutting-edge regeneration system, a pioneering example of the circular economy in action – offering the same quality and performance as traditional nylon, but with the ability to be regenerated an infinite number of times without any loss in quality.” \nThis is a logical step for a company so invested in ocean sports. There are an estimated 640,000 tons of abandoned fishing nets littered throughout the ocean, which pose great danger to sea animals and birds. The more of this waste that can be removed and repurposed, reducing demand for virgin fibers, the better off our oceans will be. \nHead of Women’s Business for Volcom, Lindsey Roach, says: \n“Econyl fiber allowed us to create a collection with deeper meaning and purpose. We wanted this collection to be more than beautiful patterns and functional pieces, so the fact that it is made with recovered fishing nets creates a natural connection to surf culture, which fully understands the value of keeping the ocean clean.” \nThe Simply Solid line for women, which contains 78 percent Econyl, includes bikini and tankini tops, bottoms of various sizes, one-piece swimsuits, long-sleeved top, and board shorts. They come in black, teal, and yellow, and range in price from $32 to $75.  ",

This is what Quote: :\ni’ve never regretted coming out more than i do now. i’ve never been more scared for mine and my friends lives than now. i came out four years ago. four. and now i feel like i’m being forced back in the closet and it’s been shut with a steel door. i am utterly terrified. for my life. for my safety. if you just want funny shit, go somewhere else. this is my life at stake. this is millions of lives at stake. fuck you if this is just some kind of giant joke. What am I supposed to say to my girl? How can I reassure her? This is terrifying for adults. She’s just 18 and trying to figure out who she is.\nI’ve heard people say that maybe this campaign getting so disgusting was Trump’s way of fighting dirty so he’d win.\nI’ve heard people say that maybe he will return to the more “centrist” position he held before he announced for the office.\nI can only pray it’s true but that’s not going to reassure any person he encouraged every low-life out there to act out against.\nCrimes against people of color, the entirety of the LGBTQ community, Muslims, and women are all expected to rise. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg…\nSo how do I reassure my 18 year old lesbian daughter that she’ll be ok when I don’t know that anymore?\nHOW??",

You may find yourself less inclined to share the company of others for the next few days. \nThose who intend to hole up at home and hide under a blanket with a bottle of wine until the dust settles probably already know that cats make good company. Now, they can be your drinking buddies too. \nCatwine makes animal-friendly blends for your pet. The wine is non-alcoholic—made from filtered water and enriched with vitamins. It's also infused with catnip so your cat still gets to take the edge off at the end a very long day. \nThe wines come in cleverly named flavors, like Catbernet and Meowsling . A bottle costs $9.54.",

      "text": "Miley Cyrus Posts Facebook Election Reaction See Miley Cyrus’s tear-filled Facebook video reacting to the election of Donald Trump. Twitter 2016 Kevin Mazur \nAt this point, it feels like so much time has passed, but it was under 24 hours ago that Miley Cyrus rolled up — drive-thru style — to cast her vote for Hillary Clinton. She then posted a happy-go-lucky selfie of herself with her \"I Voted\" sticker, captioning it: \"I voted today for @hillaryclinton ❤️❤️ I am so proud of all of you who did the same! #imwithher.\" \nNow here we are. As of very early this morning, Donald Trump secured the presidency, and as you might expect, countless people across the country are in an utter state of shock and dismay — including many celebrities like Rowan Blanchard, Ariana Grande, Zendaya, and more — all of whom took to social media to express their sorrow. Miley, who rallied behind Bernie Sanders and then Clinton, chose her Facebook to share her reaction to the results, and like many of her celebrity counterparts, it's brimming with raw, painful emotion. Through her tears, she expresses her undying support for Hillary, saying, \"I still think, that in her lifetime, she deserves to be the first female president, and that's what makes me so sad.\" Pausing to catch her breath she adds, \"And I just wish she had that opportunity because she's fought for so long and because I believe her when she says she loves this country; this is all she's ever done — she's given her life to make it better.\" \nShe then takes a different turn, bringing up the irony of how \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" played in the background after Trump's acceptance speech, and explains that even though it hurts to say, as a \"happy hippie,\" she will learn to accept him as the new president. And that she wants to be a \"hopeful hippie\" now. Then, through more tears, she thanks President Obama for everything he's done and begs everyone to treat people with love and compassion and respect. \nShe finishes the video by urging anyone who wants to open up, to do so, saying, \"please, if you want to open your mind and open your heart, I would love to give you a key.\" Watch the full video below. \nRelated:",

      "text": "Email marketing is still one of the best performing digital channels, beating out Facebook and Twitter by 40X according to one study .\nSo what’s the problem?\nThe number of emails that our subscribers are getting continues to balloon. Billions are already being sent daily, and the average person will get about 140 daily emails in a little over a year.\nThat means we’ve never had more competition than ever before.\nAnd it gets worse, as email service providers like Gmail are trying to reduce the amount of promotional emails that actually hit someone’s inbox.\nHere are 5 tips to escape their clutches, break through the noise, and increase click through rates across your campaigns.\nTip #1. Prune Subscribers with Low-Engagement that are Holding You Back Sending email isn’t difficult these days. Actually getting it delivered is, according to an excellent Wired article .\nIt discusses how MailChimp uses sophisticated techniques like sending large campaigns in tiny batches initially to test subscriber reactions. If Open and Click rates are low, with high unsubscribe or complaints, they’ll kill the entire campaign before sending to everyone else.\nThe reason they’re so strict is because modern email service providers like Gmail and Outlook now use Reputation Scoring – analyzing the quality of an email campaign based on who it’s being sent to and where it’s being sent from.\nThat’s one of the reasons why your promotional or newsletter-based email content automatically gets filtered to the Promotions tab in Gmail. So even though it’s technically getting to your subscribers, they’re probably not seeing it among all the other stuff in there.\n\nChances are, your current email list is full of old subscribers that have little-to-no engagement. They haven’t opened an email from the last few campaigns, or over the past few weeks, and by continuing to send stuff to them, you’re risking high unsubscribe and spam complaints that will only further jeopardize your deliverability (or chances of actually reaching the good people).\nMost email marketing software providers will provide the ability to go in and create new segments, where you can select criteria like recent Opens or Clicks and determine who might be ‘dead weight’ that is on the brink of opting out soon.\n\nTip #2. Make it Harder to Join in the First Place Another counter-intuitive starting point is to make your current email list harder to join. Crazy as that might seem, there’s data that backs this up.\nWe’ve already seen that MailChimp has a few strict policies. And unlike many others, they require and force you to use a double opt-in sequence for new subscribers.\nThat means after people give you their email address on a website or form, they also have to go into their email inbox and confirm their subscription before they’re added to your list.\nObviously, that extra step and hassle cuts down on the number of people who opt-in. But… it ensures that those who do REALLY want to hear what you have to say. Based on their research and analysis, lists with double opt-in members have higher engagement with click rates and lower spam complaints over time.\n\n( image source )\nIf you’re a service-based business that uses a bigger offer like a free consultation, you should probably also increase the number of fields you’re asking to get additional information. Some platforms, like HubSpot, give you the ability to save or ‘bank’ answers against a contact’s record so that you don’t have to ask them for that information again.\n\nWhile this might also cut down on the number of people opting-in, it should help you disqualify those who’re ‘on the fence’ and make way for the ones who’re eager and ready to get started (i.e. the quality vs. quantity argument).\nTip #3. Segment Your Email Campaigns Instead of Broadcasting Sending a newsletter-style campaign to a big list of subscribers is fine if you’re just trying to deliver general information and stay ‘top of mind’.\nBut if you’re aiming to drive new leads or sales, segmentation is the key.\nAutomatically sorting your database and sending timely emails that are personalized to each subscriber can deliver a 451% increase in qualified leads, with a 34% increase in average sales.\nStart with a specific objective or milestone hit, like a product added to someone’s cart or just recently purchased. You now know a lot of specific information about this person, what they were just looking at, and what they’re trying to do next – and you can use all of this information to your advantage.\nAgain, even relatively inexpensive software like MailChimp allows you to create these automated ‘workflows’ that will send out specific emails at predetermined intervals once someone completes the action you’re looking for.\n\nSome more advanced tools, like HubSpot, will allow you to create sophisticated follow-up sequences based on what someone DOES or DOESN’T do.\nFor example, if someone doesn’t click on the link then send them this email. If they do click, then we can send them something else.\n\nTip #4. Try to Keep Your Subject Lines Short, Sweet & Punchy People are receiving an overwhelming amount of emails each day. And unfortunately, many of yours are probably getting stuck in that dreaded Promotions tab.\nThat means you’ve got a ton of competition for attention.\nFor example, average click rates are around 2.5% for the ‘Marketing and Advertising’ industries according to one study .\nAfter analyzing over 280,358 email subject lines from a few years, we noticed that some of the best performers contained only a few words.\nFor example, “50 Ways to Get Customers in 2014” 9.10% click rate (which is 2-3x better than industry averages). We also found similar successes with “3 Killer SEO Resources” and “Why Comments are Useless”.\nBeyond keeping the subject line to 30-40 characters though, you’ll also notice that these headlines use strong, vivid language that jumps out at you (instead of generic, overly bland stuff).\nAnother take on this approach comes from Susan at 500 Startups . She advocates using common email language that we’d expect to see from a colleague or friend, like the abbreviations:\nFW: Fwd: RE: \n( image source )\nAnother critical detail in the image above is the sender’s name. Here, you’ll notice the friendly “Alison Powell”, even though it’s from HubSpot (the company), because they want you (the reader) to emotionally engage with the email.\nIn addition to a person’s name, adding the company name too (like “Alison from HubSpot”) also increases click through rates as opposed to those lifeless, dreaded “noreply@” ones.\nA final tip is to include extra context to the ‘Preview Text’ area that will show up just next to the subject line in your inbox. Here you can expand on the contents of your email a bit, or add some intrigue to build anticipation.\n\n5) Utilize & Experiment with Timing to Influence Click Rates For years and years, an age-old ‘best practice’ has been to send email newsletters out on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.\nIt’s become a generally accepted marketing principle – regardless of industry.\nYears ago, HubSpot set out to verify this and analyze the best time to send an email campaign. And the results were surprising…\n\n( image source )\nThat’s right. The campaigns with the highest click-through rates were over the weekend on Saturdays and Sundays!\nThe worst day of the week for click through rates? Tuesdays.\nThat wasn’t the only surprising thing, though…\n\n( image source )\nUnsubscribe rates also jumped on Tuesdays, which is a terrible signal in this case.\nThe reasoning? If consumers and businesspeople alike are receiving an overwhelming amount of email on one day, the chances of them opening and clicking are lower, while the chances of them getting frustrated and unsubscribing is higher.\nThat lead HubSpot to recommend testing “contra-competitive timing”, or doing the opposite of what others in your industry might be doing.\nOne way to do this is to simply send campaigns at different days and times to see what works best for your own audience. Some tools however also allow you to A/B test day and time. So you’ll send the same exact campaign, to half of your audience at one time and the other half at another. For example, MailChimp will allow you to select Opens or Clicks as the winning metric and then show you results afterward.\n\nTiming also comes into play as discussed in Tip #3 with segmentation.\nOne good example highlighted by a HubSpot article saw that Eater Boston sent out a “Where to Drink Beer Right Now” email at 6:45PM on a Wednesday, just in time for all those people leaving work and heading out for the evening.\nConclusion It’s never been more difficult to get an email delivered successfully to a subscriber.\nWhich means it takes a few different techniques and approaches to boost results.\nThe starting point is to evolve your approach and make sure only the best, most interested people are able to join your list in the first place.\nThe next step is to segment your future campaigns to make sure that the right person receives a tailored message at the right time.\nAnd last but not least, make your emails as personable as possible (from the sender address to the subject line and preview text).\nBecause after all, whether we’re talking email or the phone or Twitter or Facebook, people want to connect and hear from other people – not nameless, faceless corporations.\n",

      "text": "We feel Miley Cyrus ' pain. \nOn Wednesday morning, the liberal celeb took to Facebook to share her video reaction to the upsetting outcome of Tuesday's vote . \nLike half the country right now, Smilez was visibly devastated to learn Hillary Clinton had lost the Presidential election to Donald Trump , and couldn't stop crying throughout the emotional clip. \nRelated: Celebs React To The 2016 Election Results \nThe Voice mentor started off very clearly dejected, wondering if her sexuality was alienating her from the rest of the country: \n\"Given the result, maybe I really am different, and maybe a lot of people that I'm surrounded by think with open minds and open hearts, like I do.\" \nUgh. That just breaks our hearts! \nUnfortunately, it didn't end there… the pop star continued to lament Hillary's loss, adding: \n\"And, I do want to say that I've been very vocal for my support for everyone besides Donald Trump. I heavily supported Bernie [Sanders] . I heavily supported Hillary. And I still think that in her lifetime she deserves to be the first female president. And that's what makes me so sad, is that I just wish that she had that opportunity because she's fought for so long. And because I believe her when she says she that she loves this country. This is all she's ever done. She's given her life to make it better.\" \nBut, Miz Cyrus has an important message for her faithful followers — and is actually encouraging them to remain hopeful, even with the racist Republican in power: \n\"And, Happy Hippies, we adjust if we accept everyone, who they are. And so, Donald Trump, I accept you. And, this is hard to say, but I even accept you as the President of the United States, and that's fine. That's fine because I think now I want to be a Hopeful Hippie.\" \nHowever, the 23-year-old couldn't finish her sentence while trying to describe Donald Trump entering The White House, and broke down crying. \nRelated: Twitter Flips A Sh*t After Trump Is Elected \nWhen she composed herself slightly, the former Disney darling thanked President Barack Obama for all the progress he made throughout his presidency: \n\"President Obama, Mr. Obama, I want to thank you for everything you've done in these past eight years.\" \nBut then, the Tennessee native heartbreaking started sobbing all over again. \nShe then launched into a passionate plea directed at the cringe-worthy President-elect, begging: \n\"But please, please treat people with love and treat people with compassion and treat people with respect, and I will do the same for you. And anyway, anything you want to talk about or understand, maybe people that don't think the same way that you and some of the people that support you do, please, if you want to open your mind and open your heart, I would love to give you a key.\" \nMiles tearfully signed off expressing her gratitude for Hillary: \n\"Thank you Hillary for inspiring us.\" \nCh-ch-check out Miley's breakdown in full (below)!!! \nTo be honest, we're just as dejected as Miley is at the moment… \nBut what makes U hopeful during this dark time, Perezcious readers?! \n[ Image via Miley Cyrus/ Instagram . ]",

      "text": "Facebook news feeds around the world look a lot different Wednesday, November 9th — after the election.\nYours might be one of angst and despair, or celebrations and “I told you so’s.” It depends on the people you’re friends with and the online community you’ve created with your clicks, likes and shares.\nFacebook’s algorithm knows what you like based on the videos you watch, people you talk to, and content you interact with. It then shows you more of the same. This creates something called “filter bubbles.” You begin to see only the content you like and agree with, while Facebook hides dissenting points of view.\nThis means news on Facebook comes with confirmation bias — it reinforces what you already think is true — and people are increasingly frustrated.\nFacebook denies it’s a media company, yet almost half of U.S. adults get news from Facebook.\nWhen Facebook fired its human curators and began to rely on algorithms to surface popular stories earlier this year, fake news proliferated.\nViral memes and propaganda spread among people with similar beliefs and interests. It’s cheaper and easier to create and spread ideological disinformation than deeply-researched and reported news. And it comes from all over — teens in Macedonia are responsible for a large portion of fake pro-Trump news, according to a BuzzFeed analysis.\nFilter bubbles became especially problematic during the presidential election.\nHyperpartisan news sites and fake websites distributed false stories about voter fraud, election conspiracies, and the candidates’ pasts that spread like wildfire on Facebook. It was more prevalent on right-leaning Facebook pages. As CNNMoney’s Brian Stelter said in response to the growing number of false viral stories, people should have a “triple check before you share” rule.\nOn Wednesday, many people were shocked by Trump’s victory. Words of fear and sorrow fill their Facebook feeds, and even those with thousands of friends are probably only seeing posts that echo their feelings.\nBut if you voted for Trump, chances are your feed reflects the opposite. You might see a cascade of #MakeAmericaGreatAgain hashtags and friends celebrating.\nFacebook will likely face questions about its responsibility to weed out fake sites and false stories. The company did not respond to questions about whether it plans to modify the news feed algorithms. On an earnings call in July, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that social media sites actually provide more diversity of opinion than traditional news outlets.\nBut Facebook is just the vehicle with which friends and family are sharing news. It’s not necessarily about trusting the news people see on Facebook, but believing and trusting the people who are sharing it.\nThe U.S. presidential election starkly illustrated the problems with filter bubbles and personalized social networks. Almost two billion people use the social media site where friends and family share and nurture similar beliefs and false news snowballs. And it raises questions as to the civic responsibility of the world’s biggest platform — and whether or not automated fact-checking could have changed an election.",

      "text": "Oct 30, 2016 at 6:04pm PDT November 8th was tough. \nAs the numbers rolled in, my Facebook feed became filled with disbelief, then despair. \nBlack friends, gay friends, genderqueer friends, sexual abuse victims, white parents of black children—all of them were feeling betrayed by an America they thought they knew. \n“I’m scared,” one of my gay friends messaged to me. “I’m sobbing, and I can’t stop. I don’t know what to do.” \nHe is not the only one. \nThe 2016 election results are in, and we are mourning. For many of us, the last eight years have represented a time of inclusion and equality. President Obama won hard-earned battles that moved America forward toward equal access to healthcare, equal marriage rights, racial and religious equality and a more accountable justice system, to name a few. \nNow as the book is closed on another election, all of those issues, as well as the health of our environment, reproductive rights, education funding and foreign affairs feel like they are teetering over a cliff, and the inevitable fall cannot be stopped. \nBut something can be done. \nEven though those of us in the “anyone but Trump” camp lost the general election, we still have just as much power today as we did before November 8th. We still have our voices. We still have our strength in numbers. And we still have our love. \nWhen I woke up this morning, I replayed the reality of what has now happened in our country in my mind. It felt like something critical had been shaken and shifted. But when I opened my eyes, the sun was shining, my partner was beside me and my son was safe in our home. Outside my door, my neighbors were still the same, and the businesses and schools were still opening their doors as usual. \nNothing has really changed. The people who have been kind to others all along are still kind. The people who have been fearful or hateful are no different than they were before. The only difference is that now we know who is who. \nAnger and sadness are warranted, and we should give ourselves the time we need to feel those things. But after they have gone, the only way to battle hate is with love, and love is an action. Here’s what we can do: \nSay kind words to a stranger, a friend, or better yet, to someone who has been unkind. In a world where discrimination and insults are now normal, a pick-me-up and a smile can go a long way. \nListen to the voices of the disenfranchised and seek to understand their underlying fears. Beneath their words are genuine insecurities about their safety, their finances and their way of life. We can disagree with them and still recognize that they are valid concerns to that person. We may even learn that we share some of the same underlying concerns. \nCommit random acts of kindness. Mow the neighbor’s lawn or shovel their walkway. Pay for a stranger’s coffee or groceries if we can. Hold the door for someone. Do it without expecting anything in return, and do it anonymously as much as we can. Spread kindness like cupcake sprinkles whenever and wherever possible. \nBe mindful of what is happening around us. Apathy is the ultimate act of violence. Failing to speak out when we know what is happening around us, or refusing to pay attention can no longer be the status quo. Our eyes are wide open and our power is strong (that is why so many came out to vote in opposition). We are the only ones who can give up that power. \nThe world around us may be shifting, but the important things remain. Through kindness, we can heal. Through love, we can win. \n~",

      "text": "Michael Moore shared his plan to save the country on Facebook Wednesday following Donald Trump ’s victory in the presidential election .\n\nTitled his “Morning After To-Do List,” the “Trumpland” director listed five things voters should do if they’re feeling upset about Trump’s win on Tuesday. Number one on the list: “Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people.”\n\nMoore, who was an outspoken critic of Trump during the campaign and a supporter of Bernie Sanders during the primaries, also called on the Democratic members of congress to “fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years.”\n\n*Also Read:* Surprise! Michael Moore Made a Movie About Donald Trump\n\n“Everyone must stop saying they are ‘stunned’ and ‘shocked,'” Moore wrote. “What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren’t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew.”\n\nMoore also called on his followers to “fire” the pollsters, the pundits and the media, and work to get rid of the “arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College ,” ending the message on a positive note by pointing out that Hillary Clinton is on track to win the popular vote.\n\n*Also Read:* Michael Moore Knows 'For a Fact' Donald Trump Ran for President to Fleece NBC\n\n“You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there’s climate change , they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don’t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed,” he wrote. “We live in a country where the majority agree with the ‘liberal’ position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen.”\n\nRead Michael Moore’s full post below:\n\n*Related stories from TheWrap:*\n\nHere's Every Major Poll That Got Donald Trump's Election Win Wrong\n\nWatch Miley Cyrus Sob Through Emotional Concession Speech After Trump Win (Video)\n\nThat Time ' The Simpsons ' Predicted President Donald Trump (Video)",

O’Connell seven tips on how to spend a more financial secure holiday season Thomas J. O'Connell (Photo: ~FILE PHOTO) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe year is quickly coming to a close, and Thanksgiving will soon be upon us. We all have many things to be thankful for like, the election FINALLY being over (LOL), the stock market not crashing, inflation not running out of control, our families, our health and our overall good fortune. \nWith the last remaining weeks left to the year, now is the time to review your finances to make sure you are still on your path to success. A few things to check are: \nYour 401k contributions – did you maximize your contribution to get the employer match? \nYour required minimum distributions – I know some older folks are reading this article from the questions I get, so make sure your required minimum distributions for retirement accounts are taken by Dec. 31. Taking a withdrawal late or for the wrong amount can result in a stiff penalty in addition to regular income tax on the amount that should’ve been withdrawn. \nYour 2016 taxes – I like to suggest to my clients that they do a mock tax return based on the last 10 or 11 months so they’ll have a good understanding of how much tax they’ll owe in April 2017 \nReview your portfolio – do you need to rebalance, are your investments still in line with your objectives, how much risk are you taking, what tax effect has your portfolio created? \nCheck your beneficiaries – has there been a life event that may change these, like a marriage, divorce, birth, death? \nFAFSA application – the new window to file for financial aid opened Oct. 1 for the freshman class of 2017-2018 \nBenefits – this is when most people renew their benefits at work, so make sure you are maximizing the ones that are important to you and that help advance your financial success. \nI have no doubt that the coming year is going to bring many changes, opportunities and volatility. There are many well-known clichés, such as “people don’t plan to fail, they just fail to plan” or “if you don’t have your own plan, the government has a plan for you,” and so on. Sometimes we get tired of hearing them. \nThe one thing I do know though is that we’ve seen bad economies before, as well as market crashes, tax hikes, inflation, volatility and Black Swan events, and people have come out the other end of these periods more successful and better positioned for their future. Why? Not because they flew by the seat of their pants, but because they had a plan, executed that plan, and continually reviewed and adjusted that plan to make sure they stayed on course. \nI know sometimes I sound like your dad, but I tell you these things because I truly want to see you and your families succeed. Indulge me and let me leave you with one last thought: “Knowledge is something you learn. Wisdom is the ability to apply that knowledge to your everyday life.” I’m trying to give you my 30-plus years of experience as an advisor and share with you the mistakes other people have made before you, so you don’t have to. That’s what wisdom is all about. \nI wish all of you and your families the happiest of all Thanksgivings. Here’s to your financial success. \nA resident of Bedminster, Thomas J.

Cases of dementia are largely (though hardly solely) attributable to Alzheimer's disease, recognizable by aberrant protein formations in the brain. An analysis last year estimated that more than 28 million Baby Boomers will develop Alzheimer's disease by midcentury. Those of us who survive past age 85 will have a 50 percent chance of developing the debilitating condition. \nAlzheimer's is already the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S. and most scary of all, America's lone top 10 fatal disease without a preventative therapy, cure, or even a way to slow its progression — until now. \nFUNDRAISING: Hundreds walk for Alzheimer's Association \nIn the last few months, ground-breaking researchers at UCLA and the University of Pittsburgh have published encouraging results indicating that healthy lifestyle changes may prevent dementia as we age. \nOne study found that tell-tale Alzheimer's protein build-ups were reduced in 40- to 85-year-olds pursuing a healthier body mass index, with physical activity and/or eating a lean Mediterranean diet. The other set of tests showed that added physical activity, no matter whether formal exercise, gardening, or just walking around, produced more gray matter (what we think with) in subjects with Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment over the age of 65, opening up hope for slowing or reversal of this scourge. Buy Photo \nElaine Healy, M.D., the Vice President of Medical Affairs at United Hebrew in New Rochelle, is pictured in her office, Nov. 4, 2016. (Photo: Mark Vergari/The Journal News) \n\"We were taught Alzheimer's was not preventable, and not reversible. People took on a very fatalistic future vision,\" says Dr. Elaine Healy, geriatric specialist and Medical Director and VP of Medical Affairs at United Hebrew in New Rochelle, herself a Boomer at 62. \"Instead, we're learning that wise lifestyle choices now mean reduced Alzheimer's woes later.\" \nGetting anyone to alter long-held food and activity-related habits may require overcoming resistance to change, especially in the absence of any apparent problems. \"There can be brain deterioration with no obvious symptoms,\" Dr. Healy warns. \"There can be a long phase before Alzheimer's interferes with our abilities — in some cases, as long as 20 years.\" She emphasizes that there's no excuse for putting off better lifestyle habits, or saying it's too late to make a difference. \"Baby Boomers starting in their 60s can have an important impact on their health for decades.\" \nEven modest increases in physical activity could make a noticeable difference in body and mind. \nUnited Hebrew, a non-sectarian not-for-profit organization serving the aging in Westchester since 1919, works with more than 1,000 clients a day, from its 7.4-acre campus overlooking Long Island Sound. Many are residents of assisted-living facilities or in long-term nursing home care on the grounds. The goal for all is exercise seven days a week. Depending on their abilities and inclinations, they may show up for organized gym classes or dance therapy sessions and come away more aware and alert. \nAs a physical therapist for 23 years, Dr. Nora O'Brien , executive director of the Willow Towers Assisted Living facility on the United Hebrew campus, has witnessed reversal in memory loss in those who increase their activity level. \n\"I see it all the time.\" She notes that the word exercise may be off-putting to some, but more activity of any kind can be beneficial. \"If you have time, don't take the elevator, take the stairs,\" she recommends. \"Park further away from the entrance at the mall. Take the dog out for a walk one more time a day...\" \nAs aware as we think we are of health risks, Baby Boomers by one count have tallied a 25 percent higher rate of obesity than our parents and more than half of us report no regular physical activity at all (3 times worse than the previous generation) — an invitation to future dysfunction. \nBetter lifestyle choices go beyond keeping the perils of Alzheimer's disease at bay. \"There are all sorts of benefits to activity changes,\" Dr. Healy reprises. \"You want to keep moving as much as possible, as long as possible.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/2fg5qGx TOP VIDEOS",

Lakers players have said they'll run through walls for him , that they don't want to disappoint him , and that he's just a really cool, young guy that they can relate to . So it was no surprise to see Walton going one-on-one with the young Lakers bigs in this fantastic video that the team shared from practice.

In the process, he's all up in their faces and slamming the ball on the ground. The Los Angeles Times ' Tania Ganguli reported that none of them scored until Julius Randle's second try, which is the final one-on-one battle in the video above.
