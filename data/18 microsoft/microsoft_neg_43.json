But the cost of its refurbished devices has fallen further since then - and as part of its Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions, buyers can save even more. \nThat may prove particularly appealing to those with the most modest budgets. Since Microsoft discontinued its lower-end Surface 3 tablets , the cheapest new device in its range is the Surface Pro 4, which starts at $899 - although that starting price occasionally drops as low as $749 with the company's regular deals. \nBut you can currently grab a refurbished Surface Pro 4 for as little as $549, or a refurbished Surface Book from $1,059. \nHere's what's on offer in the Surface Pro 4 range : Model \n...and here are the options available in the Surface Book range : Model $600 (24%) Note that the prices listed above for new Surface Book models are promotional deals until November 28. These new models are usually priced at: * $1,499 | ¹ $1,899 | ² $2,099 | ³ $2,699 \nMicrosoft's store listing for the refurbished Surface Book models somewhat overstates the savings that you can expect over a new device. For example, it claims that you'll save $440 on the entry-level Surface Book - but that doesn't take into account that it's currently offering $250 off that brand new model; so in fact, the difference between the new and refurbished models is far smaller, at $190. \nThe additional savings on the refurbished Book and Pro 4 models ends today, November 28 . But even after those deals have ended, the refurbished models will still offer chunky savings compared with the cost of buying brand new. The refurbished entry-level Pro 4, for example, is usually priced $260 (29%) below its new counterpart. \nMicrosoft emphasizes that Certified Refurbished Surface devices \"undergo a rigorous refurbishment process\", adding that each device: is screened and tested to be fully functional. is reloaded with the Windows operating system and software updates. is put through a thorough cleaning process and cosmetic inspection. is repackaged with appropriate manuals, cables, and power cord in a new box. \nAll Certified Refurbished Surface devices include a one-year limited warranty, and buyers have the option of also purchasing an extended two-year warranty, along with accidental damage protection. \nSource: Refurbished Surface Pro 4 / Surface Book (Microsoft Store) Tags",

      "title": "Surface Phone: What It Is & What The Rumors Say",
      "text": "In 2012, Microsoft wasn’t a major player in tablets at all. It’d experimented with touch PCs for years. It’d even created a version of Windows PCs made specifically for tablets. None of its hardware partners were able to create a design that users could get excited about. Apple walked in with its revolutionary iPad design and made the tablet what it is today. In 2012, Microsoft introduced the first Surface tablets to the world. It took the company a few years to get it right, but eventually it did. Now it’s hard to get away from talk of a Surface Phone.\nAdvertisement\nThe Surface Phone is a longtime dream of Microsoft fans that is somewhat based on reality. Microsoft quietly sunset the line of Lumia smartphones that it purchased from Nokia in 2014. Since then, it’s had nothing to compete directly with the iPhone or Google Pixel. Rumors indicate — and fans — believe that a smartphone designed by the same team that handles the Surface tablets might offer a new way to get things done that smartphone buyers could appreciate, maybe even love.\nThe Microsoft Lumia 950.\nA year ago, the Surface Phone seemed like a device that Microsoft never planned to deliver. Today, things have changed. Microsoft’s CEO is discussing exciting new developments for the company in mobile. The Surface Team has proven that it can successfully introduce new types of devices that’ll make technology enthusiasts take notice with the Surface Book, Surface Pro and Surface Studio .\nIt’s actually possible – some even say it’s likely – that Microsoft will release a Surface Phone in the next year. Here’s what we think we know about that mythical device, and why anyone that has an iPhone or Android device right now might want to hear what Microsoft could have to say about the Surface Phone.\nGet an iPad Pro w/ 4G LTE for just $499 (refurb)\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nWhy A Surface Phone? Despite all the confusion around whether Microsoft can or will launch a Surface Phone, one line of speculation has always remained constant. If the Surface Phone does launch, it’ll be because Microsoft’s hardware designers have thought through the things that doomed its Lumia line of smartphones.\nFor all the things that the Lumia offered before they became mainstream, Living Images, integrated wireless charging, sensitive screens with Tap to Wake options, they all were just smartphones trying to compete with the iPhone. Every year, Nokia pumped out a new Lumia that it hoped would address the needs that market research told the company users buying iPhones cared about. The PureView imaging technology and camera app were direct responses to people taking more pictures with their phones than they did their camera, for example. None of these features were enough to overcome the “me too” feeling they gave off.\nAdvertisement\nMicrosoft hardware teams are united around productivity. In an email sent out to employees and leaked by ZDNet back in 2014, CEO Satya Nadella made that mission perfectly clear. “At our core, Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. We will reinvent productivity to empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more.”\nThat line of thinking extends to all of the hardware that Microsoft makes. The Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book aren’t just competitors to the MacBook and the iPad. They also add a new twist to an established product that allow users to get things done.\nSpeaking to the Australian Financial Review , Nadella shared more insight on mobile devices. Specifically, he confirmed that Microsoft will stay in smartphones, but attempt to add something new to the mix.\n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI. We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nWhy You Might Want a Surface Phone So what does the “ultimate mobile device” really mean? Apparently, it means leveraging Microsoft’s only strength in Windows. It’s the only company that offers an almost unified experience for desktops, notebooks, tablets and smartphones.\nZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley reports that Microsoft is hard at work on a technology it’s calling Cobalt. According to sources that have spoken with her, Cobalt will let devices that use typical smartphone processors emulate a processor from a notebook, desktop or tablet. A smartphone using Cobalt could be placed into a dock and used as a desktop PC, complete with programs that only a desktop or notebook can run today.\nThe Surface Studio\nHigh-end smartphones running Windows 10 can pretend to be a desktop PC when connected to a large display. Microsoft calls the feature, Continuum for Phones. It’s been steadily improving it with each software update. When you connect a Lumia 950 or HP Elite X3, you get a desktop, plus mouse capabilities and full screen apps. One thing that you don’t get is access to desktop apps like iTunes. Cobalt, if accurately described by Foley, would fix that.\nAdvertisement\nSuddenly, you could carry just a single device. Imagine a phone that could plug into a notebook dock or a desktop that could become a phone. Syncing would be unnecessary because you’d be carrying around the same device all the time.\nRead: Microsoft Reveals Stunning Windows 10 for Phones Feature\nThe possibilities fit right in with the Surface model. The Surface Pro 4 is the tablet that can replace your laptop. The Surface Book is the notebook that can become a tablet. Why not shouldn’t Microsoft offer a Surface Phone that can replace your notebook or workstation entirely? No other company offers something like that today.\nWhen a Surface Phone Might Arrive When will the Surface Phone launch? That’s what everyone is trying to figure out right now. The truth is that we have no clue.\nTHe HP Elite X3\nMicrosoft has already begun clearing out the last of its Lumia devices. At a hardware event in October, the company didn’t have anything to say about new iPhone alternatives running Windows 10. It did show off the HP Elite X3 though, a phone that includes support for Continuum for Phones.\nAllegedly, Cobalt won’t be ready until the launch of Windows 10 Redstone 3. A free software update to Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. It’s not expected to be detailed until the summer of 2017. Reportedly, Microsoft doesn’t even expect the software upgrade to be ready until the fall. The company is hard at work on Windows 10 Redstone 2, or what we now know as the Windows 10 Creators Update. The Creators Update will launch this upcoming spring.\nIt should be noted that Satya Nadella does have an established history of delaying or killing hardware products that he doesn’t think will be successful in the long run. The Surface Pro 3 was to launch alongside a Surface Mini back in 2014. Nadella killed the device the weekend before its debut, reportedly. Microsoft accidentally confirmed the existence of the device in help documentation that came with early Surface Pro 3 models.",

      "text": "Microsoft Introduces Digital Badges for Certifications and Exams Written by Lucy Black Monday, 28 November 2016 \nMicrosoft has partnered with Acclaim to award badges to MCPs who achieve certain certification or specific exams. These web-enabled digital badges make it easy to share details of skills that is trusted and verifiable. Acclaim, which is a Pearson product, is built on Mozilla Open Badges as an enterprise product with partners including IBM, Oracle and Adobe. Microsoft was one of Acclaim's first partners but has only now announced a the introduction of badges for its Microsoft Certified Professional credentials. \nWhen Mozilla first announced its Open Badges Infrastructure project in 2011 it as a way to enable tech learners to showcase their skills and achievements. It seemed a nice idea but perhaps a bit lightweight, and at the time I commented: As a developer, there is always something new to be learned, so having some recognition, something to show that you've passed another milestone or mastered a new skill is an attractive idea. \nMozilla's aim was: is to provide an infrastructure to standardize the process whereby individual learner collect badges from multiple sources and that this needs to be open and as decentralized as possible to give learners control and to support the entire ecosystem. Certified badge issuers will be allowed to award badges for activities such as after school programs, online learning and job training. The API can then be used so that you can allow users of your web site to display their badges in a \"Badge Backpack\". \nWhen the Open Badges API went into public beta in 2012 we reported : Certified badge issuers will be allowed to award badges for activities such as after school programs, online learning and job training. \nPreviously when Microsoft has issued badges as an incentive for mastering skills in Visual Studio and in Azure it has been in a rather gamified context. Now however it is awarding badges for passing professional exams or earning certifications and has endorsed the idea that digital badges provide individuals with a valued way to be able to promote themselves on social media and their own websites. \nIn answer to the question \" Why is Microsoft offering badges? \", the page states: Microsoft wants to provide you with the tools you need to move forward in your career. Your digital badge allows you to easily share the details of your skills in a way that is trusted and verifiable. Your Microsoft badge empowers you to: \nEasily share your certification online with your professional network. Find out which employers are looking for individuals with your skills. Discover what kind of salary you could expect to earn in a job that requires your Microsoft skills. Search for new job opportunities associated with your certification, and apply in just a few clicks. \nThis video from Acclaim delivers the same message: \nMicrosoft regularly updates its MCP program, introducing new certifications and retiring existing ones and badges seem to be the latest incentive to stick with the program. \nThe blog post on the Microsoft Developer site announcing them also had news of Microsoft Exam Replay - an exam voucher combined with one retake of the same exam in the event that you fail the initial test. You can purchase as many Exam Replays as you wish. \nWhile there still are classroom and on-demand online training courses for exams and exam preparation books, another alternative is to take a Microsoft Official Practice test online and get used to what the exams require that route. The Exam Replay: gives you more options and can help improve your exam odds \nAnd if you succeed you can now claim a badge to share with your professional networks.",

In an emailed statement, Andrew Low Ah Kee, executive vice president at GoDaddy International, said: “Sodhi was instrumental in helping GoDaddy expand its business in India over the past four years. India is a priority market for GoDaddy and we’re excited about the growth opportunities in the region. GoDaddy will be hiring a new managing director in India as the company accelerates its plans to help small businesses throughout the country build powerful digital identities.”\nThe announcement comes as a report has surfaced that GoDaddy is in exclusive talks to acquire Host Europe Group to significantly expand its international footprint.\nEarlier this year, GoDaddy launched its services in Hindi, Marathi, and Tamil to attract Indian small businesses, as part of a move to focus on localizing customer touchpoints, Sodhi said. GoDaddy’s success in India corresponds with internet growth in the country coming from regional hotbeds of small business and entrepreneurial activity. There are 51 million SMBs in India, and 63 percent don’t have their own website.\nSEE ALSO: Millennials are Doing it For Themselves: GoDaddy Report Shows Entrepreneurship Opportunity \nIn May, GoDaddy CTO and VP of its cloud division, Elissa Murphy, left the hosting and domains provider to join Google. \nThis article originally appeared here at The Whir.

      "text": "Microsoft today announced that it has updated its Skype for Business app for iOS such that the app now takes advantage of optional improvements for third-party VoIP calls that Apple introduced in iOS 10 earlier this year. \nFormerly known as Lync 2013, Skype for Business lets people at big companies chat, hold meetings, and make voice and video calls. The iOS version of Skype for Business launched in preview last year. \nBut historically VoIP calling apps, including Messenger, WhatsApp, and the free Skype app — and also the TrueCaller spam call detecting app — have historically not had the same native look and feel of the iPhone’s standard-issue phone app when it comes to incoming calls.\nMicrosoft has http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/28/skype-for-ios-10-lets-you-use-siri-to-make-a-call-and-answer-calls-from-your-lock-screen/”>updated Skype with support for CallKit , Apple’s name for its new iOS 10 VoIP tooling, and now similar optimizations have come to Skype for Business. Once you’re on a Skype for Business call, you can tap on a new Skype for Business button to jump right into the app. But that’s not all.\n“If you are in an important Skype for Business conversation and receive an incoming cellular call, you can send the second call to voicemail or put the Skype for Business call on hold to accept the incoming cellular call. You’ll also see Skype for Business calls in your phone’s call history,” the Skype for Business team wrote in a blog post .\n",

      "text": "on Monday November 28, 2016 @03:40PM from the filtering-stuff dept. Microsoft's Chinese-language AI chat bot filters certain topics, the company confirmed Monday, although it did not clarify whether that included interactions deemed politically sensitive. From a report on Fortune: Last week, CNNMoney and China Digital Times reported that Xiaoice would not directly respond to questions surrounding topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or \"Steamed Bun Xi,\" a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chat bot, according to the report. \"Am I stupid? Once I answer you'd take a screengrab,\" read one answer to a question that contained the words \"topple the Communist Party.\" Even the mention of Donald Trump, the American President-elect, drew an evasive response from the chat bot, according to reports. \"I don't want to talk about it,\" Xiaoice said, reports CNN Money. In response to inquiries from Fortune, Microsoft confirmed that there was some filtering around Xiaoice's interaction . \"We are committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice,\" a Microsoft spokesperson tells Fortune. \"With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.\" The tech giant did not further elaborate to which specific topics the filtering applied.

      "text": "Microsoft releases a new promotional trailer for Dead Rising 4 that introduces a unique and bloody twist to the traditional holiday Yule Log video footage. Though the main rush of AAA game releases for the holiday season may be over at this point, Microsoft is working hard to remind fans that Dead Rising 4 is still right around the corner. The latest entry in the long running franchise is a return to form of sorts, as not only is long time protagonist Frank West back in the leading role, players are also returning to the old stomping grounds of Willamette, Colorado during another outbreak. While previous videos and teasers have shown off the over the top gameplay fans have come to expect, this new trailer aims to get people into the holiday spirit.\nThe 21 minute promotional trailer for Dead Rising 4 puts its own unique and bloody spin on the classic Yule Log video. Traditional videos depict a nice and warm looking fire with wooden logs crackling and keeping the fire lit. The twist in this video is the fact that body parts are roasting instead of the wood. Every now and again, someone throws more on to keep things burning while stoking the fire with a baseball bat adorned with barbed wire and Christmas lights.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, the video also includes zombie sounds and weirdly catchy music clearly inspired by Dead Rising . As odd as this video may be, this isn’t the first time the promotional material has tapped into the holiday theme. The debut trailer which arrived officially at E3 earlier this year was set to Jingle Bell Rock, while Frank West pulverized the undead with handcrafted weapons like a candy cane launcher.\nSimilar to the other games in the series, this fourth installment remains an open world, enabling players to explore the map as they see fit. Unlike previous games however, Capcom Vancouver has removed certain elements such as a story co-op mode and the very divisive time limit. When asked for more details on the time limit removal , studio head Joe Nickolls confirmed that Dead Rising 4 features a detailed open world and the team wants people to explore it thoroughly instead of feeling rushed. Not only that, extensive research showed that the feature just wasn’t well liked.\nEven without a co-op mode for the main campaign, Dead Rising 4 will have multiplayer, including a dedicated co-op mode which seems to toe the line closer to Left 4 Dead or the zombie modes in Call of Duty. For a taste of something different, the season pass also promises an 18 hole minigolf course that up to four players can partake in, featuring an oversized gold ball and undead hordes.\nWill you be storming the streets of Willamette or waiting until it launches on other platforms in the future? Let us know what you’re thinking in the comments.\nDead Rising 4 launches on December 6 for Xbox One and PC.\nSource: Xbox YouTube ",

The $30 purchase price is split between the publisher (2/3) and Apple (1/3). ' \nIt turns out that the App Store is filled with scam apps like this. \nFrom How-To Geek : \nLet’s be blunt: these customers were ripped off, and Apple pocketed $10 each. And you’ll only see these comments if you scroll past the two five star reviews that mention the word “app” numerous times. Both of those reviews, by the way, were left by accounts that haven’t reviewed any other apps in the Store. \nSearch for other Office applications and you’ll find more template bundles, disguised as official applications to varying degrees. \nThere are also several $20+ applications that put Microsoft’s free online version of Office into a dedicated browser. Then there are the actual “apps” capable of opening and editing Office files, many of which use terms like “Microsoft Word” in their names. They appear to be slightly modified versions of open source applications, but we’re not about to buy them to find out. ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIn June, Microsoft launched a promotional deal, offering three free months of service to those who signed up for a month of its Groove Music Pass subscription. Now, it's offering a similar deal - but this time around, it's slightly better. \nPreviously, Microsoft required that you purchase a one-month subscription, priced at $9.99, to qualify for the freebie. This time, Microsoft is offering a free 30-day trial , after which it will send a promo code entitling you to a further three-month subscription free of charge. \nYou'll still have to sign up with a valid credit card, but you can cancel your subscription before it gets charged, unless you want to continue subscribing to Groove Music Pass at the standard rates once the promotional period ends. \nThe offer will remain available until December 31, but Microsoft points out that \"previous Zune, Xbox or Groove Music Pass trial customers are not eligible for this offer\". \nMicrosoft's music subscription service allows users to download songs to up to four devices, as well as streaming to one device at a time. In addition to Windows 10 devices and the web, Groove is also supported on Xbox, Android and iOS devices.",

      "title": "RightScale Compares Pricing on AWS, Google and Microsoft",
      "text": "RightScale Compares Pricing on AWS, Google and Microsoft Cloud management front-end firm RightScale works with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon and compares their discounted pricing. It's always been difficult to compare cloud pricing. The picture has gotten more complex since the cloud's inception because of a proliferation of instance types in each of the Big Three cloud vendors offerings. In addition, each offers its own approach to discounting. \nThe main reason it's been difficult to compare pricing is because the basic units of measure are different – one virtual server is different from another's, as InformationWeek explained in this story in 2012. \nA third party who is in position to compare cloud prices has attempted to do so and publish its findings. RightScale serves as a front-end management platform for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. Many of its customers turn to RightScale to connect their workloads to more than one cloud. As a result, it's had the opportunity to examine the choices in depth. In a blog posted Nov. 28, it summarized some of its long term findings, supported by a set of slides viewable on SlideShare . \n[How one company measured the cost of the cloud. Read First American Cloud Analysis Point To Savings .] \nThe main route to getting a good price in the cloud consists of mastering the details of each suppliers approach to discounting, and understanding which one best applies to the particular task at hand. Amazon Web Services' discount through use of Reserved Instances is well known. The price per hour goes down, the longer the RI commitment, either one or three years, combined with the amount the user is willing to pay upfront. \nA typical RI discount reduces the price per hour from 24% up to 76%, depending on the instance type, whether it's a one or three-year deal and the region in which the RI commitment is made. The size of the discount also depends on whether the customer is willing to pay some of the commitment upfront. \nBut Reserved Instances lock you into a particular virtual server type as well as a time commitment. Did you know AWS now offers convertible RIs, which can start out as one instance type and convert to another before the term of use is up. That's something many seekers of the Reserved Instance savings would like to do, but RightScale warns that convertibles come at a steep price. Instead of getting the steep 3-year discount with a convertible RI, a customer gets 5-6% off the standard 1-year RI price but the term of use is still for a full three-years. Most AWS customers would find their computing needs change over that time period. A conservative estimate of those servers deemed to be sure to be running three-years hence is the right group with which to pursue the steepest RI discount, and the best discount avoided in other cases, the RightScale blog said. \n\"Your usage may change drastically over 3 years... We recommend caution in purchasing three-year RIs,\" the RightScale blog said. \nOne example, 3 years vs 1 year \nIf a typical one-year RI discount for a certain instance were 24%, then the convertible, three-year RI instance would amount to another 5-6% off or 29-30% for a three year contract. Instead of that option, consider \"as a starting point\" a one-year reserved instance, with no down payment up front. RightScale used that option for purposes of comparison with other cloud discounts. \nA general purpose computing virtual server, the m3.large, located in the US East region of Northern Virginia, would be priced as a straight forward, on-demand instance at $.133 an hour. As a 1-year reserved instance, with no upfront payment, it would be priced at $.095 an hour or a 29% discount off the on-demand instance. As a 1-year RI with a partial upfront payment, it would be priced at $.083 or a 38% discount. As a 1-year RI with full upfront payment, it would be priced at $.081 or a 39% discount. \nFor purposes of illustration, the three-year RI of the m3.large, requires at least a partial upfront payment, yielding a price of $.056 and a discount of 58% off the on-demand instance or a full upfront payment yielding a price of $.052 and a discount of 61%. \nGetting the compute instance priced right is important because it represents 75-80% of what enterprises spend in the cloud, regardless of which vendor they choose, as RightScale cited in a previous study discussed here . \nThe Google and Microsoft stories \nHere's how Google and Microsoft discounting works. \nMicrosoft Azure offers enterprise discounts from 15-45%, based on customer's level of usage and length of commitment. RightScale selected 30% as the midpoint and used it in comparisons. \nUnlike AWS and Google, Microsoft always includes solid state disk with its instances, while at AWS it's ordered by the customer for a fee. SSDs are not included by customer choice or otherwise in the Google cloud; they're simply not available. Keep that in mind when looking at Microsoft pricing, particularly if the SSD adds value to your virtual machine. \nGoogle Cloud offers Sustained Usage Discount or SUD, which requires no upfront commitment. In the Amazon examples, the instances were presumed to be running 24 hours a day. Google will implement a discount automatically once an instance has run for 25% of the month, the price goes down to 80% of the regular on-demand price. The 20% discount is doubled to 40% when the instance has been running 50% of the month. For an instance that runs continuously, the discount will amount to 30% of the initial on-demand price, without the customer needing to make a series of instance type decisions and place an order, as with AWS. \nRightScale called Google SUD \"the simplest approach\" to discounting. \nOne Year Costs, Head to Head to Head \nThe closest RightScale could come to comparing comparable cloud resources was to look at the cost for one year for a general purpose virtual server on each supplier. For AWS it was the m3.large Reserved Instance; on Microsoft Azure, it was a D2v2 instance; on Google Compute Engine, an n1-standard-2 instance, with discounts applied in each case. \nThe comparison showed a one-year cost of $832.20 for AWS, $699.05 for Azure and $1,594.20 for Google. \nRightScale went on to do additional comparisons with results that sometimes favored AWS or Google, depending on the configuration. \nWhen SSDs had no value to the workload, then the comparison tended to favor Google; indeed it was the lowest price for five the scenarios that the RightScale authors conceived. But it was also the highest price for seven of them. When an SSD was needed, then customers had to add on a 375 GB SSD and pay the accompanying fee. When no discounts were applied, however, Google often came out as the lowest priced supplier, an approach that might reflect its focus on and popularity with young companies and startups less likely to plotting three-year contracts. Also, don't forget Google charges by the minute and doesn't round up to the next hour after 15 minutes of use, the way Amazon does. \nAzure was the lowest price for seven scenarios, the highest price for two. Azure tended to match or be lower than AWS, except in one of the workload example constructed by the authors. \nAmazon was the lowest price for one workload example, the highest for four, and most frequently was somewhere in between Azure and Google. \nTo inspect the specifics of each comparison, visit the RightScale blog . It was authored by Brian Adler, director of enterprise architecture at RightScale, and Kim Weins, VP of marketing. There's also this cloud comparison tool available on the RightScale site.  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Phone will be the ‘ultimate mobile device’: Satya Nadella",
      "text": "Microsoft is not giving up on its Windows phone. Far from it. The software giant has ambitions to build the “ultimate mobile device.”\nCEO Satya Nadella, the man widely credited with turning around Microsoft after a bruising period under Steve Ballmer, is addressing the mobile phone after early attention to the company’s cloud computing business and the Surface hybrid tablet.\n\n“We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,” he told the Australian Financial Review in an interview.\nOf course, nobody really knows exactly what the mobile of the future might be, or indeed what the ultimate mobile device might do.\n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” he added.\nThe Indian-born Nadella is widely expected to parlay the relative success of the Surface hybrid tablet – which has won favorable comparisons with the like of the MacBook Pro – on to a mobile phone.\nMicrosoft’s slipping mobile sales Microsoft remains a marginal player in the mobile phone, dominated by Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems. It has taken additional hits this year. For the first time, the market share of its Windows phone dropped below 1%, from 2.5% in the first quarter of 2015. According to Gartner, Microsoft’s share slipped to 0.7 percent but that’s still nearly 10 million phones.\nUnder Ballmer, Microsoft made its biggest play yet in the mobile phone market by buying Nokia’s handset business for $7.6 billion. But that gamble failed. Last year, Nadella wrote off that investment.\nWith Nokia assets, “we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of,” he told Australian Financial Review during a visit to Sydney for a developers conference.\nNadella reiterated Microsoft’s commitment to innovate.\n“I mean, take even Surface. Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it’s not a refrigerator and a toaster but it’s actually a two-in-one.”\nNadella, who took the helm of Microsoft in early 2014, has won the confidence of technologists and investors. He was recently featured on the cover of Fortune magazine as the man who is “transforming Microsoft.”\nUnder his leadership, the Microsoft stock has hit an all-time high, bettering a 1999 record of $59.96 per share. That surge came after the company in October reported upbeat first-quarter results including a more-than-doubling of its cloud business. Since then, the company has released the new upgraded Surface Book, which has beaten the new MacBook Pro notably in gaming.\n \nThe post Microsoft Surface Phone will be the ‘ultimate mobile device’: Satya Nadella appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/555631 http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password-recovery.html \nI keep reading your summary and I just don't get it. Are you scared of data loss if the password is changed? Not to be demeaning, but your the administrator. This should be an easy task. If the fear of data loss is your main concern, back up your developers data (it should have already been done, either by him or you). I understand the fear of data loss but in my experiences all that happens is that the user's home directory might go kapoot . Can you give more details on your setup. Why do you believe the approach of giving him admin is the best way? Just save the data, do what you need to do, and that's it. Like Nike, just do it. But if you wanna go the hard way. Click Win + R to open Run dialog, input regedit command and click OK to enter registry setting surface of Windows 8 Modify HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Current Version\\Winlogon Right-click and create a new string value, rename value name as AutoAdminlogon Find DefaultUserName, set it as the default user name to sign in Windows. And create string value DefaultPassword, set the value as the password of the default Windows login user. \nMore Ways Get his password via Windows Password Hint \nWhen we are creating our Windows system account and login password, a password hint will be asked to set up for preparation. This password hint had better can remind you, only just you of lost or forgotten password. So it couldn’t like the password, but is related to your login password. As a result, while you type a wrong password, the password hint will pops up below the password input box. Based on the password hint, you can think of your origin password. \nAs seen above, my password hint is email xxx@xx.com, and my Windows 8 login password is the same as the password of email. So when the password hint pops up, I will think of Windows login password instantly. Get into computer with PIN code, and reset password for locked account \nPIN code is a quick, convenient way to sign in to this PC by using a 4-digit code. If you have ever created one, this may be the most simplest and effective method for Windows 8 password reset. Totally two steps are needed. \nStep 1: Sign in with PIN code When you forgot your local account password in the login page, sign-in options is provided for you to choose. Click the Sign-in options, there are two options, Password and PIN. Choose PIN, and input 4-digit code in the box. Then you can sign in to your computer successfully. \nStep 2: Press Windows +X, and click on Command Prompt (Admin) and Yes. \nStep 3: On the Command Prompt, type in: Net User user name new password and press Enter to reset a new password for Windows 8. \nCommand Prompt screen appears, input the words like the words in the red box, user name is devloper, new password is 34567, and then press Enter to complete the Windows password reset process. Login windows 8 Via Microsoft MSN Account \nIf your computer has set up to sign in to Windows 8 with Microsoft account, and you can login Windows with it, and create a PIN that any user who has a password must enter it when waking this PC, and then login with PIN code, reset password with Command Prompt.",

      "title": "RightScale Compares Pricing on AWS, Google and Microsoft",
      "text": "It's always been difficult to compare cloud pricing. The picture has gotten more complex since the cloud's inception because of a proliferation of instance types in each of the Big Three cloud vendors offerings. In addition, each offers its own approach to discounting.\nThe main reason it's been difficult to compare pricing is because the basic units of measure are different – one virtual server is different from another's, as InformationWeek explained in this story in 2012.\nA third party who is in position to compare cloud prices has attempted to do so and publish its findings. RightScale serves as a front-end management platform for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. Many of its customers turn to RightScale to connect their workloads to more than one cloud. As a result, it's had the opportunity to examine the choices in depth. In a blog posted Nov. 28, it summarized some of its long term findings, supported by a set of slides viewable on SlideShare .\n[How one company measured the cost of the cloud. Read First American Cloud Analysis Point To Savings .]\nThe main route to getting a good price in the cloud consists of mastering the details of each suppliers approach to discounting, and understanding which one best applies to the particular task at hand. Amazon Web Services' discount through use of Reserved Instances is well known. The price per hour goes down, the longer the RI commitment, either one or three years, combined with the amount the user is willing to pay upfront.\nA typical RI discount reduces the price per hour from 24% up to 76%, depending on the instance type, whether it's a one or three-year deal and the region in which the RI commitment is made. The size of the discount also depends on whether the customer is willing to pay some of the commitment upfront.\nBut Reserved Instances lock you into a particular virtual server type as well as a time commitment. Did you know AWS now offers convertible RIs, which can start out as one instance type and convert to another before the term of use is up. That's something many seekers of the Reserved Instance savings would like to do, but RightScale warns that convertibles come at a steep price. Instead of getting the steep 3-year discount with a convertible RI, a customer gets 5-6% off the standard 1-year RI price but the term of use is still for a full three-years. Most AWS customers would find their computing needs change over that time period. A conservative estimate of those servers deemed to be sure to be running three-years hence is the right group with which to pursue the steepest RI discount, and the best discount avoided in other cases, the RightScale blog said.\n\"Your usage may change drastically over 3 years... We recommend caution in purchasing three-year RIs,\" the RightScale blog said.\nOne example, 3 years vs 1 year\nIf a typical one-year RI discount for a certain instance were 24%, then the convertible, three-year RI instance would amount to another 5-6% off or 29-30% for a three year contract. Instead of that option, consider \"as a starting point\" a one-year reserved instance, with no down payment up front. RightScale used that option for purposes of comparison with other cloud discounts.\nA general purpose computing virtual server, the m3.large, located in the US East region of Northern Virginia, would be priced as a straight forward, on-demand instance at $.133 an hour. As a 1-year reserved instance, with no upfront payment, it would be priced at $.095 an hour or a 29% discount off the on-demand instance. As a 1-year RI with a partial upfront payment, it would be priced at $.083 or a 38% discount. As a 1-year RI with full upfront payment, it would be priced at $.081 or a 39% discount.\nFor purposes of illustration, the three-year RI of the m3.large, requires at least a partial upfront payment, yielding a price of $.056 and a discount of 58% off the on-demand instance or a full upfront payment yielding a price of $.052 and a discount of 61%.\nGetting the compute instance priced right is important because it represents 75-80% of what enterprises spend in the cloud, regardless of which vendor they choose, as RightScale cited in a previous study discussed here .\nThe Google and Microsoft stories\nHere's how Google and Microsoft discounting works.\nMicrosoft Azure offers enterprise discounts from 15-45%, based on customer's level of usage and length of commitment. RightScale selected 30% as the midpoint and used it in comparisons.\nUnlike AWS and Google, Microsoft always includes solid state disk with its instances, while at AWS it's ordered by the customer for a fee. SSDs are not included by customer choice or otherwise in the Google cloud; they're simply not available. Keep that in mind when looking at Microsoft pricing, particularly if the SSD adds value to your virtual machine.\nGoogle Cloud offers Sustained Usage Discount or SUD, which requires no upfront commitment. In the Amazon examples, the instances were presumed to be running 24 hours a day. Google will implement a discount automatically once an instance has run for 25% of the month, the price goes down to 80% of the regular on-demand price. The 20% discount is doubled to 40% when the instance has been running 50% of the month. For an instance that runs continuously, the discount will amount to 30% of the initial on-demand price, without the customer needing to make a series of instance type decisions and place an order, as with AWS.\nRightScale called Google SUD \"the simplest approach\" to discounting.\nOne Year Costs, Head to Head to Head\nThe closest RightScale could come to comparing comparable cloud resources was to look at the cost for one year for a general purpose virtual server on each supplier. For AWS it was the m3.large Reserved Instance; on Microsoft Azure, it was a D2v2 instance; on Google Compute Engine, an n1-standard-2 instance, with discounts applied in each case.\nThe comparison showed a one-year cost of $832.20 for AWS, $699.05 for Azure and $1,594.20 for Google.\nRightScale went on to do additional comparisons with results that sometimes favored AWS or Google, depending on the configuration.\nWhen SSDs had no value to the workload, then the comparison tended to favor Google; indeed it was the lowest price for five the scenarios that the RightScale authors conceived. But it was also the highest price for seven of them. When an SSD was needed, then customers had to add on a 375 GB SSD and pay the accompanying fee. When no discounts were applied, however, Google often came out as the lowest priced supplier, an approach that might reflect its focus on and popularity with young companies and startups less likely to plotting three-year contracts. Also, don't forget Google charges by the minute and doesn't round up to the next hour after 15 minutes of use, the way Amazon does.\nAzure was the lowest price for seven scenarios, the highest price for two. Azure tended to match or be lower than AWS, except in one of the workload example constructed by the authors.\nAmazon was the lowest price for one workload example, the highest for four, and most frequently was somewhere in between Azure and Google.\nTo inspect the specifics of each comparison, visit the RightScale blog . It was authored by Brian Adler, director of enterprise architecture at RightScale, and Kim Weins, VP of marketing.

      "title": "RightScale Compares Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure And Google Cloud Pricing",
      "text": "last » \nWith the increasing number and sophistication of cloud instance types and pricing options, it can be painfully difficult to compare costs from the three largest public cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform—in an apples-to-apples fashion. \nRightScale released a study Monday attempting that feat. The cloud management vendor, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., found in its latest survey of the market that for most standard use cases – those not requiring special instance types – Google Cloud comes in cheaper than AWS and Azure. \nAt the same time, Google charges a premium for solid state storage, making it typically more expensive than its hyper-scale competitors for that advanced option. \n[Related: RightScale 2016 State Of The Cloud Report: A Look Inside The DevOps Revolution ] \nThe author of the RightScale report, Vice President of Marketing Kim Weins, noted that ultimately it’s the use case that drives pricing and determines which provider is most cost-effective. \nCompute resources constitute three-quarters or more of a typical cloud spend, Weins said, and to thoroughly compare those it's necessary to understand the special pricing plans that have a major impact on actual bills, according to Weins. \n\"Before you can accurately compare compute prices, it’s critical that you understand the discount methods for each of the cloud providers since that will be a major driver in the price you pay,\" Weins said. \nWhen it comes to offering special plans, Google is an outlier in that its Sustained Usage Discount (SUD) is applied automatically, requiring no upfront commitment from the customer. The SUD deducts costs from the monthly bill based on the time during that period when specific instance types were running. \nBecause Google discounts automatically, customer strategy leans more heavily on the approach to realizing savings from AWS and Azure. \nMicrosoft's primary discounting vehicle is an Enterprise Agreement, which delivers an up to 45 percent price reduction on committed use (RightScale used a 30 percent midpoint when calculating Azure results). \nWith AWS, reserved instances, which essentially are coupons that come with one- or three-year contracts, deliver 24 to 75 percent savings.

With all those dining food and drink options and 44,000 employees on campus, one might assume that Microsoft is sending huge amounts of waste to landfills. Not so.\nThe software giant on Monday announced that its Redmond campus has received the US Zero Waste Business Council's highest certification, the first technology company in the country to achieve this benchmark. The Gold Level of Zero Waste Certification recognizes facilities that divert at least 90 percent of food, office, and construction waste away from landfills, something Microsoft accomplishes via employee-driven reuse, recycling, and composting programs as well as sustainable community partnerships.\nBetween July and December of 2015, 189 million pounds of food, packaging, and other dining-related items went through Microsoft's Redmond campus. But 99.5 percent never made it to a landfill, the company said.",

      "text": "It started out in 2005 as a day of online shopping – from your desk at work – on the Monday following the Thanksgiving weekend. From then, it has grown from a day of hoping the boss doesn’t catch you as you sneak a bargain, to a full week or more of deals on TVs, computers, toys and tech.\nHere are a few of the most popular deals from online and brick-and-mortar stores.\nOverall discounts\n• Kohls is offering a 20 percent discount on in-store and online purchases from Nov. 26-30.

      "text": "Home > Cloud > Microsoft Debunks Top Cloud Myths of 2016 Microsoft Debunks Top Cloud Myths of 2016 Comments 0 Advertisement \nJulia White, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President for Azure and Security, took to the Microsoft Azure official blog today in an effort to debunk several myth's surrounding the use of cloud services in organizations. \"Public cloud is not just past the tipping point, it’s now mainstream. Yet, in talking to customers, a few common misconceptions about the cloud persist. As we head toward the new year, I believe it’s important to surface and dispel some of the top cloud myths we’ve seen to address the concerns business and IT decision makers have when it comes to the cloud.\" \nThe six items she discusses range in subjects from single source cloud vendors, security, efficiency and innovation, hybrid cloud, vendor lock in and risks to innovation and intellectual properties. \nHere is a rundown of the six areas she covers: Myth No. 1: Enterprises need only one cloud vendor \nEnterprises have diverse needs when it comes to cloud apps, data analytics, development, management, and security. Belief that one cloud can meet all these diverse needs is simply out of touch with reality. While it is easy to believe this for SaaS technology across productivity and business applications, it is just as true for IaaS and PaaS cloud technology. Different business groups have different needs and often turn to two or sometimes three cloud providers to take advantage of differentiated capabilities. Multi-cloud management solutions, as well as open development tools and platforms, are proof that we have moved beyond the period of concerns around vendor lock-in and are instead addressing the needs of IT and developers to manage updates and monitor security across multiple clouds and develop on the platform and with the tools they prefer. Myth No. 2: Cloud security is riskier than on-premises \nFundamentally, maintaining cybersecurity is about staying multiple steps ahead of the hackers. A public cloud provider has the investment resources to deploy and maintain state-of-the-art security technology, and employ the world’s leaders in cybersecurity. Additionally, with massive cloud scale and broad geographical presence comes the ability to detect emerging threats quickly and address issues before they gain traction. Beyond security, ensuring compliance with global, local, and industry regulation is a significant burden to individual companies. When organizations turn to a global cloud provider, they are inheriting the compliance certifications and standards work already put in place for organizations around the globe. Across both security and compliance, global public cloud providers are able to invest massive amounts of resources that exceeds what any one individual organization can realistically deploy. Not all cloud vendors deploy resources equally, however, so it is still important to understand and complete due-diligence on security and compliance standards of any public cloud provider you are considering. Myth No 3: The main benefit of public cloud is efficiency, more than innovation \nUtilizing public cloud infrastructure (IaaS) enables cost reduction and more rapid app deployment with the ability to instantly tap into essentially unlimited infrastructure capacity. It is easy to view the economy of scale benefits as the central cloud benefit. Because IaaS continues to carry forward some of the traditional IT overhead of infrastructure management and security, it can limit speed of innovation. Platform services enable developers to focus entirely on application development rather than infrastructure management and maintenance. Fully unlocking the cloud promise means using a combination of cloud infrastructure and platform services – often times in concert. Using IaaS is a great first step in cloud adoption, but also taking advantage of the managed services and serverless compute technologies enable greater innovation as well as developer and IT productivity. Services such as machine learning, cognitive services, IoT, mobile app development, microservices, and event-driven functions are fueling incredible new innovation and business transformation. Myth No. 4: Hybrid cloud is the connection of public and private clouds \nFor most companies, hybrid cloud is a reality, and it’s here to stay versus just being a transitory state. Recognizing that hybrid is a steady state, not a transition state, is why hybrid cannot just be a network connection between public and private clouds, but a consistent end user, IT management & security, and app development experience across public and private clouds. Hybrid consistency goes beyond network connectivity and the ability to “lift and shift” virtual machines, but truly providing the IT professional, developer, and end user experiences that don’t change based on the location of the app or resource. Consistency across a hybrid cloud environment enables uniform development, unified dev-ops and management, common identity and security, and seamless extension of existing applications and infrastructure to the cloud. Without this consistency, hybrid cloud just means dealing with two different environments for the long term. Myth No. 5: Public cloud leads to vendor lock-in \nCloud infrastructure and app development capabilities generally support all platforms and development languages. Historically, developers have been bound by the languages they code in for specific platforms. With more cloud vendors broadly supporting open-source and also frequently open-sourcing their technology it’s making it easier to build for any cloud, language, and OS. As such, developers are getting closer to the state developing in the language they want and deployment on any platform. Further, container technology supported by cloud providers enables app portability. Myth No. 6: Open cloud development is a risk to innovation and intellectual property \nOne of the great benefits of the cloud is providing an environment to test ideas quickly. As more organizations embrace agile development in the cloud, they need to feel empowered to choose the right tools and code to do the job. Increasingly, that code is coming from the open source community. Nine in 10 (91 percent) of IT workers state that for them to be satisfied at work, it is important that they work for an organization that allows them to use open source technologies (source: IT Pro Cloud Survey). Open-sourcing select projects is just one step toward earning the trust and respect of developers and their customers. Cloud providers need to embrace open source as a key component of their own development cycles as well as their customers’ technology infrastructure. This means looking for technologies that can be developed and maintained in partnership with the open source community. Vendors should be openly developing and collaborating with the open source community, while also offering regular contributions to community projects. They should also be actively participating in GitHub projects, helping to set standards with organizations such as The Linux Foundation, and engaging with the community on forums. \nSo do you agree or disagree with Julia's take on these six myth's? \nYou can learn more about Microsoft Azure at the companies Azure portal . \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "Throughout November, I plan to release details on vulnerabilities Ifound in web-browsers which I've not released before. This is theeighteenth entry in that series. Unfortunately I won't be able topublish everything within one month at the current rate, so I maycontinue to publish these through December and January.The below information is available in more detail on my blog athttp://blog.skylined.nl/20161124001.html. There you can find a reprothat triggered this issue, reversed snippets from the vulnerable codeand more details in addition to the information below.Follow me on http://twitter.com/berendjanwever for daily browser bugs.MSIE 11 MSHTML CGeneratedContent::HasGeneratedSVGMarker type confusion (The fix and CVE number for this issue are unknown)SynopsisA specially crafted web-page can cause a type confusion in HTML layoutin Microsoft Internet Explorer 11. An attacker might be able to exploitthis issue to execute arbitrary code.Known affected software and attack vectors An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.DescriptionInternally MSIE uses various lists of linked `CTreePos` objects torepresent the DOM tree. For HTML/SVG elements a `CTreeNode` element iscreated, which embeds two `CTreePos` instances: one that containsinformation about the first child of the element and one that indicatesthe next sibling or parent of the element. For text nodes an objectcontaining only one `CTreePos` is created, as such nodes never have anychildren. `CTreePos` instances have various flags set. This includes aflag that indicates if they are the first (`fTPBegin`) or second(`fTPEnd`) `CTreePos` instance for an element, or the only instance fora test node (`fTPText`).The `CTreePos::Branch` method of an `CTreePos` instance embedded in a`CTreeNode` can be used to calculate a pointer to the `CTreeNode`. Itdetermines if the `CTreePos` instance is the first or second in the`CTreeNode` by looking at the `fTPBegin` flag and subtract the offset ofthis `CTreePos` object in a `CTreeNode` object to calculate the addressof the later. This method assumes that the `CTreePos` instance is partof a `CTreeNode` and not a `TextNode`. It will yield invalid resultswhen called on the later. In a `TextNode`, the `CTreePos` does not havethe `fTPBegin` flag set, so the code assumes this is the second`CTreePos` instance in a `CTreeNode` object and subtracts 0x24 from itsaddress to calculate the address of the `CTreeNode`. Since the`CTreePos` instance is the first element in a `TextNode`, the returnedaddress will be 0x24 bytes before the `TextNode`, pointing to memorythat is not part of the object.Note that this behavior is very similar to another issue I found aroundthe same time, in that that issues also caused the code to access memory0x24 bytes before the start of a memory region containing an object.Looking back I believe that both issues may have had the same root causeand were fixed at the same time. You can find more details about thatother issue in my blog post here:http://blog.skylined.nl/20161104001.htmlThe `CGeneratedContent::HasGeneratedSVGMarker` method walks the DOMusing one of the `CTreePos` linked lists. It looks for any descendantnode of an element that has a `CTreePos` instance with a specific flagset. If found, the `CTreePos::Branch` method is called to find therelated `CTreeNode`, without checking if the `CTreePos` is indeed partof a `CTreeNode`. If a certain flag is set on this `CTreeNode`, itreturns true. Otherwise it continues scanning. If nothing is found, itreturns false.The repro creates a situation where the`CGeneratedContent::HasGeneratedSVGMarker` method is called on an SVGpath element which has a `TextNode` instance as a descendant with theright flags set to cause it to call `CTreePos::Branch` on this`TextNode`. This leads to type confusion/a bad cast where a pointer thatpoints before a `TextNode` is used as a pointer to a `CTreeNode`.Exploit--",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo To go along with its budding Surface line of computers, Microsoft is reportedly ready to move forward with a Surface Phone. It manufacturing partner, Pegatron, is reportedly ready to begin trial production.\nAccording to Commercial Times , Pegatron has been working closely with Microsoft on the Surface Phone and is now ready to move forward with a possible release date for 2017.\nRumors of the Surface Phone caught fire a few weeks back when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company was committed to creating the “the ultimate mobile device.” Today’s new rumor reignites a long-gestated myth about Microsoft making a Surface-branded smartphone.\nOther than murmurs about production on a Surface Phone starting next year, few other details are known about Microsoft’s mysterious device.\nWill the Surface Phone be a success? Microsoft’s alleged move into mobile phones is rather confusing. It tried for years to push Windows Phone, even going as far as purchasing Nokia’s mobile division , but that fizzled out. It’s hard to see why next year would be any different with iOS and Android dominating the market, even with a premium phone that mirrors the design of the Surface computers.\nWith the iPhone’s tenth anniversary set for next year, Microsoft couldn’t have picked a more challenging time to announce an alleged Surface Phone. However, if its anything like its Surface line of computers, consumers might finally have a reason to jump ship from Android and iOS.\n\n\nSource : Commercial Times \nVia : Digitimes ",

      "text": "Q & A J D Biersdorfer,Nov 28, 2016, INYT Q: Microsoft hasn’t updated Windows Movie Maker in years. I have it on my Windows 10 PC from when I upgraded the computer from Windows 8, but will there ever be a proper app version for Windows 10?\nWindows Movie Maker has been around for more than 15 years, but it has not been updated since the version that was included with the Windows Essentials 2012 software suite. The program is still available for download from Microsoft’s site for some versions of Windows, but not for much longer: The company says it will stop supporting the software on January 10.\nThe same page of release notes for Windows Essentials 2012 also says Movie Maker will soon be available from the Windows Store for Windows 10 users. At the moment, however, the Windows Store has Microsoft’s Movie Moments app for 60-second creations and several similarly named moviemaking apps, but no new edition from Microsoft — yet.\nIf you do not want to use the outdated version of Windows Movie Maker and do not see any apps in the Windows Store that fit your needs, you can find several open-source video-editing programs and alternative applications for Windows around the web. Free editing programs save money, but they may require more expertise to install and may not include dedicated technical support (aside from web documentation). Some free apps may also be ad-supported.\nCommercial video-editing tools for Windows can cost hundreds of dollars, but several consumer-oriented programs cost much less. For example, the standard edition of Pinnacle Studio 20 has a regular price of $60 (Rs 4,107) (with slightly more expensive versions that include more features). Adobe Premiere Elements 15 costs around $100 (Rs 6,846). You can also download a free trial version from Adobe’s site first. Magix Movie Edit Pro, normally $120 (Rs 8,215), is on sale for $50 (Rs 3,423) until the end of the month.\nQ: I thought Twitter already allowed you to mute people who were being obnoxious online, so what exactly have they done that is supposed to make it easier to fight abuse now?\nTwitter has had a mute function since 2014 that lets you filter out a particular user account from your timeline without blocking or unfollowing that account.\nRecently, Twitter went a bit further with the mute function and announced on its company blog that people could now use the tool to filter out specific keywords, phrases, hashtags, emoji characters and even entire conversations from account notifications that come by email, text or app alerts. (The new mute powers work only within notifications, however, and the original tweets will still be visible in your timeline or by searching.)\nTo mute words or phrases in the Android Twitter app, tap the bell-shaped Notifications icon, and on the Notifications screen, tap All. Select the Notifications Settings icon in the corner. On the next screen, Tap Muted Words and then the plus icon. Enter the hashtags, words and other material you do not wish to see in your notifications and tap Save.\nIn the iOS Twitter app, tap the Notifications icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap the gear icon in the top-left corner. Select Muted Words on the next screen and tap “+Add muted word or phrase” so you can make your list. When you are finished, tap Save and then Done.\nYou can also build a muted-words list on your account page at twitter.com. From the menu under your profile photo at the top, select Settings, then Notifications and finally “Mute specific words from your notifications.”\nThe article “Advanced Muting Options on Twitter,” in the site’s Help Center, explains how to set up your list of words and other content to filter out of your notifications. If you change your mind, you can also unmute the same words by returning to your settings.",

      "text": "by IWB · November 28, 2016 Microsoft’s MSFT 0.13% Chinese-language AI chat bot filters certain topics, the company confirmed Monday, although it did not clarify whether that included interactions deemed politically sensitive. Last week, CNNMoney and China Digital Times reported that Xiaoice would not directly respond to questions surrounding topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or “Steamed Bun Xi,” a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chat bot, according to the report. “Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a screengrab,” read one answer to a question that contained the words “topple the Communist Party.”",

Microsoft today announced that Azure DevTest Labs now comes with the ability to create your environments using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.\nARM templates are loaded directly from your source control repository (GitHub or VSTS Git). Once set up, DevTest Labs users can create an environment by simply picking an ARM template from the Azure portal as what they can do with other types of bases. Azure PaaS resources can be provisioned in an environment from ARM template in addition to IaasS VMs. Cost of environments can be tracked in the lab in addition to individual VMs created by other types of bases.

The stock generated a return of 9.10% as compared with the Zacks Computer-Software Industry’s year-to-date return of 10.17%.\nThe upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth.

      "text": "The SuperSite for Windows 10 How To Collection: Troubleshooting tips \n\nLast week Microsoft announced that Cortana had been giving a new skill for creating and editing to do lists on your compatible devices. \nI spent some time this morning trying out this new capability and found some key phrases that you can either speak to Cortana or type to build and edit to do lists using the digital assistant. \nHere are the phrases I have discovered so far: Create a To Do list . Add Grab Screenshots to my To Do list. Show my To Do list . View my To Do list. \nJust replace the italicized/bold text with your task or the name of your to do list. \nI was unable to discover a voice/typed command for deleting a current list however, once you retrieve one of your lists you can edit entries for that list or mark items as complete. \nThere was also no Interest category in Cortana's Notebook for tracking/working with these new lists either. \nAs you will see in the screenshots, many times when you ask or type the needed command to work with your lists it is not the top result. That means you need to select the right entry in the results to take that action - otherwise you end up searching on the Internet for that phrase. \nHowever, there is an option to do more robust list keeping activities. Microsoft has incorporated the Wunderlist Windows 10 app into this skill and it is very easy to sign up for a Wunderlist account using your Microsoft Account to add that additional functionality. \nThese screenshots will show you how Cortana interacts with the above commands and show you what steps are needed to sign up for that Wunderslist account. \nBe sure to also check out our App Tour of Wunderlist .",

      "text": "Azure updates include cloud-based disaster recovery support for the company's latest server OS, deeper cloud application insights and a new way to set up DevTest Labs environments. Customers of Microsoft's cloud-based disaster recovery offering can now recover Windows Server 2016 workloads to Azure or another data center, the company announced today. \"Customers can now use Azure Site Recovery to replicate, protect (or migrate) their Hyper-V virtual machines hosted on a Windows Server 2016 to Azure or to a secondary site,\" wrote Microsoft program manager Rajani Janaki Ram in a Nov. 28 blog post. \"This week, we are announcing Azure Site Recovery's support for protection [and] replication of virtual machines deployed\" in select configurations detailed in the blog . For example, Azure Site Recovery now supports replicating Hyper-V sites containing Windows Server 2016 hosts to Azure from local Hyper-V virtual machines (without Virtual Machine Manager). The company plans to extend support to Hyper-V sites with Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts in a future update. Microsoft also announced today the preview release of two new diagnostics capabilities for its cloud application performance management analytics offering called Azure Application Insights (formerly Visual Studio Application Insights). First, the new Application Insights Profiler enables users to uncover the causes of application slow-downs.\"The new Application Insights Profiler runs with low overhead and will periodically enable profiling on your production service and collect detailed examples of performance traces for your application when something interesting happens,\" said Dan Taylor, a senior program manager at Microsoft Azure Tools, in a Nov. 28 announcement. \"This means you'll have examples of interesting issues with detailed profiles (code-level breakdown of request execution time) for a range of issues and you’ll have the details you need to pinpoint where time is spent.\"In addition, the Application Map has been updated to display multiple components and the calls between them on the same map. Clicking on a component now displays a new error pane that provides a summary of top errors, allowing users to drill down further for more detailed information. Meanwhile, Azure DevTest Labs, Microsoft's cloud-based development testing solution, now supports Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, enabling users to better provision and manage multi-virtual-machine environments like SharePoint farms and multi-tier web applications. ARM templates can be loaded from source control repositories like GitHub or Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Git, explained Xiaoying Guo, senior program manager at Microsoft Azure DevTest Labs. Over at Azure Media Services, a suite of media-streaming cloud services, Microsoft recently announced that the company is switching to a new encoding pricing model in the new year. \"For the Standard Encoder and Premium Encoder, we will be calculating usage based on the total duration of the media files produced as output by the encoder,\" stated Anil Murching, a senior program Manager at Microsoft Azure Media Services, in a Nov. 23 announcement. The company is also lowering rates on Media Reserved Units used for processing videos concurrently. Examples on how to calculate the cost of encoding workloads under the new pricing model are available in this blog post .",

References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or Steamed Bun Xi, a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chat bot, according to the report. \nAm I stupid? Once I answer youd take a screengrab, read one answer to a question that contained the words topple the Communist Party. \nEven the mention of Donald Trump, the American President-elect, drew an evasive response from the chat bot, according to reports. I dont want to talk about it, Xiaoice said, reports CNN Money.

As can be expected from the title, the content takes things into snowy territory as we head into the Alpine mountains for the first time. \nAlong with the new setting comes the addition of several new vehicles that can be used in over 50 new events that were specifically designed for this new DLC. New race types include the likes of Hill Climb and Descent, along with new Bucket List, Blueprint, and Rival events. \nFor you achievement hunters out there, the DLC includes 28 achievements that add up to 500 points. Also, you will be able to use your current vehicles and upgrade them to snow variants. \nThe following is the list of new vehicles coming in the DLC: 2016 Ford GYMKHANA 9 Focus RS RX 1965 Ford F-100 Flareside Abatti Racing Trophy Truck 1975 Lancia Stratos HF Group 4 1985 Lancia Delta S4 Group B 2016 Nissan Titan Warrior Concept 2016 RJ Anderson #37 Polaris RZR-Rockstar Energy Pro 2 Truck 2016 Subaru #199 WRX STI VT15r Rally Car \nBlizzard Mountain is part of Forza Horizon 3’s expansion pass and can also be purchased individually, though specific pricing has not yet been announced.

      "title": "Microsoft gives third-parties access to Windows 10 Telemetry data",
      "text": "Microsoft struck a deal with security company FireEye recently according to a report on Australian news magazin Arn which gives FireEye access to all Windows 10 Telemetry data. \nUpdate : Microsoft told Betanews that it is not sharing Windows 10 Telemetry data with the company. \nThe nature of the deal between Microsoft and FireEye is to license threat intelligence content from FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. This additional layer of intelligence includes indicators and reports of past attacks collected and edited by FireEye and enhances detection capabilities of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). The deal does not include the sharing of Microsoft telemetry. \nThe report states that FireEye in return will provide Microsoft with the company’s iSIGHT Intelligence software for Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection on Windows 10 devices. \nFireEye iSIGHT Intelligence is a proactive, forward-looking means of qualifying threats poised to disrupt business based on the intents, tools and tactics of the attacker. \nWindows Defender is built-in to Windows 10 and enabled by default unless other security software is recognized by the operating system. \nPro and Enterprise customers may upgrade to Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection featuring endpoint behavioral sensors, cloud security analysis and threat intelligence. \nThe news article suggests that the partnership benefits Microsoft, and specifically the reputation and credibility of the commercial version of Windows Defender. \nA press release by FireEye on November 3, 2016 provides additional details on the deal. The company’s iSIGHT Intelligence software is available through Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP) but not the free version of Windows Defender. \nWDATP customers gain access to several technical indicators that are provided by the software. These include the main motivation of the attacker, related tools, information about target sectors and geographies, and a description of the actor and operation. \nAccording to the report on ARN, security teams may also get their hands on Windows 10 Telemetry data via subscription billing models. \nThird-parties will get access to telemetry data of all Windows 10 devices. An overview of what that may include is provided on this Technet page . \nNeither FireEye, Microsoft or ARN reveal details on the range of Telemetry data that FireEye gains access to. \nWindows 10 Telemetry data is loosely sorted into the four groups security, basic, enhanced and full. \nTip: you can check the Telemetry level on any Windows 10 device by using Windows-I to open the Settings app, and checking the “Diagnostics and usage data” value under Privacy > Feedback & Diagnostics. Security level \nThe Security level gathers only the telemetry info that is required to keep Windows devices, Windows Server, and guests protected with the latest security updates. \nData gathered at this level includes the Malicious Software Removal Tool reports, information that Windows Defender and Endpoint Protection require to function. \nThis includes anti-malware signatures, diagnostic information, User Account Control settings, UEFI settings, and IP address. \nNo user content, such as user files or communications, is gathered at the Security telemetry level, and we take steps to avoid gathering any information that directly identifies a company or user, such as name, email address, or account ID Basic Level \nThe Basic level gathers a limited set of data thatâ€™s critical for understanding the device and its configuration. This level also includes the Security level data. \nBasic device data such as attributes, Internet Explorer version, hardware information, operating system information, network attributes and more are collected at this level. \nCollected data includes app usage data, Internet Explorer add-ons, driver data, system data, Windows Store activity and more on top of that. Enhanced Level \nThe Enhanced level gathers data about how Windows and apps are used and how they perform. This level also includes data from both the Basic and Security levels. \nOperating system events, app events, device specific events and “some” crash dump types are included at this level. Full Level \nThe Full level gathers data necessary to identify and to help fix problems, following the approval process described below. This level also includes data from the Basic, Enhanced, and Security levels. \nMicrosoft may pull additional information from a device if the diagnostics request is approved by Microsoftâ€™s privacy governance team, including privacy and other subject matter experts. Closing Words \nTerms of the deal are not known so that we don’t know whether FireEye gets access to all Telemetry data or only to a snapshot. \nThat Telemetry data is offered to third-parties is quite problematic however if true. While it seems unlikely that Microsoft would provide third-parties with all data, it would be reassuring to Windows 10 users if Microsoft would reveal the data that it shares with third-parties. \nNow You : What’s your take on this? \nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio \nWith the Surface Pro 4 , Surface Book , and Surface Studio , Microsoft has solid devices for the 2-in-1, detachable notebook, and all-in-one desktop markets. The one area in which the company’s offerings are lacking is smartphones, with both the stand-alone mobile OS Windows Phone and the Lumia hardware line having been unceremoniously canceled. \nToday, Microsoft’s mobile efforts revolve around supporting Windows 10 Mobile running on OEM hardware such as HP’s Elite X3 smartphone. That’s been the company’s stated strategy for a few months now but it might not be its long-term direction, with the Surface Phone remaining a real possibility if only a bit delayed, as Forbes reports . \nMore: Windows 10 Redstone 2 “Creators Update” update could arrive in March 2017 \nRecently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke about the company’s work on “the ultimate mobile device,” in a reference that made it clear that Microsoft doesn’t want to compete with smartphone market leaders Apple and the Android ecosystem head on with consumer-focused devices. Microsoft tried that already, and failed. \nRather, Microsoft wants to focus its efforts on a new market-defining device that might meet a smaller subset of customers but that offers real value and differentiation. Given Microsoft’s “mobile-first, cloud-first” productivity solutions focus that’s aimed squarely at the enterprise, it’s likely that the Surface Phone will be aimed in that direction as well. \nThe newest information points to a device that will utilize Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip (SoC), and run a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Mobile with an enhanced version of Microsoft’s large-screen PC-like environment, Continuum, that supports legacy x86 applications. The ability to connect a Surface Phone to an external keyboard, mouse, and display and run full desktop applications like Office 2016 or Adobe Photoshop — or proprietary enterprise productivity apps — would be of real interest to business customers. \nThe Surface Phone is likely being tested in multiple configurations, with prototypes running both 4GB and 6GB of RAM to go with the Snapdragon 835. The 6GB version would likely be the one to run the enhanced Continuum mode and would thus be the most business focused. \nHowever, the updated version of Continuum is rumored to be coming with the Redstone 3 update, which will follow sometime after Redstone 2, or Creators Update, that’s expected in Sprint 2017. Most likely, Redstone 3 will arrive later in the second half of 2017. Given Microsoft’s pattern of introducing something new and exciting at its October events, with the Surface Book in October 2015 and the Surface Studio in October 2016 , dedicating the October 2017 event to a Surface Phone would make sense. \nIn any event, anyone who’s excited about the prospect of a high-end, truly innovative, and well-built Windows 10 Mobile device, may have a bit of a wait. And with its presumed target being the enterprise market, the Surface Phone might not be of great interest to general consumers, with Microsoft continuing to concede that market to Apple and Google.

      "text": "\nSeattle-based Pioneer News Group, a company which operates 23 newspapers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, and Montana, has partnered up with Microsoft to provide its subscribers with free Windows 10 tablets. Those who sign up for a $15/month, one year digital subscription with participating newspapers will get a free Windows 10 tablet with the subscription, and the option to have the Sunday newspaper delivered to their homes.\nThe tablet comes pre-installed with the newspaper app, called uReporter, which will be available for Windows, Android, and iOS devices. The app will not only let users read news, but also update their own news.\n“People still look to the newspaper for information, and it’s still valued,” says Pioneer Chief Operating Officer Eric Johnston, who has been involved in journalism since he became a reporter in eighth grade for his school newsletter, published with an IBM Selectric typewriter. “If we can keep readers engaged, that’s part of the battle of keeping the newspaper a vibrant piece of the community, whether it’s in print or not.”\nPioneer COO Eric Johnston met a few Microsoft execs while playing golf in 2014, and after a few discussions, the Redmond giant helped connect Pioneer with Posh Technologies, an app developing company with experience building mobile solutions for news organizations. Posh then built the uReporter app using Microsoft’s Universal Windows Platform.\nYou can read more information about the collaboration here .

      "text": "Global Payments @Adyen Microsoft Wallet @Microsoft 20 mins ago Will the Mobile Payments Landscape mirror the American Political Scene? Mobile Payment are in a bubble in the US. Geographically, that is. Blue states are typically the most common mobile payment (and technology) consumer friendly locations. Red states are typically reliant on plastic and more importantly cash (less technology) to make a payment. This technology adoption follows the 2016 US Presidential election voting trends. With the result of the Election and the Republican party winning an election fought on miss-information and half-truths, its interesting to reflect on how the next four years will impact technology innovations and Mobile Payments. The campagin was won partially on the promise of bringing back jobs in the industrial sector and others that are being taken over by technology. A comparison in the mobile payments industry, is like promising new building for banks branches in the US because it will provide more jobs, even though most Americans are performing their banking activities online. Can this rebuff of technology and progress in the real world also happen in the mobile payments ecosystem? The growth of mobile payments can only be successful if it covers the nation and we get more and more customers to change their consumer behavior to scan their phone at the terminal, rather than swiping a card (or even carrying cash). The result of the election has clearly shown that technology advancement and innovation doesn’t always move as fast we think and many members of the community often perceive technology advancements threats. “I have a son — he’s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers. It’s unbelievable” — Donald Trump So, how does the Mobile Payments Industry prevent technology moving too fast and leaving 51% of America behind, while maintaining a steady growth pattern of consumer adoption and technology improvement in the near and short term. Is there already an inbuilt emergency brake? In the shape of the Chip & Signature process? I heard a statistic the other day, that it takes 38 seconds to complete a EMV transaction request on a terminal. That is indeed not a technology improvement. In Europe, it a sub 10 second process to complete the cycle. Its interesting to look at other markets around the world. In Europe, The Netherlands and Sweden are much smaller countries but have diverse demographics in cities’ and in rural areas but are moving faster towards a cashless environment than anyone else and have done it within a very short time. Mobile Payments is totally the future of payments for many Americans living in progressive cities but its going to take much longer to cover the entire United States. The US smart phone coverage is a pretty good indicator of this, we saw over the last 10 years’ smart phone coverage has expanded to all corners of the US, even if the model of the phone are several years behind. It’s a pretty good bet the mobile payments will be the most popular way of paying in the future, but for now there is still a part of American society that want to walk slowly into the future and use the traditional cash or credit card payment option, which are perfectly fine. However, unfortunately they’ll have to figure out mobile payments, because it maybe the only way to pay in 5 to 10 years’ time and banks and technology merge closer together.",

      "text": "Home Technology HP Elite X3 Technology: Microsoft Surface Phone With Third-Party Software – Review HP Elite X3 Technology: Microsoft Surface Phone With Third-Party Software – Review 3 \nIn our HP Elite X3 review, we take a look at a third-party surface phone while Microsoft stays committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But the company hasn’t released any new device in the last 6 months or so, making everyone believe that it’s ready to give up at least on the hardware side of its mobile push. \nWith rumors that Microsoft is also aiming to abandon the Lumia lineup, every new phone coming from a different company is catching everyone’s attention, and this is exactly what happened with the HP Elite X3. \nAnnounced with much fanfare earlier this year, the HP Elite X3 comes with specs that Windows Phone fans have until now only dreamed about, despite the Lumia 950 series, which also brought specs that were compelling to say the least. \nBut the HP Elite X3 arrives at a time when only few people still believe in Windows phones, so there’s no doubt that hardcore fans really need to give it a shot. \nThat’s exactly what we did, as we took the HP Elite X3 for a spin and used it for several weeks, including with Continuum, to see what this is all about. This time, we’re going to split the review into two parts, namely hardware and software, so read on to find more about this super-powerful Windows phone. \nHardware \nIn terms of hardware, there’s no way you’re not going to be pleased with the HP Elite X3, although there still are things that would need more improvements. But let’s take them one at a time and see what this is all about. \n#Display \nThe HP Elite X3 comes with a 5.96-inch display that you’ll absolutely love. It has a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels, with a pixel density of 494 ppi, and although it looks huge at first, it has major advantages. \nWith a screen-to-body ratio of 72.2 percent, the phone has plenty of screen space to work with, so it’s absolutely a pleasure to browse the web or watch movies. \n“BRILLIANT DISPLAY!” \nIt’s so awesome! Colors are vivid, and the contrast is excellent, much better than on the other Windows phones on the market. The phone also comes with features such as double tap to wake, which is kind of handy given its size, but it lacks Glance screen, and this is one very important setback. \nIt does have a LED notification light to compensate for the lack of Glance, but Windows 10 Mobile does not have advanced support for this feature, so you can’t configure it to blink when you have missed third-party notifications just yet. \nThe response time of the display is impressive to say the least and readability in direct sunlight is a bit above the average. \n#CPU, RAM, and storage \nThis phone comes with the most powerful Snapdragon processor at the moment, namely the 820, which is quad-core in the following configuration: 2 cores running at 2.15 GHz and 2 running at 1.6 GHz. Depending on the power you need, the more powerful cores kick in, giving the phone impressive performance figures. \nThe Elite X3 features 4 GB of RAM, which is pretty much the biggest amount of memory that you can find right now in the Windows phone world, and 64 GB of storage, obviously with microSD card support. \nThe aforementioned configuration makes the HP Elite X3 blazing fast 90 percent of the time, and the remaining 10 percent is lost only because of Windows 10 Mobile. \nThe phone barely gets hot when performing more demanding tasks, such as when watching videos, but even when it does, the cooling system is super-efficient. \nThe amount of storage that the device offers is not overwhelming, but it’s a good thing that it comes with microSD card support. This is something that Apple should borrow as well, although we all know that’s not going to happen.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone Includes 8 Core Snapdragon 835, Redstone 3 For Mobile Microsoft Surface Phone Includes 8 Core Snapdragon 835, Redstone 3 For Mobile \nMicrosoft is set to make Windows 10 Mobile hotter than before, and we got some news on the latest Surface Phone that could bring more competition to the market. \nSatya Nadella says Microsoft is planning the “ultimate mobile device”. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone With More RAM, Bigger HD Screens Microsoft Surface Phone With More RAM, Bigger HD Screens \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows 10 Mobile To Cut Lumia Series Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows 10 Mobile To Cut Lumia Series 1 \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps.",

      "text": "Home Business Microsoft Surface Phone At Amazon Cyber Monday Sales Microsoft Surface Phone At Amazon Cyber Monday Sales Jennifer Hong Nov 28, 2016 Business Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Phone At Amazon Cyber Monday Sales 1 \nShoppers are getting ready for Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone To Use New Snapdragon 835 SoC, Windows 10 News Microsoft Surface Phone To Use New Snapdragon 835 SoC, Windows 10 News 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio, Windows 10 Pre-Orders To Ship Soon Microsoft Surface Studio, Windows 10 Pre-Orders To Ship Soon Michael Stevens Nov 28, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio, Windows 10 Pre-Orders To Ship Soon Like \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until “early 2017.” \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "A specially crafted web-page can cause a type confusion vulnerability inMicrosoft Internet Explorer 8 through to 11. An attacker can cause codeto be executed with a stack layout it does not expect, or have codeattempt to execute a method of an object using a vftable, when thatobject does not have a vftable. Successful exploitation can lead toarbitrary code execution.Known affected software and attack vectors + Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10 and 11 An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.DescriptionI identified two attack vectors to this vulnerability. One of them isthat Javascript can make a copy of the `hasFeature` method of a`DOMImplementation` object in one window and use it as a method ofanother object in another window. Doing so can cause at least two issuesin the `MSHTML!Method_VARIANTBOOLp_BSTR_o0oVARIANT` function of MSIE:* A FailFast exception when the code detects that calling a method of an object has not cleaned up the stack as expected; this is because the called function appears to expect a different number of arguments or a different calling convention. This issue can be triggered by changing the line `o.x();` in the repro to `o.x(new Array)`.* An out-of-bounds write when `MSHTML!CBase::PrivateGetDispID` is called; this is probably caused by a type confusion bug: the code expects a `VARIANT` object of one type, but is working on an object of a different type.Exploitation of this attack vector was not attempted. I reversed`Method_VARIANTBOOLp_BSTR_o0oVARIANT` only sufficiently to get an ideaof the root cause, but not enough to determine exactly what is going onor how to control the issue for command execution.Another attack vector is calling the `isPrototypeOf` method of the`DOMImplementation` interface as a function: this results in typeconfusion where a C++ object is assumed to implement `IUnknown` when infact it does not. The code attempts to call the `IUnknown::Release`method, expecting a vftable to be stored at offset 0, but since theobject has no vftables, a member property is stored at this offset,which appears to have a static value `002dc6c0`. An attacker that isable to control this value, or allocate memory and store data at thataddress, may be able to execute arbitrary code.No attempts were made to further reverse the code and determine theexact root cause. A few attempts were made to control the value atoffset 0 of the object in question, as well as get another object in itsplace with a different value at this location, but both efforts werebrief and unsuccessful.",

Sorry Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on \nWith the PC market tapped out and in a perpetual slump and the cloud market a tough fight for customers, Microsoft's on the prowl for new frontiers. \nIn that spirit, the company announced last week an effort to create a quantum computer , an amalgam of exotic hardware and specialized software that will allow parallel computations at speeds orders of magnitude beyond what conventional silicon can provide. [ InfoWorld's quick guide: Digital Transformation and the Agile Enterprise . | Download InfoWorld’s essential guide to microservices and learn how to create modern web and mobile applications that scale. ] \nAn announcement like this would once have been easy to blow off as a science-fiction self-indulgence. But in the last couple of years, quantum computing has become a field of serious study for big-name enterprise IT companies . Here are four big takeaways from Microsoft's plunge into what may prove to be a very deep pool. 1. Microsoft is late to this party, but that may not be a bad move \nMicrosoft is known more for being a refiner than an innovator, but that's not always a bad characteristic. It wasn't first to the cloud, but Azure is fast shaping up to be a powerful contender in that space. By hanging back, it learned lessons about what was worth attempting in this space, instead of unthinkingly copying existing contenders. \nThe same may also apply to Microsoft and quantum computing. Right now, IBM and Google have their QC efforts underway. IBM is creating its own custom hardware, and Google is looking for ways to synthesize approaches between different QC methodologies. \nThere's much to learn from all of them. By waiting to kick off its program, Microsoft can avoid some of the earlier dead ends and false starts instead of repeating the mistakes of others. 2. The plan is to build tools, not lab toys \nQuantum computing has long been regarded as a lab plaything rather than a practical application. That reputation is deserved in part: QC hardware can currently solve only a very narrow range of problems, so it's impractical for the kind of work done on conventional computing hardware. QC company D-Wave (supplier of Google's quantum hardware) has long been associated with solving highly specific problems, but IBM's approach involves creating more general-purpose systems. \nMicrosoft's plan is to use a different kind of quantum computing building block -- what it calls a \"topological qubit\" -- as the underpinning for its hardware stack. It's been difficult to create general-purpose QC hardware because quantum hardware operates properly under highly controlled, isolated conditions only. Topological qubits are believed to be more robust and thus easier to build larger systems out of -- meaning they can work in the real world, not in a laboratory alone. \nIn short, Microsoft wants to produce a monetizable product, not an abstract technological accomplishment. After all, the latter's already been done. 3. There's already cloud-based quantum computing, but perhaps Microsoft can do better \nIf history's any guide, Microsoft's most likely plan to create a product , not merely a project, of quantum research will be to offer access to its quantum hardware via Azure. \nThing is, IBM already has a version of quantum computing as a service (QCaaS). It currently offers time-shared access to programming its own five-qubit processor through a web-based, drag-and-drop \"composer\" interface. \nBut IBM's QCaaS offering is highly limited. It's essentially an experimental sandbox with few options to use the resulting quantum programs, or \"circuits,\" outside of the sandbox. Maybe that's justified for now, since QC programming is so radically unlike conventional computing. \nMicrosoft could take advantage of such a disjoint by doing as much as it can to bridge the two realms -- offering Azure-based QCaaS with many common QC functions already prebuilt, for example. 4. Microsoft's existing language tools would make a great platform for future QC development \nA more powerful long-term bet would be to have QC development tools available through Microsoft's existing software development and language products. \nAn Azure QC module for C#, R, or Python, for instance, could allow users of those languages to write QC code with software development metaphors they're already familiar with. \nSome precedent for this sort of metaprogramming already exists. The LLVM compiler, for instance, has libraries that allow other languages to drive the compiler -- such as llvmpy for Python. In the same manner, Microsoft could create metaprogramming libraries for QC with bindings to most any language. \nMicrosoft has already started working on the software side with a tool called Language-Integrated Quantum Operations, or \"LIQUi|>\" (not a typo). It allows users to define quantum circuits in Microsoft's functional F# language. F# may be a first-class language in Microsoft's world, with full-blown Visual Studio support and constant upgrades , but it's nowhere nearly as widely used as other languages in Microsoft's portfolio (C#), let alone all the outside languages that Microsoft supports directly (R, Python). \nIf Microsoft's long-term plan is to bring quantum computing to the masses -- all signs hint at that being a major motivator -- it only makes sense to support it with the tools everyone already knows and makes the most of.

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone To Use Snapdragon 835 SoC, Windows 10 News – Report Microsoft Surface Phone To Use Snapdragon 835 SoC, Windows 10 News – Report 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Business Microsoft Surface Phone At Amazon During Cyber Monday Sales Microsoft Surface Phone At Amazon During Cyber Monday Sales Jennifer Hong Nov 28, 2016 Business Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Phone At Amazon During Cyber Monday Sales 1 \nShoppers are getting ready for Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft have announced the very first expansion for their excellent, excellent open world racing game, Forza Horizon 3 . The expansion is called Blizzard Mountain , and as the name suggests, it adds a snowy, mountainous terrain to the game (otherwise set in Australia) for the very first time.\nThe expansion will come with new events designed specifically for it (including some that, I hope, leverage and utilize the terrain change in the game), and eight new vehicles. There will be 50 new events that will be a part of the update, all told.\nOwners of the Expansion Pass will get this update for free, while others can purchase it standalone. Ultimate Edition owners will also have to purchase this or the Expansion Pass if they want the DLC, though they at least get $10 off of their purchase. You can check out the full list of new cars being added to the game below.

Microsoft says that the app will also display contact information as if it were a normal call. \nThe post further details settings for how calls are handled, including the option for users to fully disable mobile integration. Data and Wi-Fi settings for video and meeting content are present as well, which can be set by group policy or by the individual user. \nThe mobile app update is available today for iOS or it can be downloaded from the Skype For Business website .",

Aim is to share certain e-mails with my team and have a proper overview of the e-mails saved. Thereby, the e-mail should be assignable to the project it concerns. Certain CRM systems have similar functionality. However, they are rather sales tools. I am looking for a lean tool only for collaborative e-mail management integrated in Outlook.

      "text": "\nLast month, Microsoft announced HoloLens Development Edition and Microsoft HoloLens Commercial Suite availability in Australia, Ireland, France, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Today, they are announcing availability of HoloLens for developers and commercial partners in Japan. Pre-orders start on December 2nd – exclusively from the Microsoft Store in Japan and HoloLens will begin to ship in early 2017.\nAlex Kipman, Technical Fellow, Windows and Devices Group, said the following regarding Japan launch,\nWe continue to be inspired by the work developers and customers are doing with HoloLens across the globe. Japan is no different. One of the companies already innovating with HoloLens is Japan Airlines . By using HoloLens, Japan Airlines has developed two proof-of-concept programs to provide supplemental training for engine mechanics, and for flight crew trainees who want to be promoted to co-pilot status. We are very excited to have them on this holographic journey with us.\nKeep an eye on Microsoft Store Japan to pre-order the device when it becomes available.",

The stock generated a return of 9.10% as compared with the Zacks Computer-Software Industry’s year-to-date return of 10.17%. \nThe upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products are expected to generate top-line growth in 2016. \nPer a report published in the South China Morning Post , Microsoft is expanding in China by strengthening its bonds with Chinese businesses in the region. \nThe Current State of Affairs \nMicrosoft’s cloud platform Azure currently enjoys nearly 17% share of the cloud computing market in China, second only to Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (NYSE: BABA ) Alibaba Cloud. However, Microsoft believes that it can scale up its market share by making some strategic partnerships in the region. \nWe note that Microsoft introduced its business of cloud computing in China nearly two years ago. However, the company is gradually recognizing the importance of partnerships that cloud play a pivotal role in expanding its cloud business presence in the country. \nCurrently, Windows and Office remain Microsoft’s main revenue growth drivers. However, amid declining PC sales worldwide, the revenue stream could get adversely affected. The need of the hour is to diversify into other emerging sectors and Microsoft is doing just that. \nCloud Scope \nAs per an IDC report, worldwide public cloud services spending is estimated to reach a whopping $195 billion by 2020 growing at a CAGR of 20.4%. Given the huge growth prospects the segment offers, it’s no surprise that Microsoft is trying its level best to expand in the aforementioned field. \nMICROSOFT CORP Price \nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nAt present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). \nSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Konami Holdings Corp.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. How Slack Versus Microsoft Could Play Out \nIn early November Microsoft announced a new product called Microsoft Teams . It’s a way for groups of people, typically colleagues inside a company, to communicate with each other over multiple, simultaneous conversations. It will be part of the software giant’s online Office 365 product, the “productivity” subscription program used by 85 million “knowledge workers” around the world. More than a billion additional customers use the offline version of Office. \nA relatively small group of people—4 million, to be precise—will recognize something familiar about the new Microsoft offering . That’s because it’s more or less what a San Francisco startup called Slack does. Microsoft is adding a few bells and whistles, including easier-to-follow threaded conversations and video conferencing. Slack, which took the charmingly old-fashioned step of buying a newspaper ad to “welcome” Microsoft to its game, has said it will match those features. ( Fortune , like many journalism organizations, uses Slack; after a year of steadily increasing usage, I’ve grown to like it.) \nThis isn’t the first time Microsoft has unveiled a “Slack killer.” In fact, it is becoming something of an annual event . What’s more, Slack is growing fast. It has 4 million users, up from 1.25 million a year ago. About 30% of those customers pay either $6.67 or $12.50 per month for the product, depending on which features they use. My back-of-the-envelope calculation of Slack’s annual revenue, assuming all customers pay the average of the two price points, is around $140 million. “You’re pretty close,” Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield told me just before Thanksgiving. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter, where this essay originated. \nThis David-versus-Goliath story could play out one of two ways. In the past, Microsoft users would ignore the new feature because it turns out what they really like about Office is email, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Slack would benefit from its focus. Then again, Microsoft has its act together in a way it hasn’t for years. And group conversations are the perfect complement to the other Office features. Slack could wither if users adopt Microsoft’s no-extra-cost feature. \nIt’s the kind of story only tech lovers and venture capitalists truly care about. Technology customers will benefit either way.",

      "text": "HP is believed to be working together with Microsoft on a brand-new Windows phone that would be specifically aimed at consumers, but new information that got leaked today is likely to leave many of fans disappointed. According to people with knowledge of the matter, HP’s main goal was to create a consumer version of the Elite X3, which is, in essence, a device developed for businesses needing the most advanced hardware available on the market right now. But needless to say, even though it’s aimed at consumers, the next HP Windows phone still needs features that would place it at the top of the pack, at least next to the Lumia 950 XL (which continues to be Microsoft’s own flagship in the Windows 10 Mobile world).

      "text": "The long-rumored Surface Phone has reportedly began its production trials, according to Chinese publication Commercial Times. Microsoft’s upcoming flagship will reportedly have a late 2017 unveiling, dubbed by Microsoft chief Satya Nadella as the \"ultimate mobile device.\" ( Nadir Aslam ) Advertisement The Surface Phone is probably closer than most people think, at least according to a report by Chinese financial publication Commercial Times, who claims that Pegatron, a main supplier for Apple, is reportedly working with Microsoft and is already administering production trials of the enigmatic Surface Phone. Surface Phone Rumors The Surface-branded phone has enjoyed its wealth of rumors in recent months. Others predict it as a high-end offering from Microsoft geared exclusively for enterprise , meaning that Microsoft is backing away from its consumer approach for Windows phones since that hasn't been exactly a successful stride . Another rumor further pins the Surface Phone at a late 2017 unveiling, which is entirely plausible if Commercial Times's report (translated) proves legitimate. Microsoft is rumored to have designed the phone to complement its Surface Book lineup, or at least facilitate some sort of integration between the devices. Microsoft wants the Surface Phone to stand out from the highly saturated smartphone market today, so it's not hard to imagine that the Surface Phone will arrive boasting with innovative features such as being able to run x86 apps via Continuum , Microsoft's proprietary technology already seen on the HP Elite x3 that can turn a smartphone into a Windows 10-capable docking station. The Ultimate Mobile Device Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, has also intimated the idea of a Surface Phone that doesn't mirror smartphone trends of late. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,\" Nadella told the Australian Financial Review. The term \"ultimate mobile device\" renders the Surface Phone quite ripe for speculation. Exactly what will set the Surface Phone apart from the abundance of smartphone today remains nebulous, but Nadella has confirmed that Microsoft is currently conducting innovative research that will suture its wounded smartphone efforts and subsequently reclaim its presence in the smartphone market. Microsoft's approach for the Surface Phone, according to Nadella, is prioritizing how users use devices, instead of inventing complicated add-ons simply to justify innovating a product in and of itself without conceiving its practical and potential usefulness for consumers. \nWhat would you like to see on Microsoft's forthcoming Surface Phone? Do you think Microsoft stands a chance in cornering a considerable chunk of the smartphone market with the Surface Phone? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!  ",
