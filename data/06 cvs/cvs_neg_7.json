      "text": "CVS Workers Hide From Virginia Man 'Asking for Cheese' CVS Workers Hide From Virginia Man 'Asking for Cheese' The company acknowledged that its employees left the floor — but denied that the man's ethnicity played a factor. - - \nA Virginia man's bizarre run-in with CVS employees garnered a groundswell of online attention when he accused them of calling police after he asked store employees if they carried sliced cheese. \nRicky Berry told WRIC-TV in Richmond (which originally aired the story) that he and his roommate found themselves alone in the store before an officer arrived; later, the officer found the store staff hiding inside a locked room. However, Berry said he and his roommate were both asked to leave the premises. \nHe just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on. \nCVS did not question WRIC and Berry's account of events, but did tell us that Berry's ethnicity (he is black) was not a factor: \nCVS Health has firm nondiscrimination policies that are rigorously enforced throughout the company. We do not tolerate any practices that discriminate against any of our customers, and profiling of customers is explicitly prohibited. \nThe local news coverage in the Richmond market failed to report that both employees working in the store that evening are African-American, and there is no indication that the race of the customers played a role in this incident. \nIt is not company policy to leave the sales floor unstaffed during operating hours and we are reinforcing the appropriate way for employees to respond to what they believe may be a security concern. We sincerely apologize to our customers for this misunderstanding. Our District Manager for the Richmond market also contacted Mr. Berry to apologize for this incident. \nWe contacted Richmond police seeking comment on the encounter. Store employees reportedly told Berry that they did not carry the cheese he was looking for.   28 November 2016",

      "text": "Google \nNEW YORK — A new study about aloe vera gel, used to treat sunburns and other skin issues, might make some consumers feel even more burned , especially those partial to store brand products. \nBloomberg hired a lab to test various store brands and it found that the aloe gel sold at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS is lacking one important ingredient — aloe vera. \nThe report says that all of the brands listed aloe vera juice as a prominent ingredient, but the three specific chemical markers that would indicate the presence of aloe were missing. \nThe four gels that Bloomberg tested were Wal-Mart's \"Equate Aloe After Sun Gel,\" Target's \"UP & Up Aloe Vera Gel,\" CVS \"Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, and Walgreens \"Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\" \nIn three of the samples the lab found none of the chemical markers, but tests did find maltodextrin, a cheap, sugary substitute sometimes used to imitate aloe, according to the results. \nThe fourth sample had one of the three chemical markers, but without the other two markers it wasn't possible to say whether or not aloe was ever included in the recipe. \nAloe vera brings in a lot of money – according to Bloomberg, the total U.S. market grew 11 percent last year, up to $146 million. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug administration does not approve the ingredients in cosmetic products, essentially leaving it up to suppliers to make good on their promises. \nA representative for Fruit of the Earth, the company that produces the gels, disputed the report, as did Walgreens, CVS and Walmart. \nBut now there are several class action lawsuits against the four retailers and Fruit of the Earth from customers who believe they were misled.

The medicines are sold at CVS pharmacy stores and have the CVS name on the boxes.\nThe recalled medicines include the Kid’s Relief Homeopathic Ear Relief Liquid, Kids Relief Homeopathic Ear Relief Oral Liquid and infants’ teething tablets. The products were distributed to CVS stores nationwide. The company says there may be too much belladonna in the medications.\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, belladonna can be dangerous or fatal when consumed in large doses.\nIf you have either product, stop using it immediately and call the Raritan Company at 1-866-467-2748 (Monday-Friday from 8am to 5:30pm EST).",

      "text": "By Ashley Harding - Reporter Posted: 4:41 AM, November 29, 2016 \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Raritan Pharmaceuticals has issued a recall on homeopathic medicine for children that could contain a poisonous substance. \nThese medicines have the CVS name on them, and they're specifically designed to help with teething and ear infections. This could affect infants and small children. \nThe medicines in question are: CVS Kids Relief Homeopathic Ear Relief Oral Liquid CVS Homepathic Kids' Ear Relief Liquid CVS Homeopathic Infants' Teething Tablets \nThe Food and Drug Administration says the substance they're concerned about is called Belladona. It can be harmful if taken in large doses. \nChildren affected by Belladona poisoning may experience seizures, difficulty breathing, lethargic behavior and sleepiness. If you have any of these medicines, you're asked to stop using them immediately. If your child experiences any of these symptoms after taking these medicines, seek medical attention right away. \nYou can also call the Poison Control Center. That number is 800-222-1222. It's open 24 hours a day. Copyright 2016 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved. News Headlines ",

      "text": "After entering the Colorado market earlier this year with its takeover of Target’s in-store pharmacies, CVS Health has even bigger plans for 2017.\nThe first standalone CVS Pharmacy locations in the state likely will open next year.\n“We will be entering the Denver and Colorado Springs markets in 2017,” Stephanie Cunha, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island-based chain said in an e-mail.\nNo other details were available, but CVS already has approved site development plans on file for a 1.1-acre piece of property it owns at West 38th Avenue and Sheridan Boulevard in Denver’s West Highland neighborhood.\nRelated Articles November 29, 2016 Outdoor industry will be added to the calculus of the nation’s gross domestic product November 29, 2016 Afrikmall eviction paves way for a new live entertainment hub, business incubator space in Aurora November 29, 2016 Greeley-based Pilgrim’s Pride snaps up Minnesota chicken company for $350M November 29, 2016 Patagonia donating its $10M in Black Friday sales to charity November 28, 2016 Cyber Monday transforms as shoppers are more connected That property, the former Tommy’s Slalom Shop at 3740 Sheridan Blvd., was acquired in June by CVS for just shy of $4 million, according to city records. The seller was an entity managed by CorePower Yoga founder Trevor Tice.\nConstruction fences recently went up around the property, although a city spokeswoman said that as of Monday, a demolition permit had not been issued for the existing structure. Plans call for a new 14,700-square-foot building and 65 on-site parking spaces.\nCVS also owns a trio of office buildings at East Hampden Avenue and South Tamarac Drive in south Denver that were purchased in late 2015 for $6.28 million, according to city records.\nThe first CVS Pharmacy locations inside Target stores in Colorado opened earlier this year. CVS Health acquired all Target pharmacies and retail clinics in December 2015, including 39 in Colorado. Nationwide, CVS has more than 9,600 locations.\nWalgreens, CVS’s main rival, is already an established presence in Colorado, with 159 locations as of August. Walgreens’ $9.4 billion merger with Rite Aid is expected to close early next year. Rite Aid also has retail locations in Colorado, including 11 in metro Denver and two in Boulder.",

      "text": "Wayland: Residents still unhappy with CVS plans   10:45 PM Nov 29, 2016 at 10:45 PM Brian Benson Daily News Staff @bbensonMWDN \nWAYLAND – The Zoning Board of Appeals on Tuesday rejected based on procedural problems three appeals of a building permit issued for a controversial project to build a CVS slated on Main Street. \nSome of the approximately 30 people in the audience pleaded with the ZBA to hear something on its merits rather than be bogged down in technicalities. \n“You’re depriving all of us from making sure that the CVS complies with the zoning bylaws,” said Arlene Schuler, who lives on King Street. \nResident Gil Wolin said it feels like the board is working hard not to hear the merits, an allegation board member Thomas White said is false. \nThe board rejected Nancy Leifer’s appeal because she does not have standing and rejected an appeal by Gretchen and Paul Dresens because the appeal was not filed with the Town Clerk’s Office within 30 days. \nThe residents appealed a building permit issued in July for a CVS store that is slated to be built at 150 Main St., the former site of Finnerty's Restaurant. The project has received Planning Board approval. \nGretchen Dresens and her attorney said Dresens tried to file her appeal on Aug. 17, but the Town Clerk’s Office was closed. She brought the appeal to the Building Department and Town Administrator’s Office, where the appeal was accepted and stamped. She thought it would be brought to the Town Clerk’s Office but it wasn’t stamped there until Aug. 19, which was after the Aug. 18 deadline. \nDresens claimed town officials didn’t give her the correct information. \n“I need someone from the town to own the mistakes that the town made,” she said. \nDresens’ attorney argued in part that the appeal deadline should have been extended because the Town Clerk’s Office was closed. He cited a Cambridge case where a deadline was extended because government offices were closed because of a blizzard. \nBut, Charles Le Ray, an attorney for developer 150 Main Street LLC, said that was a situation where the governor ordered people to stay home. Here, the Town Clerk’s Office was simply closed for a morning, Le Ray said. \nZoning board members said they understand the desire to hear the merits of the appeal and the uniqueness of this situation, but don’t have the authority to hear it. \nA statute, board Chairman Eric Goldberg said, requires the appeal to be filed timely with the Town Clerk’s Office. \n“The statute controls and we’re bound by the statute,” Goldberg said. \nGoldberg said he would like to hear the merits of the appeal, but the board doesn’t have the ability to do so. Hearing the merits of the appeal would be akin to a jury ignoring the law in reaching a decision, he said. \nGoldberg told Leifer she needed to “allege harm which is unique to you.” \nLeifer said CVS will increase traffic on her street, including trucks. She said she worries she will not be able to back out of her East Plain Street driveway. \nBut, Goldberg said the traffic effects are more of a general community concern. \nThe board denied an appeal by resident Molly Upton on procedural problems before hearing the substance of that appeal. \nSchuler, the King Street resident who spoke from the audience, said she accepts that CVS will be built. She and some other speaks said they want to make sure the project is done in a way that meets the zoning bylaw. \n“We just want it to be done right and in compliance,” she said. \nTwo other appeals were withdrawn. \nBrian Benson  3964 or bbenson@wickedlocal.com.

      "text": "\nScan your CVS ExtraCare card at the Coupon Center, usually located at the front of the store, each week to get CVS store coupons that can be stacked with manufacturer coupons for CUCKOO deals! Be sure to scan multiple times to make sure you’re getting all the coupons you’re eligible for until the machine says “Hey Super Scanner! You’ve printed all your coupons”. Some coupons are randomly given, some are based on shopping habits and some coupons are given to everyone! CVS resets the personalized coupons on Monday mornings, so that is usually the best time to scan to get the widest variety of coupons. You can also access your coupons from your CVS account online and the CVS app!\nThe coupons can only be used once, whether printed from the Coupon Center or your online account or redeemed from the app–they are the same coupon. Read about how you can load them to your ExtraCare card or print them from your computer ! You can even extend the expiration date on them!\nEach week I will post a list of the coupons you may get as well some deal scenarios for using these great coupons!

      "title": "Philippines Graduate: how long does CGFNS CVS send a letter of request to the school?",
      "text": "2:56 pm 0 Views 0 Comments 0 Hello is there any kababayan who are or have applied to CGFNS CVS or NY who can help me. I have sent all documents to CGFNS CVS since October. Now, I am waiting for CGFNS to send the letter of Request for Transcript to my school in the Philippines. Ive been checking with the school every week since then but they have been saying that they havent received the letter yet. Ive emailed Cgfns beginning of November if they sent a letter to the school already and they said they have \"sent the first set of letters\" to my school. I have no way of tracking those letters because cgfns doesn't issue a tracking number or so. Do you know how long does Phiippine school usually received these letters or have encountered the same problem as mine?",

      "text": "CVS Employees Accused Of Hiding, Calling Cops On Black Customers Photo by Home > Nation CVS Employees Accused Of Hiding, Calling Cops On Black Customers Things got strange at a Virginia CVS recently after Ricky Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell asked employees if they sold cheese. \n2 days ago 4.74K reads \nT wo Black male CVS customers were racially profiled in Carytown, Virginia, after reportedly visiting the store to buy cheese, reports say. \nAccording to WATE NEWS, Ricky Berry and his roommate Philip Blackwell recently asked the store’s employees if they sold cheese, and they were told “no.” T hat’s when things got strange because all of a sudden the employees disappeared. “ We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn’t find anybody ,” Blackwell said, saying that there was another customer who was searching for assistance to buy pain medication for a bad tooth, the report says. Then to their surprise, police showed up out of nowhere. They quickly explained what happened to the officer and were told that someone called 911 on them. The officer walked around the store and found the employees huddled in the back room with the doors locked. “ He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start ,” Berry said. But then after making a few calls, the officer told Berry and Blackwell that they had to leave the store. “ We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding, ” Berry said, “ He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us. We had no idea what was going on. ” Later, the two men called the store manager, but their calls were not returned. However, a spokesperson for the drugstore recently apologized to Berry and Blackwell for the incident and stressed that the employee who called police would be interviewed and possibly retrained, WATE noted . \nSEE ALSO: ",

      "text": "Login to post a comment \n\nLubbock police are searching for a suspect who they say robbed a West Lubbock pharmacy at gunpoint early Thursday morning. \nOfficials were called to the scene at 3:45 a.m., in reference to an armed robbery at CVS pharmacy, 3402 Slide Road, according to a Lubbock Police Department news release. \nThe victim, identified as a store employee, told police the suspect reportedly entered the store with a bandana covering his face, while carrying a rifle. \nInitially, the suspect approached the counter and asked for cigarettes. When the employee told the suspect they did not have cigarettes, the report states the suspect passed a piece of paper to the employee. \nAccording to the report, the paper had a message demanding money from the register. The employee gave the suspect money and the suspect fled the scene. \n“The employee advised the suspect never pointed the rifle directly at him,” the report states. \nPolice describe the suspect as a white male, or light-skinned Hispanic male, 18 to 20 years old. He is about 5 feet 6” to 5 feet 8, has brown hair and brown eyes, and weighs about 125 to 135 pounds. He was also observed to have a cross tattoo on the left side of his face, underneath his eye. \nAnyone with information is urged to contact Crime Line at 741-1000. Callers may remain anonymous.",

      "text": "Lubbock police search for suspect in CVS robbery Thursday morning Suspect armed with rifle A-J MEDIA \n\nLubbock police are searching for a suspect who they say robbed a West Lubbock pharmacy at gunpoint early Thursday morning. \nOfficials were called to the scene at 3:45 a.m., in reference to an armed robbery at CVS pharmacy, 3402 Slide Road, according to a Lubbock Police Department news release. \nThe victim, identified as a store employee, told police the suspect reportedly entered the store with a bandana covering his face, while carrying a rifle. \nInitially, the suspect approached the counter and asked for cigarettes. When the employee told the suspect they did not have cigarettes, the report states the suspect passed a piece of paper to the employee. \nAccording to the report, the paper had a message demanding money from the register. The employee gave the suspect money and the suspect fled the scene. \n“The employee advised the suspect never pointed the rifle directly at him,” the report states. \nPolice describe the suspect as a white male, or light-skinned Hispanic male, 18 to 20 years old. He is about 5 feet 6” to 5 feet 8, has brown hair and brown eyes, and weighs about 125 to 135 pounds. He was also observed to have a cross tattoo on the left side of his face, underneath his eye. \nAnyone with information is urged to contact Crime Line at 741-1000. Callers may remain anonymous.",

      "text": "  AP A pharmacy changeover for health care program for U.S. military service members went into effect Thursday, with one pharmacy joining the network while another left. TRICARE said Walgreens pharmacies had joined the TRICARE retail pharmacy network, effective Dec. 1. CVS pharmacies, including those inside Target retail stores, have left the network. Weed in the Workplace: A Tip Sheet TRICARE said the revised network includes more than 57,000 pharmacy locations. About 98 percent of TRICARE beneficiaries will still have a network pharmacy within five miles of their home, the company said. Express Scripts, Inc. (ESI) manages the TRICARE retail pharmacy network under a contract with the Department of Defense. ESI’s website has more information on the network and how beneficiaries can find a network pharmacy near their home. Beneficiaries can also call ESI at (855) 778-1417 for help locating a nearby network pharmacy. Longtime NASSCO President to Retire Starting Thursday, TRICARE urged beneficiaries to transfer their prescriptions from CVS to Walgreens, or any other pharmacy in the network. Those who fill a prescription at a CVS pharmacy after Thursday will have to pay the full cost of the medication up front and then file a claim for partial reimbursement, according to the TRICARE website. TRICARE is managed by the Defense Health Agency, under the leadership of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).",

Trump picks fierce Obamacare critic as health and human services secretary November 29, 2016, 9:39 am President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Rep.

Crawford County Prosecutor Matt Crall told RichlandSource.com that Gallegos passed a note to a cashier and indicated that he had a bomb. Gallegos's note demanded Xanax and three other types of prescription drugs. Gallegos in the past has been arrested on a domestic violence charge and on drug charges. Police did not find a bomb at the scene and Gallegos currently is in the Crawford County Jail on $1 Million bond. #ThisWeekinHistory",

Net sales grew 5% to $5.32 billion but were still short of the mean estimate of $5.37 billion provided by Capital IQ. For fiscal 2016 ending Feb. 3, the company said it now expects diluted EOS growth to be at the low end of the long-term growth model range of 10% to 15%. \nAnd, Express ( EXPR ) was down 17.7% after the specialty retail apparel company said it now expects full year adjusted EPS in a range of $0.78 to $0.82, down from prior guidance in a range of $1.00 to $1.14 and short of the Street estimate of $1.06. The company said it continues to expect comparable sales to decline in the high single digits. For Q4 the company guided EPS in a range of $0.26 to $0.30, missing the Street projection of $0.55. The company said it expects comparable sales to decline by low double digits. \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc. \nCopyright (C) 2016 MTNewswires.com.

      "text": "1 screenshot A version control system designed as a replacement for CVS (Concurrent Versions System) The goal of the Subversion project is to build a version control system that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community. It is developed and distributed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Apache Subversion is a command-line software similar to the Git or Bazaar version control systems. It’s similar to CVS, but better Apache Subversion includes the most recent CVS features, as well as various other features that will make this project much better than CVS, including versioned renaming, versioned symbolic links, versioned copying, versions deleting, versioned directories and free-form versioned metadata. It also comes with native client/server, layered library design that features clean APIs. Efficiently handles binary files In addition, the software comes with support for tagging and branching operations, commits are truly atomic and the program efficiently handles binary files. Other features include merge tracking, file locking, the ability to preserve executable flags, parseable output, localized messages, interactive conflict resolution, repository read-only mirroring, write-through proxy over WebDAV, changelists, as well as bindings for numerous programming languages. Supports DeltaV and WebDAV protocols Among other features, we can mention an Apache network server option, with support for the DeltaV and WebDAV protocols, a standalone server option, native client/server, layered library design, versioning of symbolic links, parseable output, and localized messages. Supported operating systems and availability The project is supported on all GNU/Linux operating systems and can be easily installed from the source archive provided by Apache or via the default software repositories of the respective distribution. Both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures are supported at this time. Choose between database or plain-file repository The client and server protocol sends diffs in both directions, and users will be able to choose between database or plain-file repository implementations. The Apache Subversion project is free software released under an Apache/BSD-style open source license. New in Apache Subversion 1.9.3: User-visible changes: svn: fix possible crash in auth credentials cache (r1705328) cleanup: avoid unneeded memory growth during pristine cleanup (r1706241)",

(Spotted by Sean S at CVS.) \nIf you’re out shopping and see an interesting new product on the shelf, snap a picture of it, and send us an email (theimpulsivebuy@gmail.com) with where you found it and “Spotted” in the subject line. Or reply to us (@theimpulsivebuy) on Twitter with the photo, where you spotted it, and the hashtag #spotted . If you’ve tried the product, share your thoughts about it in the comments. \nAlso, if you’re wondering if we’ve already covered something, search our Flickr photos or use the search box on the right (or below if you’re on a mobile device) to find out.",

      "text": "More \nBy Leada Gore | Alabama Media Group (Tribune News Service) |   \nCVS said a social media post in which one of its managers allegedly referred to imprisoning all U.S. veterans is a hoax. \nYesterday, a screenshot of a supposed Facebook conversation showing someone asking why the drug store chain no longer accepted Tricare - the insurance plan used by military personnel, retirees and their families - began circulating on social media. \nBelow the nameless post someone using the name \"Nicholas Jones\" replied \"I'm a CVS manager. Stop acting like military and veterans deserve special treatment. They should really all be in prison.\" \nThe image spread quickly online with people expressing their outrage. CVS announced it was launching an investigation into the incident and on Friday, the Rhode Island-based chain said the post was a hoax. \n\"We have completed a full investigation of the anti-military comments made by someone claiming to be a CVS manager named \"Nicholas Jones.\" In fact, there is no CVS manager named \"Nicholas Jones,\" the company said. \n\"CVS has the utmost respect and gratitude for all who have served our country.\" \nCVS said there an employee in Texas whose name is Nicholas Jones. He is not a store manager. \n\"We have also confirmed that our employee with that same name, who has been falsely accused by some on social media, did not make these comments and had no involvement in their posting,\" CVS said. \nIn September, Tricare operator Express Scripts Holding Co. announced CVS would no longer be part of its pharmacy network and would be replaced by Walgreens. Rite Aid and Kroger pharmacies are also part of the network. The change over occurred Dec. 1. \nThe move requires Tricare users - some 9.4 million nationally - to switch from CVS to Walgreens or pay full price for prescription drugs. CVS said it was \"disappointed\" with the Tricare change. \n\"It was not our decision or desire to be excluded from the network. We have enjoyed serving members of the military, and have worked extremely hard to make the experience for each member as positive as possible,\" the company said. \n——— ©2016 Alabama Media Group, Birmingham Visit Alabama Media Group, Birmingham at www.al.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. related articles",

      "text": "1 Read / Add Comments \nMOUNT KISCO, N.Y. -- A fake call to the CVS drug store on Bedford Road reporting a car with men in the parking lot with AK-47's and a bomb, caused the Westchester County Police to turn out in force to the store. \nAt about 1 p.m., the CVS store received a call from a man who claimed there were males in a green car in the CVS parking lot who had AK-47 automatic weapons and a bomb, said Westchester County police Public Information Officer Kieran O'Leary. \nThe employee called county police who responded to the scene with multiple patrol officers. As a precaution, the department's Special Response Team -- SWAT Team -- also responded, he added. \nThe team set-up a command center at Leonard Park so officials did not have to close any city streets. \nThe incident was determined to be a hoax, or a \"swatting\" event, officials said. \n\" The investigation has been turned over to detectives who are working to see if we can determine where the call came from and who is responsible,\" O'Leary added. \nThe store was closed for a little over an hour while the matter was investigated but it was able to reopen for business after that time. \nSwatting is the act of deceiving an emergency service into sending police and special response teams to a specific location and usually include bomb threats, murder or hostage-taking.
