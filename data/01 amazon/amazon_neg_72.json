      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nTarget , Wal-Mart and Kohl's each set some sort of online record over the five-day shopping extravaganza that ended Cyber Monday. Yet for many bricks-and-mortar retailers, blockbuster digital growth wasn't enough to close the gap with Amazon . \nAccording to new data by Slice Intelligence, which scanned more than 1 million online shopping receipts from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Amazon accounted for 30.9 percent of sales. It was followed by Best Buy at 7.4 percent, Target at 4.4 percent, and Wal-Mart at 4.1 percent. \nBest Buy, which entered the weekend fresh off a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report , saw the biggest improvement of the top 10 retailers, growing its share of spending by 1.3 points over 2015. Apple also recorded a gain, closing the gap with larger chains like Nordstrom and Kohl's. \nBut Wal-Mart, which said that it saw a record number of visits on its website from the start of Black Friday through Cyber Monday, fell back in the rankings, according to Slice's data. Whereas Wal-Mart's share of spend dipped 1 point to 4.1 percent, Target eked out a small gain, pushing it to 4.4 percent of spending. \nMacy's , which suffered a massive site outage for much of Black Friday, saw its share dip slightly. \nBroadly speaking, the larger bricks-and-mortar chains are the ones that are more effectively competing with Amazon, Adobe's Mickey Mericle told CNBC earlier this week . Over the five-day shopping stretch, those bigger chains grew their online sales at roughly 2 ½ times the rate of smaller players, Mericle said. \n\"They've figured out the key, which we're seeing is really the combination of social and mobile and email,\" she said. \nAlong with fine-tuning their messaging mix, major retailers have seen an uptick in the number of shoppers electing to use their in-store pickup services. At J.C. Penney , for example, one-third of online orders are now collected from its 1,000-plus locations. \nFrom Nov. 1 to Nov. 28, retailers rang up $39.97 billion in online sales — a 7.6 percent increase over the same period last year, according to Adobe Digital Insights. That includes record-setting Black Friday and Cyber Monday events, and captures 80 percent of all transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers. (The firm does not disclose whether or not Amazon's sales are included.) \nThat firm predicts online revenue will increase 11 percent this year , to $91.6 billion. And while a hefty chunk of this season's sales is sure to go to Amazon, there's room for traditional retailers to grab a piece as well. \n\"In a growing market, it's not a zero-sum game,\" Andrew Lipsman,   and insights for comScore, told CNBC. \nComScore's data shows that Amazon, eBay , Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Target were the most visited retail websites on desktop computers and mobile devices on Cyber Monday. show chapters",

      "text": "Amazon's new Snowmobile data truck. Image: Amazon It's Time to Start Thinking of Amazon as a Transportation Company   10:00   \nAmazon’s newest toy is here, just in time for the holidays. Nope, it’s not a drone . It’s not taking flight at all , although it’s in the cargo business. It’s a 45-foot-long shipping container that hauls a million gigabytes of your precious data. \nDubbed Snowmobile , the truck stores up to 100 petabytes, or 1 million gigabytes, of data to move exabytes to Amazon Web Services “in a matter of weeks.” It’s in the family of Amazon’s smaller-scale data transfer project Snowball , which moves less-massive amounts of data via an appliance sent through regional carriers. \nIt rolled onto the stage at the Las Vegas re:Invent 2016 conference to the electric synth-guitar licks of a professional wrestler’s entrance music: \nAWS Angel Gonzalez November 30, 2016 \nAnd despite the comically flashy unveiling, Amazon appears to be offering this idea as a serious business, writing on an FAQ page : \"Snowmobile jobs cost $0.005/GB/month based on the amount of provisioned Snowmobile storage capacity and the end to end duration of the job, which starts when a Snowmobile departs an AWS data center for delivery to the time when data ingestion into AWS is complete.\" \nAs for how that job looks: one (or more) of these big rigs backs it up to your data center, plugs-in with a fiber connection, glug-glugs your financial data, millions of feature-length films, scads of scientific data (or whatever you’ve got hoarded), and trucks it away to one of Amazon's cloud storage services. This process cuts what would be a years or decades-long transfer over the Internet down to weeks. \nThe trailer is equipped with GPS tracking, is waterproof, climate-controlled, and comes with a security escort vehicle and guards to watch over your transfer. It takes 10 days to fill the truck, but Amazon will supply security in case someone tries to pull off a physical heist of your data. \nThe truck is just the latest in a series of announcements that have Amazon looking more like a transportation business than a mere online retailer. Shipping costs have long been Amazon’s “big albatross,” as Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, which follows Amazon closely told Motherboard last year : “They’re always looking for ways to bring that under control.\" \nConsidering how Uber’s self-driving truck subsidiary Otto showed off its own machismo-loaded autonomous rig last month , and given with Amazon’s interest in intelligent mapping systems and autonomous delivery via drone, it’s not hard to see where this project might one day end up. Amazon could be the Uber of cargo instead of people, and increasingly, that cargo is digital data. But for now at least, humans will still be at the wheel. \nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .

      "title": "Alexa, Tell Me Where You’re Going Next – Backchannel",
      "text": "Alexa, Tell Me Where You’re Going Next Amazon’s VP of Alexa talks about machine learning, chatbots, and whether industry is strip-mining AI talent from academia. In the Game of Thrones -like artificial intelligence competition between Houses Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, the company most reticent to speak about its technology has usually been the one that ships planeloads full of stuff to consumers, hosts thousands of companies in its data centers, greenlit Catastrophe , and has a breakaway hit product that answers questions, plays music, and 4,998 or so other things. Yes, for some time, Amazon has been even more shrouded than the famously secret Apple, which opened up about its machine learning programs earlier this year. Lately, however, Amazon’s head scientist and vice president of Alexa, Rohit Prasad, has been speaking up in public, making the case for his company’s prowess in voice recognition and natural language understanding. Alexa, of course, is the conversational platform that supports that aforementioned hit product, Echo .\nToday Prasad is giving an Alexa “State of the Union” address at the Amazon Web Services conference in Las Vegas, announcing an improved version of the Alexa Skills Kit , which helps developers create the equivalent of apps for the platform; a beefed-up Alexa Voice Service , which will make it easier to transform third-party devices like refrigerators and cars into Alexa bots; a partnership with Intel; and the Alexa Accelerator that, with the startup incubator Techstars , will run a 13-week program to help newcomers build Alexa skills. Prasad and Amazon haven’t revealed sales numbers, but industry experts have estimated that Amazon has sold over five million Echo devices so far.\nPrasad, who joined Amazon in 2013, spent some time with Backchannel before his talk today to illuminate the direction of Alexa and discuss how he’s recruiting for Jeff Bezos’s arsenal without drying up the AI pipeline. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nSteven Levy: You’re a VP of Alexis. Tell me where things stand with it in 2016. \nRohit Prasad Rohit Prasad: We’re excited about where things are. We did several device launches and also expanded internationally. And we’ve made huge progress in teaching Alexa to better understand you, both in terms of the surface area Alexa covers, as well as accuracy within search material. For instance, think about music as a domain: We have new capabilities [for] you [to be] able to search for or play a song, based on its lyrics. And lastly is the speed at which third-party skills are being built. Earlier this year we had only a few hundred, and now we are in the 5,000 range.\nWhat are the conversational aspirations for the Alexa platform? Are our Echos something we should be talking to, or talking with? \nAlexa is already providing a large set of utilities and experiences, where a few one-shot intents work with very high accuracy. From a conversational aspect, I think there a lot of trade-offs on doing it right. Alexa shouldn’t come back and ask you [needless] questions. That would be really frustrating. But Alexa should always ask a question when needed, and the ability to have a conversation is super important as well. Are you aware of the Alexa Prize competition?\nThis is the $2.5 million challenge to computer science students that you announced in September? \nYes. In academia it’s hard to do research in conversation areas because they don’t have a system like Alexa to work with. So we are making it easy to build new conversational capabilities with a modified version of the Alexa skills kit. This grand challenge is to create a social bot that can carry on a meaningful, coherent, and engaging conversation for 20 minutes.\nWould that be a Turing-level kind of conversation, do you think? \nNo, the Turing test comes down to human gullibility — can you fool an outsider into thinking it’s a human? If you think about certain tasks, Alexa is already better than a human. It’s super hard for a human to play a particular song out of millions of catalog entries within a second, right? If you ask Alexa to compute factorial of 60, that’s hard for a human. So we definitely did not want it to be like a Turing test. It’s more about coherence and engagement.\nWhat are people going to be talking about in these 20 minute conversations with Alexa? \nWe are giving topics. Like, “Can you talk on the trending topics in today’s newspaper?” We expect the social bot to be able to chat with you on topics like scientific inventions, or the financial crisis.\nHave you had a lot of responses to the challenge? \nWe got an overwhelming number of applications, hundreds and hundreds. We are providing funding to university students — these are grad students who are also taking time off from their research, or hopefully it’s very aligned with their research, so we wanted to make sure that they have sponsorship for the compelling application of speech. We got so many that we couldn’t decide on the original ten we had planned, and we ended up funding twelve teams .\nBecause of the huge demand in corporations for the best students in AI and machine learning, there’s worry that academia might lose its core talent. \nIt is a concern. This is one of the reasons that I was motivated to start the Alexa Prize. We want to build the next generation of machine learning and AI scientists, and academia plays an important role in that. I think it would be very myopic and very scary if every professor moved to companies like us.\nOn the other hand, you are obviously hiring AI talent, competing with with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and even traditional companies. What’s the pitch that you give potential recruits to come to Amazon? \nI don’t think I should answer that, because those other companies will copy it.\nActually, if you answer it well, those people might read it here and apply to work at Amazon .\nWhat’s unique about research in a company like Amazon is the combination of data, computing power, and the best minds in the world all coming together to solve a customer-facing problem. Working on a customer-facing problem doesn’t take away the innovation — it actually accelerates innovation. The problems we try to solve at Amazon are all super, super hard. When Alexa started, solving speech recognition and natural language understanding across many different domains was clearly a very, very hard problem.\nToday you are announcing new tools that will help developers, right? \nYes. One of the key things we want to make simple for developers is what we call “built-in intent” and “slot types.”\nExplain, please. \nIn most skills, people will want to say things like, “Alexa, stop.” Or “cancel.” You want those commands, or intents, to be exposed to the developer, rather than trying to tell developers to build customized versions of things like the cancel/stop intent. Slot types are things like city names, vocabulary items. We had previously done a handful of them, things developers use quite often — around 10 intents and 15 slot types. So as part of third-party skills we’re announcing a larger set of hundreds built-in functions — slot types — across different domains, like books, video, or local businesses. And also a large set of intents as well, which help answer queries that people ask Alexa.\nSo in other words, if I’m the developer, I can rely on your built-in vocabulary and your interpretation of synonyms, in order to make my skill smarter off the bat. And you’re doing more. \nExactly. It gives you a much better starting point for interaction with skills. We’re announcing this as a developer preview, because of two reasons. One is, we want to see how people use these in their intents, because we have a certain mindset of how these intents and types should be used. But the developer may have a slightly different mindset. And the customer may use it slightly differently as well. We want to make sure that we get some feedback from the developers and continually improve these, and we will keep adding more and more built-ins.\nRight now, when users invoke a skill on Echo, the mind of Alexa, to some degree, gets turned over to that developer. So what you’re implementing today is a step toward a standard Alexa vocabulary and means of execution that developers will plug into? \nYou’re absolutely right, this creates a common vocabulary which works for sharing and for helping Alexa itself to become better and better. Developers can integrate this new functionality so that they don’t have to recreate the same things.\nMy issue with Alexa is I’m just overwhelmed by what is available. Generally, you have to know that a skill exists in order to invoke it. Now that you are at 5,000 skills and counting, how can a user keep up? \nWe definitely want Alexa to tell you how to accomplish your query through a third-party skill, even if you don’t have knowledge of the skill. We haven’t done it yet, but definitely that’s something on our roadmap. Having a common vocabulary helps get us to that connection.\nAmazon is only one of several companies using AI to build a conversational interface. What’s unique about your approach? \nThe hands-free ability is key. That’s the killer application for speech. If you think about Alexa and Echo in particular, there was no cop-out in terms of solving the hard problem of interaction without a screen. So our thinking, from the get-go, was very different from other companies in terms of how conversation interface should be. It wasn’t like on a phone; it was a completely dedicated device which didn’t have a screen. We had to solve the hard problem.\nWhat about people who are concerned about having an open mic in the home? What can you tell people who are worried about, “Oh my god, Amazon is listening to me all the time!” \nPrivacy is important, and we are being very, very transparent about how we are approaching this. The cloud is not listening to you. It’s only on the device, acting as a detector, not a recognizer recognizing all words. It’s detecting whether Alexa is spoken versus something else. Once it determines Alexa was spoken to the device at a very high confidence, only then do we start streaming to the cloud.\nWill Alexa become proactive like Google Now or Apple notifications? Maybe telling me, if it hears me knocking around the house, that I should leave because I’m late for an appointment? \nWe’ve definitely thought about it. Because there’s no screen on Echo, there are some new [challenges] to it. We want to do things right with anything in terms of the kind of notifications you’re talking about. But right now I can’t reveal our exact approach to that.\nRight now, people pretty much have to choose one conversational interface for their assistant. Will we ever see some mashup where Alexa, Cortana, Google Home, or Samsung Viv, or whatever, all work together? \nIt’s very early days in these conversational settings. Having seen this for 20-plus years I still feel that the [intellectual property] of Alexa and Echo are revolutionary material, specifically in terms of interface. I think it remains to be seen; every company has a different set of offerings so you can imagine that there would be multiple AIs. But in terms of interoperation, it’s too early to tell.\nEcho, and the Alexa technology, seemed to come as a surprise to a lot of us, and at first people thought it was intended as a quick way to buy products from Amazon. Now it’s one of Amazon’s most popular products and a significant platform. Has your mission shifted? \nI wouldn’t say the mission has shifted. We are still very much doing things that we said three years back we should be doing. Right now there’s just a lot to do to make Alexa even more magical for our customers.",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nVadim Georgiev/Shutterstock\nMost people could stand to devote more time to reading. We all make room in our busy schedules for the latest seasons of our favorite TV shows, but we reserve too little time for books.\nIf you're looking for something to keep you occupied before bed or on your commute to work this December, we suggest checking out Amazon's Best Books of the Month , a section of the site wholly dedicated to new releases in literature and fiction, nonfiction, history, and so on.\nYou'll find a spotlight pick (this month's is Michael Lewis' \" The Undoing Project \"), and nine other books that the Amazon book editors loved for this month.\nKeep scrolling. One of these recommendations might just inspire your next hardcover or Kindle purchase.\nCaptions are have been provided by Erin Kodicek, Editor of Books and Kindle at Amazon.com.\nView As: One Page Slides \"The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds\" Amazon For fans of books like \"Thinking Fast and Slow,\" \"Grit,\" \"Freakonomics,\" and \"Outliers,\" bestselling author Michael Lewis’ \"The Undoing Project\" is about the duo who invented the field of Behavioral Economics.\nBuy it here >>\n\"Normal: A Novel\" Amazon Famed graphic novelist Warren Ellis has written a taut techno-thriller set in the near future. In \"Normal,\" an exhausted strategist uncovers a vast conspiracy while on holiday, after his roommate disappears, leaving only a pile of insects behind.\nBuy it here >>\n\"Against Empathy\" Amazon Prevailing logic suggests that employing empathy in our decision-making process is a good thing. Not so! says psychologist Paul Bloom. In \"Against Empathy,\" he argues that such decisions come from an emotional place, rather than a logical one, which can result in us making incorrect, less moral conclusions.\nBuy it here >>\n\"Christmas Days: 12 Stories and 12 Feasts for 12 Days\" Amazon Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, these twelve highly imaginative holiday tales with accompanying recipes will warm the cockles of your (cynical/terrified/hopeful) heart.\nBuy it here >>\n\"Game of Queens: The Women Who Made Sixteenth-Century Europe\" Amazon The phrase \"Girl Power\" may very well trace its origins to sixteenth-century Europe, where some very loved and loathed women — many (many) of them named Mary — managed to shape history. The title’s wink at a certain popular HBO series is not a coincidence…\nBuy it here >>\n\"Mincemeat: The Education of an Italian Chef\" Amazon Fans of books like Anthony Bourdain’s \"Kitchen Confidential\" will devour this memoir by chef and anthropologist Leonardo Lucarelli. Like Bourdain, Lucarelli highlights the fascinating moral code that cooks adhere to, despite their often dubious backgrounds.\nBuy it here >>\n\"The Signals Are Talking: Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's Mainstream\" Amazon In this fast-paced, technologically driven world, it can be difficult parsing out what’s important — the things that will have a lasting impact on our future — and the things that are merely passing trends. In \"The Signals Are Talking,\" Amy Webb helps us to focus, and plan for the future.\nBuy it here >>\n\"Prince Lestate and the Realms of Atlantis\" Amazon \"Prince Lestate and the Realms of Atlantis\" provides proof that vampires never die. The latest in Rice’s lauded Vampire Chronicles series finds our anti-hero, Prince Lestat, reckoning with an ancient evil, one that reveals a connection between vampires and the mysterious island of Atlantis.\nBuy it here >>\n\"Krazy: George Herriman, A Life In Black And White\" Amazon I’ll admit that when I picked up this book I had no idea who George Herriman was (apologies to the rabid Krazy Kat fans out there!). But I think it’s telling that this biography of the comic strip’s creator is fascinating, and surprising, nonetheless.\nBuy it here >>\n\"The Seventh Plague: A Sigma Force Novel\" Amazon What would happen if the biblical plagues were unleashed on the modern world? James Rollins’s latest action/adventure novel blends science and history to explore this terrifying possibility.\nBuy it here >>\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "text": "Amazon Prime Adds HBO and Cinemax Subscription Options Posted by Evan Selleck   tweet \nAmazon Prime already offers Showtime as a packaged option to add for paying subscribers, and now a couple of other options are joining the ranks. \nAmazon has officially announced today that Amazon Prime subscribers can now attach not only HBO onto their streaming package, but also Cinemax by way of Amazon Channels. Pricing is different for both options, though. For HBO, Amazon Prime users will need to fork over $14.99 per month for access to the streaming option, while Cinemax will cost an additional $9.99 per month if they choose to add that option as well. \n“HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning shows in television history,” said Amazon VP of digital video Michael Paull in an official statement. “Prime members can now watch the latest episodes of the critically-acclaimed Westworld and Game of Thrones without the need for a cable subscription. We’re thrilled to work with HBO to bring their cutting-edge content to Amazon Prime members with Amazon Channels.” \nIt’s another option for Prime subscribers, which already offers Starz and Showtime, but it’s up against growing competition. AT&T just announced DirecTV Now , for instance, which offers the option to include HBO streaming, and access to HBO Go, for only $5 per month. \nDo you use Amazon Prime?",

      "text": "In a race to widen their respective developer networks, Amazon and Google have released separate self-service tools to help inventors create apps based on machine learning that will ultimately make it easier for brands to work with the technology.\n\nAmazon has made three of its   tools available to developers within its Web Services group, marking the first time that the company has allowed outside inventors to build apps and services on its technology.\nBuilding AI capabilities into apps requires access to large amounts of data and expertise in machine learning and neural networks. The deep and machine-learning algorithms require access to automatic speech recognition, natural-language understanding and classification to collect and train the networks to recognize phrases, speech inflections, objects, and keywords.\nThe group, Amazon AI , features three services: Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition. Lex, the technology that powers Amazon Alexa, allows any developer to build conversational experiences for Web, mobile and connected devices. Capital One, OhioHealth, HubSpot and Twillo have used Amazon Lex to build out chatbots for their respective companies.  \nThe Washington Post and GoAnimate used Amazon Polly to turn text into speech, enabling their respective apps to talk with 47 lifelike voices in multiple languages.\nThe third tool, Rekognition -- which Redfin, and SmugMug applied to apps -- allows app users to sort through images. The application uses deep learning-based image and face recognition.\nGoogle also has been pushing self-serve tools, trying hard to convince developers to adopt technology that allows them to create bots for Google Assistant through Actions on Google, which the company should release earlier this month. Venture Beat reported in October that a software development kit (SDK) that brings Google Assistant into device not made by Google should become available next year.\nIn addition, there is also  G Suite , a collection of Web-based productivity tools formerly known as Google Apps.\nThe new offering that Google App Maker announced this week rolls out as part of G Suite for Business. It's a browser-based platform that pushes the ability to build internal business apps without the need to write code. It aims to offer easy integration with Gmail, Drive and Docs, as well as machine learning capabilities, but not on the scale of Amazon AI.\nGoogle App Maker offers developer tools to build apps that Google says can make every day processes simple and easier to manage through the cloud without worrying about servers, capacity planning and infrastructure security.",

      "text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) seems to be hitting the purple patch, as its Amazon Web Services, or AWS, announced two contract wins in as many days. 2 Deals, 2 Days \nAmazon announced on Tuesday that Capital One has selected AWS as its predominant cloud infrastructure provider. \nClose on heels of the company picking up Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF ) as its cloud customer, it announced Wednesday Workday Inc (NYSE: WDAY ) too has selected its AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider for customer production workloads. \nAmazon stated that it is offering the option of running Workday's full suite of applications, including Workday Financial Management and Workday Human Capital Management for the first time in the public cloud. Workday said it would make available the option of using, either AWS Cloud or Workday data centers, to its customers in Canada in calendar year 2017 and then look to expand the scope geographically. RE:Invent Revelations \nIn the AWS re:Invent Conference held in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Amazon announced seven new compute services and capabilities to support an even wider range of workloads. The company unveiled the next generation of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is memory optimized, compute optimized, and has high input/output (I/O) instances, and features the latest processors, storage technologies and enhanced networking. The new F1 instance with customer-programmable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) boosts performance 30 times relative to general purpose CPU. Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs allow customers to easily attach low-cost, professional grade graphics acceleration to Amazon EC2 instances. AWS also announced Amazon Lightsail, which gives developers the ability to launch powerful virtual private servers in only three clicks for a simple, low monthly price. \nAt last check, Amazon shares were slipping 1.34 percent to $752.44. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "title": "Amazon Destroys Competition, Taking 30% of Cyber Weekend Sales",
      "text": "Source: Wikimedia Commons No wonder so many large retail chains continue to close stores, and will do more in the future. As e-commerce sales rise as a portion of total retail, a huge portion of the market belongs to Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), leaving other retailers to fight for much more modest market share. Based on new research, Amazon took nearly a third of all Cyber Weekend sales.\nCyber Weekend has passed and data from Slice Intelligence shows online Black Friday sales were up 20%, while Cyber Monday sales grew 10% this year. Sales so far in November are 15% higher this year, relative to 2015.\nSlice Intelligence also pointed out :\nOver 30 percent of the revenue generated during Cyber Weekend went to Amazon, making it the retail winner for the early holiday season. Nearly seven percent of sales went to Best Buy, which is up from six percent in 2015. Apple also made gains with their Black Friday sale and was the eighth largest retailer over this period. Conversely, both Walmart and Macy’s saw their share drop slightly over Cyber Weekend compared to last year.\nThe news is good for Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY), which has been a particular target of Amazon’s huge consumer electronics segment, much of which encompasses its own hardware products such as Echo, Alexa and Kindle.\nApple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) data points to a picture that is less clear. Many of its sales go through consumer electronics stores and those of the three wireless carriers. An iPhone could be bought at Best Buy.\nThe data is particularly troubling for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), which has struggled to keep customers from moving to Amazon. It has invested hundreds of millions of dollars on e-commerce and recently paid $3.3 billion for start-up Jet.com as a means to increase its online footprint.\nSlice points out that the traditional wisdom about retail is true. There is Amazon, and then everyone else. Those in the latter category are dying.\n\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "title": "Stream on: Amazon adds premium networks HBO and Cinemax to Channels feature",
      "text": "(Amazon Photo) Amazon’s claim to the streaming throne may have just gotten a little stronger.\nThe Seattle retail giant this morning announced the ability for Prime members to add premium channels HBO and Cinemax to their streaming catalog for a monthly fee via Amazon Video’s Channels feature. Amazon previously added other networks like Starz and Showtime, giving people who want premium channels to watch their favorite shows like Game of Thrones and Westworld an alternative to pricey cable packages or having to manage a deluge of network apps.\nHBO was already available without a cable subscription for $14.99 a month, the same price you’d pay to add it on Amazon. Cinemax — $9.99 a month on Amazon — could previously be had through a subscription to Sling TV. But Amazon is betting that the new channels will be an added incentive for people to subscribe to its Prime membership program. It also allows people to stay within the Amazon Video ecosystem when flipping between channels rather than having to cycle through multiple apps.\nIt’s a good time to be a cord cutter, as the battle for streaming supremacy has caused companies to seriously raise their game. Netflix continues to lead the way, and its global expansion earlier this year shows how serious it is about worldwide domination. Netflix’s app recently popped up on Comcast X1 set-top boxes, following a deal in July between the two rivals. And just this week, Netflix announced the ability to download programs directly , a feature Amazon instituted last year .\nBut Amazon itself is planning a global expansion , and it continues to add new programs and features all the time. Taking aim squarely at Netflix, Amazon in April began offering a monthly $8.99 Prime subscription so members could access its video streaming service.\nA big new player joined the fray earlier this week as AT&T announced its streaming network DirecTV Now . Just released Wednesday, the app lets people stream some of the top live TV networks, with a focus on mobile devices.",

      "text": "Amazon begins rolling out new Fire TV user interface 12/01/2016 by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nAmazon’s Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices are getting a new look… or rather, the software that they display on your TV screen is getting an overhaul. The hardware looks pretty much the same. \nIn October Variety gave us a sneak peek at the new Fire TV user interface, which moves the navigation from the left side of the screen to the top, offers a more colorful look, and generally… looks a lot like Android TV . \nNow Amazon is starting to roll out Fire OS 5.2.4.0 which features the new design, along with some other changes. \nAccording to Cord Cutters News and AFTVnews , the update is rolling out first to 2nd-gen Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices, but it should eventually be available to owners of 1st-gen hardware as well. \nAside from the new design, there’s also a new notification center , which allows app developers to push information about app updates and other non-urgent news. \nWhen a notification is available, you’ll see an indicator next to the Settings tab on the home screen. Opening the Notifications menu lets you view any available notices, take actions suggested by them (such as updating an app) dismiss them, or adjust your settings. Share this:",

      "title": "Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker",
      "text": "amazon echo vs google home versus header More Google\nLike Rome and Carthage, Google and Amazon continue to try and seize footholds in each other’s territory. The drumbeats of war again resounded when Google revealed a new speaker during its Google I/O keynote in May. Google Home was seen as a direct response to the Amazon Echo, a smart speaker that can respond to users’ questions and commands. Amazon certainly had the head start in this competition, having launched the Echo in late 2014. The Echo was an impressive device at launch — as our review indicates — meaning the Home needed to make quite the splash to catch up with its worthy adversary. Now that the fateful day of digital assistant, smart-home reckoning is here, how do these two products stack up against one another in terms of design, features, and pricing?\nMore: Google Home review\nDesign As if to highlight the inherent differences between the Home and Echo, Google’s device features a plain white body, in contrast to the Echo’s dark chassis.\nThe Home features LED lights on the top to indicate when the device is working and a touch-sensitive top. It also touts a modular base, so you can swap out the default base for one that better matches your living space. The petite, curvy device certainly seems friendlier than Amazon’s tiny monolith. Of course, the Echo is beautiful in its own way, with a sturdy build and matte black (or all-white ) finish that conveys dependability. Judging purely by aesthetics, you will have to decide which device suits your decor better.\nLike the Echo — but unlike Amazon’s like-minded Tap speaker — the Home must be plugged in to function . This means you’ll have to consider its placement in your home and you won’t be carrying it around, but Google promises that tethering it to an outlet makes it a better speaker. When we first reviewed the Echo, we noted that while it won’t win any audiophiles’ hearts, it’s a full-sounding speaker with a respectable amount of bass. It’s also loud enough to fill up a fairly large room. Caleb Denison, a Digital Trends’ senior editor thinks the Echo outperforms the Home on sound, writing in our review, “While Amazon’s full-size Echo has a very large sound with full bass that doesn’t go overboard, Google’s Home over-juices the bass, and ends up sounding like it’s trying too hard.”\nWith Home, you can utilize other speakers via Wi-Fi and Google “Cast,” making th is one of the biggest differences between the two smart devices. The Echo can also sync with the Amazon Tap or Dot to give you great flexibility (and portability) when setting up your home audio system and smart home.\nIt appears that Google would prefer owners to sync their Home and Cast devices, or include several Homes, to fulfill the same role as the all-encompassing Echo, Dot, and Tap. By u tilizing Google Home in unison with the supported devices, you are able to play music in various rooms across your home, while still reaping the device’s voice-controlled features.\nOnce Home and all correlating devices are fully mapped, you can make very specific requests. Ask Home to “Play Santo and Johnny in the living room,” for instance, and the device will have Sleep Walk playing in no time. This makes Google Home similar to Sonos’ speaker systems, with the added benefit of voice-command technology. It shares similar functionality with Chromecast devices, too, letting you play YouTube videos on your TV by saying something like, “OK, Google, play the Rogue One trailer on the living room TV.” Even in a house brimming with Google Homes, the company claims that only the closest unit will respond.\nMore: Amazon Echo review\nBoth the Echo and the Home also utilize microphones with far-field technology. Google claims it has incorporated hundreds of thousands of various audio environments to ensure the Home can isolate speech even in an environment with added ambient sounds.\nWinner: Home on adaptability, Echo on sound\nUsefulness and connectivity The Echo and Home are more than just pretty speakers. They are meant to be proto-AIs, helping users control smart home devices and process tasks hands-free. The Echo can integrate with your Amazon Prime account, giving you access to all the music, movies, and apps you normally have access to. Google Home, meanwhile, taps into Google’s suite of apps, including Google Play. Of course, the latter will also integrate with Google’s Nest appliances, allowing you to, for example, set the temperature to 70 degrees Fahrenheit in specific rooms in your home. The Echo already works with many smart-home devices , and is fairly agnostic when it comes to different brands.\nRead More Google has thus far partnered with Nest, Samsung SmartThings, IFTTT, and Philips. Here, Home has the edge, because you can get away with being a little less rigorous about how exactly you execute commands, and it seamlessly switches the color of Hue bulbs. The Echo’s built-in AI assistant, Alexa, on the other hand, currently requires an IFTTT trigger to do so. Home also works with Sony and LG televisions to support Chromecast Audio TV. Google has assured us that Netflix will soon work with Home as well, and like Amazon’s Skills, Google said it will open Home to developers with a new service called Actions come December. We can only hope a slew of useful third-party apps will follow.\nView photos\ngoogle-home-io-1-970x646 More Alexa can carry out a variety of functions, such as playing music, adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and so forth. She can also answer questions, set timers and alarms, and make shopping lists.\nMore: Everything that works with Google Home\nHome makes use of Google Assistant, a no-nonsense helper who seems like the next evolution of personal computer assistants. Google Assistant can, like Alexa, perform a number of personal tasks, from playing music and checking for traffic, to scanning your calendar for events. Google Assistant can also answer questions, and this is where it really shines. Google has branded this new personal assistant as being “conversational.” Not only can it respond to inquiries and provide the appropriate response, but it can retain that information and respond to follow-up questions.\nFor example, if you were to ask, “Who is Jessica Chastain?” Google Assistant could then provide a basic summary of the actress based on her Wikipedia entry. You could then ask, “What’s her most recent movie?” and Google will supposedly relay the information. In reality, though, it just tells you some recent movies that she’s not in, such as Bad Santa 2 and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . However, when you ask, “Who wrote The Giving Tree ?” Home answers with Shel Silverstein. Follow up with, “When was it written?” and Home will say 1964. Alexa can answer the first question but gives up when you ask for the year, even if you repeat the book’s name.\nMore: Every device that connects to Amazon’s Alexa\nWhile the Echo lets you set up different household profiles so you can switch between users — which is very useful if you and your loved ones have different tastes in music — Google Home is still bound to a single account. If you ask how your morning commute looks, for instance, you’ll only get the traffic for your spouse’s commute.\nFor now, Amazon’s Echo has far more skills. And while many, like bacon facts or pickup lines, aren’t super useful, its integration with services such as Kayak, Lyft, and Uber are great. Google has some catching up to do here.\nWinner: Amazon Echo\nPricing The Amazon Echo is currently on sale and retails for $179. Google wanted to undercut its competitor, and as such, the device retails for $129. Google’s price point also includes six months of YouTube Red, the platform’s paid subscription service .\nWinner: Google Home\nOverall winner: Amazon Echo From a purely aesthetic perspective, Home is by far the superior device. The elegant design begs to be showcased in any room, whereas the Amazon Echo has the of overall aesthetic of an LED-equipped dumbbell. Nonetheless, the Echo is certainly one of the most intriguing devices we’ve seen in the last year or two, one that offers a lot of functionality with minimal effort.\namazon-echo-2 More Google Home is a worthy competitor on many fronts, though. It’s a more intelligent helper, one that can respond to increasingly complex demands.\nCurrently, the Echo is far ahead in terms of third-party support, meaning it already lets you order a Domino’s pizza or a dozen roses from 1-800-Flowers. With the forthcoming addition of Actions, however, Google is attempting to catch up in this category. Regardless of how it turns out, the gauntlet has been thrown.\nBuy Google Home from:\nGoogle Best Buy Target Walmart\nBuy Amazon Echo from:\nAmazon\nAmazon is having a 1-day sale on the Echo, $40 off Everything you need to know about the Google Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra Google's Chromecast Audio will set your music free without the Sonos price tag",

      "title": "Tiger Group Experts: ABL Lenders Should ‘Have No Fear’ Of Amazon",
      "text": "Some asset-based lenders (ABLs) still hesitate to lend against inventory held at Amazon’s warehouses. However, savvy e-tailers, distributors and manufacturers increasingly see the upside of using the e-commerce giant as a closeout channel, write two liquidation and asset appraisal experts from Tiger Group in the November/December issue of ABF Journal. Typically, lenders cite Amazon’s lack of a collateral access agreement as well as its ban on liquidation language. But Tiger’s Andy Babcock, Director of Transition Services, and Ryan Davis, Director of Appraisals, note a dramatic increase in the amount of inventory moving through the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. “Lenders would be wise to pay attention, as this shift will affect liquidation strategies, and therefore net recovery values, for a wide variety of companies,” they write in the piece (“Have No Fear: Why the Rise of Amazon Is Good For the ABL Sector”).\nBabcock and Davis explain the three avenues available for the sale of merchandise on Amazon. In the first, Amazon purchases and warehouses inventory in its own facilities and ships orders to consumers. “Amazon typically chooses the items it stocks based on historical and projected demand, focusing primarily on branded items with relatively fast turnover,” they write.\nIn the second, a company can use the marketing-through-Amazon approach. Here, products are listed on Amazon’s website through a seller account. “Unlike websites like eBay, which require sellers to write their own item descriptions, Amazon has developed a simple process: A seller can search for the exact item on Amazon, use that description and input the quantity available,” Babcock and Davis explain.\nThe third method is Amazon’s FBA program. “Here, Amazon serves not only as a marketing site, but as a third-party warehouse and logistics provider,” write the Tiger Group veterans. “Sellers send their inventory to Amazon’s warehouses and don’t have to deal with warehousing inventory or shipping products. The seller retains ownership of the merchandise, and Amazon automatically maintains the inventory and credits sales to the seller’s account.”\nImportantly, FBA merchandise qualifies for Amazon’s popular Prime program, which not only gives participating customers expedited free shipping, but also improves the seller’s placement in the search-results if there are multiple sellers, the authors note. “Amazon handles all packaging, shipping and — crucially — all customer returns,” they explain. “FBA program participants pay warehousing and shipping charges, as well as the standard per-unit sales commissions and fees.”\nToday, many disposition specialists prefer to see inventories liquidated through FBA, as opposed to the traditional jobber model, because the revenues and expenses are often more predictable and controllable than running a sale with company employees and facilities, Babcock and Davis write.\nThree options are available when liquidating inventory already situated in a FBA facility: a physical transfer out of Amazon’s sites, an ownership transfer and sale through FBA, or continued use of the debtor’s FBA account. According to Babcock and Davis, lenders can realize the best recovery when the liquidator works on a fee basis, selling the merchandise through FBA and utilizing the debtor company’s FBA account. “The total revenues generated under this fee-basis arrangement should, in effect, be the same as in the scenario where the inventory stays at FBA with an ownership transfer to the liquidator,” they write. “This method yields a lower profit for the liquidator, but generates more dollars for the estate.”\nThe article also addresses ABL lenders’ concerns about the lack of a collateral access agreement with Amazon. “Barring an extremely unlikely scenario — for instance, if the company had so few sales through the FBA channel that it actually owed more in fees than it generated in revenue — Amazon is likely to owe the debtor money and not the other way around,” they note. “Therefore, rather than pulling the inventory out of Amazon, the liquidator could continue to use the FBA service with no additional capital needed.”\nNor should lenders be overly concerned about the ban on liquidation language in this channel: “Selling through Amazon is almost purely about price,” Babcock and Davis explain. “Liquidators can spur demand by simply lowering the prices of a given product — without needing the strong sales language that they’ve used for decades to stir consumer interest in liquidation sales.\nWhile many lenders prefer to make all sales final in liquidations—a practice prohibited by Amazon policies—even this should not prevent liquidators from using Amazon, the authors maintain, citing the efficiency of Amazon’s return system. “The liquidator need only budget properly for the fees associated with returns to account for this factor,” they write.\nThe full column is available at: http://www.abfjournal.com/%3Fpost_type%3Darticles%26p%3D54815\n###\nMedia Contacts: At Parness & Associates Public Relations, Bill Parness, bparness(at)parnesspr(dot)com, (732) 290-0121 or Mobile: 732-673-6852.",

      "title": "BEZOS GROWING MONOPOLY… AMAZON captured 31% online spending over Cyber Weekend… Flashback– Trump: Bezos using ‘Washington Post’ to protect Amazon monopoly",
      "text": "Amazon’s Growing Power In The U.S. Economy according to a new report. \n“Behind the packages on the doorstep, and behind the inviting interface and seamless service that has consistently put the company at the top of corporate reputation rankings, , extending its tentacles across our economy, and with it, our lives,” says the report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. \nAccording to ISLR: \nToday, half of all U.S. households are subscribed to the membership program Amazon Prime, half of all online shopping searches start directly on Amazon, and Amazon captures nearly one in every two dollars that Americans spend online. Amazon sells more books, toys, and by next year, apparel and consumer electronics than any retailer online or off, and is investing heavily in its grocery business. \nAs a retailer, its market power now rivals or exceeds that of Walmart, and it stands only to grow: Within five years, one-fifth of the U.S.’s $3.6 trillion retail market will have shifted online, and Amazon is on track to capture two-thirds of that share. \nAnd the numbers grow with every new product and sales event. \nBlack Friday weekend was Amazon’s best-ever , according to the company. \n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/lauraheller/2016/11/30/amazons-growing-stranglehold-on-the-us-economy/#7a47e84f193e Amazon captured 31% of online spending over Cyber Weekend, data shows \nTarget , Wal-Mart and Kohl’s each set some sort of online record over the five-day shopping extravaganza that ended Cyber Monday. Yet for many bricks-and-mortar retailers, blockbuster digital growth wasn’t enough to close the gap with Amazon . \nAccording to new data by Slice Intelligence, which scanned more than 1 million online shopping receipts from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Amazon accounted for 30.9 percent of sales. It was followed by Best Buy at 7.4 percent, Target at 4.4 percent, and Wal-Mart at 4.1 percent. \nBest Buy, which entered the weekend fresh off a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report , saw the biggest improvement of the top 10 retailers, growing its share of spending by 1.3 points over 2015. Apple also recorded a gain, closing the gap with larger chains like Nordstrom and Kohl’s. Trump: Bezos using ‘Washington Post’ to protect Amazon monopoly \n\n\nOnce again Donald Trump has kindled the fires of conspiracy. \nThe soon-to-be Republican nominee for president says Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO who owns The Washington Post, is using the paper to attack him and the other political enemies who would force the massive online retailer to pay more in taxes. \nTrump told Sean Hannity in an interview Thursday that Bezos is using the Post “like a toy” and “for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.” 6 views Share and Enjoy",

      "title": "Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker",
      "text": "amazon echo vs google home versus header More Google\nLike Rome and Carthage, Google and Amazon continue to try and seize footholds in each other’s territory. The drumbeats of war again resounded when Google revealed a new speaker during its Google I/O keynote in May. Google Home was seen as a direct response to the Amazon Echo, a smart speaker that can respond to users’ questions and commands. Amazon certainly had the head start in this competition, having launched the Echo in late 2014. The Echo was an impressive device at launch — as our review indicates — meaning the Home needed to make quite the splash to catch up with its worthy adversary. Now that the fateful day of digital assistant, smart-home reckoning is here, how do these two products stack up against one another in terms of design, features, and pricing?\nMore: Google Home review\nDesign As if to highlight the inherent differences between the Home and Echo, Google’s device features a plain white body, in contrast to the Echo’s dark chassis.\nThe Home features LED lights on the top to indicate when the device is working and a touch-sensitive top. It also touts a modular base, so you can swap out the default base for one that better matches your living space. The petite, curvy device certainly seems friendlier than Amazon’s tiny monolith. Of course, the Echo is beautiful in its own way, with a sturdy build and matte black (or all-white ) finish that conveys dependability. Judging purely by aesthetics, you will have to decide which device suits your decor better.\nLike the Echo — but unlike Amazon’s like-minded Tap speaker — the Home must be plugged in to function . This means you’ll have to consider its placement in your home and you won’t be carrying it around, but Google promises that tethering it to an outlet makes it a better speaker. When we first reviewed the Echo, we noted that while it won’t win any audiophiles’ hearts, it’s a full-sounding speaker with a respectable amount of bass. It’s also loud enough to fill up a fairly large room. Caleb Denison, a Digital Trends’ senior editor thinks the Echo outperforms the Home on sound, writing in our review, “While Amazon’s full-size Echo has a very large sound with full bass that doesn’t go overboard, Google’s Home over-juices the bass, and ends up sounding like it’s trying too hard.”\nWith Home, you can utilize other speakers via Wi-Fi and Google “Cast,” making th is one of the biggest differences between the two smart devices. The Echo can also sync with the Amazon Tap or Dot to give you great flexibility (and portability) when setting up your home audio system and smart home.\nIt appears that Google would prefer owners to sync their Home and Cast devices, or include several Homes, to fulfill the same role as the all-encompassing Echo, Dot, and Tap. By u tilizing Google Home in unison with the supported devices, you are able to play music in various rooms across your home, while still reaping the device’s voice-controlled features.\nOnce Home and all correlating devices are fully mapped, you can make very specific requests. Ask Home to “Play Santo and Johnny in the living room,” for instance, and the device will have Sleep Walk playing in no time. This makes Google Home similar to Sonos’ speaker systems, with the added benefit of voice-command technology. It shares similar functionality with Chromecast devices, too, letting you play YouTube videos on your TV by saying something like, “OK, Google, play the Rogue One trailer on the living room TV.” Even in a house brimming with Google Homes, the company claims that only the closest unit will respond.\nMore: Amazon Echo review\nBoth the Echo and the Home also utilize microphones with far-field technology. Google claims it has incorporated hundreds of thousands of various audio environments to ensure the Home can isolate speech even in an environment with added ambient sounds.\nWinner: Home on adaptability, Echo on sound\nUsefulness and connectivity The Echo and Home are more than just pretty speakers. They are meant to be proto-AIs, helping users control smart home devices and process tasks hands-free. The Echo can integrate with your Amazon Prime account, giving you access to all the music, movies, and apps you normally have access to. Google Home, meanwhile, taps into Google’s suite of apps, including Google Play. Of course, the latter will also integrate with Google’s Nest appliances, allowing you to, for example, set the temperature to 70 degrees Fahrenheit in specific rooms in your home. The Echo already works with many smart-home devices , and is fairly agnostic when it comes to different brands.\nRead More Google has thus far partnered with Nest, Samsung SmartThings, IFTTT, and Philips. Here, Home has the edge, because you can get away with being a little less rigorous about how exactly you execute commands, and it seamlessly switches the color of Hue bulbs. The Echo’s built-in AI assistant, Alexa, on the other hand, currently requires an IFTTT trigger to do so. Home also works with Sony and LG televisions to support Chromecast Audio TV. Google has assured us that Netflix will soon work with Home as well, and like Amazon’s Skills, Google said it will open Home to developers with a new service called Actions come December. We can only hope a slew of useful third-party apps will follow.\ngoogle-home-io-1-970x646 More Alexa can carry out a variety of functions, such as playing music, adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and so forth. She can also answer questions, set timers and alarms, and make shopping lists.\nMore: Everything that works with Google Home\nHome makes use of Google Assistant, a no-nonsense helper who seems like the next evolution of personal computer assistants. Google Assistant can, like Alexa, perform a number of personal tasks, from playing music and checking for traffic, to scanning your calendar for events. Google Assistant can also answer questions, and this is where it really shines. Google has branded this new personal assistant as being “conversational.” Not only can it respond to inquiries and provide the appropriate response, but it can retain that information and respond to follow-up questions.\nFor example, if you were to ask, “Who is Jessica Chastain?” Google Assistant could then provide a basic summary of the actress based on her Wikipedia entry. You could then ask, “What’s her most recent movie?” and Google will supposedly relay the information. In reality, though, it just tells you some recent movies that she’s not in, such as Bad Santa 2 and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . However, when you ask, “Who wrote The Giving Tree ?” Home answers with Shel Silverstein. Follow up with, “When was it written?” and Home will say 1964. Alexa can answer the first question but gives up when you ask for the year, even if you repeat the book’s name.\nMore: Every device that connects to Amazon’s Alexa\nWhile the Echo lets you set up different household profiles so you can switch between users — which is very useful if you and your loved ones have different tastes in music — Google Home is still bound to a single account. If you ask how your morning commute looks, for instance, you’ll only get the traffic for your spouse’s commute.\nFor now, Amazon’s Echo has far more skills. And while many, like bacon facts or pickup lines, aren’t super useful, its integration with services such as Kayak, Lyft, and Uber are great. Google has some catching up to do here.\nWinner: Amazon Echo\nPricing The Amazon Echo is currently on sale and retails for $179. Google wanted to undercut its competitor, and as such, the device retails for $129. Google’s price point also includes six months of YouTube Red, the platform’s paid subscription service .\nWinner: Google Home\nOverall winner: Amazon Echo From a purely aesthetic perspective, Home is by far the superior device. The elegant design begs to be showcased in any room, whereas the Amazon Echo has the of overall aesthetic of an LED-equipped dumbbell. Nonetheless, the Echo is certainly one of the most intriguing devices we’ve seen in the last year or two, one that offers a lot of functionality with minimal effort.\namazon-echo-2 More Google Home is a worthy competitor on many fronts, though. It’s a more intelligent helper, one that can respond to increasingly complex demands.\nCurrently, the Echo is far ahead in terms of third-party support, meaning it already lets you order a Domino’s pizza or a dozen roses from 1-800-Flowers. With the forthcoming addition of Actions, however, Google is attempting to catch up in this category. Regardless of how it turns out, the gauntlet has been thrown.\nBuy Google Home from:\nGoogle Best Buy Target Walmart\nBuy Amazon Echo from:\nAmazon\nAmazon is having a 1-day sale on the Echo, $40 off Everything you need to know about the Google Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra Google's Chromecast Audio will set your music free without the Sonos price tag",

      "text": "AtlantaGeorgia The X-Wing Miniatures Game: Ghost Expansion Pack is available on Amazon for $22.99 . Price is directly from Amazon and is listed as being in stock and available now.Currently $37.49 on CSI. Best price ever according to CCC.edit: I've updated this post to reflect the lowering of the Amazon price (and here I was thinking I got a good deal on my Ghost by combining B&N coupons); as of the time I write this there is a third party seller who has the Ghost for $28.95, but they only have 4 in stock, so I don't want to change the thread title to reflect what will probably be gone soon.",

      "text": "Amazon Pushes Islamic Propaganda In New “Priest and Imam” Commercial Mainstream media fawns over ad as rejection of Trumpism Dan Lyman | Infowars.com - December 1, 2016 Comments \nAmazon has released a new television advertisement featuring a Catholic priest and Muslim imam chumming it up over a cup of tea. \nThe dialogue-free commercial opens with an imam in full Islamic regalia visiting the home of an elderly man in plain clothes and clerical collar, where they make small talk, laughing and touching each other affectionately. \nAs they stand to bid farewell, both grab their knees in pain. Moments later, after parting ways, they place orders on their Amazon Prime smartphone applications. Gift boxes are delivered to each man from the other, followed by scenes of the the imam entering a mosque, and the other man entering a Catholic church, now in priests’ robes. \nIt is then revealed that they sent knee pads to each other, as both kneel and pray in their respective ‘houses of worship.’ \nPredictably, the mainstream media is ecstatic about the new ad, universally propagating the talking point that it is a “total repudiation of Trumpism,” according to the Daily Beast . \n“Amazon’s ad offers a not-so-subtle counterargument to some of the angry anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters,” wrote David Goldman at CNN. “As talk bubbles of Muslim registries and even a potential ban on Muslim immigrants, Amazon’s message offers a different approach: We are people first. We embrace the things that make us different, but we’re all very much the same. Muslims have arthritis, too.” \nJeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post , made a rare appearance on Twitter to express his pride in the commercial. Love this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team. https://t.co/E8ceXs4nte \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nIslamic historian, Cristina Laila , offered her take on the message behind the advertising. \n“It’s another way to put Muslims on your TV, on your computers, in your homes – as if they are in the fabric of western society,” she said. “Amazon is implying that an Imam and a priest both basically pray to the same god as if they’re the same religion, same belief system.” \n“The depiction of an Imam walking into a priest’s home and hugging him and having tea with him is ridiculous.” \nThe web retailer recently came under fire for banning sales of the Confederate flag – while still carrying ISIS and Hamas flags, paraphernalia, and publications. \nA Catholic priest in Normandy, France, was beheaded in July by Muslim terrorists in Islamic garb. They stormed the church during morning mass and forced the priest to kneel at the altar, while they filmed themselves slitting his throat in front of the congregation. \nComments have been disabled for the Amazon video, in contrast with most other content posted to their YouTube channel.",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Members Can Now Subscribe To HBO And Cinemax By Adnan Farooqui on 12/01/2016 08:48 PST \nAmazon doesn’t quite have an online TV streaming service as yet but it has the next best thing called Amazon Channels which enable members to subscribe to major networks. The company today announced that Amazon Prime members can now subscribe to HBO Now and Cinemax through Amazon Channels. The subscription fee is charged on a monthly basis and subscribers are free to cancel at any time without having to incur any additional charges. \nThe HBO subscription costs $14.99 per month and provides access to all HBO shows as well as its library of on-demand content and movies. Subscribers can stream HBO whenever they want without requiring a cable package. It’s the same price as a standalone HBO Now subscription which offers the exact same thing. \nAmazon Prime members can subscribe to Cinemax via Amazon Channels for $9.99 per month. The premier movie destination streams some of the most popular titles as well as its own original series like Outcast, Banshee, Strike Back, and more. \n“HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning shows in television history,” said Michael Paull, vice president of digital video at Amazon, adding that the company is thrilled to work with HBO to bring its popular content to Amazon Prime members via Amazon Channels. \nFiled in General .

      "text": "Fukushima Costs Could Double to $180 Billion \nThe feud between Amazon and Oracle heated up in September when Oracle chairman Larry Ellison introduced new cloud products during his company’s OpenWorld keynote address and said, “Amazon’s lead is over.” \nA slide in Jassy’s presentation highlighted the “ability to see through the hand-waving and bombast,” and featured a photo of Ellison popping up intermittently. Another slide proclaimed Amazon freed users from “customer hostile database vendors,” showing part of the red Oracle logo as the letter o in hostile. \nThe competition will increase with Amazon’s announcement Wednesday that its database tool Aurora will be compatible with additional open-source databases, said Al Hilwa, who directs software development research at IDC. \nIn the third quarter, Amazon had about 45% of the market for infrastructure as a service, where companies buy basic computing and storage power from the cloud, according to Synergy Research Group. Amazon’s revenue is more than twice that of the next three players combined, Synergy said. Love tech? Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning \nAmazon’s Web Services division is the Seattle-based company’s fastest-growing and most profitable source of revenue, offsetting regular quarterly losses from its e-commerce operation. Cloud computing revenue is projected to top $10 billion this year. \nThe new AI services will let customers create applications hosted on Amazon Web Services that understand what’s displayed in photos and, with a program called Lex, develop conversations in a manner similar to Amazon’s Alexa voice-activated technology. Microsoft offers the ability to bake similar artificial intelligence into applications run on its Azure cloud services and Google earlier this year launched business tools and products based on its own AI technology to entice more companies to rent its cloud-computing services. \nThe company also introduced an expanded version of its data-transfer product called Snowball, a suitcase-sized device. In addition to the new service called Snowball Edge, Jassy unveiled snowball-on-steroids, a 45-foot-long shipping container dubbed Snowmobile, which is capable of moving massive amounts of a customer’s data to the cloud. The container, pulled on a tractor-trailer bed, rolled toward the stage in the Las Vegas convention center to cap Jassy’s keynote address. \n“We needed a bigger box,” he said, as the truck moved through simulated smoke and attendees snapped photos. \nBy Spencer Soper and Dina Bass, with assistance from Brian Womack.

      "text": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing service all of us have likely used at one point or another. It's a massive cloud infrastructure that even Netflix relies on to function. Using AWS is as easy as setting up an account and transferring your data on to its servers, but there are companies and organizations out there who have petabytes or even exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) of data they may want to transfer, with no realistic way of doing so. Examples include scientific data collections, satellite imagery, movie vaults, or financial records.\nAmazon went part way to solving this issue last year when it introduced a data transfer appliance called AWS Snowball , which looks like a large desktop PC. Each Snowball can hold 80TB of data, which Amazon then ships back to a data center and uploads to AWS. However, 80TB at a time is too small when talking about petabytes of data, so Amazon had to think bigger.\n\nThis week, Amazon unveiled AWS Snowmobile . It's a shipping container measuring 9.6 by 8 by 45 feet, and is capable of storing 100 petabytes of data. The container hooks up to a customer's network and appears as a local storage volume that files can be transferred to in encrypted form.\nOnce full, the container is locked down to form a waterproof, climate-controlled storage locker that is GPS tracked and under video surveillance. Amazon even provides a security vehicle escort and dedicated security guards if required.",

      "text": "December 1, 2016, 10:45 AM Amazon reveals artificial intelligence products for its web services By Bloomberg News The head of Amazon Web Services unveiled cloud-computer offerings that include image recognition and speech-to-text service, and he took jabs at rival Oracle. \n(Bloomberg)—Amazon.com Inc. introduced an image recognition program, a speech-to-text service dubbed Polly, and tools for building conversational apps, highlighting its push to add artificial intelligence to its cloud-computer offerings. \nAndy Jassy, CEO of the Amazon Web Services unit , unveiled the new products Wednesday at the company’s fifth annual re:Invent conference, which drew 32,000 people from diverse industries to Las Vegas. He pitched Amazon’s wide breadth of services and ability to customize them for clients, while poking fun at competitor Oracle Corp. , which Amazon dismisses as a cloud pretender. \nThe event attracted people from financial services, health care, gaming and other industries interested in learning more about how to use cloud computing, and let Amazon flex its muscles as a market leader in the fast-growing industry. Public cloud spending is expected to increase almost 17% to $204 billion this year, according to researcher Gartner Inc. \nAmazon is trying to maintain its lead over Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, IBM and Oracle as more companies transition from using their servers to renting computing power and data space hosted remotely, which they access via the internet. Movie-service Netflix Inc. is a prominent example of a web company powered by Amazon Web Services. Capital One Financial Corp. announced Tuesday it would transition more of its data to Amazon, highlighting growing interest of the financial sector in the speed and flexibility of cloud computing. \nSpat with rival \nThe feud between Amazon and Oracle heated up in September when Oracle chairman Larry Ellison, introduced new cloud products during his company’s OpenWorld keynote address and said, “Amazon’s lead is over.” \nA slide in Jassy’s presentation highlighted the “ability to see through the hand-waving and bombast,” and featured a photo of Ellison popping up intermittently. Another slide proclaimed Amazon freed users from “customer hostile database vendors,” showing part of the red Oracle logo as the letter o in hostile. \nThe competition will increase with Amazon’s announcement Wednesday that its database tool Aurora will be compatible with additional open-source databases, said Al Hilwa, who directs software development research at IDC . \nIn the third quarter, Amazon, No. 1   , had about 45% of the market for infrastructure as a service, where companies buy basic computing and storage power from the cloud, according to Synergy Research Group. Amazon’s revenue is more than twice that of the next three players combined, Synergy said. \nGreater profit \nAmazon’s Web Services division is the Seattle-based company’s fastest-growing and most profitable source of revenue, offsetting regular quarterly losses from its e-commerce operation . Cloud computing revenue is projected to top $10 billion this year. \nThe new AI services will let customers create applications hosted on Amazon Web Services that understand what’s displayed in photos and, with a program called Lex, develop conversations in a manner similar to Amazon’s Alexa voice-activated technology . Microsoft offers the ability to bake similar artificial intelligence into applications run on its Azure cloud services and Google earlier this year launched business tools and products based on its own AI technology to entice more companies to rent its cloud-computing services. \nThe company also introduced an expanded version of its data-transfer product called Snowball, a suitcase-sized device. In addition to the new service called Snowball Edge, Jassy unveiled snowball-on-steroids, a 45-foot-long shipping container dubbed Snowmobile, which is capable of moving massive amounts of a customer’s data to the cloud. The container, pulled on a tractor-trailer bed, rolled toward the stage in the Las Vegas convention center to cap Jassy’s keynote address. “We needed a bigger box,” he said, as the truck moved through simulated smoke and attendees snapped photos.

      "text": "  Insgesamt wurde in den Vereinigten Staaten am Cyber Monday 2016 die Rekordsumme von 2,67 Milliarden US-Dollar umgesetzt. Damit markiert der Cyber Monday in diesem Jahr einen neuen Höchstwert für die Umsätze in den USA. Auch Adobe hatte schon von einem neuen Rekord für das Onlineshopping in den USA am Cyber Monday 2016 berichtet. Im Zeitraum von 1. November bis einschließlich 29. November gaben die US-Amerikaner online im Weihnachtsgeschäft bisher 29,7 Milliarden US-Dollar aus, berichtet comScore. Dies markiere einen Zuwachs von 12 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum (26,4 Mrd.). Im 5-Tages-Zeitraum zwischen Thanksgiving und Cyber Monday wurden in den USA online über Desktop Computer insgesamt Umsätze in Höhe von 8,41 Mrd. Dollar getätigt. Das entspricht einem Plus von 17 Prozent (YoY). Bei den größten Retailern, deren Internetshops von US-Kunden am Cyber Monday 2016 über Desktop Computer oder Mobilgeräte besucht wurden, heißt der Sieger erneut: Amazon.com . Kein anderer Onlineshop wurden von den US-Amerikanern so oft angesurft. Auf den Plätzen 2 und 3 folgen die Dauerrivalen eBay.com und Walmart . Insgesamt etwa 130 Millionen Amerikaner haben laut comScore am Cyber Monday 2016 über einen PC, Smartphone oder Tablet einen Onlienshop besucht. Tests",

      "text": "In a race to widen their respective developer networks, Amazon and Google have released separate self-service tools to help inventors create apps based on machine learning that will ultimately make it easier for brands to work with the technology.\n\nAmazon has made three of its artificial intelligence tools available to developers within its Web Services group, marking the first time that the company has allowed outside inventors to build apps and services on its technology.\nBuilding AI capabilities into apps requires access to large amounts of data and expertise in machine learning and neural networks. The deep and machine-learning algorithms require access to automatic speech recognition, natural-language understanding and classification to collect and train the networks to recognize phrases, speech inflections, objects, and keywords.\nThe group, Amazon AI , features three services: Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition. Lex, the technology that powers Amazon Alexa, allows any developer to build conversational experiences for Web, mobile and connected devices. Capital One, OhioHealth, HubSpot and Twillo have used Amazon Lex to build out chatbots for their respective companies.  \nThe Washington Post and GoAnimate used Amazon Polly to turn text into speech, enabling their respective apps to talk with 47 lifelike voices in multiple languages.\nThe third tool, Rekognition -- which Redfin, and SmugMug applied to apps -- allows app users to sort through images. The application uses deep learning-based image and face recognition.\nGoogle also has been pushing self-serve tools, trying hard to convince developers to adopt technology that allows them to create bots for Google Assistant through Actions on Google, which the company should release earlier this month. Venture Beat reported in October that a software development kit (SDK) that brings Google Assistant into device not made by Google should become available next year.\nIn addition, there is also  G Suite , a collection of Web-based productivity tools formerly known as Google Apps.\nThe new offering that Google App Maker announced this week rolls out as part of G Suite for Business. It's a browser-based platform that pushes the ability to build internal business apps without the need to write code. It aims to offer easy integration with Gmail, Drive and Docs, as well as machine learning capabilities, but not on the scale of Amazon AI.\nGoogle App Maker offers developer tools to build apps that Google says can make every day processes simple and easier to manage through the cloud without worrying about servers, capacity planning and infrastructure security.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nCloud Chronicles is written by Network World Senior Writer Brandon Butler, who tracks the ins and outs of the cloud computing industry. Why Amazon’s new machine learning tools are so important Amazon wants to bring machine learning to developers Network World | Dec 1, 2016 8:14 AM   Credit: IDG What everyone's talking about at AWS re:Invent \nThe fact that Amazon Web Services announced three new machine learning services this week shouldn’t come as a surprise. Machine learning, artificial intelligence and cognitive computing are hot buzzwords for cloud vendors and the world was waiting to see how AWS would address it at its re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. \nWhat may be surprising is how Amazon is positioning these new machine learning tools. \n+ MORE AT NETOWRK WORLD : A peek inside Amazon’s cloud – from global scale to custom silicon | Cool tech at AWS re:Invent + \nUntil recently, machine learning was considered somewhat of a moon-shot technology. ML experts have spent their careers mastering the art of coding algorithms and training computers to learn. Cloud vendors from Google to Microsoft and IBM have all developed machine learning platforms on their clouds to attract these workloads. \nAmazon’s announcement of these three products – and two of them in particular with Polly and Rekognition - are aimed specifically at application developers though, not PhDs. \nAmazon Polly is a tool that allows developers to input text into it and the app will provide an audio stream of the words. Developers can input text manually or through an API. There are 47 voices in 24 languages, making it fairly easy to add voice dictation to a plethora of apps. \nImage Rekognition is a simple platform for finding trends in images uploaded to Amazon’s cloud. Images that are in Amazon’s Simple Storage Service can be queried by the Rekognition platform, which in turn will analyze the images and categorize traits such as vehicles, pets or furniture. It can also analyze faces so it can identify photos that have certain people in them. \nThe functionality of these applications is fairly limited. They’re not meant for machine learning experts who want to write their own artificial intelligence applications. But what they are meant for are developers who are familiar with the AWS platform who want to add text-to-speech and image recognition functionality to their apps. \nFor all the Machine Learning PhDs, Amazon has other tools, most notably the Amazon Machine Learning platform, that is geared for more programmatic Machine Learning functions. By announcing these new capabilities this week Amazon is rounding out its ML capabilities and offering customers a wider range of ML options for folks who are just getting started with this exciting technology.

      "text": "At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the launch of a new service called CodeBuild, which is meant to automatically compile developers’ code and then run unit tests on it.\nAWS will charge by the minute and automatically scale it in and out based on the needs of the workload, said Amazon vice president and chief technology officer Werner Vogels.\nThe service can also be customized. If developers work in less popular languages, they can build a Docker image, point the CodeBuild service at it, and the service will automatically run that as well, Vogels said.\nThe tool fits in with AWS’ other tools for storing and then building and deploying code: CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy. Considered together, this can represent a fuller distribution chain for getting solid code out the door and updating it as needed. Much of this has been done in other tools, but now AWS is basically making it easier for developers to rely more exclusively on it.\nAWS is also introducing a service called X-Ray, which is meant to help developers with debugging their code. The service will show performance bottlenecks and show which services are causing issues. It will also show the “impact of issues for users,” Vogels said. The service is available now in preview from all of AWS’ data center regions, according to a blog post today from AWS chief evangelist Jeff Barr.\nAdditionally Vogels introduced an enhancement to its OpsWorks devops service: AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. It’s a fully managed version of a Chef server for automating the management of infrastructure. \n",

      "title": "Amazon VP: The Network Gear Economy Is Becoming Commoditized",
      "text": "People attending Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference in Las Vegas finish their dinners early so they can return to the main stage, just to hear the company’s celebrated VP and distinguished engineer, James Hamilton, spew ideas in what would be a stream-of-consciousness monologue were it not for the presence of gently guiding slides. During a late evening keynote session on Tuesday, Hamilton introduced attendees to his company’s custom network routers, explaining that no single vendor of vertically-integrated network gear is capable of responding to architecture-centered network problems within a timeframe any narrower than six months.\nThe solution, he explained, was for Amazon engineers to collaborate with multiple, competing manufacturers of network gear along a loosely coupled stack of technologies. Those technologies would enable Amazon to produce simpler, more versatile custom routers adhering to standards of its own — even the less universally accepted ones, like 25 Gbps Ethernet instead of 10-gig or 40-gig.\nAttendees leaving Hamilton’s talk early might have come away thinking he was advising them to go build global retailing empires of their own, just to give them the leverage they needed to conduct negotiations with the Broadcoms and Marvells of the world.\nBut just then, Hamilton suggested something potentially profound: The ASICs that Amazon ordered to power its custom routers are becoming cheap. Their cheapness enables them to be ordered in bulk. And with those competing network stack vendors’ products becoming more open, perhaps one need not be an Amazon to build a more moderate data center using custom networking gear.\n“Vertically-integrated networking equipment, where the ASICs, the hardware, these protocol stacks [ were ] supplied by single companies, is [ like ] the way the mainframe used to dominate servers,” said Hamilton.\n“If you look at where the networking world is, it’s sort of where the server world was 20 or 30 years ago. It started out with, you buy a mainframe. . . and that’s it. And it comes from all one company. The networking world is the same place. And we know what happened in the server world: As soon as you chop up these vertical stacks, you’ve got companies focused on every layer, and they’re innovating together, and they’re all competing. You can get great things happening.”\nFor any given server size, Hamilton explained, the overhead of networking required to service that node is rising. That wasn’t the case, he said, back when network equipment was artificially expensive. In a more commodity-driven economy, this no longer can be the case.\nAmazon’s custom-built routers are built with the assistance of the company’s own protocol development team, he said. This fact is responsible for what Hamilton characterized as a steep reduction in costs. When a vendor is bound to supporting the protocol needs of a vast plurality of customers, he argued, the complexity of the resulting product renders its reliability, in practice, unmaintainable.\n“And the next release comes out, and they don’t test all that stuff that people like me ask for, because nobody uses it anyway,” the AWS VP continued. “And it doesn’t work! It just doesn’t work!”\nBy comparison, Amazon’s protocols only have to serve Amazon’s requirements. It’s the flip side of the argument in favor of standards, which in the older economy were vitally necessary to ensure interoperability. In certain facets of Amazon’s network, standards are absolutely not required at all. In fact, Hamilton argued, the demands on standard protocols are so high that they end up working against customers with Amazon’s scale.\nLater, Hamilton showed off one of AWS’ ASICs of choice: a custom-built Broadcom Tomahawk. Because the vertical networking stack is breaking loose from the ties that bind, he said, custom ASICs are becoming a market. And that means costs are coming down — for everyone.\n“These are absolute monsters!” he exclaimed. “This is a 3.2-terabit part. What does that mean? It’s 128 ports of 25-gig. All ports can be running flat out, with no blocking. It’ll flow at 3.2 terabits at the same time. . . Why do I like that? Non-blocking is a wonderful place to be, but the real reason I like it is, there’s a healthy ecosystem. Cavium, Mellanox, Broadcom, Marvell, Barefoot, and Innovium are all building parts. There’s 6-terabit and 13-terabit parts coming. And they will be around the same price, in just the same way the server was.”\nHamilton described an environment for networking gear whose situation was similar to the bright, beautiful world that Intel brought forth, when Moore’s Law was in its heyday. (I would call it a new stack, but that phrase has been taken.)",

      "text": "Amazon lets Prime members add HBO and Cinemax to their plans Through Channels, you can get access to the two networks without a cable plan. Save REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach \nAmazon already offered Prime subscribers the ability to add streaming services to their account and today it tacked on two more big names. If you're willing to pay a few extra dollars a month, you can now add HBO and Cinemax to that annual membership. Through Amazon Channels, HBO will set you back $15 a month while Cinemax requires an extra $10 monthly fee. Of course, the advantage here is that you're getting on-demand access to content from the two networks without the need for a cable plan. \nShowtime was already available through Amazon's Channels program alongside NBC's SeeSo comedy streaming service, PBS Kids, History Channel Vault, Starz and more. As you might expect, any of these networks that you link to a Prime plan are available though the retailer's video app on phones, tablets and connected TVs. Owners of Amazon's Fire TV , Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets also get easy access to any of the aforementioned streaming add-ons. \nThe best part of the news? HBO and Cinemax are available today for Prime customers. Just head over to the Channels page to get started. ",

      "text": "  \nInteresting announcements from Amazon at its AWS event this week: the company is rolling out a suite of artificial intelligence APIs for developers to plug their apps into. These tools are based on the AWS cloud (which a lot of your favorite apps and services already use) and they leverage the same AI and deep learning that has also powered Alexa , the software behind the Amazon Echo . \nHere's April Glaser, writing for Recode : \nDrawing on the artificial intelligence that powers Amazon’s popular home assistant Alexa, the new tools will allow developers to build apps that have conversational interfaces, can turn text into speech and use computer vision that is capable of recognizing faces and objects. \nAmazon’s latest push follows moves from Google and Microsoft, both of which have cloud computing platforms that already use artificial intelligence. \nGoogle’s G Suite , for example, uses AI to power Smart Reply in Gmail, instant translation and smart scheduling functions in its calendar. Likewise, Microsoft recently announced it’s bringing artificial intelligence to its Office 365 service to add search within Word, provide productivity tracking and build maps from Excel with geographic data. \nIt's increasingly starting to look like \"AI as an SDK\" will become a requirement for modern apps and services. Deep learning and AI aren't limited to playing chess and recognizing cat videos anymore; developers are using this new kind of computing power for all kinds of features – see Plex , Spotify , and Todoist for two recent examples. I've also been hearing about iOS apps using Google's Cloud Vision a lot more frequently over the past few months. \nI think this trend will only accelerate as AI reshapes how software gets more and better work done for us. And I wonder if Apple is considering an expansion of their neural network APIs to match what others are doing – competition in this field is heating up quickly.",

      "text": "At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) said that it has turned on distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack mitigation technology, called AWS Shield, for all of its customers, free of charge.\nTo help customers prevent more sophisticated attacks, AWS is also introducing a premium tier called AWS Shield Advanced. It lets customers call in a special support team that’s available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Customers can get notifications when certain infrastructure is used to stop attacks. \nWhen AWS detects attacks, “we will work together with DDoS protection teams to create the right level of protection using WAF [web application firewall]. We will also keep an eye on cost, making sure you don’t incur any additional cost by using our service,” Amazon vice president and chief technology officer Werner Vogels said.\nThe launch of this service comes three years after Google introduced the Project Shield DDoS mitigation tool , but only some organizations have been able to use it, and Google hasn’t made it available for anyone to use in its Google Cloud Platform.\nThe launch of AWS Shield and AWS Shield Advanced is an example of AWS, the biggest public cloud today, is able to come out regularly with new services while its competitors strive to catch up. Meanwhile, AWS and the others also compete on price, variety of infrastructure, and geographic availability. Microsoft Azure has not revealed a DDoS mitigation tool.\n",

At the AWS re:invent conference this morning, they announces both AWS X-Ray and the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.\nAWS X-Ray is a fully-managed service that allows developers to debug their distributed applications. Using trace data from applications, X-Ray creates a visual console to easily visualize key metrics and health issues in code.\n\nX-Ray captures trace data from code running on EC2 virtual machines, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and the Amazon API Gateway. It allows developers to follow thread execution by adding HTTP headers to requests.\nWerner Vogels introduces AWS Personal Health Dashboard at AWS re:invent Amazon also released the AWS Personal Health Dashboard today, a new dashboard allows developers to monitor all of their infrastructure in one place. The dashboard can provide real-time alerts and notifications and can also perform immediate responses using Lambda functions.\nThe Personal Health Dashboard will be a welcome change for AWS developers who have had to rely on third-party services to augment the very basic dashboard previously available from Amazon.\nYou can learn more about AWS X-Ray in this AWS blog post .",

      "title": "The new information super-highway: Amazon hauls 100 petabytes of data on a truck",
      "text": "amazon snowmobile data migration cloud storage truck More Amazon\nNeed to move lots and lots of data into the cloud but don’t have the time and money to pump all that information across the internet? Look no further than Amazon’s new Snowmobile for its Amazon Web Services platform. Despite the bitter cold, free-riding name, this data migration solution is a secure data ‘truck’ that can store up to 100 petabytes of data for moving “exabytes” of data across the nation’s real highways to Amazon’s cloud in a matter of weeks. Ten-four, good buddy.\nAmazon describes its new Snowmobile as a “ruggedized, tamper-resistant shipping container” measuring 45-feet long, 9.6-feet high, and 8-feet wide. The container is both climate-controlled and waterproof and consumes around 350KW of power just for the cooling system alone. It can be parked in a covered or uncovered area at the customer’s datacenter, and Amazon will even supply a generator if customers can’t provide enough power to juice the container.\nMore: Amazon fed up with fakes, taking aggressive action to banish counterfeits\n“Each Snowmobile includes a network cable connected to a high-speed switch capable of supporting one terabit per second of data transfer spread across multiple 40 gigabits per second connections,” Amazon’s Jeff Barr wrote in a blog post on Wednesday . “Assuming that your existing network can transfer data at that rate, you can fill a Snowmobile in about 10 days.”\nBarr indicated that the Snowmobile is aimed at customers in the scientific, media and entertainment, financial services, and other industries. It attaches directly to the company’s network and appears as a local, Network File System (NFS) storage device. Customers can use their own backup/archiving tools to transfer all their data to be stored using Amazon Glacier or Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).\nUsing a Lego-inspired example, Barr suggested Snowmobiles are ideal for aging data centers that still rely on racks full of disk and tape drives storing “precious, mission-critical” data. Thus, by moving all that data onto current storage technologies via the cloud, enterprises are spending less time and money trying to squeeze additional performance out of aging hardware.\nAWS customers can call to set up a meeting to discuss how the data can be moved to Amazon’s cloud using a Snowmobile. Once the 18-wheeler shows up with the container, AWS Professional Services does all the work in connecting the container to the customer’s network. The customer then initiates the data transfer and when the process is finally complete, the 18-wheeler hauls the container back to Amazon to import the data as specified by the customer.\nFor now, Snowmobiles will only be used to migrate data into Amazon’s cloud. However, the company is quite aware that many customers may want to export their data from the cloud in disaster recovery cases. Barr didn’t say when the latter service will become available, nor did he have any info to share regarding the overall cost of using one or more Snowmobiles. However, this new truck-based storage transfer service is available in all AWS Regions.\nTo see Amazon’s new Snowmobile container, head over to Twitter and have a peek at the company’s coverage stemming from its annual Re:Invent conference that is currently under way in Las Vegas.\nTransferring data to your shiny new PlayStation 4 Pro is a piece of cake Don’t lose your email! Here’s how to export and import your Outlook inbox As connected cars become more common, will you need an in-car ad blocker?",

      "text": "One Green Planet December 1, 2016 \nThe deforestation of the Amazon has been worrying environmentalists for decades but recently the Brazilian government released their most recent study on this problem and the numbers were shocking. Deforestation has gone up 29 percent in this past year which is a five percent increase from 2015. This is also the highest rate of deforestation since 2008. The government estimates that around 3,000 square miles – that roughly the same size as Delaware and Rhode Island combined – of rainforest were destroyed from August 2015 to July 2016. While conservationists in Brazil were bracing themselves for larger losses this year, these numbers were astounding. Estadão Reports blames the rapid increase of deforestation on government action, “such as the waiving of fines for illegal deforestation, the abandonment of protected areas.” \nAnd the Brazilian government is to blame, but not entirely. The beef industry in Brazil is responsible for the majority of the destruction happening in the Amazon – right around 70 percent. Trees are clearcut and to make room so that the massive herds of cattle can graze. Researchers at the University of Cambridge estimate that for every 10 percent of the rainforest that is destroyed, we will lose one or two species. On top of that, the livestock industry is responsible for around 30 percent of Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions and the increasing importance of this industry is going to make it difficult for the country to meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement in the upcoming year. \nHowever, this is a much larger problem. Brazil exports a large portion of the beef that it produces – the Unites States imports approximately 200 million pounds of beef from the area. This means that we have the ability to fight against the deforestation of the rainforests when we go to the grocery story every day. By choosing a plant-based diet we can help to stop the destruction of our planet’s rainforests. The production of meat and dairy products is impacting the environment all over the world, not just in Brazil. Around 14.5 percent of the world’s carbon emissions come from the production of livestock and this industry uses just under 50 percent of the global land and 23 percent of the world’s fresh water. \nBy choosing to eat more plant-based foods, you can drastically cut your carbon footprint, save precious water supplies and help ensure that vital crop resources are fed to people, rather than livestock. With the wealth of available plant-based options available, it has never been easier to eat with the planet in mind.

Johnson/HBO) \nAmazon is continuing its push into online streaming video by letting its Prime customers purchase monthly subscriptions to HBO and Cinemax right from their Amazon accounts. \nHBO will be available on Prime for $15 a month, while the Cinemax add-on will cost $10 a month, Amazon said in a release. You can already access some HBO content on Amazon, but by selling subscriptions, the company is taking things to a new level. \nBoth channels were also recently announced as add-ons to AT&T's new streaming service, DirecTV Now, highlighting HBO and Cinemax's attempts to reach beyond their traditional audience of cable subscribers. As many as 20 million U.S. households lack cable TV, AT&T estimates, either because they canceled their plans or because they never had one to begin with. [ AT&T just unveiled its answer to the cord-cutting wars ] \nWhile it may seem odd for Amazon to offer yet another way to get HBO when consumers can already get it directly through HBO's own streaming app, HBO Now, for exactly the same price, being able to consolidate your bills a little could be useful. For Amazon, the premium channel serves as another incentive for Americans to sign onto Prime, the company's lucrative membership service. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.) \nAnd because Amazon's HBO viewers will be watching \"Westworld,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and other hit shows through the Amazon video portal known as Amazon Channels, the company may get credit for all that streaming when analysts compare it to the likes of Netflix and Hulu. Numbers from Sandvine show Amazon Video accounts for 4.26 percent of all Internet traffic consumed in North America during peak hours, versus 35 percent for Netflix. \nIf more people start streaming \"Silicon Valley\" and \"The Night Of\" through Amazon, those numbers could rise. And that would be good for Amazon. business",

Amazon is hoping to change this by providing a new tool called AWS CodeBuild.\nAWS CodeBuild is a a managed build service. By specifying the source code repository and build environment, along with other build specs, AWS will automatically provision an isolated, container-based environment to execute the build.\nDevelopers can use a variety of source repositories like GitHub, AWS CodeCommit or an S3 bucket. Build environments like Android, Java, Python, Ruby, Go, Node.js or Docker are supported.\n\nCodeBuild costs are per minute, but only for the minutes used, so developers do not have to maintain static instances of the build environment on AWS.\nRead more about AWS CodeBuild on the AWS blog .",

      "title": "Amazon Prime Gets HBO and Cinemax Subscriptions For $15 and $10 Per Month",
      "text": "The great cord-cutting revolution continues today with the news that HBO and Cinemax are now available to Amazon Prime subscribers for $15 and $10 per month, respectively.\nThe news comes almost a year after Amazon Video opened to third-party video-streaming services , letting those on the company's $99 annual Prime member service subscribe to the likes of Starz and Showtime from within a single platform. Adding HBO and Cinemax to the mix is a major scoop and serves as one more incentive for people to sign up for a Prime plan that already includes free deliveries on goods and a Netflix-esque video-streaming service, among other perks. There are now somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 third-party channel subscriptions available through Amazon Channels.\nBoth new channels are available free for 30 days as part of the launch promotion, after which their respective monthly fees kick into effect.\nFor more about Amazon Prime, watch: \nThe partnerships make sense for Amazon, viewers, and the providers, as it alleviates \"subscription fatigue,\" removes the need for multiple login credentials, and re-bundles only the specific channels desired by viewers, with no long-term contracts. It also lets subscribers create a single watchlist for programming across all their subscriptions and view everything within the one Amazon Video app.\nThis post was originally published on VentureBeat .

      "text": "For developers, building an app is hard enough. Actually getting people to use a product is another story.\nThat’s why Amazon today debuted Amazon Pinpoint , a new mobile marketing analytics feature within Amazon Web Services that helps app makers run targeted push notification campaigns.\nSpeaking at AWS re:invent in Las Vegas on Thursday, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels said that Pinpoint will help developers better understand and analyze the preferences and behavior of their mobile users on a granular level so to improve the quality and timing of push notifications.\n“To really drive engagement for customers with push notifications, you need to be really careful about who you are targeting and when you target them so you can really optimize engagement,” Vogels said.\nPinpoint includes dashboards that show real-time analytics; the ability to create targeted campaigns based on external data; use A/B testing for different messages; and more.\n\nAmazon charges developers based on the number of users a campaign targets, the number of messages sent, and the events collected. There are no upfront setup costs and no fixed monthly costs. Pricing breakdown can be seen here . You can read more about Pinpoint at this FAQ page .\nPinpoint is one of many analytics features offered on AWS that include Redshift and Athena , a new SQL query service product revealed Wednesday.\n“Analytics is in the hands of all of you,” Vogels told the crowd on Thursday. “It really allows you to transform your business and get detailed information about how your business is operating, how customers can be targeted, and how you operate.”\nAmazon made several other AWS-related announcements today, including AWS Shield , which offers protections from DDoS attacks, and new integration with Seattle software automation company Chef .",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Instant Video review Netflix look out… Amazon is back with a much improved user experience Tested at Compare Prices Our Verdict A more advanced, easier-to-use version of its former self, Amazon Instant Video is one of the most complete and competitive streaming services out there For Ultra HD and HDR content included Valuable original content First to newer releases over Netflix Vast catalogue No Apple TV or Google Chromecast support Jump to Reviewed on 1st December 2016 \nGone are the days when Amazon was the go-to website for only books, CDs and DVDs. Now the shopping Goliath is vying for your custom anywhere, anytime and in any way it can – not least in the digital realm. \nIt wants you to download books from its Kindle Store, stream music from its Prime Music catalogue, and subscribe to its Amazon Prime Instant Video service. \nThe latter has had plenty of different names over the years (Amazon Unbox, LoveFilm Instant, Instant Video…), but has always been in direct competition with Netflix . That’s not an easy place to be, as fellow video streaming service NOW TV would concur. \nAt the time of our last review of the service in 2014, it was a silver medalist in a two-horse race. We praised Amazon’s extensive catalogue and wide platform support, but found its subscription packaging was confusing and needed simplifying. \nTwo years is a lifetime in the fast-moving digital realm, so it’s hardly surprising that much has changed: the size of its catalogue and number of subscribers has gained traction in a big way, and while it still nests within Amazon’s all-encompassing website, the service has been considerably simplified. \nMORE: Netflix review f Price \nThere are two cancel-anytime subscription tiers, both of which offer a 30-day free trial: Prime Video for £6 per month , which is the Netflix-rivalling video streaming service, and a £8 per month (or £70 upfront) Prime membership that adds ad-free streaming of Prime Music , unlimited photo storage in Amazon Cloud Drive, and one-day shipping service on select Amazon-stocked products. \nAmazon Video – the subscription-free on-demand and rental part of the website, available to everyone and anyone – has also been worked into the Prime Video and Prime offering, with select titles also available to subscribers. \nAnd the fate of Amazon-owned LoveFilm? It’s still with us, but clinging on as a postal service. \nMORE: Amazon Prime Music review Features \nPrime Video (and Prime) subscribers have access to over 15,000 movies and TV episodes – more than enough to satisfy the most ardent couch potato. It has grown considerably since 2014, when it was a little over 2000. \nSize isn’t everything, of course, and while there are a fair few oldies – who wouldn’t want Fist of Fury 3 and all eight series of Downton Abbey available at the touch of a button? – there is no shortage of new releases either. \nIn fact, while new films ( Neon Demon , for example) and hot-off-the-lens TV shows (Season 7 of The Walking Dead ) are only available to buy or rent outside of the subscription offering through the 38,000-strong Amazon Video service, the Prime Video catalogue still tends to be quicker to newer titles than Netflix. \nA fair few of last year’s big hits such as the Macbeth adaptation, Academy Award-winning Spotlight and nominee Room are present, as well as films that had theatrical releases just months ago, like A Walk in the Woods . \nTitles are constantly coming and going, but Amazon’s own content is on the rise too. In 2011, Netflix began the trend of producing its own original content, and Amazon has clocked on. \nSince 2013, Amazon Studios has produced TV dramas, comedies, documentaries and children’s programming under the ‘Amazon Originals’ umbrella: Bosch , Hand of God , Mad Dogs , Alpha House and Man in the High Castle , to name just a few. \nExclusive to Amazon, they all fall under the subscription tier, and with many now in a second season and some renewed for a third, it seems Amazon is doing something right. \nIndeed, Transparent won a Golden Globe award in 2015 for best TV series (musical or comedy), and the much-anticipated Grand Tour , fronted by petrol-heads Clarkson, Hammond and May, has surely already secured a fan base since the first episode aired on 28th November. \nAmazon Originals’ Ultra HD content is available under the Prime Video and Prime subscription tiers at no extra cost, for anyone who has a 4K TV with the 4K-supporting Amazon app (like the LG OLED65E6V and Samsung UE55KS7000 ) and an internet connection of at least 15Mbps. \nCurrently it’s the cheapest way to stream 4K content, as Netflix only offers it under its £9 per month Premium subscription tier. \nMORE: What is Ultra HD TV and 4K TV? Everything you need to know More after the break \nThere are a few 4K Amazon Original shows also available in HDR: all three seasons of Transparent , both seasons of Mozart in the Jungle , and the first seasons of Red Oaks , Mad Dogs and Man in the High Castle , to get you started. \nWhile these 4K and 4K HDR offerings aren’t comprehensive enough to sideline Full HD altogether, they are on par with Netflix. \nFor those prepared to splash out, Amazon Video offers more to rent or buy. New release Concussion currently tops the bill at £27, accompanied by other releases at £20. \nNetflix was first to support Dolby Vision (Dolby’s alternative to the more universal HDR 10 version of HDR ) and Amazon has followed suit by offering the likes of Bosch and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment films in the Amazon Video section – albeit only in the US for now. \nMORE: HDR TV - What is it? How can you get it? Ease of use \nFar from being limited to PCs and laptops, Amazon Instant Video can also be used on Android and iOS platforms, thanks to mobile apps. \nIt’s also available on the Fire TV and Roku media streaming sticks and Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and has become common on TV and Blu-ray players’ smart offerings. \nApple TV remains a gaping hole in its platform support, although you can always AirPlay it to the Apple TV from the iOS app. \nSimilarly, there’s no native support for Google Chromecast, but you can cast a laptop or phone screen from a Google Chrome web browser or Chromecast app to your telly. \nThe user experience is much improved across all platforms. \nThe service is still buried in amongst the Shoes & Bags and Sports & Outdoors categories in the search bar menu, but it’s now much easier to browse and filter what’s included with your subscription and what isn’t. \nIn ‘All Videos’, content included with Prime is indicated with a sash, and categories are clearly flagged in blue to avoid confusion. \nWant to see what’s available under the subscription service? Use the filters to strip out paid-for content, so you can choose to see just TV shows or movies. The web platform adds extra tick-box filters like genre, release date, actor and certificate. \nLike Netflix, the home interface is a busy banner list of seemingly endless categories: Ultra HD TV, Amazon Originals, Highest Rated TV and Movies Out This Week to more obscure 2016 Emmy Award Shows, Movies in French, and our favourite: 90 Minutes or Less Movies. \nBelow there’s tabs for your Video Library (content you’ve purchased) and Watchlist (content you’ve flagged to watch later), as well as a handy search bar for when nothing but old episodes of The X-Files will do. \nWe wish HDR programming had its own tab, but our only other gripe is that when you return to the menus, you are taken back to start of the list instead of where you left off – frustrating for those partial to casual browsing. \nMORE: 4K streaming vs 4K Blu-ray vs Blu-ray – which is best? Performance \nNo longer does streaming mean noisy pictures and buffering waits you could boil the kettle during. But neither does high-definition streaming bring the absolute crispness and subtlety of the Blu-ray. \nThe quality gap is narrowing though, with streams from Amazon consistently sharp, clean and punchy. \nOn the audio front, Amazon supports multi-channel up to Dolby Digital 5.1, so you get an improvement in sound to match the step up in picture quality. \nThe high-definition stream of gangster film Legend , starring Tom Hardy, contrasts with the bleak streets of 1960s East End. \nMORE: 10 of the best film scenes to test picture quality \nBut there is plenty of definition in the gleaming cars, PVC dresses, the shine to the Kray brother’s slicked-back hair and the anxious faces of their imminent casualties. \nNavy suits and mahogany interiors have a richness that gives their club the intended sense of grandeur, and thanks to a sense of smoothness and poise, the brutality of the fistfights will have you grimacing, rather than distracted by any motion blur. \nIn our opinion, paying out for a 4K telly is worth it for streams alone. Bosch in the higher resolution is notably sharper than HD streams, glossier and cleaner too. \nOur praise for HDR streaming is more reserved, as it is with Netflix streams too, the benefits considerably more noticeable on the 4K disc format. Verdict \nAmazon Prime Instant Video has undoubtedly matured as a video streaming service. \nIt offers a vast and attractively up-to-date catalogue – uniquely inclusive of 4K and HDR material – under a subscription that’s competitively priced and much simpler to grasp than before. \nThe opportunity to easily open your wallet wider to what Amazon Video offers is a bonus, as is the option to incorporate Amazon’s shopping and other digital avenues for a few quid a month extra. \nTime to go Prime? Maybe. All we’ll say is, Netflix better watch out… \nSee all our Amazon reviews See all our",

      "title": "AWS launches Glue service for running automated ETL jobs",
      "text": "At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the launch of AWS Glue, a tool for automatically running jobs for cleaning up data from multiple sources and getting it all ready for analysis in other tools, like business intelligence (BI) software.\nThis type of work is typically known as extract-transform-load, or ETL. Companies including Informatica and Talend offer software for it. Now AWS has a cloud service for it.\nIt’s been possible to use AWS infrastructure to do ETL work, with services like EMR (Elastic Map Reduce). The other big public clouds have Hadoop-based tools for this sort of thing, too. But with AWS Glue it will be easier.\nAnd with the help of JDBC connectors, it will be able to connect with data in on-premises services, making AWS Glue another proof point that AWS is interested in working with organizations that still retain their own on-premises data center infrastructure.\nWhen data changes at their original sources, “jobs can be triggered again to make sure you always have access to the latest information,” Amazon vice president and chief technology officer Werner Vogels said.\nDeveloping…. \n",

      "text": "Free $25 to Amazon for Amex Membership Reward Members December 1, 2016 by Deals We Like 2 Comments \nThis post may contain affiliate links from our advertising partners, such as American Express. Read my Advertiser Disclosure policy here. \nFor awhile now, you’ve been able to use your American Express Membership Reward points to pay for Amazon.com purchases . For every 1 point you redeem you get 1 cent off your purchase, definitely not a value I’d redeem my points at. BUT…. for a limited time, if you link your Membership Rewards account to your Amazon.com account you can get $25 off your purchase of $50 or more! Unfortunately though, this is a targeted offer, so there is a change you might not be eligible for this promotion. On the plus side, many merchant gift cards work, so you can purchase a $50 gift card to another store for half price! This offer worked for me on my Amazon account, but not my husbands, for whatever reason! I was able to apply the coupon to a Southwest gift card! How to take advantage of this promotion: If you haven’t already linked your American Express card to your Amazon account, you can do that here . Linking your account seems to be temporarily available, so you might have to wait a few days until this is fixed. Shop at Amazon.com and add $50 worth of products (which must be sold and shipped by Amazon.com) to your Shopping card. Many merchant gift cards work as well, so you can go ahead and search for merchant gift cards here. On the payment page, select your linked Membership Rewards earning credit card. Select “Choose a different amount” and enter the number of points you want to use towards your purchase. Since I do not like redeeming my points at Amazon (due to the low redemption value), I entered just 1 cent which means 1 point will be applied. For the promotion to apply, the minimum amount required is only 1 point ! Do not do full points as it is not a good value! On the check out page, enter the promotion code AMEX16EVER . If you were not targeted for the promotion, it will say “The promotional code you entered cannot be applied to your purchase.” You will see the $25 taken off on the right-hand side displaying your total amount. \nIf you are not eligible for this offer, you still might be able to get customer service to manually apply the $25 discount to your order. In the past, Amazon customer service has been very generous and applying the offer to accounts that weren’t eligible, so it is worth a try to see if it works this time as well! Directions on contacting customer service and getting this applied are similar to this past post (just keep in mind that the coupon code and discount used in the prior post is for an old promotion – make sure to give customer service the information listed in this blog post). \nFor those that are eligible, enjoy your $25 free at Amazon!

      "text": "AWS   Posted YayPay wants to help big companies deal with accounts receivable \nAmazon’s new AWS Batch allows engineers to execute a series of jobs automatically, in the cloud. The tool lets you run apps and container images on whatever EC2 instances are required to accomplish a given task. \nAmazon recognized that many of its customers were bootstrapping their own batch computing systems. Users were stringing together EC2 instances, containers, notifications, and CloudWatch monitoring. By offering proprietary capability, this entire process becomes easier and more accessible. \nOne of the biggest benefits of putting batch computing in the cloud is the ability to access a diverse array of instances. In the physical world, compute clusters typically feature a large number of duplicated processors. Doing away with this generates massive computing efficiencies and makes it possible to create innovative pricing models around such a service. \nAmazon allows users to bid for capacity so you can minimize spending. In addition to saving money, its now easy to scale up resources to match evolving needs at any time. It’s a lot less time intensive to temporarily upgrade resources in the cloud than it is to order and install an entirely new physical computing cluster. \nAmazon isn’t planning to charge an additional fee for AWS Batch on top of the traditional costs for other necessary AWS resources. Batch is available in Preview for users in the US. East (Northern Virginia) region. Moving forward, Amazon plans to expand the service to other centers. Further integration with AWS Lambda can also be expected so users can use the functions as jobs. 0",

      "text": "Buy from Amazon \nThere are two main forms of whole-home electric heating systems, - forced air and radiant heating . With forced-air, heat is pushed out from the heat source and with a furnace, the heat is delivered to the rest of the home via a series of ducts. When the heater is smaller, forced air is expelled with the use of a fan, to warm a room. \nRadiant heat on the other hand, emits heat which radiates to the room to provide warmth. A network of baseboard , convection or other type of radiant heaters can form a home's main heating system. There are various sizes and models of ​ electric heaters on the market, from wall or ceiling-mounted units to larger furnace and space heaters . \nHeat exchangers and heat pumps either as a whole-home unit or combined with air conditioning in a multifunction heat/air exchanger, can be a way of saving in overall outlay for your home's main comfort systems. \nWhen choosing a main heating system, it's important to buy the proper size of heater rated for the size of your home. A heating technician can recommend the size of heating system you need, as well as help you choose the best and most suitable type for your particular home and area. Check Amazon rating » \ncontinue reading below our video How to Make a Room Feel Bigger Buy from Amazon \nConsidered one of the most energy-efficient ways to heat a home, in-floor radiant heating must be planned and installed when a home is being built. These heating systems are available in whole-home units and can also be used for smaller projects such as bathroom floors. \nThey do require professional installation but this type of heating is well worth considering for a new development. Supply and installation is generally through heating specialists or home renovation centers. Check Amazon rating » Buy from Amazon \nAlso called zone heaters, the most common type of room heating units are baseboard heaters, which require a 220-volt installation. You can install one in every room to heat your entire home. Though you'll need a qualified electrician to install them, no ducting or furnace is required for baseboard heaters, which makes it an ideal heating source for some homes. \nThese types of heaters come either with onboard adjustable or wall-mounted thermostats to control the heat. They are called baseboard heaters since the installation places it on the floor, at the base of the wall. \nBaseboard heaters are available in various sizes and limited colors. These 220-volt heaters are more energy efficient to heat a room than portable heaters. Check Amazon rating » Buy from Amazon \nThough they are often referred to as a type of baseboard heating, convection heaters have differences in heating technology and there can be some installation differences. \nThey require 220-volt installation, the same as traditional baseboard heaters. The main feature of convection heaters is their energy efficiency when compared to traditional baseboard models. \nThey use up to 30% less electricity to heat a room. Some convection heaters have a low profile design similar to traditional baseboard heaters and it can be difficult to tell them apart. Check Amazon rating » Buy from Amazon \nWhen it comes to electric heaters, portable tends to refer more to the ease of plugging these heaters into a standard wall outlet and being able to transfer them to another room as needed. \nHeaters with oscillating features are the most popular for quickly heating up a room while distributing it evenly and ceiling-mounted radiant heaters are ideal for a home shop or garage. \nWhile most portable heaters generally are rated for heating a small room, there are some that can be adequate for larger spaces. Portable heaters are generally not as energy efficient as 220-volt baseboard or convection heaters, but the key word is portability and they are very convenient when you need to add a little more heat to make a room comfortable or while renovating. \nTo better manage high energy bills, it has been proven that turning down your central heating system slightly and supplementing with a portable heater can result in some energy savings .

While there is actually no official announcement yet, the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini Prime with its 4-inch display is now available for purchase through Amazon and eBay. It’s one of the smallest phones available in the market now, and if that’s your thing and you have around $89 to spare, then this should be your thing.\nThe 4-inch display on the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime and with the 480 x 800 pixel resolution, is probably one of the smallest in the market right now. The original variant, the Galaxy J1 was already small enough in itself with its 4.5-inch screen. But other than the differences in the screen size, the two are basically the same. They are powered by a quad-core Spreadtrum SC9830 that clocks in at 1.2GHz. They also have 1GB of RAM and just 8GB of internal memory, but can be expanded through a microSD card.\nThe device has a 5MP main camera and just a VGA front-facing one, so don’t expect to take great mobile photos with this one. It has a 1500 mAh battery which should be good for a few hours and it runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow but no news if it will be able to upgrade to Nougat 7.0. The specs obviously aren’t impressive, but it can serve as a back-up phone for you.\nOn Amazon, you can get the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime for $89 while on eBay, someone seems to be selling it at $86.99. They are both unlocked, with dual SIM support, and is compatible with either AT&T 3G network or T-Mobile but only on 2G.\nVIA: Phone Arena",

      "text": "At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced support for the C# programming language in its Lambda event-driven computing service, as well as a new capability called Lambda@Edge, which makes it possible to run Lambda functions at edge locations where customers store media content around the world on its CloudFront content distribution network (CDN). \nThere is also a new capability called AWS Step Functions, which will allow developers to build full applications in the form of functions that are hooked up together. A visual editor makes it easy to connect multiple functions, Amazon vice president and chief technology officer Werner Vogels explained onstage.\nAltogether this is a big refresh to Lambda, which AWS first introduced at re:Invent two years ago. At the time it was viewed as a revolutionary concept because it let developers do complex things without having to set up and manage the underlying computing and storage infrastructure. \nThe “serverless” concept has been emulated by Google , Microsoft , and IBM — the clouds that are most closely trailing AWS.\nBut Lambda has picked up extra steam in the past year or so as a result of people using it to create skills, or miniature voice-activate apps, for Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant, which is available on Amazon’s Echo line of smart speakers. \nOriginally Lambda launched only with support for Node.js, and then last year AWS added Java support . C# support was highly requested, Amazon vice president and chief technology officer Werner Vogels said onstage today.\nThe philosophy behind letting customers run Lambda functions at CloudFront locations is similar to the thinking behind the AWS GreenGrass software that makes it possible to run Lambda functions on data on AWS Snowball storage devices , which are used to efficiently move data from organizations’ on-premises data centers into AWS facilities.\nCompanies can sign up for the limited preview of Lambda@Edge now, AWS chief evangelist Jeff Barr wrote in a blog post .\nDeveloping…. \n",

      "text": "<iframe src=\"http://www.jdsupra.com/post/contentViewerEmbed.aspx?fid=155ceae8-8e8a-4bfe-b073-6646c51dbc6c\" width=\"100%\" height=\"620\" frameborder=\"1\" style=\"border: 2px solid #ccc; overflow-x:hidden !important; overflow:hidden;\" scrolling=\"auto\"> \nAmazon is taking a new aggressive stance against counterfeiters who use its marketplace — a sign that the massive online retailer’s tactics toward rights-holders may be turning from frustration to friendship. \nIn two suits filed in Washington state court, Amazon alleges that two groups of defendants (one of exercise bands and another selling furniture moving bands) are trafficking in counterfeit goods. [1] These suits, with Amazon as a named plaintiff alleging direct harm caused by entities trafficking in counterfeit goods, appear to indicate a new direction for Amazon — one in which Amazon actively pursues counterfeiters in court. \nFor many years, Amazon has been a target for brand-owners frustrated with the flow of counterfeit goods through its online marketplace. The Amazon marketplace, one of the largest in the world, can be confusing for some consumers, who may not realize that a product identified on the Amazon site may not actually be sold by Amazon itself. Allegations of counterfeit products proliferate. \nHistorically, Amazon’s policies have been more reactive than proactive, requiring brand-owners to issue NOCI (Notice of Claimed Infringement) or “takedown” warnings to Amazon as a trigger to review sales by an alleged counterfeiter. Amazon positioned itself in more of a passive role as the marketplace – the vehicle by which the sales were made – not an active one. This system placed the onus on buyers to be careful, sellers to diligence their wares (presuming they had legitimate intent), and brand-owners to police everyone. While Amazon would respond to the NOCI warnings, brand-owners were constantly asking it to do more to police its marketplace. [2] \nAmazon amended its Business Solutions Agreement in 2014 to take a harder line against counterfeit goods. “We take product authenticity very seriously….If you sell counterfeit goods, we may immediately suspend or terminate your selling privileges and destroy inventory in our fulfillment centers without reimbursement.” Further, “[t]he sale of counterfeit goods can also lead to legal action by rights holders and civil or criminal penalties.” \nIn its new lawsuits, Amazon details its anti-counterfeiting efforts and its specific experiences with these sellers leading up to filing suit. Also, Amazon declares that it “depends on its reputation” and that if “customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers, and manufactures place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon’s brand and causing irreparable reputational harm.” These statements stand in contrast to the position taken in previous litigation, where Amazon claimed it had “no duty to police” its marketplace. Amazon alleges claims of false advertising and breach of contract on behalf of itself, distinct from any claims raised by the manufacturer. These two new lawsuits may signal a significant change in the war by brand-owners against counterfeit goods. \n[1] See A mazon.com, Inc. and Fitness Anywhere LLC v.

      "text": "Menu   Team Inc42 December 1, 2016 6 min read Inc42 Staff 201 SHARES \nAt the 2016 Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, besides unveiling new updates to the cloud provider’s portfolio of services, CEO Andy Jassy also announced the first three services of the Amazon AI portfolio – clearly hinting that Amazon is making a big bet on next-generation technology. AWS And AI \nThe new Amazon Rekognition platform enables developers to quickly and easily build applications that analyse images, and recognise faces, objects, and scenes. It uses deep learning technologies to automatically identify objects and scenes, such as vehicles, pets, or furniture, and provides a confidence score that lets developers tag images so that application users can search for specific images using keywords. With Amazon Rekognition, the user pays for the images they analyse and the face metadata they store. There are no minimum fees and there are no upfront commitments. Image Source: AWS Blog Amazon Lex is a new service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text that is built on the same automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology and natural language understanding (NLU) that powers Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex makes it easy to bring sophisticated, natural language capabilities to virtually any app. Developers can build and test conversational bots directly from the AWS Management Console. Bots built using Amazon Lex can be used anywhere: from web applications, to chat and messenger apps like Slack and Facebook Messenger, or through voice in apps on mobile or connected devices. As a fully managed service, Lex scales automatically, so one does not need to worry about managing infrastructure. \nImage Credit: AWS re:Invent Twitter account \nAmazon Polly is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that is powered by deep learning. It takes a text input and returns an MP3 stream that is altered to sound more like actual conversation. The service supports 47 voices and 27 languages. As per AWS chief evangelist Jeff Barr’s blog post , it’s free to process up to 5 Mn characters a month, and after that it costs $0. 4 per character. \nImage Source: AWS Blog \nWith Polly, a user only pays for the number of characters they convert to speech, and they can save and replay Polly’s generated speech. Polly’s low cost-per-character-converted, and lack of restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way to enable Text-to-Speech everywhere. \nIn the area of analytics, AWS launched Amazon Athena , a server-less query service that makes it easy to analyse data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, customers can point Amazon Athena at their data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard SQL to run queries and get results in seconds. \nImage Credit: AWS re:Invent Twitter account Compute Updates And Lightsail \nAt the conference, Andy also announced a slew of new compute instances and features to its portfolio of cloud services as well. Optimised to deliver the right combination of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for a wide range of applications, the next-generation of AWS’s Memory Optimized, Compute Optimized, and High I/O instances include the latest processors and storage technologies. \nAWS also added two new hardware acceleration options to its range of compute services. The new F1 instance is the cloud’s first customer-programmable, hardware-accelerated compute instance with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs allow customers to easily attach low-cost, professional grade graphics acceleration to Amazon EC2 instances. \nAWS also announced Amazon Lightsail , a new way to get started with AWS that makes it easy to spin up powerful virtual private servers (VPS) that have bundled storage and networking with simple, monthly pricing. Sometimes, developers just want a server in the cloud to deploy their code or run their software, and Amazon Lightsail provides the easiest way for them to launch a VPS with just a few clicks. \nAmazon Lightsail includes everything customers need for projects such as web sites, blogs, custom applications, or development servers. Amazon Lightsail runs on the AWS Cloud, making it easy for customers to connect to the more advanced services when they are ready. Amazon Lightsail is available immediately, and customers pay a simple monthly fee for each virtual private server, starting at $5 per month. With Lightsail, now AWS is directly going after DigitalOcean’s offerings in cloud infrastructure. Greengrass, Snowball, And A Truck To Move Your Data AWS also announced it has added full PostgreSQL compatibility to Amazon Aurora , the AWS database engine that combines the speed and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. Also announced was the AWS Greengrass software which allows customers to run AWS compute, messaging, data caching, and sync capabilities on connected devices. With AWS Greengrass, devices can run AWS Lambda functions to perform tasks locally, keep device data in sync, and communicate with other devices while leveraging the full processing, analytics, and storage power of the AWS Cloud. AWS also announced a new Snowball data transfer appliance, the AWS Snowball Edge that can transport two times more data than the original AWS Snowball (up to 100 TB). AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transfer service that uses secure appliances to allow customers to transfer large amounts of data to and from AWS at as little as one-fifth of the cost of using high-speed internet connections. Since AWS introduced the AWS Snowball data transfer service in October 2015, customers have sent AWS Snowball devices a distance equal to circling the world more than 100 times. \nFor companies that have exabytes of data — of which there are a lot, according to Andy — AWS is introducing a full-size truck containing a 45-foot shipping container in which customers can load data. Snowmobile makes it easy to move massive volumes of data to the cloud, including video libraries, image repositories, or even a complete data center migration. \nAll data is encrypted with 256-bit encryption and you can manage your encryption keys with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Snowmobile includes GPS tracking, alarm monitoring, 24/7 video surveillance, and an optional escort security vehicle while in transit.

      "text": "At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the launch of AWS Batch, a service for automating the deployment of batch processing jobs. \nIn the past decade or so, people have relied on the Hadoop open-source big data software to do batch processing, and AWS and other public clouds have come up with managed versions of Hadoop and additional services that are catered to batch and streaming workloads. Now AWS is trying to more directly meet the needs of developers who want to process lots of data automatically even if it doesn’t happen instantly. \nAnd it’s designed to work with containers as opposed to the more traditional virtual machines (VMs). Customers can provide the exact container images that need to be run on top of the AWS EC2 computing infrastructure. (Shell scripts and Linux executables are also supported, and it will be possible to run Lambda functions in the future.)\nOn top of that, it’s able to take advantage of cheaper EC2 instances — specifically that which is available on the spot market . But customers can specify the types of instances they’d like, as well as minimum and maximum compute resources.\n“In the past, many AWS customers have built their own batch processing systems using EC2 instances, containers, notifications, CloudWatch monitoring, and so forth. This turned out to be a very common AWS use case and we decided to make it even easier to achieve,” AWS chief evangelist Jeff Barr wrote in a blog post .\nThe new service doesn’t cost anything, but charges are incurred based on the resources that the service sets up for you. It’s in preview today but only through AWS’ US East (Northern Virginia) region, Barr wrote.\n",
