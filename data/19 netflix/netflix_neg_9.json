      "text": "Chelsea Lauren/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  55AM PT \nThe Los Angeles premiere of “ Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ” transported guests back to Stars Hollow onscreen and then in real life at the premiere party. The nostalgia pull was overwhelming and many guests teared up at the emotional “Winter” episode that screened, as a core element of it fondly remembering the late Edward Herrmann , who played patriarch Richard Gilmore. \nThe premiere felt like a much-needed warm hug with so many familiar faces at every turn. In addition to stars Lauren Graham , Alexis Bledel and Scott Patterson , returning cast members Matt Czuchry , Sean Gunn , Yanic Truesdale , Liza Weil , Keiko Agena , Danny Strong , and Tanc Sade were there to celebrate and revel in the cheers of screaming fans lining the street. On a heartwarming and bittersweet note, one of Herrmann’s daughters attended the premiere to represent her late father. Related Review: ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ on Netflix \nOn the red carpet, Graham commented on being part of a show that’s ingrained in pop culture vernacular, “I try not to think too much about the outside of things. The day I first read this script in 2000, I’d never connected so strongly to material. I was dying to do it from the first words, so to get to do it again and come back with a sense of appreciation for the fans who helped bring it back, to get to be in a moment and know how lucky you are, was a real treat.” \nShow creator, executive producer and director Amy Sherman-Palladino , clad all in black, save for silver glitter heels, effusively thanked the cast, recalling when they first reassembled in Austin, Texas for a panel which sparked the revival. Of Graham, Sherman-Palladino said, “I’ve always said that there was no ‘Gilmore Girls’’til she walked In the room. I’m so grateful we got to hang out and troll ‘goop’ for hours.” Sherman-Palladino then thanked her husband, executive producer and director Dan Palladino, who she called “the best writer I know.” Her remarks closed with thanks to Netflix “for taking over the world” and Warner Bros. TV for their strong support and “letting us sing show tunes in the hallway.” \nNetflix VP of original series Cindy Holland said of the show, “Wherever they lead, we will follow. We are honored to continue the Stars Hollow story.” \nAfter the screening, the flashback continued as guests made their way to a pop-up Stars Hollow town square on the UCLA campus, festooned in lights, with the show’s trademark gazebo. The eclectic, show-inspired menu featured “Thanksgiving in a bite,” including sliders, pizza, mini Pop-Tarts, donut bread pudding, homemade cider donuts and, of course, really good coffee from Luke’s diner. \nThe “Gilmore Girls” revival hits Netflix on Nov. 25.

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/Longmire) Netflix has officially renewed \"Longmire\" for its sixth and final season. Will Walt be true to his feelings for Vic this time? \nFollowing the announcement that \"Longmire\" will be renewed for its sixth and final season, fans are now trying to speculate what could happen next for the characters. \nSince this will be the final season for the series, viewers are wondering if the showrunner will abide by the events detailed in Craig Johnson's book series. In the books, Walt (Robert Taylor) and Vic (Katee Sackhoff) will end up together. \nWhile fans have long been rooting for the two to come together in romantic terms, it never happened until some bits of evidence that they could potentially find love in each other's arms were dropped in season 5. \nRumor has it that \"Longmire\" season six will finally see Walt and Vic facing their feelings for each other. While Vic seemed to feel that there was something more than a work relationship between them, Walt always dismissed the idea. On the other hand, there is a possibility that Walt will decide to be true to himself this time. Advertisement \nEarlier this month, Netflix announced that \"Longmire\" season 6 is happening amid rumors of a cancellation after season 5. According to Deadline , the upcoming installment will feature 10 episodes and will premiere sometime 2017. \n\"Longmire\" had been canceled by A&E after the finale of season 3 where a major cliffhanger was left for fans to ponder upon. Netflix then salvaged the series and the show later became a huge hit on the streaming service. \nExecutive producers Hunt Baldwin, John Coveny and Greer Shephard said of Netflix's decision to give the show a chance to wrap up the stories of Walt, Vic, and Henry Standing Bear (Lou Diamond Phillips): \"We are grateful to Netflix for the opportunity to compose a closing chapter for these beloved characters that inspires lasting memories. Most importantly, we're committed to delivering a dynamic and satisfying conclusion to our fans that rewards their longtime loyalty.\" \nFor now, fans should wait for further announcements regarding the specific air date for \"Longmire\" season 6.

      "text": "When the residents of Stars Hollow reconvened for Netflix’s highly-anticipated revival series Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life , one key member of the Gilmore family was missing: Edward Herrmann .\nThe actor, who played the distinguished family patriarch Richard Gilmore for seven seasons on the original Gilmore Girls series, passed away in 2014 at age 71 after a battle with brain cancer.\nIn the revival , which debuts Nov. 26, the cast and crew made certain he was there in spirit. His character Richard has also died on the show — but his memory provides key story points as his family processes his loss.\nWhile filming, Herrmann’s set family was able to work through their own feelings about his passing as the material paid loving tribute to their cosstar.\n“It was really a big day to walk on the Gilmore stage without Ed, but there were tears of joy all over the place as well,” Lauren Graham told PEOPLE at the premiere of the new series at Los Angeles’ Fox Bruin Theater on Friday.\n“I really was deeply fond of Ed,” actress Kelly Bishop explained. She shared a plethora of screen time with Herrmann, playing his on-screen wife Emily Gilmore.\n“We were set buddies — we hung out together,” she said. “We did crossword puzzles together, occasionally had a drink after the show, and stayed in touch, mainly via email. So I knew it was going to be sad, but when I read the script, I thought he was so much a part of the show.”\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic She added: “I told his wife that it was going to be bittersweet. She was going to be sad, but very proud because he’s as much a part of the show as if he were still with us. … I think it was wonderfully handled, frankly.”\nSeries creator Amy Sherman-Palladino recalled how shocked the Gilmore Girls team was to learn of Herrmann’s passing, shortly before the long-speculated series revival became a reality.\n“When he died it really felt like, it was weird because he died not too long before we had our [cast] reunion in Austin [at the 2015 ATX Television Festival],” Sherman-Palladino revealed. “So we were all very raw, and it was a big surprise, and we didn’t really know he was sick because he was very proud – he was a proud dude. He was dad.”\nMatt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock “It rocked our world so much,” she continued. “And it’s obviously going to rock Lorelai, Rory and especially Emily’s world so much that that seemed like a good place to chime in. And in chiming in, and seeing how that would affect them, it felt like it was a good way to honor him.”\nBishop said that because Lorelai and Emily’s journeys are about the loss of Richard, the show felt special. “I lost a husband — she lost a parent — there was so much more heft to the scenes, and there was a lot of emotion at times,” she said. “I mean, it wasn’t all good, and it wasn’t all understanding and warm and lovely. It really changed the dynamic tremendously.”\nShe retains fond memories of Herrmann — particularly in how his intriguing mix of carrying high standards while remaining warm and open-minded.\nRELATED VIDEO: Lauren Graham on Gilmore Girls Revival: ‘I’m Nervous Because the Expectation Is So High’ \n“He was always interested in people,” said Bishop. “The thing about Ed that was interesting is that he was a bit of an elitist because he was very smart and he loved learning, but while he had a sort of elitist attitude, he was completely friendly with anyone. So he was not really a snob…He could be friends with anyone. He was a great guy.”\nHarrmann enjoyed a long and prolific career on screen and on stage — including a Tony winning performance in 1976’s Mrs. Warren’s Profession and as well as memorable appearances in films including The Great Waldo Pepper , The Paper Chase , Annie, Overboard and The Lost Boys. \nHe was also Emmy-nominated for his guest work on St. Elsewhere and The Practice — and for his portrayal of president Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Eleanor & Franklin TV movies.\nAmanda Edwards/WireImage The actor’s daughter Ryen Herrmann attended the premiere and revealed that her father didn’t fully realize “just how many fans and the fan base until there would be an event like this.”\n“To him, he got up and got to go to work — but it wasn’t work for him,’ she said. “It was, ‘I got up and got to go be with my other family.’ I mean, literally that’s what it was. It wasn’t work to him.’\n“In our personal lives, Gilmore Girls was an extension of our family,” Ryen added. “I know that he would have loved to be a part of this in real life, so this is incredible for us.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Milo Ventimiglia Talks About What It Was Like to Reunite With the Cast of Gilmore Girls \nAnd Bishop thinks that perhaps her co-star’s spirit made a mischievous appearance while she was shooting a new scene in the Gilmore family living room, where they shot so many scenes together.\n“One time I was standing at the bar fixing drinks or something, and I just thought how many times I’ve stood here, and I’m going to turn around and he’s not going to be there – except I think he was,” she said. “I just feel like he was hovering, and he did manage to turn the lights off once.”\n“I kept calling for him,” she recalled. “I’d sit there on set: ‘Come on, Ed! Come on! Come see us!’ And then one day finally as we got ready to shoot, everything was set up, and everything [electronic] blew. And I went, ‘Okay, I think he’s just arrived. I think he’s with us, yes.’ “",

      "title": "So Choix Sample Subscription Box Review – October 2016",
      "text": "\nSo Choix is a cosmetics sample subscription service; think Netflix for luxury brand cosmetics. Their goal is to combine the best parts of the in-store experience with online shopping. For $15 a month, you’ll get your choice of 5 beauty products to try. Build your queue with any products you want to try from So Choix’s lineup of luxury brands and products. Add, edit, and delete products from your queue as you wish. You’ll also earn 250 points ($5 credit) every month that can be redeemed towards any product at So Choix . Points can be rolled over and do not expire! You can also sample items from So Choix without a subscription for $5 each (turns into $5 credit towards the full–size product).\nChoix is French for choice , and this service strives to give you that. So Choix was created on the following philosophy:\nThat’s why we let you choose the beauty samples you want to try! We let you try on enough sample of the product to determine whether or not that product lives up to a standard you are happy with, because we believe you need to be able to touch and try makeup and beauty products (on your face!) to love it…\nWe want to give you an easy, risk-free, and hassle free way of shopping for beauty…we want to help you make thoughtful decisions about your beauty look, your beauty routine, and help you discover who you are, without pressure! This is beauty on your terms.\n\nProducts and tools are packed in separate containers.\n\nEach product is secured in the box to keep it from rattling around during shipment. The lid contains a list of the items sent.\n\nThe smaller container had tools for me to use when applying my samples – 2 lip gloss brushes and a cotton swab.\n\nBenefit “Boiing” Concealer – Medium Light : I don’t normally use a concealer, but lately I’ve had some serious raccoon eyes going on. This is a light cream formula that applied easily. It was a little hard to get out of the container, and the brush application didn’t pull as much product as I would have liked.\n\nTom Ford Eye Defining Pencil – Bruise : This is a creamy eyeliner that glides on smoothly. The plum color was different but worked well with my purple shadows. However, I will have to look for a similar shade in a different brand. I cannot justify $36 for an eyeliner.\n\nGivenchy Lip Liner – Lip Nude : I liked this shade – it was just slightly lighter than my natural lip. However, the liner had a drier formula and was a little difficult to apply. I’m on the fence with this liner.\n\nTom Ford Nail Lacquer – Sugar Dune : Sorry, I didn’t include a picture of this on my nails. While I liked the nude shade (realized I have an OPI that is similar), I did not like the formula. This had a sheer and streaky application. You need more than 2 or 3 coats for complete opacity. In my opinion, this is not worth the $35 price point. I’ll stick with my $8 polish.\n\nRalph Lauren Tender Romance Eau de Parfum : This has notes of fresh ginger, white magnolia, and soft cashmere. I liked the soft scent and thought it was a good everyday/work fragrance.\n\nI took apart the atomizer to show you how much perfume comes in a sample. There is a fair amount of product for multiple uses. According to So Choix, this is a 3mL sample.\n\nFrom top to bottom: Givenchy lip liner, Tom Ford eyeliner, and Benefit concealer.\n\nI curated my own nude collection from So Choix this month. The samples were a draw on likes vs non-likes. This subscription makes me happy because it saves me, and my wallet, from products that either don’t work as expected or I just don’t like. $15 is a much better value than the nearly $200 I could have potentially spent on this assortment.\nSo, what did you think of the products I chose? Have you tried So Choix ? Share your thoughts below.\nVisit Choix to subscribe or find out more !\n \n",

      "title": "How the Gilmore Girls Team Remembered Their Late Costar Edward Herrmann, On-Screen and Off",
      "text": "Email Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images \nWhen the residents of Stars Hollow reconvened for Netflix’s highly-anticipated revival series Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life , one key member of the Gilmore family was missing: Edward Herrmann . \nThe actor, who played the distinguished family patriarch Richard Gilmore for seven seasons on the original Gilmore Girls series, passed away in 2014 at age 71 after a battle with brain cancer. \nIn the revival , which debuts Nov. 26, the cast and crew made certain he was there in spirit. His character Richard has also died on the show — but his memory provides key story points as his family processes his loss. \nWhile filming, Herrmann’s set family was able to work through their own feelings about his passing as the material paid loving tribute to their cosstar. \n“It was really a big day to walk on the Gilmore stage without Ed, but there were tears of joy all over the place as well,” Lauren Graham told PEOPLE at the premiere of the new series at Los Angeles’ Fox Bruin Theater on Friday. \n“I really was deeply fond of Ed,” actress Kelly Bishop explained. She shared a plethora of screen time with Herrmann, playing his on-screen wife Emily Gilmore. \n“We were set buddies — we hung out together,” she said. “We did crossword puzzles together, occasionally had a drink after the show, and stayed in touch, mainly via email. So I knew it was going to be sad, but when I read the script, I thought he was so much a part of the show.” Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic \nShe added: “I told his wife that it was going to be bittersweet. She was going to be sad, but very proud because he’s as much a part of the show as if he were still with us. … I think it was wonderfully handled, frankly.” \nSeries creator Amy Sherman-Palladino recalled how shocked the Gilmore Girls team was to learn of Herrmann’s passing, shortly before the long-speculated series revival became a reality. \n“When he died it really felt like, it was weird because he died not too long before we had our [cast] reunion in Austin [at the 2015 ATX Television Festival],” Sherman-Palladino revealed. “So we were all very raw, and it was a big surprise, and we didn’t really know he was sick because he was very proud – he was a proud dude. He was dad.” Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock \n“It rocked our world so much,” she continued. “And it’s obviously going to rock Lorelai, Rory and especially Emily’s world so much that that seemed like a good place to chime in. And in chiming in, and seeing how that would affect them, it felt like it was a good way to honor him.” \nBishop said that because Lorelai and Emily’s journeys are about the loss of Richard, the show felt special. “I lost a husband — she lost a parent — there was so much more heft to the scenes, and there was a lot of emotion at times,”she said. “I mean, it wasn’t all good, and it wasn’t all understanding and warm and lovely. It really changed the dynamic tremendously.” \nShe retains fond memories of Herrmann — particularly in how his intriguing mix of carrying high standards while remaining warm and open-minded. \nRELATED VIDEO: Lauren Graham on Gilmore Girls Revival: ‘I’m Nervous Because the Expectation Is So High’ \n“He was always interested in people,” said Bishop. “The thing about Ed that was interesting is that he was a bit of an elitist because he was very smart and he loved learning, but while he had a sort of elitist attitude, he was completely friendly with anyone. So he was not really a snob…He could be friends with anyone. He was a great guy.” \nHarrmann enjoyed a long and prolific career on screen and on stage — including a Tony winning performance in 1976’s Mrs. Warren’s Profession and as well as memorable appearances in films including The Great Waldo Pepper , The Paper Chase , Annie, Overboard and The Lost Boys. \nHe was also Emmy-nominated for his guest work on St. Elsewhere and The Practice — and for his portrayal of president Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Eleanor & Franklin TV movies. Amanda Edwards/WireImage \nThe actor’s daughter Ryen Herrmann attended the premiere and revealed that her father didn’t fully realize “just how many fans and the fan base until there would be an event like this.” \n“To him, he got up and got to go to work — but it wasn’t work for him,’ she said. “It was, ‘I got up and got to go be with my other family.’ I mean, literally that’s what it was. It wasn’t work to him.’ \n“In our personal lives, Gilmore Girls was an extension of our family,” Ryen added. “I know that he would have loved to be a part of this in real life, so this is incredible for us.” \nRELATED VIDEO: Milo Ventimiglia Talks About What It Was Like to Reunite With the Cast of Gilmore Girls \nAnd Bishop thinks that perhaps her co-star’s spirit made a mischievous appearance while she was shooting a new scene in the Gilmore family living room, where they shot so many scenes together. \n“One time I was standing at the bar fixing drinks or something, and I just thought how many times I’ve stood here, and I’m going to turn around and he’s not going to be there – except I think he was,” she said. “I just feel like he was hovering, and he did manage to turn the lights off once.” \n“I kept calling for him,” she recalled. “I’d sit there on set: ‘Come on, Ed! Come on! Come see us!’ And then one day finally as we got ready to shoot, everything was set up, and everything [electronic] blew. And I went, ‘Okay, I think he’s just arrived. I think he’s with us, yes.’“ Show Full Article",

      "text": "This Netflix “Black Mirror” parody is as nerve-wracking as the hit show itself If you haven’t been watching Netflix’s Black Mirror , you’ve been missing out. The sci-fi futuristic horror just released a creepy new season a month ago, and people have been freaking out.\nFeaturing stories set not far in our potential future, the show tells tales of technology gone wrong — or, even scarier, people using technology for terrifying reasons.\nNow, Black Mirror has an even scarier pitch: Netflix Vista . In a parody video (or maybe just a glimpse into our future), Black Mirror shows us a world where we can have Netflix not just at our fingertips with our computers, tablets, and smartphones. With Netflix Vista, we can have the streaming service right on our eyes. Ready for this?\nOMG, right? Pretty horrifying, but also kind of intriguing. Look, we don’t want to be totally unconnected from the world. But being able to watch our favorite shows so easily while taking the train to work or doing some crunches at the gym actually sounds pretty awesome.\nStill, there’s something super unnerving about the video. \nThe moment at the end where two people are sitting completely still across from each other at the dinner table? Chills.\nAnd Netflix knows exactly what we’re thinking. “The question is not if you want this, but are you ready for it?” they ask in the video’s description. We’re not sure we’re ready for it.\nThe post This Netflix “Black Mirror” parody is as nerve-wracking as the hit show itself appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "By Kayleigh Roberts Nov 19, 2016 We're officially less than a week away from the premiere of Netflix's Gilmore Girls revival and there is no chill to be found anywhere. At this point, people are literally tasking Gilmore Girls with \"saving\" 2016. It's a lot to ask, but if any show can deliver, it will be this one (*please* let it be this one). In anticipation of the impending premiere, Netflix just released another Gilmore trailer and there's a LOT to unpack here. Let's dive right in. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 1. Rory and Lorelai are adored (and waited upon) by the next generation of Stars Hollow citizens. GIF Most Popular 2. Luke is still calling them out on their shenanigans (we'd be disappointed if he wasn't). GIF 3. Rory is going to spend time with two small children—but whose are they? GIF 4. Lorelai seems to be involved in planning a wedding. Like, really involved. 5. Adult Rory cannot find her underwear. GIF 6. But she *does* have plans that warrant a \"lucky outfit.\" GIF 7. Stars Hollow snow is still the *MOST MAGICAL* snow there is. GIF 8. No matter what team you're on, know that all of Rory's exes aged well. GIF Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 9. Emily Gilmore shops at Kohl's (unless she borrowed this Candie's shirt from Lorelai). 10. Lorelai is still obsessed with coffee (not that we needed a new trailer to tell us that). GIF 11. Rory Gilmore is every millennial struggling to figure things out. GIF 12. Richard's death is going to wreck you even more than you thought. GIF 13. Lorelai is ~soul searching~. GIF 14. And...questioning her relationship with Luke? WHA?? No. No. No. *Sticks fingers in ears and hums loudly* GIF 15. Rory is still friends with Paris and Lane. GIF 16. Stars Hollow has a whole \"thirty-something gang\" who \"went to college, then out in the real world, and it spit 'em out like a stale piece of gum and now they're all back in their old rooms.\" Like Rory. Ouch. Sorry, Rory. GIF 17. The Stars Hollow Musical might be the best thing we ever see. GIF 18. Caesar still works at the diner! GIF 19. Paris still has significant anger issues. GIF 20. And that wedding Lorelai was planning? Looks like Luke is wearing a tux to it. NBD. (JK. BD. VBD.) 21. The Gilmore ladies can still EAT. GIF Watch the glory for yourself and of course watch the ~whole thing~ when Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life drops on Netflix November 25.",

      "text": "A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" could be celebrating Thanksgiving at home with his family in Wisconsin after a judge Monday ordered him released from prison.\nBrendan Dassey's release was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin even as prosecutors appeal the judge's earlier ruling overturning Dassey's conviction. It's not clear how quickly Dassey will be released. He faces a Tuesday deadline to provide information on where he will live and federal probation officers must also inspect the site before he is released. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel promised to file an emergency motion in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to keep Dassey behind bars.\nDuffin ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach at the Avery family salvage yard in Manitowoc County in 2005. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan.\nThe state has appealed that ruling and argued Dassey should remain in prison while it was pending.\nDassey was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilating a corpse. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe Dassey as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking.\nIn his August ruling, Duffin said investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" Schimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made.\nAttorneys are in the process of filing legal briefs in the appeal, which is expected to be argued sometime next year.\nWisconsin AG appeals overturned conviction of 'Making a Murderer' nephew Tribune news services Wisconsin's attorney general on Friday appealed the overturned conviction of a man accused of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the popular Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Brendan Dassey into confessing...\nWisconsin's attorney general on Friday appealed the overturned conviction of a man accused of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the popular Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"\nA federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators tricked Brendan Dassey into confessing...\n(Tribune news services) State prosecutors argued that in the meantime, Dassey should remain in prison because he's a serious threat to public safety. But Duffin in ordering Dassey set free cited his \"exceedingly benign\" prison disciplinary record and the fact that he had no convictions before the Halbach case.\nDassey, now 27, was 16 when Halbach was killed.\nThe judge ordered Dassey released as soon as the federal probation office approved where he was going to live and \"completed whatever additional investigation it deems necessary.\" Dassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he didn't know how long that would take but he hoped Dassey would be free by Thanksgiving, which was just 10 days away.\n\"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Drizin said.\nDassey had until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he plans to live. Drizin would not say exactly where Dassey would be living.\nGiven that his family lives in northeast Wisconsin, there is little chance Dassey will try to flee, the judge said. Under the judge's order, Dassey would be forbidden from having contact with Avery or Halbach's family.\nDassey's attorneys filed a motion seeking his release in September after Duffin overturned his conviction. That filing said Dassey had developed a plan with a social worker that calls for him to live initially with his mother in a family-owned trailer in rural northeastern Wisconsin about 100 miles from Manitowoc, arguing that would minimize the disruption for the community, Dassey and the Halbach family.\nThe plan calls for Dassey to later relocate to an apartment in Brown County that his mother and stepfather would rent for him. He would then start participating in educational and job training.\nMike Halbach, Teresa's brother, and Barb Janda, Dassey's mother, did not return calls for comment.\nDassey would have to meet numerous other conditions, including reporting to a probation officer, not owning a gun or other weapon, being available for home visits and getting approval before moving. Any travel outside of eastern Wisconsin would have to be approved by the court and Dassey could not get a passport.\nAvery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal.\nTheir cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men.\n Chicago Tribune Trials and Arbitration Homicide Crime",

      "text": "Tweet \nNetflix’s new series Black Mirror, which fans and critics alike say is this generation’s Twilight Zone — probably meaning super ramped up creepiness that only years of perfecting horror and thriller films can bring — is being promoted in a new ad that may deter you from wanting to watch the show at all. \nThe show itself is a vignette-style drama featuring “satirical tales that explore techno-paranoia” and general queasiness about the modern world, according the the show’s Wikipedia page . A different way of saying that is that it explores the dark side of things like binge-watching Netflix. \nThe new ad is a meta exploration of that dark side and, if it’s successful in bringing in viewers, begs the question: what’s going on with us as a culture that we are intrigued rather than repulsed by technology that would allow us to binge watch our stories no matter where we are? \nDark, creepy, yet intriguing. Definitely intriguing. Something special for your bright, bright future. pic.twitter.com/gDpbPGCJpE \n— Black Mirror (@blackmirror) November 18, 2016 Rate this story",

      "text": "Efforts by Amazon ( AMZN ) to significantly expand its global video streaming service will put it near the same level as Netflix ( NFLX ) in how much they spend on content and distribution.\nAmazon on Thursday disclosed on a webpage it will expand its video streaming service to 200 countries, up from five currently, ratcheting up their competition with Netflix. Amazon said it will launch \"The Grand Tour,\" an Amazon original series, worldwide in December. Starting Friday, the series will launch in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Australia and Japan.\nNetflix airs in some 190 countries, with China the only major holdout.\nAmazon did not issue a press release announcing the global expansion, leaving that role to CEO Jeff Bezos in a tweet.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n\nJefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald in a research note estimated that the launch of a global video streaming service by Amazon would require an additional $1 billion to $2 billion in video content spending in 2017. That would bring Amazon's annual content expenditure in line with Netflix, at about $6 billion for 2017, Fitzgerald wrote. The $6 billion is up from an estimated $4.5 billion Amazon will spend this year, he estimates.\n\"Three weeks ago Amazon reported a mixed quarter with solid top line performance and soft margins; margin guidance disappointed too. Now we know where a major piece of incremental investment might be going to — digital content for Amazon Video,\" Fitzgerald wrote.\nAmazon missed the consensus estimate on earnings per share by a wide margin when it reported third quarter earnings Oct. 27, while its profit guidance for Q4 also fell short. The main reason for the earnings miss was larger-than-expected investments in video content, Amazon Web Services and an expansion of fulfillment centers.\n\"Considering the fact that in general Amazon makes announcements of strategic initiatives only after the bulk of the necessary assets are already in place, we believe that the company has more or less secured the global rights for a core streaming video offering,\" Fitzgerald wrote.\nAmazon's global rollout begins with \"The Grand Tour\" and is expected to expand rapidly into new markets.\nNetflix, in addition to the increased competition from Amazon is confronting a more aggressive Hulu, which plans to launch a live streaming TV service in 2017, in addition to its original and third-party content. Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney ( DIS ), NBCUniversal parent Comcast ( CMCSA ), 21st Century Fox ( FOXA ) and Time Warner ( TWX ).\nJefferies analyst John Janedis, in a research note on Netflix, said Amazon appears to be aggressively securing digital rights for content in India, much more so than Netflix. In India, Amazon has been developing relationships with local talent and has started making investments in high quality content, je wrote. Janedis has an underperform rating on Amazon and price target of 80. Fitzgerald has a buy rating on Amazon and price target of 950.\nAmazon stock rose 0.50% to 760.16 in the stock market today . Netflix stock rose a small fraction to 115.21.",

      "text": "Asia Pacific SVOD Forecasts, 2021: Netflix, Amazon, Iflix, HOOQ and Viu will Enjoy Rapid Growth - Research and Markets [November 18, 2016] Asia Pacific SVOD Forecasts, 2021: Netflix, Amazon, Iflix, HOOQ and Viu will Enjoy Rapid Growth - Research and Markets Tweet \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Asia Pacific SVOD Forecasts\" report to their offering. \nThe Asia Pacific region will have 157.78 million SVOD [subscription video on demand] subscribers by 2021, up from 41.68 million in 2015 and 76.12 million expected by end-2016. The total will be nudging 100 million by end-2017, according to the Asia Pacific SVOD Forecasts report. \nRapid smartphone subscription growth means that China will command 47% of the 2021 total SVOD subscribers - up from 38% in 2015. From the 82 million additions between 2016 and 2021, China will supply 34 million, Japan 9 million and India 15 million. \nBy 2021, 17.5% of the region's TV households [across 7 countries] will subscribe to an SVOD platform, up from only 5.1% by end-2015 and 9.1% expected by end-2016. Penetration rates in 2021 will vary from 53.5% in Australia (with four countries above 50%) to 8.0% in Pakistan. \nAlthough Netflix, Amazon, Iflix, HOOQ and Viu will enjoy rapid growth, they will collectively only account for 16% of the region's SVOD subscribers by 2021. \nNetflix is forecast to have 7.59 million subscribers in the region by 2021, up from 3.17 million at end-2016. Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand will together account for nearly three-quarters of the total. Netflix is considered expensive in most other countries. We do not believe that Netflix will launch as a standalone platform in China. \nThe report comprises: \n- Major SVOD players, including subscriber estimates by country (2010 to 2021) for the major platforms. \n- Country-by-country forecasts from 2010 to 2021 \n- Country profiles \nFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6fjx5s/asia_pacific_svod View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161118005297/en/",

NETFLIX From left: Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Scott Patterson in a scene from 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' (Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix, Saeed Adyani/Netflix, Saeed Adya) \nGrand. Giddy. Gifted with the pithy gab. \"Gilmore Girls\" was that rare TV series that made you want to crawl inside the screen and spend some quality time with the mother-daughter duo of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, who lived in the quirky, slightly precious Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. It left the air in 2007 after a final season that was absent the input of its creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, a TV injustice that never felt right to its coffee-and-fast-patter-loving fans. \nOn Friday, Netflix drops the ultimate \"GG\" Thanksgiving gift with the four-part series, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" that gives Sherman-Palladino the coda she deserves. The series reunites the original cast and provides an update on where the female-dominated Gilmore generational line is at now. Suffice it to say that things are slightly anxious, but never too discouraging to stop Lorelai and Rory from wearing fabulous coats and dropping constant streams of pop-culture references. \n►Review: You'll still laugh and cry at Netflix's return to 'Gilmore Girls' \nWhat's the \"GG\" universe up to these days? Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is together with her diner-running soul mate, Luke (Scott Patterson), but facing a vague midlife crisis of sorts. \n\"I always thought I knew exactly what I wanted and where I was going. Lately, I don't know. Things seem hazier,\" she says in the preview. \nOverachieving Rory, who was supposed to save the world by now through good journalism, is having a bout of what appears to be existential aimlessness. \n\"I have no job, I have no credit, I have no underwear,\" she's shown griping to former beau Jess (Milo Ventimiglia). \"I coulda been a contender.\" \nMeanwhile, exacting matriarch Emily (the awesome Kelly Bishop) is mourning the death of the male head of the household, her patrician teddy bear of a husband, Richard (who was played by the late Edward Herrmann, a former Grosse Pointer). \"I don't know how to do this,\" she says. \"I was married for 50 years. Half of me is gone.\" \nThe quartet of 90-minute episodes brings back \"GG\" characters who feel like imaginary friends who've been away for a decade: lovable chef Sookie (played by the now-comedy-superstar Melissa McCarthy), Rory's BFFs Paris (Liza Weil) and Lane (Keiko Agena), Rory's boyfriends Jess, Dean (Jared Padalecki) and Logan (Matt Czuchry), town windbag Taylor (Michael Winters) and the mystery that is Kirk (Sean Gunn). So give thanks for a chance to revisit a series that's humane, optimistic and embracing of core values like family, community and ordering five kinds of ethnic food to eat when you're having a junk TV marathon. Raise your caffeinated beverage of choice to the glory that is \"Gilmore Girls.\" 4 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2fGXO00 More Stories",

      "text": "The Los Angeles premiere of “ Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ” transported guests back to Stars Hollow onscreen and then in real life at the premiere party. The nostalgia pull was overwhelming and many guests teared up at the emotional “Winter” episode that screened, as a core element of it fondly remembering the late Edward Herrmann , who played patriarch Richard Gilmore.\nThe premiere felt like a much-needed warm hug with so many familiar faces at every turn. In addition to stars Lauren Graham , Alexis Bledel and Scott Patterson , returning cast members Matt Czuchry , Sean Gunn , Yanic Truesdale , Liza Weil , Keiko Agena , Danny Strong , and Tanc Sade were there to celebrate and revel in the cheers of screaming fans lining the street. On a heartwarming and bittersweet note, one of Herrmann’s daughters attended the premiere to represent her late father.\nOn the red carpet, Graham commented on being part of a show that’s ingrained in pop culture vernacular, “I try not to think too much about the outside of things. The day I first read this script in 2000, I’d never connected so strongly to material. I was dying to do it from the first words, so to get to do it again and come back with a sense of appreciation for the fans who helped bring it back, to get to be in a moment and know how lucky you are, was a real treat.”\nShow creator, executive producer and director Amy Sherman-Palladino , clad all in black, save for silver glitter heels, effusively thanked the cast, recalling when they first reassembled in Austin, Texas for a panel which sparked the revival. Of Graham, Sherman-Palladino said, “I’ve always said that there was no ‘Gilmore Girls’ ’til she walked In the room. I’m so grateful we got to hang out and troll ‘goop’ for hours.” Sherman-Palladino then thanked her husband, executive producer and director Dan Palladino, who she called “the best writer I know.” Her remarks closed with thanks to Netflix “for taking over the world” and Warner Bros. TV for their strong support and “letting us sing show tunes in the hallway.”\nNetflix VP of original series Cindy Holland said of the show, “Wherever they lead, we will follow. We are honored to continue the Stars Hollow story.”\nAfter the screening, the flashback continued as guests made their way to a pop-up Stars Hollow town square on the UCLA campus, festooned in lights, with the show’s trademark gazebo. The eclectic, show-inspired menu featured “Thanksgiving in a bite,” including sliders, pizza, mini Pop-Tarts, donut bread pudding, homemade cider donuts and, of course, really good coffee from Luke’s diner.\nThe “Gilmore Girls” revival hits Netflix on Nov. 25.\nRelated stories\nAmazon Gives Quiet Launch to Prime Video in Australia\nNetflix's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' Trailer Promises Lots of Misfortune, Neil Patrick Harris (Watch)\nTV News Roundup: Rumer Willis Joins 'Empire,' Justin Bieber to Perform for AMAs\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Netflix’s ‘Black Mirror’ Takes Aim at … Netflix (Video) More Netflix’s sci-fi drama “Black Mirror” offers scarily close-to-home commentary about how technology changes our lives, and now it’s taking on the technology that lets us watch “Black Mirror.”\nA new online ad for the series imagines a world in which everyone can watch Netflix through contact-lens-like devices, activated by an implant in our necks. The fake (so far) technology is called “Netflix Vista.”\nThe ad shows people using Netflix Vista to watch scenes from our favorite episodes of “Black Mirror,” including the one that inspired Netflix Vista.\nAlso Read: 'Black Mirror': 5 Real-Life Inspirations for the Mind-Bending Satire (Photos)\nThe third episode of Season 1, entitled “The Entire History of You,” imagines a near future in which people use implants called “grains” to record every aspect of their lives — and sometimes play them back for everyone, with occasionally disastrous effects. Robert Downey Jr. has optioned the episode to be made into a feature film. (There’s no word on when the Downey adaptation will be available on Netflix Vista.)\nLike every piece of technology in “Black Mirror,” Netflix Vista sounds great … at the beginning. But by the end of the ad we see how “Netflix and chill” has been replaced by “Netflix Vista and give everyone else the cold shoulder.”\nUsing a grain to watch Netflix isn’t that different from using our phones to watch Netflix, of course. Here’s a list of the five real-life inspirations for great “Black Mirror” episodes.\nYou can watch the Netflix Vista ad here:\nSomething special for your bright, bright future. pic.twitter.com/gDpbPGCJpE\n— Black Mirror (@blackmirror) November 18, 2016\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n'Black Mirror': Where Was 'San Junipero' Filmed?\n'Black Mirror' Fact Check: Do Most Soldiers Really Not Shoot?\n'Black Mirror' Fact Check: Can Hackers Watch You Through Your Camera?",

      "text": "TOKYO — Netflix and Japan ’s public broadcaster NHK are partnering on a four-part historical drama to be broadcast next month.\nNHK will broadcast “ Tokyo Trials ” about the post-WWII court hearings of Japanese war criminals, on its terrestrial channel, while Netflix will stream it abroad. Then, after the NHK On-Demand VoD service has aired the series for a period, Netflix will also offer it to users in Japan.\nBoth companies contributed to the production costs, with NHK concluding co-production deals with L.A.- and Toronto-based Don Carmody Television and Amsterdam-based FATT Productions. Pieter Verhoeff and Rob King are the drama’s co-directors.\nAfter launching in Japan in the fall of 2015, Netflix has made shows with Japanese with broadcaster Fuji TV, talent agency Yoshimoto Kogyo, and ad agency Dentsu. For NHK, however, this sort of production and broadcast arrangement with Netflix is a first.\nRelated stories\nTech Stocks' Donald Trump Hangover Continues\nJapan Box Office: 'Your Name' Stays Top in 12th Week, Beats 'Museum' Opening\nHayao Miyazaki Hints at Return to Feature Filmmaking\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "People go to Luke’s Diner for reassuring takes on classics like grilled cheese, pie, and coffee, not for foodie creations that look and taste unfamiliar. Most of the viewers who dive into Netflix’s “new” incarnation of “ Gilmore Girls ” are probably operating from a similar impulse: They want their TV comfort food, and they want it now.\nBreathe a sigh of relief: The “Gilmore Girls” we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it’s the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it’s a little too much at times — and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised — but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring.\nThe early sections of the first episode dwell heavily on cameos from returning characters and spend a lot of time recapturing the vibe in the small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, where grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson) sighs at freeloaders who want his wifi password, and where the sweetly wayward Kirk (Sean Gunn) is excited about yet another preposterous money-making scheme. But for those who want a retreat from reality in order to spend time in this beautiful little Brigadoon of a town, where a scheme to install a new sewer system is one of the most pressing issues on the local agenda, these “Gilmore Girls” episodes will feel like a warm blanket on a cold winter night.\nAt times, the fan service threatens to take over the storytelling, and there are signs of the drift that afflicts other Netflix series: Sub-plots that would have gotten a scene or two in the WB version of the show receive extensive and sometimes indulgent amounts of room in the four installments of “A Year in the Life,” each of which depicts a season in Stars Hollow. It takes a while for various story threads to kick into gear, but “Gilmore Girls” was always more interested in spending time with its eccentric array of characters than in powering through various tightly disciplined plot points.\nThe good news is, despite some structural wobbles, its singular combination of screwball patter, self-aware whimsy and barbed WASP drama remains more or less intact, and 16 years after the show debuted on the WB, “Gilmore Girls” continues to owe a great deal of its success to Lauren Graham . She slips back into creator Amy Sherman-Palladino’s rat-a-tat dialogue without missing a beat, and her nuanced performance as Lorelai Gilmore supplies the show’s beating heart. The “girls” in this narrative — Lorelai, Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) and Emily (Kelly Bishop) — can sometimes be monstrously selfish or annoyingly oblivious, and it’s not always clear that the show is aware of how grating the Gilmores can be at their most narcissistic or even cruel.\nBut Graham and Bishop in particular are masters of imbuing their evasive characters with layers of pain, yearning and compassion, and Graham’s chemistry with Bledel remains charming. For this program to work, the love these women have for each other must remain palpable, and it is, certainly in some scenes near the end that are likely to bring a tear to the eye.\nAs was often the case with the earlier incarnation of the show at its most potent, what gives “A Year in the Life” its spine is something thorny and painful. The three Gilmore women are mourning the loss of Emily’s husband, Richard, and given his importance to the clan, it’s entirely appropriate that the show spends this much time on the fallout from that death. The focus on grief is also a tribute to actor Edward Herrmann, who played the preppy Richard with such versatile bonhomie for so many years.\nA death in any family kicks off a reshuffling of relationships and priorities that can be difficult to navigate in the best of circumstances, and given how prickly Emily and Lorelai’s relationship was to begin with, their post-Richard year is often an emotional minefield. But Bishop and Graham play their scenes of conflict and commiseration with such verbally dextrous facility that many of them are simply enthralling. There’s one Lorelai speech in the final episode — which is by far the strongest of the four — that easily matches Graham’s most memorable moments from the previous seven seasons.\nRead More Like Graham and Bishop, Patterson knocks his monologues out of the park. The terse Luke gets fewer big moments, but the way he has always lovingly and exasperatedly held his own with Lorelai has always been one of the show’s chief draws. Speaking of other men in the orbits of the Gilmore women, “A Year in the Life” might serve as something of a referendum among fans: How much Logan (Matt Czuchry) did anyone really want? That particular subplot tends to go in circles without acquiring much in the way of depth or texture. Czuchry’s performance is faultless, but the show goes to that well more than it should have.\n“Gilmore Girls” was never in the business of supplying gritty realism — and hooray for that — but sometimes its so unrealistic that it intrudes on one’s enjoyment of the show. Rory is flailing in her early 30s, and her bank account is apparently on life support too, but during much of “A Year in the Life,” she goes on long, expensive flights without worrying too much about the cost. There’s also a Rory subplot involving a loopy British character that supplies few comic dividends.\nIn its previous seasons, fans got used to putting up with the show’s more tiresome excesses because the good stuff was so often worth waiting for, and that’s the case here. “Gilmore Girls” distracts viewers with fun, silly tangents (and the supporting cast is uniformly good at supplying those kinds of moments). But there is darkness at the heart of all those layers of eccentricity and surreal flights of fancy, and those tougher elements are as necessary as Sam Phillips’ lilting music, the hilarious intensity of Paris (Liza Weil) or the withering put-downs of Lorelai’s employee, Michel (Yanic Truesdale).\nThe hard kernel at the core of the series is that Lorelai usually feels rejected by Emily, who never understood her spirited daughter and who reacted badly when she became pregnant at 16 all those years ago. The very proper Emily, in turn, projects her fears on to Lorelai, and both women talk past each other in a lifelong battle to gain control of the family narrative. In this go-round, as she has always done, Rory tries to make peace between her elders as she attempts to carve out a place in the world that is not overly dominated by these two women, neither of whom likes coming out from behind her emotional defenses.\nEverything “Gilmore Girls” tries to pack in — the wit, the whimsy, the pop-culture references, the family conflict, the perfectly calibrated insults, the set pieces that go on a bit too long — can feel pretty pummeling at a 90-minute running time. The show is sometimes too overstuffed for its own good.\nSo here’s a recipe for enjoying this new edition of “Gilmore Girls”: Get a blanket and a mug of cocoa, and watch 30 or maybe 40 minutes at a time. It’ll still be there, waiting for you, next time you need a distinctive and idiosyncratic blast from the past, one that makes the transition to the present fairly seamlessly.\nIn other words, don’t binge on this comfort food. In these difficult and uncertain times, why not make it last?\nRelated stories\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Trailer Offers First Look at the Return to Stars Hollow (Watch)\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' Gets Four Seasonally Appropriate Posters from Netflix\nFrom 'Supergirl' to 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,' Women Are the Real Heroes of the CW\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Netflix VP on 'Gilmore Girls' Revival: 'Wherever They Lead, We Will Follow' Updated: November 19, 2016 — 1:55 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Diane Gordon \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - The Los Angeles premiere of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" transported guests back to Stars Hollow onscreen and then in real life at the premiere party. The nostalgia pull was overwhelming and many guests teared up at the emotional \"Winter\" episode that screened, as a core element of it fondly remembering the late Edward Herrmann, who played patriarch Richard Gilmore. \nThe premiere felt like a much-needed warm hug with so many familiar faces at every turn. In addition to stars Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Scott Patterson, returning cast members Matt Czuchry, Sean Gunn, Yanic Truesdale, Liza Weil, Keiko Agena, Danny Strong, and Tanc Sade were there to celebrate and revel in the cheers of screaming fans lining the street. On a heartwarming and bittersweet note, one of Herrmann's daughters attended the premiere to represent her late father. \nRelated Review: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' on Netflix \nOn the red carpet, Graham commented on being part of a show that's ingrained in pop culture vernacular, \"I try not to think too much about the outside of things. The day I first read this script in 2000, I'd never connected so strongly to material. I was dying to do it from the first words, so to get to do it again and come back with a sense of appreciation for the fans who helped bring it back, to get to be in a moment and know how lucky you are, was a real treat.\" \nShow creator, executive producer and director Amy Sherman-Palladino, clad all in black, save for silver glitter heels, effusively thanked the cast, recalling when they first reassembled in Austin, Texas for a panel which sparked the revival. Of Graham, Sherman-Palladino said, \"I've always said that there was no 'Gilmore Girls' 'til she walked In the room. I'm so grateful we got to hang out and troll 'goop' for hours.\" Sherman-Palladino then thanked her husband, executive producer and director Dan Palladino, who she called \"the best writer I know.\" Her remarks closed with thanks to Netflix \"for taking over the world\" and Warner Bros. TV for their strong support and \"letting us sing show tunes in the hallway.\" \nNetflix VP of original series Cindy Holland said of the show, \"Wherever they lead, we will follow. We are honored to continue the Stars Hollow story.\" ",

And we won’t want to escape. \nI'm A Celebrity's Martin Roberts is victim of sweet justice in bushtucker trial after his snoring How do we know? Well, we’ve just seen a horrifying promo for Netflix Vista, the platforms’s new cutting-edge wearable technology which ensures all our viewing needs are met — and which sits inside our eyes.\nYes. Humanity — surely keen to sign up to Netflix Vista for £9.99 a month come Friday — is bound for ruination.\nBut do not despair just yet, for all is not at it seems. After this video hits the 40-second mark, shrewd TV fans will notice they are actually watching a Black Mirror ad.\n&&&&& To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIndeed, as we see various Netflix customers writing over their daily lives with endless television, coating their irises in a milky fog, we hear an old song — a song called Anyone Who Knows What Love Is.\nThis track was used in the episode Fifteen Million Merits from Black Mirror series one, so that’s a major clue we’re not actually watching a Netflix Vista ad.\nSay goodbye to your soul (Picture: Netflix) And the clips we see flashing up from the sci-fi show itself, which formerly aired on Channel 4, are even bigger giveaways.\nPhew! The future isn’t Charlie Brooker’s vision of a zombie human race with TV stuck in their eyes after all!\nNetflix Vista is a vision of a future where consumers are slaves (Picture: Netflix) While it’s rather sad that this is ultimately a piece of clever, knowing advertising, it’s at least heartening to see Netflix is willing to poke fun at itself, not to mention mock its users.\n‘Your life is a story. Get out and watch it,’ reads the final tagline, which could either be a send-up of insidious, guilt-inducing marketing strategies, or just earnest self-promotion by Netflix.\n! (Picture: Netflix) Still, the effort that was put into this ad should be applauded, and its look fits the aesthetic of the series itself very well indeed.\nIt had us scared for a few moments…\nConsumer slaves may wish to know that all six episodes of Black Mirror series three, as well as episodes from previous series, are available now on Netflix. \nMORE: Netflix’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events looks very different from the 2004 film version \nMORE: Gilmore Girls cast refuse to call the Netflix revival ‘an ending’ sparking hope for fans ",

Show Caption Previous Next \nHere are some favorite holiday movies that you can watch anytime, courtesy of your Netflix account. 1. “Scrooged” (1988) \nBill Murray is a curmudgeonly network TV exec in this somewhat updated version of the Charles Dickens epic “A Christmas Carol.” Let’s just say he gets more than a lump of coal by the end of the film. \n2. “A Very Murray Christmas” (2015) \nBill makes a second appearance on this list in this Netflix original, joined by the always dapper George Clooney and Miley Cyrus. \n3. “White Christmas” (1954) \nYou’ll be dreaming of you know what in no time, even if you live in, say, Phoenix. 4. “Kung Fu Panda: Holiday” (2010) \nSure, reindeer are the default animal for the season, but pandas have a place, too. \n5. “Winnie The Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year” (2002) \nOh, bother. Have fun with Winnie and the entire gang. Well, maybe Eeyore won’t have any fun, but you knew that. ",

      "text": "More from Denise Duguay, Montreal Gazette Published on: November 20, 2016 | Last Updated: November 20, 2016 4:00 PM EST \nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in a scene from Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, on Netflix starting Nov. 25. Saeed Adyani / Netflix Share Adjust Comment Print \nI won’t even try to pretend there are choices this week. There is only one thing to watch: the return of the beloved Gilmore Girls to Netflix on Friday. But while they pale in comparison, here are some options to limp through the other six days. Let’s go! \nMonday, Nov. 21 \nTravelers (9 p.m., Showcase) \nWell, that was close! I had feared a perfectly good sci-fi time-travel show had gone all soapy on me, with Eric McCormack’s FBI Agent MacLaren getting pulled into a turf war with a rogue traveller and supposedly brilliant doctor Marcy and tech genius Philip unable to get his addiction enough under control to execute their mission. The hook for this show is brilliant scientists from the future having to surmount the very human challenges of their hosts, but, seriously, Travelers! Then the series corrected itself back toward science thriller with last week’s Room 101, which left MacLaren on his own as the rest of the team endured torture. Will MacLaren’s 11th-hour rescue allow the reunited team to complete their primary mission and save the future? We’ll find out tonight in Helios-685. \nTuesday, Nov. 22 \nThis Is Us (9 p.m., CTV, NBC) \nTwo days ahead of the real U.S. Thanksgiving, this family drama celebrates turkey day in both of its eras. In the way back portion of the episode Pilgrim Rick, Jack (Milo Ventimiglia), Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and the kids are detoured from their usual holiday plans, and in the present, Kate embraces decision-making, Kevin introduces Olivia to the fam and Randall gets his heart broken – again. \nWednesday, Nov. 23 \nMercy ( Netflix.com as of Nov. 22) \nMom is dying and four brothers – well, some are only half-brothers but who cares about that right? – have come home to be there for her. Or for the large inheritance, which just happens to get mentioned. And there’s also that group of uninvited balaclava-wearing guests. It’s going to be a long night. \nThursday, Nov. 24 \nThe Great Indoors (8:30 p.m., Global , CBS) \nHow are you liking the new workplace comedy starring Community’s Joel McHale, playing a former star correspondent now roped to a digital magazine desk job? My DVR is full of its first few episodes. Tweet me your thoughts if you can roust yourself from the couch. Tonight’s episode is No Bad Ideas, in which Jack (McHale) gives a brutal performance review. \nFriday, Nov. 25 \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ( Netflix.com ) \nDiscovered and revered by TV streamers after all seven seasons appeared on the popular TV streaming app, this solid-gold show about the big emotions of the small-town characters of Stars Hollow is back on this day with four new 90-minute episodes. It’s nine years later and one time wild child Lorelai (Parenthood’s Lauren Graham) is with Luke (Scott Patterson), Rory (Alexis Bledel) is at a crossroads, and grandmother Emily (Kelly Bish op) is grieving the loss of husband Richard (Edward Herrmann, who died in 2014). Also back are Melissa McCarthy (Mike and Molly), Milo Ventimiglia (This Is Us), Jared Padalecki (Supernatural), Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife) and more. Some tea and tissues and I’m good for the night. \nSaturday, Nov. 26 \nMichael Che Matters (Netflix.com as of Nov. 25) \nYou know this comic as the acid half of the Weekend Update news team on Saturday Night Live, which you can catch up on at globaltv.com/saturdaynightlive . But first, watch Che’s full standup show, taped live at the Greenpoint Terminal Warehouse in Brooklyn. Topics include “Donald Trump, white girls, Hitler, Jesus.” OK. \nSunday, Nov. 27 \nShameless (9 p.m., The Movie Network) \nSo how are things with America’s most messed up, but biggest-hearted family? The lovely, heartbreaking Lip (Jeremy Allen White) is trying to hide his relapse, Debbie (Emma Kenney) finds an unexpected ally in the fight to regain custody of daughter Franny and the laundromat gets a bad review. Curses! Three more episodes left in the season. \nThat’s it for me this week. Got a question? Spot an error? Find me, tell me. And remember, we do our best but times and dates are subject to change.

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Top Lists > 5 Series Similar to Gilmore Girls on Netflix 5 Series Similar to Gilmore Girls on Netflix Tweet \nThe newly made Netflix Original series is set to bring out its brand new season featuring four new episodes at the end of November 2016 and to celebrate, we’re taking a look at what else you should be streaming if you love Gilmore Girls. \nWhat are we looking for when searching for alternative series? Well, first and foremost we’re looking for the warmth that Gilmore Girls has. Secondly, we’re looking for the light comedy aspect, and thirdly anything that fits the previous two-plus is infinitely bingeable. We’re talking those shows you watch ten times over. Parks and Recreation \nAlthough Parks and Recreation is a lot giddier than Gilmore Girls (particularly in the middle seasons) the warmth is still there with this show that makes you care about the characters. Like our favourite Gilmore’s Leslie ultimately is trying her hardest to have the best and a positive impact of those around her. It’s also one of the most watchable shows on Netflix with something for everyone. The Office US \nThe Office, although set in a seemingly mediocre paper company is all about the relationships. Whether it’s Michael Scott attempting to connect with his employees or Jim and Pam’s fairytale relationship which is something Rory is always striving for. Something about this show feels real, and that’s the same feeling you get with Gilmore Girls too. All of this plus most people have no doubt seen this show all the way through at least five times. Friends \nWe simply had to include friends here for the simple fact that it’s probably the biggest comedy sitcom with strong female leads in the world. Centred around a group of friends in New York, it follows their daily struggles much like the struggles in Gilmore Girls. Again like Parks and Recreation, it’s certainly a bit higher tempo but still has moments that hit the same spot as Gilmore Girls. New Girl \nIf the relationships are your thing in Gilmore Girls, perhaps you should give Fox’s New Girl a try. The series stars Zooey Deschanel as Jess Day, a teacher who goes out looking for an apartment after splitting up with her boyfriend. The follow six seasons follow Jess as she tackles romance, work and family life; all of which Gilmore Girls does brilliantly. Parenthood \nIf you look closely at the picture above you may notice someone familiar. That’s right Lauren Graham is in this show too, and it turns out she picked to star in another show which will be right up the alley of someone who loves Gilmore Girls. This family-centered comedy series is about the dysfunctional lives of the Braverman family. It’s certainly a bit of a bigger family, but it’ll strike the right chords of any diehard Gilmore fan.

      "text": "Critics Weigh In on Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life   \nSeason 7 of Gilmore Girls has long been hotly debated by fans. When show creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and Executive Producer Daniel Palladino left the series after Season 6 due to failed contract negotiations, the show carried on without them... But whatever special sauce they brought to production was greatly missed. \nThere are definitely a ton of fans who love the series from episode one to the finale, but purists insist they can only watch the first six seasons, preferring to forget the seventh even happened. \nFor star Lauren Graham , this is literally the case: she \"blocked\" parts of Season 7 from her memory, they were so \"out of character\"! \nGilmore Girls : What's the Same? What's Different? What You Need to Know \nOr as Graham explained to Entertainment Weekly : \"Christopher and I got married in that season. When we came back to do [the Netflix revival], I say something about having been married or somebody says it to me, and I was like, 'I was never married.' I forgot, they had to get one of the super-fan assistants to get on the phone with me to remind me. She had to tell me the whole thing. It just seemed so out of character that I literally blocked it from my memory. That was my Season 7 experience.\" \nHappily for everyone's memories, Amy Sherman-Palladino returned to helm the Gilmore Girls revival, airing on Netflix on November 25.",

      "text": "1 point by guilamu 6 minutes ago | hide | past | web | discuss | favorite My understanding is that Netflix mostly detect VPNs by flagging ips being used by multipe accounts at the same time.\nI also know that some (expansive) VPNs are still working with Netflix by proving a unique ip for each client, solving that issue. \nThe problem is, with the shortage of available ip v4, they've become quite expensive and no VPN can provide you a unique ip in each country. Most of them provide you a unique US ip and some a unique UK ip and that's pretty much it. \nWith the virtual infinity of ip v6, wouldn't that be cheaper to provide unique ip adresses in all countries and make it nearly impossible for Netflix to flag it?

      "text": "New ‘Gilmore Girls’ episodes on Netflix this week Credit: Netflix \nBy Reinier Macatangay \nWidely seen as a show for girls during its original run, Gilmore Girls has a wider reach than what one might think. The mother-daughter dramedy, which lasted for seven seasons (2000-2007), combines the usual relationship drama with quick-talking banter and quirky characters in the storybook town of Stars Hollow. \nTo the delight of fans, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) return on Netflix this Friday with four new 90-minute episodes titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Netflix, also known for hosting the Full House sequel Fuller House, is slowly becoming a safe place to bring back old television favorites. \nLess people might be familiar with Gilmore Girls though, so here is a recap (possible spoilers ahead). \nLorelai Gilmore grew up in a rich Connecticut family and became pregnant at a young age. She ran away with her child Rory to Stars Hollow, and eventually made a decent life for herself by managing an inn. \nMeanwhile, Rory started off her high school career in a public school, but Lorelai decided she wanted a better life for Rory, so she placed Rory in a prestigious private school named Chilton. \nThe catch is, despite her job at the inn, Lorelai needed to borrow money in order for Rory to attend Chilton. This meant Lorelai had to reconnect with her mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), as well as Richard Gilmore (Edward Herrmann). Throughout the series, the four characters participate in Friday night dinners. \nLorelai progresses towards building her own inn from scratch and managing it. Her love interest also becomes the “coffee shop guy” named Luke (Scott Patterson), and their chemistry works especially well. \nThe show was known during its run for making references to current events and pop culture, as in Season 6 Episode 2, when the show opened with a dialogue between Luke and Lorelai about Star Wars. In the same episode later on, Luke claimed the “high ground” while standing on a ladder next to Lorelai’s house. \nOf course, there were not so fun moments in the Luke/Lorelai relationship too. The Netflix episodes are going to explore their complicated relationship further, and viewers will see if the pair can finally tie the knot. \nAs for Rory, her career as a journalist stalled as well after graduating from Yale, and the new episodes will follow her path to finding herself as an adult. Old boyfriends from the past (Logan, Jess and Dean) appear too. \nTragically, Edward Herrmann, who had a long and distinguished career, died before the show began filming again. The new episodes are expected to honor him. \nBesides the revival, Lorelai and Rory are also set to appear as Funko Pop! figures in December. \nGet ready for more snappy dialogue and drama mixed with comedic moments. Gilmore Girls is back this week. From around the web:",

      "text": "After a long day at the office, Netflix is usually more appealing than cracking open a sales book or streaming a sales training video on YouTube.\nFortunately, there’s a simple way to learn new sales techniques without having to set aside extra time in your day -- through podcasts.\nThe next time you’re walking the dog, commuting, exercising, cleaning, or doing any other task that doesn’t require mental energy, you can pop in your earbuds, press “Play,” and learn from sales leaders and experts.\nHere are 13 sales podcasts to get you started.\n1) Stories From the Sales Floor Hosts: Brandon Redlinger , head of growth at PersistIQ , and Ben Sardella , co-founder and CRO of Datanyze Length: 15-25 minutes Listen on: SoundCloud | iTunes | Stitcher If you’re looking for an entertaining sales podcast, look no further than Stories From the Sales Floor.

The theme changes every week depending on what listeners want to learn about, and issues Caskey and Neale encounter frequently.\nYou can get even more out of this podcast by downloading its app , which’ll give you access to bonus content and the ability to ask the hosts questions.

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock \n\nEquity markets seem as though they normalized after the massive post-election rally of the last two weeks. The markets were indicated up marginally on Monday morning ahead of the shortened work week. Investors are looking for new ideas to generate gains or income. It has been proven now for over five years that investors will buy selloffs and market dips.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other analyst calls cover stocks to sell or stocks to avoid.\nThe headwinds that should have mattered just haven’t really mattered — rising bond yields, coming Fed rate hikes, high valuations, and a huge political upset. This bull market is now also closer to 8 years old than 7 years old.\nSome of the key stocks that have been considered beneficiaries of the election have risen 15% to 20% in the last 10 days. That is not normal at all and it might mean that more selective selling or profit-taking can be seen. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen from this Monday morning:\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) was downgraded to Underperform from Sector Perform and the price target was cut to $12 from $20 (versus $14.60 close on Friday, after a 13% drop) at RBC Capital Markets. Abercrombie & Fitch has a 52-week range of $14.00 to $32.83 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $18.41.\nKBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $21 price target (versus $16.25 close) at MKM Partners. KBR was recently pointed out among the many Trump infrastructure stock winners as well. KR has a 52-week range of $11.61 to $19.94 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $18.15.\n3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) was downgraded to Sell from Neutral with a $159 price target (versus $172.96 close) at Goldman Sachs. 3M shares were indicated down 1.2% at $170.90 on Monday, versus a 52-week range of $134.64 to $182.27 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $179.20.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) was started with a Buy rating and was assigned a $145 price target (versus $115.21 close) at Brean Capital. Netflix has a 52-week range of $79.95 to $133.27 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $123.13.\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) was started as Neutral at Buckingham Research. Starbucks closed at $55.77, with a 52-week range of $50.84 to $63.19 and has a consensus analyst price target of $64.54.\nYou can follow @ Jonogg on Twitter if you want the daily analyst calls and research updates directly on your Twitter feed.\nOther key analyst upgrades and downgrades seen on Monday were in shares of the following companies:\nAon Corp. (NYSE: AON) was raised to Outperform from Market Perform with a $130 price target (versus $111.96 close) at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.\nCirrus Logic Inc. (NASDAQ: CRUS) was started with a Hold rating and was assigned a $60 price target (versus $57.79 close) at Craig-Hallum.\nFinish Line Inc. (NASDAQ: FINL) was downgraded to Neutral from Positive with a $23 price target (versus $23.67 close) at Susquehanna Financial.\nGreif Inc. (NYSE: GEF) was downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at Wells Fargo. Greif was downgraded from Neutral to Underperform at D.A. Davidson & Company.\nHeadwaters Inc. (NYSE: HW) is being acquired by Boral in Australia for $24.25 per share in cash. It was downgraded to Hold from Buy with a $23.50 price target (versus $20.09 close) at Canaccord Genuity. Wedbush also has a Neutral rating and says to take the cash at $24.25 per share in its offer.\nHSBC Holdings PLC (NYSE: HSBC) was raised to Market Perform from Underperform at Bernstein. HSBC closed down 0.7% at $39.02 on Friday and its ADSs have a 52-week trading range of $28.62 to $40.74.\nInvestment Technology Group (NYSE: ITG) was started as Outperform and was assigned a $20 price target (versus $19.43 close) at Credit Suisse.\nMelco Crown Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ: MPEL) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse.\nSymentec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) has emerged as the winner in the buyout rumors regarding LifeLock. Oppenheimer reiterated its Outperform rating and $28 price target in a flash research note, noting that Symantec is reinvigorating its consumer division.\nTata Motors (NYSE: TTM) was raised to Outperform from Market Perform at Bernstein.\nFriday’s top analyst upgrades and downgrades were in shares of AmEx, Citigroup, First Solar, Gap, HP Enterprise, UPS, Wells Fargo and over a dozen more companies.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "SHARES show chapters <p>Stocks to Watch: November 21, 2016</p> <p>Tyson, 3M and Netflix are making headlines this Monday morning on Wall Street. </p> 35 Mins Ago | 00:51 \nCheck out which companies are making headlines before the bell : \nTyson Foods — The poultry and beef producer earned an adjusted 96 cents per share for its latest quarter, missing estimates of $1.17 a share. Revenue and forward guidance missed, as well. Tyson also announced that President Tom Hayes will succeed Donnie Smith as chief executive officer on December 31. \n3M — 3M was downgraded to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" at Goldman Sachs. \nFacebook — Facebook announced a stock buyback of up to $6 billion, to begin in the first quarter of 2017. Separately, Facebook said its Chief Accounting Officer Jas Athwal will leave the company on February 17. \nNetflix — Brean began coverage of the video streaming service with a \"buy\" rating, saying Netflix has created an \"unstoppable lead\" in the internet TV business. \nCitigroup — Citi replaced HSBC in an annual list of 30 banks deemed globally systemic by the G-20's financial stability board. Those banks are required to hold extra capital to insure financial stability. \nNovartis — Novartis is buying privately held U.S. drugmaker Selexys Pharmaceuticals for up to $665 million. Selexys specializes in treatments for blood diseases. \nGlaxoSmithKline — The drugmaker filed for U.S. approval of its new three-in-one inhaled lung drug, meaning it could reach the market ahead of similar treatments by rivals AstraZeneca and Novartis . The drug is designed to offer a single treatment for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \nBlackstone — The private-equity firm is in talks to sell as much as $2.3 billion in Japanese property to China's Anbang Insurance, according to sources quoted by Reuters. \nWal-Mart — The retailer plans to begin offering Cyber Monday deals on Black Friday, following up its recent announcement that it plans to increase its online inventory significantly. \nLifeLock — LifeLock will be bought by cybersecurity software maker Symantec for $2.3 billion or $24 per share. LifeLock specializes in identity theft protection services. \nApple — Apple will replace iPhone 6s batteries for free for customers who are experiencing an unexpected shutdown problem.

      "text": "The FANG group of stocks -- Facebook ( FB ) , Amazon ( AMZN ) , Netflix ( NFLX ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) -- formed positive hammer-like candles on their weekly charts, after several previous periods of underperformance. On the daily time frame, however, they are at best in only the initial stage of recovery, and at worst may be preparing for another leg lower.\nThe underperformance of the FANG stocks in the post-election period and the potential for them to continue lower and be a drag on the broader market, as I've said .\nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB or GOOGL ? Learn more now .\nThe group did go on to break key levels of support and move lower, but the broader market has been resilient, and it moved to new highs. There was a small bounce in the FANG stocks last week, which created the hammer candles on the weekly chart, but the price action in Friday's closing session was not particularly constructive.\nLet's take a look at the individual FANG charts and the new technical levels as we head into a new week of trading.\nFacebook shares broke the previously highlighted $120 support level and its 200-day moving average last week, moving down to the $114 level. The reinforced support area has proven to be a sticky zone, and the stock price has remained just under the long-term average.\nOn Friday, it touched back up over the average but pulled back, closing near its low of the session, and forming a bearish dark cloud cover candle in the process. This candle overlaps the upper end of a previously bullish candle and at important intersections of resistance can signal a top.\nThere has been an increase in volume during this recent downturn, and it looks like the trend is still lower. Support is now the $114 level and a break below it could take the stock to the $108 level.",

      "text": "Brean Capital’s Alan Gould believes that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has created “an unstoppable lead in the internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term.” \nGould initiated coverage on the company with a Buy rating and price target of $145. Largest Spender \nThe analyst thinks Netflix is on its way to becoming the “largest spender” on entertainment content. However, its direct-to-consumer audience across the world would make the company a low-cost producer. \nGould believes that 15 years out, the company could attract 300 million global subscribers, generating ARPU of $19, with EBIT margin of 29 percent and EPS of more than $25. \n“We project NFLX will be spending $15 billion per year on content in 5 years and $25 billion annually in ten years,” the analyst stated. \nIn fact, Netflix is predicted to have 7.59 million subscribers in the Asia Pacific region alone by 2021, from the 3.17 million at the end of 2016. Business Model \nAccording to the Brean Capital report, “The business model has tremendous flexibility allowing management to balance long-term subscriber growth vs. near-term profits.” \nFollowing the almost 27 percent appreciation in the stock through October, Netflix has been weak since the U.S. presidential election, given the portfolio rotation into cyclicals, while increased interest rates would drive lower discounts. \nImage Credit: By Coolcaesar at the English language Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15857647 Latest Ratings for NFLX",

That places him in the top 13 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry.",

      "text": "Nov 21, 2016 8:28 AM (Photo: Netflix) Share Tweet \nLauren Graham is one of the people—she too has chosen to exercise selective memory when it comes to the seventh season of Gilmore Girls . Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino wasn’t around for the last network season of the series, and the Netflix revival is seen as a corrective to its sins. Graham told Entertainment Weekly that she straight up forgot that Lorelai married Rory’s father Christopher at one point. (It didn’t work out.) This brain fart came into play when shooting A Year In The Life . “When we came back to do [the revival], I say something about having been married or somebody says it to me, and I was like, ‘I was never married.’ I forgot,” Graham told the publication. “They had to get one of the super-fan assistants to get on the phone with me to remind me. She had to tell me the whole thing. It just seemed so out of character that I literally blocked it from my memory. That was my season 7 experience.” \nWhile it does appear that the new episodes haven’t completely ignored the events of the first final chapter in the Gilmore saga, they don’t seem to be too relevant to the proceedings. After all, Sherman-Palladino is back in her rightful place for the four installments, and she probably doesn’t want to dwell too hard on plot she didn’t devise. \n ",

      "text": "By Jared DiPane Monday, Nov 21, 2016 at 9:30 am EST \nThere's Netflix, there's Hulu, there's CraveTV, there's Crackle, there's Shomi – there's too many! If you subscribe to only one streaming service, then you're probably missing out on reliving many of your favorite shows and you may not be discovering all the new favorites that you don't even know you have! Sure, you could subscribe to all of them, but then you might as well pay for cable! \nYou need a streaming service that has it all: every TV show you could ever want, every movie you never even knew you wanted to see, and even some live channels and pay per view options. How about radio stations too? You need a one-stop shop so that you're not having to create a bunch of accounts and having to keep track of passwords and login information. And wouldn't it be great if that service worked with just about every browser you can think of? \nSelectTV has it all . Formerly Rabbit TV, SelectTV features over 10,000 movies, 250,000 TV episodes, 50,000 radio stations, and much more, from over 150 countries. If you feel like listening to some latin music, don't settle for local AM radio – listen to radio stations from Mexico or Cuba! Don't limit yourself to North American programming; SelectTV opens you up to a literal world of TV and movie possibilities. You can even stream concerts, live sports, right from a full calendar, all provided with your subscription. \nUsually, a 1-year subscription to SelectTV is $36 (even compared to $9 a month at Netflix, that's still a great deal), but right now through Android Central Digital Offers, you can get access to global entertainment for a year for only $19 . If you want to save even more, go for a 3-year subscription for only $49 . \nThe most popular streaming services are fine – until you run out of things to watch. Subscribe to SelectTV and never be left wanting for TV, movies, live sports, world radio, and concerts ever again.",

The two end up lost in New York City, and meet a band of abandoned pets led by a bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart). Watch it all play out when the film comes to Digital HD November 22, and Blu-ray/DVD/On Demand December 6. The home release comes so many special features, including three Mini-Movies, making-of featurettes with the voice actors, \"The Best Of Snowball,\" and Hart and Stonestreet working with an animal trailer to educate fans on average and not-so-average household pets. Here's an exclusive clip from the bonus features, with Jenny Slate talking about her role voicing Gidget the Pomeranian, who has a crush on Max: \"Don't Think Twice\" When a member of a New York City improv troupe catches a big break, the other members are forced to reevaluate their own successes and fears in this painfully real comedy starring Keegan-Michael Key, Gillian Jacobs, Mike Birbiglia, Kate Micucci, Tami Sagher, and Chris Gethard. The critical darling arrives on Digital HD November 22, ahead of the DVD/Blu-ray release December 6. The home release includes deleted scenes and three behind-the-scenes featurettes. \"The Wild Life\" Mak the macaw and friends meet human castaway Robinson Crusoe, then team up with him to save their tropical island from savage cat invaders, in this animated adventure out on Digital HD November 22.

True to its title, this revival heads to Stars Hollow to follow the Gilmore girls for one year -- a new season for each episode -- starting with winter and ending with fall. Will those final four words bring fans closure, or just whet appetites for another year? \"Mercy\" (Netflix Original) Two sets of brothers return home to say goodbye to their dying mother, then find themselves under attack as masked intruders try and invade the house, in this drama/thriller/horror starring James Wolk, Caitlin Fitzgerald, Tom Lipinski, Dan Ziskie, Michael Godere, Michael Donovan, Dion Graham, and Constance Baron.

Watch it November 25. New on DVD and Blu-ray \"Hell or High Water\" Chris Pine plays a desperate father who learns the bank is going to take his family's land, so he and his ex-con brother (Ben Foster) decide to rob the bank's branches, and come into the crosshairs of an aging Texas Ranger (Jeff Bridges). The highly acclaimed thriller is out on DVD, Blu-ray, and On Demand November 22. The home release includes filmmaker Q&A; footage from the red carpet premiere; and the featurettes \"Enemies Forever,\" with an intimate look at the characters; \"Visualizing the Heart of America,\" on the setting and how the filmmakers used real locations to bring the story to life; and \"Damaged Heroes,\" exploring the cast performances. \"I.T.\" In this thriller out on DVD and Blu-ray November 22, Pierce Brosnan plays Mike Regan, a successful, self-made man who finds himself in a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse when his I.T. consultant (James Frecheville) starts using his skills to put Mike's whole world at risk. The home release includes a making-of featurette with Pierce Brosnan, Anna Friel, and James Frecheville. \"Chicken People\" This documentary -- a \"Best in Show\" about chickens -- follows three chicken breeders whose shared passion of raising the perfect chicken brings them together in competition, from the Ohio National Poultry Show to the Dixie Classic in Tennessee. The New York Times Critics' Pick is available on DVD November 22. \"Mechanic: Resurrection\" Grab some popcorn and join Jason Statham, Jessica Alba, Michelle Yeoh, and Tommy Lee Jones for this sequel to Statham's 2011 action thriller, out on Blu-ray, DVD, and On Demand November 22. The home release includes five behind-the-scenes featurettes on making the sequel, scoring the film, a breakdown of the Malaysian prison break sequence, and in-depth interviews with Michelle Yeoh and Jason Statham. TV Worth Watching \"Search Party\" (Monday on TBS at 11 p.m.) Alia Shawkat plays Dory, who becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her missing college acquaintance Chantal -- even though none of her other friends care -- in this new dark comedy/mystery on TBS. According to Deadline , the entire first season is airing during Thanksgiving week, with two episodes each night from 11 p.m. to midnight. It all starts November 21 with \"The Mysterious Disappearance of The Girl No One Knew\" and \"The Woman Who Knew Too Much.\" \"Dancing With the Stars\" (Tuesday on ABC at 9 p.m.) This is it. The Fall 2016 Season 23 is coming to a close, and James Hinchcliffe, Laurie Hernandez, or Calvin Johnson will win the coveted Mirror Ball trophy. (Jana Kramer is also still a contender, but she seems less likely to win. But we could be wrong.) After two hours of dancing from 8 to 10 on Monday, the Finale will air from 9 to 11 p.m. Tuesday, with the finalists dancing one last time, and the winner most likely revealed around 10:57 p.m. ET. \"Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\" & \"National Dog Show\" (Thursday on NBC at 9 a.m.) It's time for another great Thanksgiving Day tradition: Watching all, or at least part, of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 9 a.m. to noon, then chasing that with purebred shenanigans from John O'Hurley, David Frei, Tara Lipinski, Johnny Weir, and the beautiful canine stars of the 15th annual National Dog Show. Here's hoping the Komondor finally wins this year.",

      "text": "Tumblr November 21, 2016 | 07:14AM PT \nAs President Obama prepares to leave office after eight years, Netflix is presenting “ Barry ,” a movie dramatizing the 44th president of United States as a 20-year-old college kid in New York City. \nThe movie, set to debut on Netflix on Friday, Dec. 16, stars Australian actor Devon Terrell as the young Obama arriving at Columbia University in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year — a pivotal moment in his life that laid the foundation for his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. “Barry” depicts Obama struggling to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. \nIn the trailer, a fellow student tells Obama that because he’s of mixed race, he can fit in anywhere. “I fit in nowhere,” Obama responds. \nNetflix acquired rights to “Barry” after its premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film’s director, Vikram Gandhi (“Kumaré,” HBO’s “Vice”), who is a Columbia University grad, approached fellow alum Adam Mansbach (author of “Go the F— to Sleep”) on the project and Mansbach penned the script. \nVariety ‘s Owen Glieberman called the movie “at once moving and revealing” in his review . “The film is rooted in the murky, drifting, sleep-late-and-get-stoned-and-do-whatever nature of college life that the movies almost never get right,” Glieberman wrote. “This one does, and that’s one reason it feels bracingly authentic.” \n“Barry” is a joint production between Black Bear Pictures and Cinetic Media, produced by Cinetic’s Dana O’Keefe and Black Bear’s Teddy Schwarzman and Ben Stillman. The movie is the first production for Jon Sloss’ Cinetic. \nThe cast of “Barry” includes Ashley Judd (“Divergent,”“Double Jeopardy”), Jenna Elfman (“Friends With Benefits,”“Big Stone Gap”), along with Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Witch”), Jason Mitchell (“Straight Outta Compton”), Ellar Coltrane (“Boyhood”), and Avi Nash (“Learning to Drive,”“Silicon Valley”).

      "title": "Barack Obama Grows Up in New Trailer for Netflix’s ‘Barry’",
      "text": "\nRest assured there will be many films to come about the current (and immediate future) political climate, but before they arrive, next month brings one about our current president. Following this summer’s Southside With You , Vikram Gandhi ‘s Barry follows Barack Obama’s college days in New York City. With Devon Terrell taking the lead role, we now have a new trailer from Netflix which sells a promising, authentic drama.\nWe said in our review , “The racial tension in Adam Mansbach and Gandhi’s script is voyeuristic by simply, and smartly, showing us more than is explicitly said. Barry wants to be accepted, but he fears the path to acceptance will not come without major change in his country. He sees his brothers and sisters suffering daily, but is frustrated that he can’t do anything about it. A major decision for him would be to live outside of campus on West 109th, which would end up having him converse with black people on a daily basis, something he might not have previously done.”\nCheck out the trailer below for the film also starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Jason Mitchell, Ellar Coltrane, Ashley Judd , and Jenna Elfman .\n\nA young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later.\nBarry hits Netflix on December 16 .\n",

      "text": "TWEET Today it's difficult to imagine a time before Stranger Things existed on Netflix. But before it, when the streaming service was still mastering how best to put out their original programming, we were given a hilarious and poignant six-episode-long British sitcom with a pretty unfortunate title — Scrotal Recall . The second season of the show, which follows the adventures of Dylan, who was diagnosed with chlamydia in the pilot and spends episode after episode seeking out the women he's slept with to let them know, has been given a name change. It is now known as Lovesick , a play on the show's warmer themes. According to actress Antonia Thomas, who plays Dylan's friend Evie, it is more tonally fitting. In a recent interview with Paste , Thomas commented on the new name: The name change has been the best! I can't tell you what a relief the name change is. It's just so weird to feel proud about everything about the show but not wanting to talk about it because of the name! So yeah, I'm really, really pleased. I mean, technically, the name made sense in a funny way, but actually it completely mis-sold it in terms of the tone and what we were trying to do. The title change was revealed at the Television Critics Association press tour back in J uly , perhaps in response to negative comments about its raunchiness. Nevertheless, with the show premiering its second season today, it seems that there are several people who are not content with change. \nI AM SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS #SCROTALRECALL IS COMING BACK/I REFUSE TO CALL IT BY ITS NEW NAME @NETFLIX \nIt will always be called #ScrotalRecall to me @NetflixUK #lovesick but bring on season 2 https://t.co/KLKgcZa5MR \nA lil bitter it's no longer #ScrotalRecall but still stoked for #Lovesick \nugh why did they change #ScrotalRecall to such a generic name like Lovesick @netflix \nAnyone else upset #Netflix changed title of #ScrotalRecall to #Lovesick? Thought the original was funny but I have the maturity of a 6y/o. Lovesick season two is currently available for streaming on Netflix. You can watch the trailer for the new season below. ",

      "text": "print \nGetty/Gaye Gerard \nAmazon paid about $250 million dollars for its new show “The Grand Tour,” a 12-part series from Jeremy Clarkson and the “Top Gear” team, according to Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos. \n“The Grand Tour” is a huge moment for Amazon in its bid to rival Netflix as the top producer of high-quality streaming content. Netflix even mentioned the show in its most recent earnings report, saying the company assumed it would make Amazon “as global as YouTube and Netflix.” Amazon is poised to expand its video service to over 200 countries, likely starting in December, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nIf “The Grand Tour” is Amazon’s calling card in its worldwide ambitions, it didn’t come cheap. Conventional wisdom had said that Amazon paid around $160 million for it. But Sarandos claimed Amazon paid much more. \n“That’s an under-reported number,” Sarandos told The Telegraph . “It was about a quarter of a billion dollars. We’ll be able to figure out later what it was that made the show the show. It’ll be interesting with 'Grand Tour' to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of 'Top Gear' will people miss?” \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said previously. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nSarandos said that Netflix pursued the show, but implied Netflix didn’t think it was worth what Amazon paid. \n“We made a play for that show, definitely,” Sarandos said. “But we’ve had every season of 'Top Gear' on Netflix in most territories in the world, so we had a better sense than most of what the audience was for 'Top Gear' on our platform. We knew what it was worth.” \nNetflix is no stranger to shelling out money, however. It plans to spend $6 billion on content in 2017. \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim.

      "title": "Netflix Arrivals December 2016: See the Full List",
      "text": "Twitter \nIf you're home this Thanksgiving holiday and trying to find something to watch on Netflix to pass the time, we know the feeling: by now, binge-watching your favorite shows in the same sweats for days on end is as much a tradition as a turkey dinner. (Don't judge us.) But if you're struggling to find something to watch — y'know, after the Gilmore Girls reboot — don't worry. Come the winter holiday break, you'll have that many more titles to choose from. \nNetflix just released their lineup of movies coming to the platform in December 2016, and it's pretty festive. Of course, there's a new crop of holiday movies so you can get very merry, but there are also some pretty big moments beyond Christmas rom-coms. For one, Fuller House season 2 officially debuts. And two big superheroes are coming to the platform: Captain America and the Avengers will swoop in with Civil War , and the Netflix Original Barry will hit your internet. That's right: a Barack Obama origin story movie. (That totally counts as a superhero flick, right? Right.) So clear your queue now; you don't want to miss what's coming your way in December. \nAvailable December 1 \nAngels in the Snow (2015) \nBeverly Hills Cop (1984)",

      "text": "  10:16 AM EST Netflix: Brean Starts at Buy, Unstoppable Except for Amazon Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are higher by $3.32, or 3%, at $118.53, after Brean Capital ’s Alan Gould initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating, and a $145 price target, writing that the company \"has created an unstoppable lead in the internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term.\" The company’s vast spending — it will spend $25 billion annually in five years from now, he estimates — will be a “content moat” to competition, and though it looks expensive as a stock now, after 15 years, it will have 300 million users around the world and $19 in revenue per user, for a 29% Ebit margin and $25 per share in EPS. Just think of how much they’re spending: Netflix will add almost $9 billion of content to its streaming library this year, up from less than $4 billion in 2014, and we project the company could be spending over $25 billion annually in 10 years.",

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via ... more Photo: Saeed Adyani, AP Fast-talking 'Gilmore Girls' returns; mad binging forecast 1  /  3 Back to Gallery LOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream.\nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\"\nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai.\nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns.\nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored.\nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview.\n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\"\nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore ( Lauren Graham ), her equally devoted daughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe.\nLuke ( Scott Patterson ), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy 's return to her TV roots).\nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino , her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original.\n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\"\nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general.\n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said.\nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore . That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann , the respected actor who played him in the original series.\n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\"\nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it.\nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman.\n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said.\nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon.\nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene.\n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said.\nAnd does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\"\nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn , who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\"\n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\"\nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening?\n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\"\n___\nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press .

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via ... more Photo: Saeed Adyani, AP Fast-talking 'Gilmore Girls' returns; mad binging forecast 1  /  3 Back to Gallery LOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream.\nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\"\nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai.\nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns.\nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored.\nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview.\n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\"\nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore ( Lauren Graham ), her equally devoted daughter Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe.\nLuke ( Scott Patterson ), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy 's return to her TV roots).\nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino , her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original.\n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\"\nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general.\n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said.\nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore . That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann , the respected actor who played him in the original series.\n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\"\nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it.\nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman.\n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said.\nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon.\nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene.\n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said.\nAnd does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\"\nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn , who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\"\n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\"\nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening?\n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\"\n___\nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press .

The movie, starring newcomer Devon Terrell, follows a young Barack Obama as he moves to New York City to attend Columbia University. ( Roar lion roar! ) The movie is a Netflix original that will be available on December 16, when we'll still be grapping with our despair over the end of the Obama presidency. Don't go, Barry!",

So this Thanksgiving holiday, fill your queue with the films and TV shows leaving the streaming service by December 1 or later. We know it's a big lift, but we have a feeling you and your couch will be up to the task. \nLeaving December 1",

      "text": "A month after buying a software-as-a-service startup called Palerra Inc. that was founded by two of its former executives, Oracle Corp. is bolstering its cloud arsenal yet again by acquiring New Hampshire-based DNS provider Dyn.\nOtherwise known as Dynamic Network Services, Inc., the company has thousands of customers including household names such as Twitter Inc., Netflix Inc. and National Geographic. Oracle didn’t divulge the terms of the deal, but Dyn’s sizable client base and the fact that it’s raised $88 million from investors likely puts the price tag in the nine digit range. Dan Primack, the former editor of Fortune’s venture capital newsletter, cited a source as saying that the deal is worth more than $600 million.\nThe acquisition buys Oracle a tried-and-tested platform for handling one of the most fundamental aspects of running a web service: Processing browser requests. Organizations can rely on Dyn to resolve the URLs that users type in their browsers to the IP addresses that their applications employ at the backend instead of having to deploy in-house DNS servers. Additionally, the company provides value-added features such as an automated failover mechanism that can help make cloud infrastructure more resilient against outages.\nDyn admittedly isn’t completely immune to downtime (as a recent distributed-denial-of-service attack demonstrated all too well), but that doesn’t diminish the significance of today’s deal to Oracle. The acquisition should make the company’s public cloud more competitive against AWS and other rivals that already offer DNS hosting. Plus, the purchase will give the enterprise technology giant a foot in the door of many Dyn customers who could potentially be receptive to upselling efforts.\nOracle is marketing its cloud platform as a “one-stop shop” for infrastructure and application development services. This value proposition is a threat not only to the likes of AWS but also Dyn’s niche rivals in the DNS hosting market, which can expect much more competition now that its service is moving under the wing of one of the world’s top enterprise technology suppliers. CloudFlare Inc., a top contender in this segment, has been actively bolstering its platform recently in a bid to stay on top of the market.\nImage via Pixabay ",

      "text": "Netflix Releases First Trailer for Obama Biopic: Barry Charlie Ridgely Tweet This \nNow that Netflix has got a firm hold on the original television market, it looks like they're doubling down on their attempts at original movies as well. \nAlong with a slew of new movies arriving on the streaming platform in December, Netflix has announced the release of one of its more acclaimed efforts, Barry . \nAlong with this announcement, Netflix also released a full length trailer for the film. \nBarry chronicles the college years of President Barack Obama, and the difficult times that helped mold him into the man he is today. \nIn 1981, Barack Obama headed to Columbia University in New York. The film shows the changes he goes through, how he grew to love the American people, and how he viewed diversity across the country. His experiences as a child of a mixed-race relationship gave Barack a unique perspective on race relations in the US. \nBarack struggled to find his place in the world during college, as his mixed background kept him from fitting in most places. The trailer highlights his mentality as he faced this adversity, and how he wanted to be a bridge between both worlds. \nBarry was written by Adam Mansbach and directed by Vikram Gandhi ( Kumare , Vice ). This is the first feature written by Mansbach, and Gandhi's first foray into a narrative feature. He served as a producer on Vice , and his first film, Kumare , was a documentary. \nDevon Terrell, who has no other acting credits to his name, portrays the young Barack Obama. It looks like a great choice, as the actor looks just like his Presidential counterpart. The film also stars Ashley Judd, Ellar Coltrane, and Anya Taylor-Joy. \nBarry premieres on Netflix December 16, 2016. (Photo: Netflix)",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nAs President Barack Obama prepares himself and his administration for the transition to President-Elect Donald Trump , Netflix is preparing to send the 44th POTUS off in style with the release of their original biopic, Barry . The film, directed by Vikram Gandhi and written by Adam Mansbach , centers on Obama’s junior year at Columbia University in 1981, but as this full trailer promises, the feature will be a nuanced look at the life of the future President. \n“Nuanced” has been the descriptor thrown around for Barry since its reception at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival . Our own Adam Chitwood had the chance to check it out, calling it “The kind of film in which you quickly accept the protagonist as a character, not a full-on impression of a famous person” and “a thoughtful, intelligent film that also happens to be mighty entertaining.” \nThe film stars Australian newcomer Devon Terrell in a breakout performance as the lead, along with a strong supporting cast including Ashley Judd ( Divergent ), Jenna Elfman ( Friends With Benefits ), and up-and-comers Anya Taylor-Joy (T he Witch ), Jason Mitchell ( Straight Outta Compton ), Ellar Coltrane ( Boyhood ), and Avi Nash ( Silicon Valley ). Look for the Netflix original film Barry on December 16, 2016. \nCheck out the full trailer below: \nHere’s the film’s official synopsis: \nA young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. Only on Netflix December 16. Image via Netflix",

      "text": "B. Alan Orange | 16 minutes ago \nLove it or hate it, we do have a new President-Elect. And with that comes a sad moment for Americans everywhere as they say good-bye to President Barack Obama . As Obama's presidency draws to a close, experience the inspired story of where it all began with the debut of the Netflix original film Barry &#160on&#160December 16, 2016.&#160We have the full-length trailer, which debuted today. \nDebuting at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival to critical acclaim, Barry is a nuanced, artistic exploration of a pivotal year in the life of the 44th President of the United States . A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as \" Barry ,\" arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. His experiences over that pivotal school year lay the foundation for his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. \nDirector Vikram Gandhi (Kumaré, HBO's Vice), a Columbia University alumni, approached fellow alum Adam Mansbach (author of Go the F**k to Sleep) to help tell this origin story . And from that collaboration Mansbach penned the script. Now, we have one of the more interesting and unique biopics every released about a sitting U.S. President . \nThe film stars Australian newcomer Devon Terrell in a breakout performance as Barry , and features a strong supporting cast including Ashley Judd (Divergent, Double Jeopardy), Jenna Elfman (Friends With Benefits, Big Stone Gap), and up-and-comers Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch), Jason Mitchell (Straight Outta Compton), Ellar Coltrane (Boyhood), and Avi Nash (Learning to Drive, \"Silicon Valley\"). The movie will arrive just in time to be enjoyed over the long holiday weekend. \nAn original movie , Barry will provided an alternative to the crowded multiplexes this Christmas. It will be streaming in the U.S. and Canada. Yet, it does face some stiff competition from the box office. It arrives just two days before the first ever Star Wars spin-off Rogue One. It will also face off against Will Smith's fantasy drama Collateral Beauty. But with the power to move you, and make you think about the world, life and what is happening at this current moment in time, Barry should be one of the biggest movie hits of this upcoming winter season.

      "text": "Netflix boss Ted Sarandos has admitted that he's gutted the streaming service didn't have a chance to pick up The Great British Bake Off. Bake Off was snapped up by Channel 4 earlier this year after negotiations for more series with the BBC fell though. It's been reported that it all happened within a matter of hours, and Sarandos - Netflix's chief content officer - has now admitted that he didn't even really have a chance to make a bid on the tent. \"I wish we'd had a shot at Bake Off,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. \"It moved very quickly, and we didn't.\" Just imagine if you could have had Berry on demand? If you could binge on Mel &amp; Sue at the same time as you binged on cake? The dream, right? And Sarandos seems to have known he missed out, saying: \"The show's very, very popular on Netflix, all over the place, so we would've definitely been interested.\" Still, after public outcry about The Great British Bake Off leaving its home on the BBC, Channel 4 defended its decision to buy the show by pointing out that it meant it would still be on free-to-air telly - which it wouldn't have been if it moved to Netflix. But the BBC still doesn't seem convinced the move will be good for the show given that Mel &amp; Sue and Mary Berry have quit, with its director of content Charlotte Moore saying recently: \"I know that chemistry and alchemy is a very delicate, fragile and precious thing.\" Ouch. Meanwhile, during the Daily Telegraph interview, Sarandos also confirmed that he \"made a play\" for Jeremy Clarkson et al's new show The Grand Tour - and suggested that Amazon paid even more than we thought they did by stumping up $250m.

That includes The Mighty Ducks 2 , The Angry Birds Movie , Harry and the Hendersons , Toys and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids . And for those who want to watch something with a bit more edge, there's the less family-friendly Hannibal , Black Snake Moan and National Lampoon's Animal House . \nOn the original programming side, Netflix is rolling out a lot of new series, including The Break , Travelers and Dreamworks' Trollhunters , from Guillermo del Toro. We're also getting the second season of Fuller House . There's also Barry , which tells the story of a young Barack Obama, which will air on December 16. \nFinally, you'll note that Christmas Day marks the debut of Marvel's Captain America: Civil War streaming. What better time to drop one of the more recent Marvel movies than when families are gathered around the Christmas tree. Let's just hope no family disputes break out over Team Cap vs. Team Iron Man .

The streaming service will drop the second season of Fuller House December 9. There are also some other options if you don’t want to descend into treacly nostalgia, including new specials from Reggie Watts and Gabriel Iglesias. If you’re looking for some indie options, two movies that debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year will be available to stream: Blue Jay , an intimate drama with Mark Duplass and Sarah Paulson, and Barry , a look at the life of college-age Barack Obama. And on December 23, you can catch the premiere of Guillermo Del Toro’s Trollhunters , with voicework from future presidential candidate Ron Perlman . \nMeanwhile, Netflix is bidding farewell to the likes of 50 First Dates , American Beauty , and the entirety of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys . Should you need a break from Gilmore Girls , feel free to have a Sorbo-themed Thanksgiving binge. \nAvailable December 1 \nAngels In The Snow (2015) \nBeverly Hills Cop (1984)",

      "text": "YouTube \n\nThe INSIDER Summary: \n• Movie adaptations of books can bring them to life or ruin them. \n• Here are some of the best book-to-movie adaptations on Netflix right now. \n• Highlights include classics like Forrest Gump and tearjerkers like A Walk To Remember.  \nThere are a wide variety of movies based on books on Netflix , so that means there are plenty of chances to either love or detest seeing your favorite literary works in cinematic form. After all, bookworms often have a love-hate relationship with movie adaptations of books. On the one hand, there's the excitement of seeing your favorite authors' work get recognized in such a big way, and watching their stories and characters come to life on the big screen. On the other hand, there's an uncomfortable conflict if the portrayals onscreen don't match the story you pictured in your head, particularly if it's a book that you've read many times (and therefore probably have some very set feelings about).\nAdditionally, sometimes a movie is already \"ruined\" for you if you've read the book and therefore know how the story ends. For example, the movie Fight Club would have a very different impact on someone who had already read the book than it would on someone who was going in fresh. It's also worth nothing that not all book-to-movie adaptations are created equal, and sometimes the screen version of a certain novel is just bad. It's disappointing when that does happen, but the good news is that there are plenty of other adaptations that are worth watching. Here are some movies available to stream on Netflix that any bookworm will enjoy.\n1. The Color Purple Warner Bros. \n \nWhoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey both made their film debuts in this adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. \n\n\n2. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo Columbia Pictures \nBefore the American adaptation with Rooney Mara, there was this Swedish version with Noomi Rapace.\n\n\n3. Forrest Gump Paramount Pictures \nThe movie is so iconic that you might not have even known that it was based on a novel. \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

Plus, this movie looks pretty darn great. \nWith that, Netflix has released the first official trailer for the biopic on President Barack Obama , tited Barry . I personally think this is a wonderful and bold move from Netflix, as their track record for quality has been through the roof ever since they started developing original content. This movie looks to further and embolden that effort. \nCheck it out below: \nBarry was written by Adam Mansbach and directed by Vikram Gandhi ( Kumare , Vice ). The film premieres on Netflix December 16, 2016. \nSo what do you think of President Obama getting his own biopic? Let me know in the comments below, and stick with Inside the Magic for the newest and most interesting goings on in the entertainment industry and beyond!",
