The catch is that it's going to sell out extremely quickly. \nThe bundle is a newly-released PS4 Slim (retails for $300) with Uncharted 4 , Fallout 4 , and Skyrim Special Edition for $249.99. Those who are looking to get in on the most current model of the PS4 will find themselves with long-lasting role-playing games to spend some quality time with. \nBut, again, it's going to sell out fast. It's 10 percent claimed at time of writing. Better decide quickly.",

Amazon is apparently an equal opportunity retailer in that the hella good PS4 Slim bundle for $250 is reciprocated with a hella good Xbox One S bundle for $250. \nThis deal has a white Xbox One S, Battlefield 1 , and Skyrim Special Edition for $249 (the Xbox One S regularly retails for $399 alone).It's a Lightning Deal too, meaning that it's only good for a few hours or until they all sell out. Amazon says that 20 percent are claimed at the time of writing. \nYou know what to do. Either do the damn thing or don't do the damn thing. Just don't waffle. Well, you can waffle if you don't do the damn thing. You are logged out.

      "text": "Amazon removes negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's memoir By Brooke Seipel - 11/23/16 04:44 PM EST © Getty \nIt appears Amazon has decided to remove some negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's new autobiography, \"Settle for More,\" after groups of pro- Donald Trump \nA report from Slate Tuesday showed that more than 75 percent of the book's reviews were one star, but by Wednesday morning, USA Today noted that that number had been reduced to 17 percent. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Los Angeles Times, the negative reviews began at \"The_Donald\" reddit page. The page consists of supporters of the president-elect and bears the Trump-Pence presidential campaign logo but has no official ties to the campaign.\nPosts in the group asked people to go leave negative reviews on Kelly's book. \nOne reviewer, identified as One Woman's Opinion, said Kelly was “Confused as a feminist, lacking as a 'journalist.' Now she can add 'failed' as an author.\" \nNew posts on the Reddit page note that many of the reviews have been taken down, with some calling Amazon's actions \"censorship.\" \nKelly has faced criticism from many Trump supporters who feel she did not do enough to support the Republican nominee on the campaign trail. Trump and Kelly first got into a feud during the Republican primaries, when Kelly asked Trump about his comments on women.  ",

      "text": "Twitter News Feed Item Amazon’s Lead Narrows, Says Annual Boomerang Commerce Report on Holiday Pricing and Assortment of Toys and Games November 23, 2016 09:54 AM EST Blog This \nBoomerang Commerce, the leading Retail Performance Management solution , today releases its annual “ Boomerang Insights: Toys Category ” report comparing top retailers' pricing, promotion and assortment of this holiday season's popular toys and games. This year’s results reveal that Walmart is making big strides to challenge Amazon’s dominance. The retailer has more than doubled its online product assortment between Q1 and Q3 2016 and is leveraging its recent Jet.com acquisition for competitive pricing. Toys“R”Us is also pursuing a strategy of increased assortment, as well as offering exclusive product lines. Meanwhile, Target is eschewing assortment expansion in favor of special pricing promotions. \nKey findings across data from Amazon, Walmart, Jet.com, Target, GameStop, and Toys“R”Us show: Amazon is still, by far, the leading retailer for toys and games with over 5 million items in the category — compared with less than 100,000 for other retailers — and with a pricing strategy that optimizes based on external market and internal data signals. Jet.com has the lowest prices , meeting or beating the usual leader Amazon by an average of 64 percent — up from 55 percent in 2015 — on its overlap of most popular items. Walmart is a close second to Jet by pricing 55 percent of popular items the same or lower than Amazon, but this represents a 9 percentage point decrease YOY.Meanwhile, Target increased its price competitiveness with Amazon by 8 percentage points YOY to meet or beat Amazon’s price on 42 percent of popular overlapping toys and games. Walmart and Jet offer the most aggressive price discounts . Compared to list prices on Amazon, Walmart discounted 54 percent of popular items, followed by Jet with 47 percent, and Target with 41 percent. Concurrently, Target is seeking to win customers through promotions , such as 20 percent discounts for select toys, “buy two, get one free” games and its current “10 Days of Deals” campaign. Walmart is becoming increasingly more competitive in assortment with a 66 percent overlap with Amazon’s most popular items; this represents approximately 1.8 times the nearest competitor. After Walmart, Toys“R”Us has the highest assortment overlap (40 percent) with a sampling of Amazon’s popular items , representing a 5 percent improvement over last year. Although toys and games specialty retailers struggle to compete on price, their wide assortments within specific sub-categories like video games at GameStop and exclusive LEGO products at Toys“R”Us keep them relevant. \n“Today’s always-on, mobile-enabled consumers force retailers to be much more responsive to higher consumer expectations and competitive changes,” says Boomerang Commerce CEO Guru Hariharan. “During this year’s holiday season — where retailer fortunes are won or lost — the toys category is a spectacular example of which retailers are up for the challenge and which fall short. Winners will be those retailers that are high tech and high touch — executing their strategies through a combination of data-driven decisions, ongoing measurement, and operational excellence.” \nBoomerang Commerce Insights reports are produced annually for different product categories. In this report on toys and games, Boomerang analyzed 1,800 items throughout the online stores of six leading toy retailers: Amazon, GameStop, Jet.com, Target, Toys“R”Us and Walmart. The analysis is based on 600 randomly selected items from each of three tiers: best-sellers, moderately popular items and less-popular (specialty) products. More details and examples for specific products are in the full report from Boomerang Commerce. The data used was compiled during October 2016. \nAbout Boomerang Commerce \nFounded in 2012, Boomerang Commerce is a leading retail technology company led by veterans from Amazonand McKinsey.

Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. The Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) comments SEATTLE — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir.\nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum.\nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book.\nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\"\nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign.\nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.",

In the event that don’t have either, then ought to start up another program tab each for our best Xbox One Black Friday arrangements and best PS4 Black Friday bargains – Black Friday Electronics Deals 2016 keeping those overhauled over the Black Friday time frame as well.\nOn Nov. 5, the retailer facilitated a one-day, in-store-just deal. The LG 50-inch class LED Smart 4K Ultra HDTV was $649.99 amid that deal. Be that as it may, it’ll be $399.99 amid the Black Friday deal.

Its typically $5-$10 more on average. If you need something that is better performing, there are other deals bouncing around.\n\nNewEgg is selling for the same price with $0.99 shipping on pre-order, so Amazon is a better deal if you have prime.

The ads you see each time you unlock it are insulting and it's not worth any more to pay for the ad-free upgrade. It wasn't for me but if you want a cheap tablet and have low expectations then you may be happy with it. morriefisher (L20 Captain) - 6 months ago Wont do Play store apps, but you can change that. Guest - 6 months ago Don't listen to Pacfolly - just read the Amazon reviews - it's a lot of bang for your $39 bucks. IT'S _$39_!! Don't expect features of a $300 tablet. Guest - 6 months ago Great for kids at this price. Disagree with other poster. pacfolly (Freebie Lover) - 6 months ago I bought one of these and even at that price they're so cheap and limited it's not really worth it so I quickly returned mine.

The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

      "text": "Amazon's Black Friday deals on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and peripherals Shop Amazon while your turkey cooks Amazon Logos on monitors Leon Meal/Getty Images The turkeys haven’t even hit America’s collective ovens, and Amazon is already posting a slew of Black Friday deals. The online retailer is offering deals across gaming hardware and new releases, along with PC hardware and gaming accessories. With so much to go through, we’ve parsed down some of the better deals to snag as they went live this morning. Some of these deals don’t vary wildly from other sites, but Amazon Prime members will definitely want to get free shipping. HARDWARE PlayStation 4 Slim : Similar to other online retailers, you can grab a PlayStation 4 Slim bundle for $249.99, which includes a copy of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. Xbox One : Amazon is knocking $50 off all bundles of Microsoft’s console. Highlights include snagging the sleeker, thinner 1 TB Xbox One S with Gears of War 4 for $299.99 . Both consoles have nice deals on their controllers, too. You can get DualShock 4 controllers for $47.59 — about 21 percent off — and all Xbox wireless controllers are discounted 20 percent. It’s a great time to add another player to your couch. SOFTWARE There are a few new release game deals worth noting. You can grab Xbox One exclusive titles Gears of War 4 for $34.99 and ReCore for $19.99 . Some fall releases have been dramatically reduced as well.

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the “hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book” and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \n",

Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. The Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) Posted: Wednesday, November 23, 2016 9:18 pm | Updated: 9:45 pm, Wed Nov 23, 2016. Amazon removes negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's memoir Associated Press | \nSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.",

      "text": "» News & Magazin-Redakteur Nicht nur die Verbraucherverbände warnen, auch unabhängige Vergleichsportale und kritische Berichterstatter zeigen mit dem Finger auf aufgeblasene Rabatte zu Black Friday und Cyber Monday . Auch in diesem Jahr werben wieder unseriöse Anbieter mit fantastischen Sparpreisen, die sich bei genauerer Betrachtung schlicht als Mogelpackung entpuppen. Jetzt hat Vergleich.org aktuelle Zahlen präsentiert. Stichproben der Verbraucherzentrale NRW zeigten schon in den vergangenen Jahren, dass die Preisreduzierungen an solchen \"Rabatt-Tagen\" statt versprochener weit über 50 Prozent durchschnittlich bei unter 20 Prozent lagen. Laut dem Bericht von Vergleich.org wirbt beispielsweise Amazon.de mit einer durchschnittlichen Ersparnis von 36,53 Prozent auf die praxisferne \"unverbindliche Preisempfehlung des Herstellers\" (UVP). Von den durch Vergleich.org 60 stichprobenartig ausgewählten Angeboten waren 51 Produkte wirklich günstiger als im Preisvergleich von Idealo.de (\"Marktniveau\"). 9 Produkte waren für Personen ohne Prime-Mitgliedschaft sogar teurer als auf anderen Websites. Im Schnitt spart man mit den Cyber-Monday-Angeboten von Amazon 12,35 Prozent gegenüber dem üblichen Marktpreis laut Idealo-Preisvergleichsportal. Amazon-Prime-Mitglieder zahlen keine Versandkosten und sparen damit hingegen sogar 21,12 Prozent gegenüber dem üblichen Marktpreis. Sie bekommen in 57 von 60 Fällen einen Preis unter Marktniveau.

      "text": "If you’ve never thought about playing “competitive” Fruit Ninja, this might eventually change your mind. The simple but fun (and sometimes challenging) fruit slashing game will be introducing a new variant to its collection: the Tournament Edition. Halfbrick Studios will be unveiling this new game at Amazon’s Champions of Fire e-sports tournament next week, but you can also sign up to try out the closed beta mode, in case you’re hungering to show off your fruit slashing skills.\nThe Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition is actually Halfbrick Studio’s first entry into the burgeoning casual PvP / e-sport scene. At this point, not much has been revealed as to what will differentiate this game from the regular Fruit Ninja one, aside from the fact that you will be competing with other players to see who’s the best fruit slasher of all time. The game will be included in the upcoming Champions of Fire competition happening this December 2 in Las Vegas (of course, where else?)\nIf you don’t know what Champions of Fire is, it is actually the Amazon Appstore’s first mobile game eSports tournament. They have invited 16 of the biggest celebrity video game streamers (yes, they’re a thing if you didn’t know yet) and they will be playing some of the most popular casual mobile games, and doing it competitively. And yes, there is an actual cash prize of $100,000 for the one who will come out on top.\nBut if you’re not one of the 16 who will be playing Fruit Ninja Tournament for the first time, you can play the beta version of the game and give your feedback as well. You can sign up at the closed beta website, beta.fruitninja.com.\nSOURCE: Halfbrick Studios",

By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: November 23, 2016 2:11 PM Amazon seems to have come a long way from being an intricate machine propelling CEO Jeff Bezos ‘ever-expanding’ ambitions, to making some key changes in the way the company functions. (Picture: Reuters) \nOn August 15, last year, The New York Times had in an article called ‘Inside Amazon : Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace’ accused the company of pushing its employees too far to achieve unrelenting ambitions. The article portrayed Amazon as putting up standards which were ‘unreasonably’ high and using employees to use tools to ‘sabotage’ each other resembling ‘Hunger games’. The ‘purposeful Darwinism was so bad that even employees suffering from miscarriages and cancer were given undue feedback without been given time to recover. Amazon seems to have come a long way from being an intricate machine propelling CEO Jeff Bezos ‘ever-expanding’ ambitions, to making some key changes in the way the company functions. According to reports, Amazon has said that it is overhauling the review process that is done by the company annually. It says that the review is more simplistic as it works on the strengths rather than the weakness of its employees, and eventually building on the program. \nAmazon reportedly has been using an employee rating system which ranks them as low or high-level performers, which is a very draconian management technique, earlier used in the tech world. But while most of the companies in the Silicon Valley have done away with it, Amazon could not let go of the system. While critics might call the recent announcement as a PR activity and the same process might continue, but the way Jeff Bezos works, the plan just might have been well-thought by him before making the announcement. \nBut putting aside what the mechanism’s fortune turn out to be, this move does give out some business lessons for us all. The most important lessons being how Bezos showed amazing emotional intelligence by understanding the article and criticism and acting upon it. Some may consider it a change, too late, but Bezos made some quick responses when the story came out as well, even though he felt the article in NYT was unduly biased. He reportedly told his employees that he does not identify the picture of Amazon that was portrayed and hoped his employees did not as well. He also asked his employees to read the NYT story. Such an overwhelming need for further goals can lead a company to scale back its ambitions or softening its stance. \nBut we as outsiders cannot in any way know what it is like working for a company like Amazon unless the 3 lakh people who work for the company let the world know. However, this announcement and the first reaction by Jeff Bezos show the abilities that the founder has, that is, to learn from feedback and act on them rather than relying on emotions, no matter the viability of the implications. It is an attitude to imbibe. \nTo understand this more, one has to think from the perspective of a founder- especially the founder of the world’s biggest online retailer. Bezos has invested so much of his life in his company, and when you give it your all, it is not easy to understand the criticism, leave alone accepting it and acting upon it. The reason being, when you are so big, there has to be some truth in all feedback, and all you can to is either run when the dirt hits the fan or accept and learn from it. Emotional intelligence is one of the most important qualities to have in general and as a leader, as it opens up new avenues to benefit from. At the same time, this means that your criticism should also be sincere and substantial instead of just being hurtful, as nobody benefits in the larger scheme of things. \nBut if you do get hurtful feedback, rather than trying to correct the person you did it, you must use it as a chance to improve, at least that is what Jeff teaches us.

Amazon Tap is also offered at a hefty discount: $89.99 (down from $129.99). \nKindle Paperwhite, Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablet and the Fire HD 8 have also had their prices slashed, though the savings are less dramatic. And you can get additional savings by getting some combos — for example, the Echo Dot in combination with the Bose SoundLink Mini II Carbon will set you back $203.99. \n\nThe prices are good while supplies last, and until the end of the week.

      "text": "Home > Consumer Amazon delivery pilots ordered to end strike for retail peak Pilots for the Air Transport Services Group Inc unit that hauls packages for Amazon.com Inc and DHL Worldwide Express were ordered back to work by a federal judge, halting a strike that threatened to disrupt holiday deliveries. PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 24, 2016 9:42 AM \n[NEW YORK] Pilots for the Air Transport Services Group Inc unit that hauls packages for Amazon.com Inc and DHL Worldwide Express were ordered back to work by a federal judge, halting a strike that threatened to disrupt holiday deliveries. \nUS District Judge Timothy Black in Cincinnati gave a nod to the holiday shopping rush in granting ABX Air's request for a temporary restraining order for pilots to return to the cockpit. \n\"The public expects that purchases and shipments will be delivered in a timely fashion,\" Mr Black said in Wednesday's ruling. \"Absent an injunction, ABX, its customers and the public will suffer immediate, irreparable harm. Imagine Christmas without Amazon!\" \nThe strike began Tuesday morning and forced the cancellation of dozens of flights. Julie Ford, a lawyer for the pilots union, said the union has withdrawn picket lines to comply with the order, which is effective for five days under federal law. \n\"The union is obviously disappointed,\" Ms Ford said in a phone interview. The pilots will make a decision on how to proceed next week, she said. \nThe ruling clears a major obstacle for Amazon heading into its first holiday shopping season since contracting with ATSG and another carrier to operate a fleet of cargo planes to shuttle inventory around the country. Those contracts reduced the company's reliance on FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc. \nThe pilots are returning to work in time for the online shopping peak between Thanksgiving and the following Monday. Online spending in the US on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday is expected to reach US$8.4 billion, or 9.2 per cent of all online spending in November and December, according to Adobe Systems Inc. \nABX Air spokesman Paul Cunningham and Amazon declined to immediately comment on the order. DHL didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment on it. \nAbout 250 ABX Air pilots walked off the job to protest the cargo carrier's alleged staffing shortages. ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 for DHL, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. ABX said in its complaint that 26 flights, loaded with 1.25 million pounds of cargo, were grounded Tuesday. By Wednesday, 75 DHL flights had been grounded, the pilots union said. \nIn issuing his order, the judge said the dispute qualifies as minor because it involves only the interpretation of an existing union contract. That means that it must be submitted to binding arbitration, rather than be brought to a federal court, Mr Black said. \n\"ABX and the other airlines that service DHL and Amazon are facing a staffing crisis, in large part because they cannot attract and retain talented pilots with the sub-standard pay and benefits they provide,\" Dan Wells, president of Teamsters Local 1224, said in a statement. \n\"Pilots should not have to go on strike to get back provisions of a contract that was taken away from them just to ensure they have adequate rest and time with their families.\" The case is ABX Air Inc v International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division, 16-cv-01096, US District Court, Southern District of Ohio (Cincinnati). \nBLOOMBERG ",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.'s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season.\nContinue Reading Below\nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon's two airline partners.\nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc., which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., was hired by Amazon to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies.\nBut the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management.\nIn a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.It also filed a request for a temporary restraining order. Atlas declined to comment on whether it was affected by the ATSG industrial action on Tuesday.\nAmazon said it works with a variety of carriers and is \"confident in our ability to serve customers.\"\nContinue Reading Below",

      "text": "November 23, 2016 – /PressAdvantage/ – Wholeness Home, a home and garden company based in Pasadena, California has announced the launch of their Fancy Christmas Gift Tags with Gold String in the Amazon Marketplace. Wholeness Home is known for providing a wide array of items for the home, including Kitchen and Baking tools as well as novelty items.\nThe Christmas Gift Tags are their first seasonal offerings. Annie French, of Wholeness Home, explains that the company has been looking for manufacturers to produce high end, but reasonably priced tags for the past two years. She says, “Many of us love to spend time wrapping our gifts and making them look beautiful on the outside as we know they will be prominently displayed in the homes of our friends under their tree. So often all the attention goes into the wrapping and not into the to/from tags we attached to them. We wanted our tags to have gold string, that can be tied to a bow, would fit easily over a wine bottle or be attached to a special gift bag.”\nThe Christmas gift tags come in 16 different styles, from snowmen, ornaments and jingle bells to Christmas trees and a variety of Santas. There are 8 cards in each style for a total of 128 separate tags. The tags come in a carrying case that can hang on the wall or fold down to one quarter its size for easy storage for the ones saved for next year. They are decorated with light glitter so they will shimmer in the lights under a Christmas tree and each has a golden string. The tags also include a variety of colors for those who like to color coordinate their gift wrap and tags. With this much assortment and so many tags in the set, it may well be the only gift card tage purchase one needs this season.\nThey are currently only available in the Amazon marketplace. They will be available on Thanksgiving Day and Ms. French expects that due to the limited quantity they will sell out quickly.

      "text": "\nIt's far from the most affordable deal this year, but it serves a certain niche. Anyone who's looking to both buy a new PC and  get into virtual reality might want to pay attention to this one.\nAmazon is selling an Oculus Rift and a VR-ready PC for $1,000 . It caters to a very specific need, yes, but it's also a pretty dang good deal. The Rift retails for $600, and there haven't been any high-profile sales announced like the Vive's $100 discount . That means you're getting a PC that's capable of running VR for $400, and that ain't shabby.\nAs for the rig, it's not top of the line but it'll get the job done. It's a CyberPower PC with an Intel i5-6402P 2.8GHz quad-core processor, an AMD Radeon RX 480 video card with 4GB of VRAM, 8GB DDR4, and a 1TB hard drive. That bundle regularly retails for $1,320, so it's a savings of more than $300.\nThat's not the only option, though (but it's the only one to come in at the $1,000 mark). Amazon has other bundles at this node . They might not be as cheap, but they might better suit your lifestyle -- that is if your lifestyle is \"Doesn't yet have a beefy PC or virtual reality but wants to get in on that right now.\"\nCYBERPOWERPC Oculus Ready GXiVR8020A Gaming Desktop & Oculus Rift Virtual Reality Headset Bundle [Amazon] ",

      "text": "(Adds aviation expert comment, details of Amazon air expansion)\nBy Nick Carey\nCHICAGO Nov 22 Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retailer Amazon.com Inc and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear.\nSome 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG .\nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said.\n\"Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,\" said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. \"But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.\"\nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle an \"illegal work stoppage\" including seeking a court order to get pilots back to work.\n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement.\nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year.\nAmazon has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp , giving it alternatives to ABX.\nIn May, Amazon also entered into a long-term agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc under which the company would provide cargo services to the online retailer using 20 Boeing Co 767-300 freighters.\n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.\nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States.\n\"Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are continuing to monitor the situation.\"\nMatt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics, said he expects the strike will be short, so will only cause a \"relatively minor shortage\" for Amazon.\nBut he said the long-term problem is a nationwide shortage of pilots, as older pilots retire and too few step up to replace them, which portends more strikes in the coming years.\n\"Call it a canary in the coal mine or a shot across the bow, but this is happening now,\" Barton said. \"We are going to see pilot wages rise and problems like this for the next 10 to 15 years.\" (Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler and Lisa Shumaker)",

      "text": "0 \nThere are savings, but it'll cost you \nIt's far from the most affordable deal this year, but it serves a certain niche. Anyone who's looking to both buy a new PC and get into virtual reality might want to pay attention to this one. \nAmazon is selling an Oculus Rift and a VR-ready PC for $1,000 . It caters to a very specific need, yes, but it's also a pretty dang good deal. The Rift retails for $600, and there haven't been any high-profile sales announced like the Vive's $100 discount . That means you're getting a PC that's capable of running VR for $400, and that ain't shabby. \nAs for the rig, it's not top of the line but it'll get the job done. It's a CyberPower PC with an Intel i5-6402P 2.8GHz quad-core processor, an AMD Radeon RX 480 video card with 4GB of VRAM, 8GB DDR4, and a 1TB hard drive. That bundle regularly retails for $1,320, so it's a savings of more than $300. \nThat's not the only option, though (but it's the only one to come in at the $1,000 mark). Amazon has other bundles at this node . They might not be as cheap, but they might better suit your lifestyle -- that is if your lifestyle is \"Doesn't yet have a beefy PC or virtual reality but wants to get in on that right now.\" You are logged out.

Before burning out a sizable chunk of your holiday shopping budget on the e-commerce giant’s super-affordable in-house gear, you may want to consider putting every penny you’ve saved of late towards a more “meaningful” purchase.\nHow does a $999 CyberPowerPC Oculus ready GXiVR8020A gaming desktop & Oculus Rift virtual reality headset bundle sound? Like a mouthful, right? Also, pretty expensive at first for a Black Friday “Deal of the Day” if you don’t wrap your head around exactly what you’re getting here.\nNamely, the Oculus Rift , one of the world’s most popular, best-reviewed first-wave VR contraptions, typically sold for $599 all by its lonesome, and a fully compatible Windows 10 system with Intel Core i5 “Skylake” power, 8GB DDR4 memory, 1TB HDD, AMD Radeon RX 480 graphics, six USB 3.0 ports, as well as four USB 2.0, one HDMI, Display Port, and Network Ethernet connectivity.\nThe latter desktop PC currently costs $700 when not bundled with the Rift for a holiday-special promo, so all in all, Amazon offers you the unprecedented opportunity of saving 300 bucks. Plus, you even qualify for additional $100 Oculus Store Credit and a free copy of the EVE: Valkyrie multiplayer dogfighting shooter game. It almost goes without saying you need to act fast though.\nThe post Amazon’s best Black Friday deal of the day is a $999 Oculus-ready PC and Rift bundle appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

No matter which branch I try, it's 'WRONG!' My brother and father can hang it up just fine, but when my mother and I try, it's just 'WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!' \nA message from a Trump campaign staffer advertising the ornaments says: “President-elect Trump loves Christmas and makes a point of proudly saying ‘Merry Christmas’ every chance he gets.” \nMost of reviews appeared to be fake.

      "text": "Starting at 9PM PST (12AM EST) Amazon will offer a rare $20 discount on Amazon Prime memberships for only $79. This offer is only good for new members and you will have to act fast as this is only good for one day and will end on 11/18 11:59PM PST.\nPrime’s nicest perk (besides 2-day free shipping) is Amazon Video which offers access to some of Amazon’s highly rated and Emmy award winning original shows like Mr. Robot, Transparent, Mozart in the Jungle and more. In fact this new $20 discount is part of their promotion for their newest show, “The Grand Tour” with former Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson.\nThe benefits don’t stop there. Prime members also get a lot of other perks that you might otherwise have to pay for: Prime Music streaming, unlimited photo storage, and the Kindle lending library. You can even share your 2-day shipping benefits and Prime exclusive shopping benefits with a member of your family.\nFor Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the upcoming Holiday shopping season Amazon Prime is a huge benefit as members will often get exclusive discounts that meet or beat some of the lowest pricing we see in stores. Members also get access to their limited time limited supply Lightning deals 30 minutes ahead of everyone else. Lastly, Amazon will often price match other retailers like Best Buy, Walmart and Target and you’ll want to save yourself the hassle of shopping in-store and getting the price match and 2-day shipping from Amazon with your Prime membership.\nFor more Amazon Black Friday Deals and sneak peeks as they go live go to TechBargains .\nThe Huffington Post may receive revenue via links on this page.\nMore: Amazon Comments THE MORNING EMAIL 802 K 479 K 457 ",

      "text": "Subscribe To Newsletter Search for: Michelle Fields says ‘Trump trolls’ are flooding Amazon with bad reviews of her new book and Megyn Kelly’s 0 \nMichelle Fields and Megyn Kelly have a lot in common these days. \nBoth are not well-liked by many Donald Trump supporters, both have been accused of exploited their feuds with Trump for headlines, and both recently wrote their first books. \nAnd apparently, they both have terrible book reviews on Amazon. Trump bypasses media, outlines first 100 days, lays out list of executive actions, in video message \nBut are Trump supporters responsible for most of their abysmal book reviews? That’s what former Breitbart reporter Fields claims. \n“The @Amazon reviews of my book and @MegynKelly’s book are almost identical. All Trump trolls who haven’t read it and are insulting us personally,” Fields complained on Twitter. The @amazon reviews of my book & @megynkelly 's book are almost identical. All trump trolls who haven't read it & are insulting us personally pic.twitter.com/ZYnYaXv9Fe \n— Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) November 16, 2016 \nFields may have a point. Several reviews of her book, “Barons of the Beltway,” make references to her scrum with Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski , who was fired after she accused him of violently tugging her arm. \nMany reviewers claimed Fields tried to exploit her feud with Lewandowski for attention (and she did get a LOT of media attention for that), including several appearances on Megyn Kelly’s show, “The Kelly File.” \nSimilarly, reviews for Kelly’s book, “Settle For More,” are also littered with references to Donald Trump. \nOne reviewer slammed Kelly for unfairly trashing Trump to get more famous: \n“Read book. Tried to give benefit of doubt. Not impressed. She starts with Trump debate. All day of debate news reported her plans to destroy Trump before the debate occurred. I was not a Trump supporter but did not approve. Sick of media trying to destroy candidates. She was no different than CNN.” \nLike Michelle Fields, Kelly was blasted as an opportunist. \nThere’s no way to be 100% certain if the negative reviews of Fields’ and Kelly’s books are mostly from “Trump trolls,” as Fields claims. \nThe Daily Mail , citing the LA Times, insists some of Megyn Kelly’s poor reviews may be from Trump supporters, citing their curious timing. \n“More than 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s ‘Settle For More’ appeared on Amazon’s site within hours of its release,” the Daily Mail noted. \nAfter Kelly’s book publisher HarperCollins complained, Amazon took down most of the bad reviews (sounds like rigging?). Amazon is owned by liberal billionaire Jeff Bezos , who also owns the anti-Trump newspaper, the Washington Post. \nJust sayin’.",

      "text": "New York/Seattle: The pilots for the Air Transport Services Group Inc. unit that hauls packages for Amazon.com Inc. and DHL Worldwide Express were ordered back to work by a federal judge, halting a strike that threatened to disrupt holiday deliveries.\nUS District Judge Timothy Black in Cincinnati gave a nod to the holiday shopping rush in granting ABX Air’s request for a temporary restraining order for pilots to return to the cockpit.\n“The public expects that purchases and shipments will be delivered in a timely fashion,” Black said in Wednesday’s ruling. “Absent an injunction, ABX, its customers and the public will suffer immediate, irreparable harm. Imagine Christmas without Amazon!”\nThe strike began Tuesday morning and forced the cancellation of dozens of flights. Julie Ford, a lawyer for the pilots union, said the union has withdrawn picket lines to comply with the order, which is effective for five days under federal law.\nALSO READ: Amazon challenges Netflix by taking video service global \n“The union is obviously disappointed,” Ford said in a phone interview. The pilots will make a decision on how to proceed next week, she said.\nThe ruling clears a major obstacle for Amazon heading into its first holiday shopping season since contracting with ATSG and another carrier to operate a fleet of cargo planes to shuttle inventory around the country. Those contracts reduced the company’s reliance on FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc.\nCyber Monday \nThe pilots are returning to work in time for the online shopping peak between Thanksgiving and the following Monday. Online spending in the US on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday is expected to reach $8.4 billion, or 9.2% of all online spending in November and December, according to Adobe Systems Inc.\n“We re-balanced capacity across our network of carrier partners to ensure there are no disruptions through the busy holiday weekend, and plan to leave these adjustments in place,” Kelly Cheeseman, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nABX Air spokesman Paul Cunningham declined to immediately comment on the order.\nDHL said its hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has resumed operations and all delayed shipments are expected to be delivered by the weekend.\nAbout 250 ABX Air pilots walked off the job to protest the cargo carrier’s alleged staffing shortages. ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 for DHL, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. ABX said in its complaint that 26 flights, loaded with 1.25 million pounds of cargo, were grounded Tuesday. By Wednesday, 75 DHL flights had been grounded, the pilots union said.\nArbitration required \nIn issuing his order, the judge said the dispute qualifies as minor because it involves only the interpretation of an existing union contract. That means that it must be submitted to binding arbitration, rather than be brought to a federal court, Black said.\n“ABX and the other airlines that service DHL and Amazon are facing a staffing crisis, in large part because they cannot attract and retain talented pilots with the sub-standard pay and benefits they provide,” Dan Wells, president of Teamsters Local 1224, said in a statement. “Pilots should not have to go on strike to get back provisions of a contract that was taken away from them just to ensure they have adequate rest and time with their families.”\nThe case is ABX Air Inc. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division, 16-cv-01096, US District Court, Southern District of Ohio (Cincinnati). Bloomberg \nMary Schlangenstein also contributed tot this story.",
