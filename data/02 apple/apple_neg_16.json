      "text": "  13:29 PM EST Apple brings back the peach butt emoji Nobody can touch the peach butt emoji, not even Apple. A couple of weeks ago, Apple dropped the first iOS beta for iOS 10.2 with dozens of new and redesigned emojis. The world needs more emojis, I’m all for it. But Apple also accidentally redesigned the peach emoji and was a bit too literal — it didn’t quite look like a butt. Calm down, no need to grab the pitchforks.… Read More",

      "text": "Download our iOS app Apple Introduces Photo Book “Designed by Apple in California” Dedicated in the memory of the Apple CEO Steve Jobs, \"Designed by Apple in California,\" photo book has lively chronicled the remarkable journey of Apple products ranging from iMac 1998 to Apple Pencil 2015. \nWhether it’s the superior Mac, ultra-elegant MacBook, evergreen iPhone, fabulous iPad or fascinating Apple Watch, Apple’s products are gifted with incredible design. Today, the tech giant has introduced a new hardbound photo book, named “Designed by Apple in California,” which has vividly recorded 20 years of Apple product designs through 450 photographs. \n“Designed by Apple in California” has been dedicated in the memory of the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. The photo book has chronicled the journey from 1998 to 2015-covering iMac to Apple Pencil. \nIt has documented the materials as well as techniques used by Apple’s design team to create those iDevices. Apple Announces Photo Book “Designed by Apple in California” \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”– Apple . \nDesigned by Apple in California” comes in two sizes. It has been printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, with the use of eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume took eight years of long development. \nIn the book’s foreword, Ive explains: \n“While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.” \nThe photo book is to be available from tomorrow, Wednesday, November 16, in small (10.20″ x 12.75″) at $199 (US) and large (13″ x 16.25″) at $299 (US) from Apple.com in countries like Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US. It will also be available at select Apple Stores. \nConnect with us on Facebook , Twitter , and Google Plus . TAGS",

      "text": "Apple Removed 47,300 Outdated iOS Apps From App Store in October of 2016   11:05 am PST by Juli Clover Back in September, Apple announced plans to start removing outdated apps from the App Store , promising to eliminate apps that are non-functional, not compatible with recent versions of iOS, or that do not adhere to current review guidelines. According to data app analytics firm Sensor Tower shared with TechCrunch , Apple has made good on that promise. In October of 2016, the number of apps removed from the App Store increased by 238 percent, with Apple purging a total of 47,300 apps throughout the month. On an average month, Apple removes approximately 14,000 iOS apps, so October's much larger purge represents a significant step towards cleaning up the App Store. Developers with problematic apps were notified starting in September, and Apple gave them 30 days to make changes to prevent their apps from being eliminated from the App Store. Apps that did not see updates were then removed. Apps across all categories were subject to removal, but many of the 47,000 apps that were culled from the App Store were games. 28 percent of removed apps fell into the Games category, 8.99 were in the Entertainment category, 8.96 were in the Books category, 7 percent were in the Education category, and 6 percent were in the Lifestyle category. The App Store purge is part of Apple's effort to improve the App Store. In recent months , Apple has opened up app subscriptions to all product categories, introduced more favorable revenue splits, improved sharing tools, and added ads to App Store search results to give developers new ways to promote their apps.",

      "text": "Topics: Apple , AR , augmented reality , Innovation News , Technology News FILE - In this Friday, Sept. 25, 2015, file photo, people wait in front of an Apple store in Munich, before the worldwide launch of the iPhone 6s. After a tax ruling against Apple on Tuesday, Aug. 30, 2016, the spotlight turns to dozens of companies that have boosted earnings taking advantage of low tax rates abroad. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader, File) (Credit: AP) \nIf Pokemon Go was a revolutionary first step toward bringing Augmented Reality (AR) to the mainstream, Apple is hoping the next one will be its newly announced digital glasses . \n“We are high on AR for the long run,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook during an earnings call in July, shortly after Pokemon Go exploded into a worldwide phenomenon. “We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nAccording to early reports, Apple’s new digital glasses will connect wirelessly to the iPhone, display visuals and other information within the wearer’s field of vision, and will incorporate augmented reality. Apple has already started discussing the glasses with potential suppliers, according to a Bloomberg article on Monday . \nThe digital glasses would be the next big step for a company that has already spent several years trying to increase its competitiveness in the burgeoning AR market. Apple has already purchased several companies that specialize in aspects of AR technology, including PrimeSense in 2013, Metaio Inc. in 2015, and Flyby Media Inc in 2016. \nThat said, Apple will face a number of challenges in making these digital glasses into a reality, which is why they aren’t expected to be released until 2018 at the earliest. While the technology for effective AR does exist, it won’t be easy fitting it into a pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and light enough for people to wear in their day-to-day lives. The most recent attempt to create this type of technology, Google Glass, failed because its battery couldn’t power the glasses for a long period of time. \nNevertheless, Cook has a strong incentive to make Apple’s digital glasses into a success. As iPhone sales continue to slow and Apple Watch continues to founder, a ground-breaking new product will be instrumental to Apple’s bottom line.

      "text": "– A + Apple purged 47,300 broken & outdated App Store titles in October By Roger Fingas \nTuesday, November 15, 2016, 11:00 am PT (02:00 pm ET) \nApple began its promised purge of the iOS App Store in October, pulling some 47,300 titles, according to third-party research data published on Tuesday. \n\n\n\n\nApp removals jumped 238 percent last month, according to intelligence firm Sensor Tower, quoted by TechCrunch . Figures were also about 3.4 times higher than the monthly average between January and September.\n\nAbout 28 percent of the deleted apps were games, far higher than the next two categories —Entertainment and Books —which accounted for just 8.99 and 8.96 percent, respectively. Education came in fourth at 7 percent, while Lifestyle apps represented just 6 percent.\n\nApple announced plans to start reviewing old apps in early September, \"removing apps that no longer function as intended, don't follow current review guidelines, or are outdated.\" This included deleting \"abandoned\" titles which hadn't been given compatibility updates \"for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhile Apple said that it would immediately remove apps that crash on launch, it added that it would otherwise send out notifications asking developers to update within 30 days if they wanted to keep their apps available.\n\nPurges are likely ongoing, as prior to October, it was estimated that nearly half of iOS apps hadn't been updated since May 2015. Over a quarter hadn't been updated since Nov. 2013.",

      "text": "As mentioned back in September , Apple and Nintendo are bringing Super Mario to Apple devices. Beginning December 15, Super Mario Run will be available for iPhone and iPad in the U.S.\nPlayers will in turn be able to try elements of the game’s three modes for free. Once downloaded, a one-time fee of $9.99 USD will award you unlimited access to each of the three modes in the release.\n“The wait is almost over for a Super Mario game that can be played on mobile devices,” said Doug Bowser, Nintendo of America’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “Developed under the direction of Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Super Mario Run brings a new take on the series’ beloved action-platforming gameplay to iPhone and iPad for the first time.”\nSuper Mario Run is the first Super Mario Bros. game developed specifically for mobile devices, initially compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices running iOS 8.0 or later.\nAgain, look for the Super Mario game to become available beginning December 15.\n",

      "text": "NewsBot Oltre 450 bellissime foto dei prodotti Apple rilasciati negli ultimi 20 anni: un testamento al design dell’azienda di Cupertino che si fa pagare caro, 300 dollari, ma non sarà disponibile negli store italiani. \nLe foto sono tutte del fotografo ufficiale di Apple, Andrew Zuckerman e sono volutamente sparse per il libro senza un ordine preciso. \nJonathan Ive, capo del design in Apple, ha scritto nella prefazione: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \n\n\nIl libro è dedicato alla memoria di Steve Jobs e sarà disponibile da domani (16 novembre) in due diverse versioni (small e large, a 200 e 300 dollari) negli Apple Store e nei negozi online di Apple in Australia, Francia, Germania, Hong Kong, Giappone, Corea, Taiwan, Inghilterra e Stati Uniti. \nNiente Italia.",

      "text": "Apple's Book: A $300 'Gentle Gathering' of Product Photos There are 450 photos, for what it's worth By Jenn Gidman , Newser Staff Posted Nov 15, 2016 11:47 AM CST Pretty. ( Apple ) Pretty. ( Apple ) (Newser) – \"A book like this takes courage\" is how the Verge describes Apple's newest publishing venture. Not because the coffee-table tome features narratives on how the company's products change the world , but because it boasts page upon page of breathtakingly beautiful photos of Apple products—450 photos, to be exact—and pretty much nothing else, a veritable steal at $299. Per a press release , Designed by Apple in California —which the Verge snarks is \"a name that somehow manages to be both humble and incredibly pretentious at the same time\"—is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs and is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink\" in two sizes (the smaller book is only $199). Per CNNMoney , the book, which took more than eight years to pull together, kicks off with the 1998 iMac and finishes off with 2015's Apple Pencil for the iPad Pro. Not every product featured within the linen-bound pages is an Apple bright spot: There's the failed G4 Cube, for example, as well as the Apple Watch, which CNN notes hasn't quite turned into a wearable sensation. Andrew Zuckerman gets photography credits for the \"deliberately spare\" images in the book, which Apple design chief Jony Ive notes is a \"gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years\" that can be fawned over as a \"resource for students of all design disciplines.\" The book will go on sale Wednesday at Apple Stores and on Apple.com.

      "text": "Video Sir Jony Ive reflects on the nature of objects, the fragility of ideas, and 20 years of Apple design Sir Jony Ive reflects on the nature of objects, the fragility of ideas, and 20 years of Apple design Design / 15 Nov 2016 / By Tony Chambers Facebook \nSir Jony Ive takes us inside Apple's design studio and opens up about the company's creative processes... \nDeveloped over an eight-year period, Apple's self-published Designed by Apple in California is available in two sizes and printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper \niPhone, 2007. The spline on the 5052 aluminium alloy housing for every iPhone was custom fit to the unique shape of each 304 stainless steel bezel \nA rare look inside the Power Mac G4 Cube, 2000. The entire computer is suspended within a clear acrylic enclosure to enable a quiet, convection-cooled architecture \nApple Watch, 2015. The Force Touch sensor (left) is made from several layers of polyimide, copper electrodes, silicone, and adhesive molded into ultra-thin sheets that serve as a capacitator. The Digital Crown (right) has an 8-pixel optical sensor that provides 200 discrete positions per rotation \nThe book comes slipped in a specially designed envelope \nA slip-in portfolio outlines the technical details of Apple's archive \nMac mini, 2010. A custom-designed T-cutter enabled the removal of the maximum amount of material to ensure that all internal components could fit inside a single unibody enclosure \niPhone 5s Leather Case, 2013. Eight steps in the process to form the iPhone 5s Leather Case, including skiving the leather to a thinness of 0.4mm, die-cutting the leather, wraping the leather around the polycarbonate shell, and inlaying the microfibre lining \nThe inaugural iPod model in 2001 had a combined exterior; a single sheet of formed and polished 304 stainless steel with laser-etched graphics for the back, and a double protection of PC/ABS and clear polycarbonate for the face \nApple EarPods, 2012. Hundreds of prototype models were tested on more than 600 people to obtain more than 500 measurements. This, combined with additional ergonomic data from more than 10,000 people, contributed to the design of an earpiece defined by the geometry of the ear itself \nApple Watch Sport, 2015. The 7000 Series aluminium is polished to a mirror finish using a four-axis force-feedback wheel, then blasted with zirconia media to create a consistant, satin texture \nMany of us can remember our first encounter with an Apple product. For a rare few, it may have been the Apple 1 (1976). For some, the turning point was the iMac (1998). And who can forget the frenzy surrounding the iPod’s debut some 15 years ago, or the iPhone (2007), the iPad (2010), and most recently the Apple Watch and Apple Pencil (both 2015). \nLaunching today, a new book gathers Apple's most memorable projects in a visual compendium engineered with the same precision and scrupulous attention to detail as one of its products. \nThe linen-bound, hardcover volume is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges \nThis is a comprehensive and objective portrait of Apple products produced over the past 20 years. ‘It is a book with very few words,’ writes Sir Jony Ive in the foreword. ‘It is about our products, their physical nature and how they were made.’ The pages that follow trace two stratospheric decades of product design with the effortlessness that’s become synonymous with the company. \nIt is a quiet and elegant work, a high-quality piece of book design, typography and production. It is far from a show-off vanity project. Great care, time – and money – has been spent on making it a paean to good, useful design and manufacturing. It is also of course a paean to Steve Jobs.In the five years since his death, Apple has forged on without him. Designed by Apple in California is a tribute both to him, and to the products that have shaped our future. \nThe tome is Apple at its purest: the products. We caught up with Ive to find out more... \nWallpaper*: The new book, quite unusually for Apple, is a look back. Jony Ive: The biggest challenge for us was the fact that our focus and preoccupation is always on the future. So that tends to exclude much time to look back at the work we have previously done. Sometimes if we are struggling with a particular issue then that gives us reason to go back and look at the way we have solved problems in the past. But because we've been so consumed by our current and future work we came to realise we didn't have a catalogue of the physical products. So about eight years ago we felt an obligation to address this and build an objective archive. Many of the products that you see, we actually had to go out and purchase [laughs]. It's a rather shameful admission, but it's just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in, so we started to build an archive of the physical products. \nThese custom-designed, high-performance tungsten carbide cutting tools were use to manufacture the iPhone 4 bezel \nW*: Objectivity seems to be the key goal? JI: We were intrigued how we could objectively describe, define and catalogue the objects and try to give people a sense of how they were made. Not how they were designed, but how they came to be. How they were manufactured and how you can transform these often-anonymous materials into something that is valuable and useful. \nW*: By looking back, did it trigger memories? JI: You know, I've spent half my life at Apple – so many of us associate different projects with different parts of our lives. It was curious and interesting. For each project there are multiple stories. \nInterestingly, the only way we realised we would finish the project was to treat it like one of the projects in the studio. There were a few things we needed to do to accurately and objectively portray these products. Of course, many of these products are white, so the off-the-shelf printing processes really didn't do an adequate job in describing the colour and surface of those products. So, unsurprisingly we ended up developing custom forms of paper [ from British papermaker James Cropper ] and custom inks. \nThe composition from the launch of the very first iMacs, unveiled in 1998, was replicated exactly for the book \nW*: Did you and the team in turn learn anything from the process of making the book? JI: The products we're working on at the moment, and have been for a while, are the beneficiaries of all the learning we gained from the book – so of course to us they are the very best things we have ever done. Therefore the frustration, the absolute frustration, of not being able to include that work was sometimes enough to make us think this is something we're not going to be able to finish. It's around 20 years of work and it certainly isn't everything we've done – it's the things that we think were salient in our learning or that we just had an affection for. That part [the selection process] wasn't too hard or challenging – we generally all felt the same way about the same products. But certainly to draw a line and say this will be the end of this first catalogue, first book, that was exquisitely painful. \nW*: Quite typically for Apple, the book comes beautifully packaged. JI: We're so used to packaging 3D objects, so that was part of the project we really enjoyed – trying to create a very simple way of protecting the book and not having to force people to deal with a myriad of sticky labels – hopefully it helped the unwrapping and made it enjoyable. So often you can put all of your energy into the primary product that you forget that your actual experience is an aggregation of the product plus all of these peripheral objects like the packaging and shipping box. We really wanted to treat each of them with the care they deserve, or rather, the care that people [the customer] deserves, such as with the draw tab on the cardboard box and the simple tuck on the envelope. \nDetail of the draw tab of the shipping box, which is pulled open to reveal the book inside. Photography: Antonio Camera \nW*: What were your key objectives for the book? JI: We asked ourselves, 'What is the value of a book like this, when most people know these objects so intimately already?'First, to see the objects out of their functional context. Next, to see them in a context of the subsequent products and hopefully how we have learned as a team how technology shifts, moves and evolves. And the other reason was to do with the fact that many people don't really have much of a sense of how their manufactured environment came to be. Most people wouldn't understand how the chair they are sat on is made. One of the things we wanted to do was try and explain as clearly as we can – through photography – how you transform a raw material into a product that you recognise and hopefully use as a daily tool. \nWe decided to be fairly explicit about some of the processes we used. I guess we feel a strong sense of ownership of these processes because they really do aid our understanding and learning and transfer from one product to the next. We feel that more than ever there has been a disconnect between designing and making and really, you can't disconnect them. In the 90s, as manufacturing was outsourced, this chasm developed between where something was made and where it was designed. But designing and making are inseparable if you want the ultimate product to have integrity. Another key point is that the book is being sent to all the major design colleges in the world. We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines. It's very important that it’s an educational resource as well. \niPod aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour \nW*: I presume all the photographs (by Andrew Zuckerman) were shot specifically for the book. But there's one incredible image of a Nasa space shuttle? JI: Yes, they were – with the exception of that Space Shuttle image (above). The first image in the book is of the very first iMac. We used the same composition as the launch shot in the 1990s. But we reshot every single product [for the book]. As the project has taken so long we actually had to go back and re-photograph some of earlier products because of how photographic technology had changed and improved. The images of the later products were superior to the earlier ones, so we had to go back to the beginning to keep that perfect consistency throughout the book. Nasa images are quite extraordinary. We were poring over these one day and noticed an iPod on the dashboard, resting up there. I thought that was so funny – it was both humbling and humorous.",

Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are up 72 cents, or 0.6%, at $106.43, shares of Alphabet ( GOOGL ) are up $14.29, or 2%, at $767.51, shares of Amazon ( AMZN ) are up $9.30, or 1.3%, at $728.37, shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are up $1.33, or 1%, at $114.71, and shares of Facebook ( FB ) are up $1.47, or 1.2%, at $116.55. Speaking of Apple, Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman , Alex Webb , and Ian King wrote late yesterday that Apple is in “early product testing” for “ digital glasses ,” which would take an “augmented reality” approach to displaying images and information in front of the user’s gaze, similar to Alphabet’s Google’s failed “ Google Glass. ” The authors, citing multiple unnamed sources, write that the device is “still in an exploration phase,” with any possible delivery of actual product not expected before 2018.",

      "text": "Reuters/Issei Kato \nApple will launch three new iPhones in 2017, according to a new note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nAs noted by MacRumors , the note mainly focuses on the display and camera technology in next years iPhones. Kuo believes that there’ll be two sizes with LCD screens — similar to today's iPhone and iPhone Plus — and one with an OLED screen.\nOLED is a type of display tech that’s already available on numerous high-end phones today. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel are two notable examples. It allows for an infinite contrast ratio, which helps colors pop more onscreen. Done right, it could be a notable improvement over what's on current iPhones. Apple itself has already adopted the tech with the Apple Watch and the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro.\nRumors for the 2017 iPhone have been all over the map, and as always you should take this one with a big heaping of salt. It wasn’t long ago that an “iPhone 7 Pro” was expected alongside the eventual iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and that never came to pass.\nBut reports of Apple adopting OLED as part of a radical, all-glass redesign for next year’s iPhone have popped up repeatedly in recent months, and the notion of Apple using a third device to introduce it isn’t new either. Past rumors have suggested that the third model could be anywhere between 5 and 5.8 inches. \nPlus, these latest predictions come from Kuo, who has a very long track record of figuring out Apple devices before they launch.\nNevertheless, we're probably 10 months away from a new iPhone launch, and Apple might not even know how 2017 is going to shake out. \nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

      "text": "We Don't Need Smart Apple Glasses newsfeedback@fool.com (Evan Niu, CFA) 1 hr ago If Apple moves forward, it will need to learn from Google Glass's failure. Image source: Google. \nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) hasn't even proven that the average consumer needs or wants a smartwatch yet, but the company may already be looking into expanding its wearables strategy into the realm of smart glasses. \nBloomberg reported yesterday that Apple is thinking about making digital glasses its next foray into wearables. The glasses would display contextual information to users to create an augmented reality (AR) experience, which is in line with CEO Tim Cook's suggestion that AR has a lot more potential than virtual reality (VR) to broadly and profoundly affect consumers. The company has supposedly already had preliminary discussions with suppliers and taken delivery of small volumes of \"near-eye displays\" for prototyping purposes. The earliest that such a device would reach the market would be 2018. \nOf course, the project could be shuttered, and it remains in an experimental phase as Apple explores the idea. If at first you don't succeed \nThe challenge is that Apple Watch is already stalling, just a year and a half after its initial launch. Since Apple stubbornly refuses to disclose any financial data regarding the performance of its first wearable device, investors must turn to sometimes unreliable third-party estimates. According to market researcher IDC, Apple Watch unit shipments have been utterly decimated this year. Data source: IDC. Chart by author. \nApple Watch Series 2 was launched at the very end of September in limited supply, so this chart predominantly represents the original Series 1. That also means that there are unlikely to be many upgrades in here, and these sales should be going almost entirely to first-time adopters. \nThe broader smartwatch category saw its first decline in the second quarter, with worldwide units falling 32%. Apple Watch is the No. 1 smartwatch in the world right now, so the company's performance has a disproportionate effect on what the entire market is doing. Depending on how you define a smartwatch, this market is either a year old or a few years old, but seeing it start to contract already is not a good sign. \nSimply put, Apple hasn't proven that mainstream consumers need a smartwatch, or even that they should really want it that badly. The company is still searching for that killer use case. While bolstering its fitness uses makes sense, those are still only features that a small subset of customers is asking for (I haven't been swimming in months). \nThere's by no means a requirement that Apple Watch must succeed before Apple jumps into the next category, but growing adoption of Apple's first wearable would pave the way for its next one. Picking up where Google left off \nNaturally, a discussion of Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) failed Google Glass project is obligatory at this point. The concept that Google came up with was somewhat compelling. Video source: Google. \nBeyond the concept, there was a tremendous gap between vision and execution. Apple will need to address Glass's failings if it has any hope of potential Apple Glasses succeeding. Google Glass failed for a number of reasons: Too expensive at $1,500",

Catch The Final Round at 4 p.m. ET as we break down all of today’s market action with Yahoo Finance’s Jen Rogers and reporter Myles Udland.\nWinners and losers \nStocks on the move lower today include Amplify Snack Brands as the SkinnyPop maker missed on both earnings and revenue; Tesaro as the biopharma company announced a 1.75 million share secondary offering; and Dick’s Sporting Goods, with shares getting walloped as the retailer said current quarter guidance likely wouldn’t meet Street expectations.\nStocks pushing higher today include Advance Auto Parts as comparable same-store sales came in better than expected, JD.com, as China’s second biggest e-commerce site reported 38% year-over-year revenue growth; and Fiat Chrysler, with shares reversing higher from yesterday as the automaker says Ram Truck lawsuit filed yesterday doesn’t have merit and it contests the claims “vigorously.” Separately, Fiat Chrysler was upgraded by analysts at Redburn.\nBreaking down the markets post election \nAfter a post-Trump rally, stocks are cooling off a bit as investors look for direction. Here to break down recent market action and how retail investors have been trading the rally is John Sweeney, executive vice president, Retirement and Investing Strategies for our sponsor Fidelity Investments.\nLooking ahead \nIn the morning, we’ll get the MBA’s mortgage applications report for the week. It will be interesting to see if applications drop following the rise mortgage rates last week. Later in the morning we’ll get the Fed’s industrial production figures for October. The Street’s looking for a slight 0.1% gain in production and a 0.3% jump in manufacturing. Finally, we’ll get huge earnings reports from Lowe’s, Target, and networking giant Cisco.",

      "text": "The 5 best navigation apps for drivers for Apple and Android Top 5 navigation and maps apps for drivers Most smartphone users swear by Google or Apple Maps, often based on which one their phone came equipped with. But there are better options out there if you're willing to try. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  58 PM \nWhen it comes to navigation apps on your smartphone, sticking with what you know can often lead you in the wrong direction, literally and figuratively. \nWhile mapping giants Google and Apple have the basics down to a science, there are a myriad of other apps out there that can do the same job and more, sometimes better than the big guys. With a focus on the needs of the average driver, we’ve compiled a list of the top 5 navigation apps for drivers available for both Apple and Android users. \nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. \n5. Apple Maps Sometimes what you've already got is good enough, and with CarPlay functionality on new vehicles, Apple's once-maligned Maps app becomes even more appealing. (Apple) \nSometimes what you've already got is good enough. Apple's proprietary maps app is no superstar, but it gets the job done. With live traffic updates, 3D displays and pretty much everything else you need as a driver - not to mention the ability to work seamlessly with Siri - you may want to stick with what's already on your iPhone for the sake of simplicity (and data storage). \nPlus, drivers of new cars equipped with Apple CarPlay functionality will enjoy the ability to input a destination, plug in the phone, and have turn-by-turn directions pop up right on the infotainment screen, and seamlessly switch between music and text message reading capabilities. \n(Comes pre-installed on iOS devices, unavailable on Android) \n4. inRoute Free app inRoute (with a $5 premium option), gives you up to 25 stops on one route, with a feature available to find the quickest and most fuel efficient combination of stops. (inRoute) \nThe big map apps all do point-to-point directions with ease, but what about those of us who make multiple stops along one trip? For the road-tripper in all of us, there’s inRoute, a free app that gives you the freedom to plot up to five stops on one trip. InRoute also lets you search for points of interest between where you are and where you’re going, handy in a pinch when you find yourself in the backwoods in need of a gas station. \nFor an extra $4.99, inRoute users can add up to 25 stops on one trip, including the amount of time you plan to stop at each location, and a feature that reorders stops into the fastest and most efficient route. Take note, Google and Apple. \n(Available for free on the iTunes store with option for a $4.99 upgrade) \n3. Waze By using inputs from other drivers in the area and around the world, Waze crowd-sources traffic updates, road hazards, detours, speed cameras, and even police officers. (Waze) \nWaze was an overnight success, and has become a cult favorite among commuters in the know, with good reason. By using inputs from other drivers in the area and around the world, it crowd-sources traffic updates, road hazards, detours, speed cameras, and even police officers lurking behind the nearest sight-line obstruction. Users can get detailed too, with the ability to make notes and post photos to be clearer about what lies on the road ahead. \nWhile it lags behind the big players in location accuracy and public transportation/walking options, as well as cycling routes. There’s also no option for offline use, as it relies solely on cellular data or WiFi. Either way, if you’re looking to socialize your commute, Waze is the one and only. \n(Available for free on the iTunes store and Google Play store ) \n2. Google Maps With the ability to seamlessly integrate Google search, voice commands, and your personal preferences, there are few better mapping options than the ubiquitous Google Maps. (Google) \nThere’s a reason Google Maps stays so high on this list, and much of it has to do with the wealth of information afforded to the internet giant. Live traffic updates, estimated times of arrival, and nearby places of interest are what Google does best, and as an all-rounder, there are none better. Google has also upped its game in the suggestion department, learning what routes you take and what you like to do on your way and using it to personalize the experience. \nWhat’s the catch, then? Well, there aren’t many, but Google still forces you to search for routes and directions while online before being used offline, and there are no live updates or warnings like with Waze. The seamless integration with search and other Google apps may be enough to offset that, though. \n(Available for free on the iTunes store and Google Play store ) \n1. HERE \nNokia’s impressively-comprehensive navigation app was just bought by a consortium of Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW for a whopping $3 billion, and upon using the HERE app, it’s not hard to see why. With a massive fleet of mapping vehicles and cloud-based updates, HERE is able to plot directions almost down to the inch, hence the interest from automakers for their autonomous car efforts. \nCouple that with the ability to download offline maps for cities, states, and even entire countries around the world, and HERE begins to make a lot of sense. It’s free to download, free to use, and setting route preferences is easier than offerings from Google and Apple. It also gives you driving, walking, and public transit directions in one place, rather than having to re-search for each separate option. If you haven’t downloaded it yet, do it now. You’ll thank us later. \n(Available for free on the iTunes store and Google Play store ) Tags:",

      "text": "In Brief Rumors are swelling that Apple's next big thing could be a new swing at smart glasses. Unlike with the Google Glass, Apple has the advantage of a surge in popularity of augmented reality systems and applications. \nThe Cupertino-based tech giant might be adding to its lone wearable soon. According to Bloomberg , Apple is cooking up ideas for a potential competitor to Snapchat’s Spectacles and Google’s Project Aura . Apple’s supposedly in talks with its hardware suppliers for potential augmented reality (AR) glasses and ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays” for testing. Credits: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach \nGetting into smart glasses could be a game changer for Apple, especially with the increasing popularity of AR and video-sharing apps (like Snapchat). Although Google’s glasses ended up being a flop, Apple might be looking for its next big hit in the increasingly popular AR business. The AR glass “would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality,” according to insiders , as reported by Bloomberg . The new product could be introduced by 2018. \nCurrently, Apple has existing patents for AR and virtual reality (VR) products. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” CEO Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts last July 26. “We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nWith Google taking on Apple in the smartphone gig, it seems likely that Apple is continuing to look for other ways to get ahead.",

A couple of weeks ago, Apple dropped the first iOS beta for iOS 10.2 with dozens of new and redesigned emojis. The world needs more emojis, I’m all for it.

      "text": "(Apple's iPhone 7 Plus.Reuters/Issei Kato) \nApple will launch three new iPhones in 2017, according to a new note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. \nAs noted by MacRumors , the note mainly focuses on the display and camera technology in next years iPhones. Kuo believes that there’ll be two sizes with LCD screens — similar to today's iPhone and iPhone Plus — and one with an OLED screen (and dual cameras).\nOLED is a type of display tech that’s already available on numerous high-end phones today. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel are two notable examples. It allows for an infinite contrast ratio, which helps colors pop more onscreen. Done right, it could be a notable improvement over what's on current iPhones. Apple itself has already adopted the tech with the Apple Watch and the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro.\nRumors for the 2017 iPhone have been all over the map, and as always you should take this one with a big heaping of salt. It wasn’t long ago that an “ iPhone 7 Pro ” was rumored alongside the eventual iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and that never came to pass.\nBut reports of Apple adopting OLED as part of a radical, all-glass redesign for next year’s iPhone have popped up repeatedly in recent months, and the notion of Apple using a third device to introduce it isn’t new either. Past rumors have suggested that the third model could be anywhere between 5 and 5.8 inches. \nPlus, these latest predictions come from Kuo, who has a very long track record of figuring out Apple devices before they launch.\nNevertheless, we're probably 10 months away from a new iPhone launch, and even Apple might not know how 2017 is going to shake out. \nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n\nMore From Business Insider \nNintendo's first iPhone game will launch in December for $10 \nSwipe down on your iPhone for a fast way to do anything \nHere’s what most people do with their old smartphones after they buy a new one",

      "text": "Reddit \nA book called “Designed by Apple in California” has been revealed by the company in two sizes. This book is the first of its kind made by Apple, having been curated and developed over the past eight years. Inside this book are few words, and mostly photographs, concentrating on the design language Apple uses in the industrial sense spanning their history in 450 photographs. \nThis book does not cover the entirety of Apple’s history in products. Instead it begins at a turning point for the company, back in 1998 with the iMac. This was the point at which the company became colorful and “magical.” It was the point at which Steve Jobs really started striking the iron with public presentations of products, making that part of the Apple experience. \nThis book is “dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs”, as it were. As Apple’s Jony Ive suggests, “The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future.” Ive continues, “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years.” \nThis book is made for the public – it’ll be released by Apple in a number of Apple Stores. It’s aimed at lovers of Apple’s products as well as those that wish to study the industrial design of Apple’s most successful run of years in business (thus far). “We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist,” said Ive, “while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThis book will be hardbound in both of its editions, large and small. Both sizes are printed on “specially milled, custom-dyed paper” so as to allow Apple’s many all-white products to avoid disappearing before your eyes. Pages in these books have gilded matte silver edges and are linen-bound. \nInk on each page is “low ghost”, which essentially means that ink stays on the page for which it was intended. While I’d rather Apple used the words “archival inks” in their presentation of the book, I can’t imagine this book will be kept in anything less than mint condition by its future owners any time soon. \nTwo editions of this book exist and will be put on sale starting on the 16th of November, 2016. The smaller of the two is 10.20 x 12.75-inches and available starting at $199 USD. The larger edition is 13 x 16.25-inches and available starting at $299 USD. \nThis book will be available internationally at the following Apple retail locations: Apple Regent Street and Apple Covent Garden in London; Apple Opera in Paris; Apple Kurfürstendamm in Berlin; Apple ifc mall and Apple Canton Road in Hong Kong; Apple Ginza in Tokyo; and Apple Sydney. Inside the USA, this book will be found at Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica. Apple Stores that’ll have this book available also include Apple North Michigan Avenue in Chicago; Apple Lincoln Road in Miami; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino.

      "title": "More from Jony Ive on Designed by Apple in California",
      "text": "Linked By John Voorhees \nJony Ive was interviewed by design website Wallpaper about Designed by Apple in California , an Apple-published book of photography that documents twenty years of product design and manufacturing. Apple is known for its singular focus on the future and, during Steve Jobs’ tenure, its disdain for dwelling on the past. That has begun to change in recent years with things like its 40 Years in 40 Seconds video and its tribute to past laptops at the MacBook Pro event last month. Even so, Apple’s announcement of an expensive book about its own products caught some off guard. In response to Wallpaper , Ive addressed why Apple created Designed by Apple in California : \nSometimes if we are struggling with a particular issue then that gives us reason to go back and look at the way we have solved problems in the past. But because we've been so consumed by our current and future work we came to realise we didn't have a catalogue of the physical products. So about eight years ago we felt an obligation to address this and build an objective archive. \nBeyond chronicling the design of Apple’s past products, Ive explains that Apple wants to illuminate the connection between designing and making a product and provide a resource for design students: \nOne of the things we wanted to do was try and explain as clearly as we can – through photography – how you transform a raw material into a product that you recognise and hopefully use as a daily tool…. We feel that more than ever there has been a disconnect between designing and making and really, you can't disconnect them. In the 90s, as manufacturing was outsourced, this chasm developed between where something was made and where it was designed. But designing and making are inseparable if you want the ultimate product to have integrity. Another key point is that the book is being sent to all the major design colleges in the world. We are keen to get it into the hands of young people who are studying design disciplines. It's very important that it’s an educational resource as well.",

      "title": "Super Mario Run Release for iPhone: 4 Things That We Know",
      "text": "Eager to impress smartphone shoppers ahead of the holiday season, electronics maker Apple shocked audience members and fans watching its iPhone 7 Event . Ironically, it wasn’t the announcement of a water-proof device or upgrades in processors that generated all the amazement It was the reveal of the Super Mario Run release for iPhone.\nThe reveal of Super Mario Run shocked a lot of people this morning – particularly fans of the Mario franchise. Published and developed by Nintendo, no Mario game has ever made it onto the platform of another company. In fact, Nintendo uses its most popular brands to boost sales of its Nintendo 3DS handheld. Earlier this year the company said that it would focus more on mobile while still trying to lure users to the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS.\nAdvertisement\nSuper Mario Run will bring Nintendo’s most popular video game character to smartphones for the very first time. Here’s what we know about the upcoming game.\nSuper Mario Run Release: Release Date Confirmed in a press release well after the game’s original announcement, Nintendo has finally confirmed a Super Mario Run release date. iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users can expect the game to arrive on December 15th. The game will require devices to run Apple’s iOS 8 operating system.\nAdvertisement\nNintendo has planned a staggered, country by country launch of the game. Support for Russian, English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch and Russian are confirmed. Chinese languages will be supported to. It’s coming to 151 regions and countries.\nAdvertisement\nSuper Mario Run Release: Exclusive to iPhone Nintendo took the stage to announce Super Mario Run just as Apple was giving the press a look at the iTunes app store’s performance. The point was clear, through working with developers of all kinds, Apple devices will continue to have access to the most interesting, well-made apps out there.\nSuper Mario Run won’t immediately be available on anything else but devices that run iOS, Nintendo confirmed on-stage at the reveal. That’s a big change in direction for Nintendo. The company’s first-ever game for mobile devices was Miitomo . It came to both Android and iOS.\nSuper Mario Run Release: Run & Tap Controls Perfect for One Hand Super Mario Run looks a lot like the console versions of the game that you might have seen before. Certainly, the point of the game hasn’t changed a lot. You’re still Mario. You’re trying to reach the end of levels by avoiding cracks in the ground and collecting coins.\nAdvertisement\nIt’d have been easy for Nintendo to abdicate responsibility for controlling the characters in this game. After all, Super Mario Run is an offshoot of a game that focuses heavily on physical controls and has been around for a very long time. The company didn’t.\nThe Run in Super Mario Run’s title comes from some pretty important changes to the game’s mechanics. In the franchise’s other platformers, players are free to stop, run or turn around. Run doesn’t give players that opportunity at all. Mario keeps moving forward at break-neck speed. Only through dodging the different obstacles quickly will players make it to the end of the level.\nThrough finger taps users force their character to jump. In a press release sent out after the reveal, Nintendo said that it hoped users would be able to enjoy the entire game with just a single hand.\nSuper Mario Run Release: Multiplayer Besides the basic mode, Nintendo also gave users a look at the game’s dedicated Toad Tally Mode. This feature lets users compete with the scores that other players have managed to rack up on their own.\nAdvertisement\nSuper Mario Run Release: Price\nToo often, one thing that seriously puts a damper on mobile games is their business model. In the early days of the iTunes App Store, games had cover charges. You could buy a game for a flat fee and play it as long as you wanted.\nAll of that changed when the so-called Games-as-a-Service phenomenon took over. Developers started giving away their games for free to attract as many people downloaders as possible. With users hooked, the game’s economy would kick in. Players needed in-game tools or currency to make the game they were playing a less time consuming. Now almost all mobile games feature some kind of economy like this.\nSuper Mario Run won’t require or encourage extra digital purchases, Nintendo says. Instead, it’ll have a cover charge so that user’s don’t need to keep spending money on in-game items and currency that they can’t use anywhere else.\nAdvertisement\nThere’ll be a free and a paid version of the game, Nintendo has confirmed. The game will sell for $9.99. This version provides unlimited access to everything that Super Mario Run has to offer. The free version will let users try all of three of its modes, but only on a limited basis.\nFor sure, Nintendo will have more information closer to the Super Mario Run release this holiday season.",

      "text": "World autosport doyen reported to favor Chinese takeover Mooted offer from Apple has so far failed to materialize Share on Facebook \nMotoring-racing patriarch Ron Dennis stood down as chief executive officer and chairman of McLaren Technology Group, saying rival investors had forced him out of the Formula 1 team turned supercar maker. \nDennis, reported to be leading a plan to sell MTG to a Chinese group for 1.65 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), said Tuesday he had quit McLaren’s management after 35 years as its “creative force” amid opposition to him from TAG Group Ltd. and the kingdom of Bahrain’s investment arm, which own 75 percent of the group’s stock. Ron Dennis Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg \nDennis, who has a 25 percent holding in MTG, said in a statement he reached his decision after the two shareholders placed him on enforced leave. The Briton, 69, added that he’ll honor commitments to the Woking, England-based group before founding a technology-investment fund of his own later in 2017. \nTAG and Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co. had acted “despite the strong warnings from the rest of the management team about the potential consequences of their actions on the business,” Dennis said. He added that the grounds for his suspension were “entirely spurious” and that neither investor shared his “vision for McLaren and its true growth potential.” \nSky TV said Friday that Dennis had presented details of a proposed Chinese takeover to fellow shareholders, provoking an attempt to oust him. The offer might involve an asset manager and funding from private equity, Sky said, without revealing where it got the information. Apple Link \nDennis, who didn’t mention the report in his statement, said he’ll continue to use his boardroom seats at MTG and McLaren Automotive Ltd., as the supercar arm is known, to protect the interests of the business and its 3,500 staff. \nAn anticipated investment in McLaren by Apple Inc. has so far failed to materialize. The U.S. company, eager for a new hit to replace the iPhone, has hundreds of engineers working on car design and while McLaren is a niche manufacturer with road cars priced from $200,000, it would deliver brand strength, advanced engineering and a portfolio of patents, analysts have said. \nMTG’s McLaren Racing ranks behind only Ferrari NV by the number of Formula 1 driver’s championships won, having secured 20, 17 of them with Dennis as team principal. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE ",

      "text": "Apple Saves the Peach Emoji That Looks Like a Butt Oh phew. Twitter \nEarlier this month, we collectively lost it when we found out that the new peach emoji no longer looked like a butt, and instead just like a boring old peach . Well, the emoji gods (or Apple) must have been listening, because Apple has saved the butt-like peach emoji, TechCrunch reports. \nIn the iOS 10.2 beta 3, the peach emoji returns to its original shape, and looks even more like a gluteus maximus than the old one did. Clearly, someone at Apple had strong feelings about it. Although emoji look different depending on user interface (Samsung, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft each have their own set) Apple seems to be moving away from cartoonish, kitschy images, and embracing a more realistic look for its latest set of emojis. Many of the old ones are still intact, except now they're basically three-dimensional. Social media users argued that the peach emoji lost its personality , and some emoji lovers even created a shrine to the deceased peach at EmojiCon last week in California. \nBut now, the peach emoji has more personality than ever. Without further ado, here's what the newest version of the peach emoji looks like:",

      "text": "Nov 15 - Books by Apple Basically, Apple is releasing a book tomorrow that literally contains 450 images of apple products through the years. The small book will cost $199 and the large one starts at $299, no joke. The book is titled \"Designed by Apple in California.\" Here is a foreword from the book\"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\"",

      "text": "Jony Ive speaks on means and methods of 'Designed by Apple in California' book By Tuesday, November 15, 2016, 01:04 pm PT (04:04 pm ET) In an interview about the new \"Designed by Apple in California\" coffee-table book, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive speaks about how the title was composed, documentation of the processes used to build the products in the book, and Apple's history. Early iPod in the cockpit of Space Shuttle OV-105 Endeavour , as seen in \"Designed by Apple in California\" \"Because we've been so consumed by our current and future work we came to realize we didn't have a catalogue of the physical products,\" Said Ive to Wallpaper . \"So about eight years ago we felt an obligation to address this and build an objective archive.\" Ive confesses that many of the products in \"Designed by Apple in California\" didn't come from the Apple archives, but had to be purchased from collectors and other sellers, as preservation is \"not an area that we really invested much time or energy in\" until now. Looking back complicates the present In the course of production, the team, including Ive, realized that the only way to do the project the way they wanted to was to treat the entire project like it was a piece of hardware that they were working on. \"There were a few things we needed to do to accurately and objectively portray these products. Of course, many of these products are white, so the off-the-shelf printing processes really didn't do an adequate job in describing the color and surface of those products,\" said Ive. \"Unsurprisingly we ended up developing custom forms of paper and custom inks.\" Over the course of development, photography improved. Near the end of production, photographer Andrew Zuckerman reshot every single product, to keep \"that perfect consistency\" through the entire book. Why now? \"We asked ourselves, 'What is the value of a book like this, when most people know these objects so intimately already?\" asked Ive. \"First, to see the objects out of their functional context. Next, to see them in a context of the subsequent products and hopefully how we have learned as a team how technology shifts, moves and evolves.\" \"The other reason was to do with the fact that many people don't really have much of a sense of how their manufactured environment came to be.\" explained Ive. \"One of the things we wanted to do was try and explain as clearly as we can - through photography - how you transform a raw material into a product that you recognize and hopefully use as a daily tool.\" Ive noted that the book is ending up in the hands of \"all the major design colleges in the world.\" Being explicit in the processes used in the construction of the Apple aesthetic is key to Ive and team as an \"educational resource\" for future designers. \"Designed by Apple in California\" will be available beginning Wednesday, November 16 in select Apple retail stores or online, in small (10.20\" x 12.75\") for $199 and large (13\" x 16.25\") for $299.

      "text": "Apple set up hopes for a target-busting holiday quarter this year, despite drops in iPhone unit sales. The record to beat? 75 million iPhone buys . A money target? Gross revenue of at least $76 billion. If the iPhone 7 and dual-camera-wielding iPhone 7 Plus weren’t enough for a win , the company could hedge on its refreshed MacBook Pro line .\nAnd, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo, it looks as if Infinite Loop will be leaning a bit more on those new laptops after all. Kuo believes that demand has “peaked” for the new iPhone and supplier shipments could fall between 5 and 15 percent over the this and next month.\nWhy? Well, signs of slowed demand have shown in the iPhone 7 “due to a lack of spec surprises” while shipping delays for the iPhone 7 Plus — amazingly still between three and four weeks in its second month of sales — have started to shrink, bit by bit. Apple’s weakened inventory filling prowess has not helped the company in this respect.\nIf the numbers don’t pull through for the Cupertino-based tech giant, perhaps some real concerns will finally be raised by financial analysts come the end of January, when earnings will be announced. Then again, the Street does have the predictive tendency to be as wrong as it can be right.\nThe post KGI: iPhone 7 may splat on demand after all appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

Enlarge Image Photo by Apple \nApple is 40. \nIt's time for museums around the world to offer retrospectives. It's time for Apple's design principles to be taught in the universities of the world. \nHere, then, is another step in the deification of the Apple brand. The company on Tuesday released a coffee-table book. \nIt's called \" Designed By Apple In California .\" It's full of sumptuous pictures of its meticulously crafted products of the last 20 years. \nEverything's shot with only perfection in mind. Each product flaunts its best angle. And of course, every page has a glorious white background. Even the cover is a pure white. \nSome might find the price a little less pure. It's $300. You could see that as a bargain. It's roughly 67 cents per picture. \nIf you want to drive a better (but smaller) bargain, there's a mini version of the book for a mere $199. \nYou might still want to whisper to yourself in Jony Ive tones about the care that's gone into this book's design. \nApple's blurb offers that the book is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" More Technically Incorrect",

      "text": "Some Apple fans have held off from upgrading to the iPhone 7 because of rumors that next year’s model will include more significant improvements, particularly to the screens.\nBut a new analyst report casts some doubt on the screen rumors. Only a premium version of the iPhone Plus model will get a much sharper display by replacing current LED technology with higher contrast OLED, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report on Tuesday . Next year’s standard iPhone Plus and the smaller screened regular iPhone will stick with TFT-LCD display technology, the analyst said.\nApple aapl has improved the iPhone’s screen somewhat in recent years by increasing the range of colors it can show, making photos appear more lifelike for example. But the iPhone’s screen resolution of 750 pixels by 1334 pixels has not changed in the past three models. Meanwhile, competitors like Samsung have been adding more pixels and using OLED to create sharper on-screen images, a far more noticeable improvement than Apple’s color range improvement.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nAnalysts have said they expect that a higher proportion of iPhone owners will be interested in upgrading next year, when the device is likely to get the more significant make over. The iPhone 7 had nearly the same exterior as the prior iPhone 6S and the two year old iPhone 6, except for the elimination of the earphone jack and the addition of a two-lens camera on the Plus version.\nFortune asked Apple for comment on Kuo’s report and will update this story if a reply is received.\nAlthough many rumors about the upcoming iPhone are likely off base, Kuo has a long track record of mostly accurate predictions. Thanks to close ties to some of Apple’s Asian suppliers, Kuo has correctly predicted many iPhone developments, including the creation of the 4-inch iPhone SE and the addition of a new shiny black color option for this year’s iPhone. Still, Apple could make design changes before the new iPhones are expected to hit the market next fall.\nKuo has previously written that next year’s iPhone would move away from the aluminum body of recent years in favor of stainless steel frame wrapped in glass. The phone may also have a display that runs from edge to edge, without a bezel, like some Samsung Galaxy models.",

      "text": " Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were higher in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, despite being down in the past week on the election of Donald Trump last Tuesday. Investors are worried about whether Trump's anti-trade plans will come to fruition and what effect they will have on Apple.\nIf the U.S. puts sanctions or tariffs on China, then the U.S. will get hit back, Bloomberg News' Cory Johnson said on \"Bloomberg Markets: America\" on Tuesday afternoon. He was citing an editorial titled \"Will Trump start a trade war against China?\" from the Global Times over the weekend.\n\"China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,\" the editorial board wrote. \"A batch of Boeing (BA) orders will be replaced by Airbus . U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\"\n\"You can already see the saber rattling there,\" Johnson noted. Going forward, the focus will move toward companies that are \"iconically American\" and Apple \"certainly fits into that category.\"\nSince Apple could possibly experience setbacks from Trump's trade policies, the \"selloff we've seen in the last few days isn't as stupid as some of the stupid things that Wall Street does,\" he claimed.\n(Apple is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of his holding with a free trial here. )\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.",

      "text": "(Reuters) - The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday.\nThe reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 percent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said.\n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the association said in a statement on its website.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday.\nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire.\n(Reporting by Jess Macy Yu and Sijia Jiang; Editing by Greg Mahlich)",

Both of the 5.5-inch versions will pack a dual camera like on the iPhone 7 Plus. \nKuo added that a 4.7-inch model of the new iPhone will also be launched by Apple, though it will only pack an LCD display and single camera. \nApple has been widely speculated to launch a redesigned iPhone in 2017 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the platform. The rumor mill has suggested a glass back, upgraded OLED display, and wireless charging for the new models. \nThe larger versions are expected to be more popular among customers next fall, according to Kuo, saying 65 and 75 percent of new iPhones will boast dual-camera displays. \nKuo predicted in April the number of iPhones made with aluminum bodies will fall to 40 percent following the launch of the 2017 iPhone. \nGiven the iPhone 7 just launched in September, it's too early to tell exactly what Apple will launch. Notably, Kuo has pegged several previous Apple launches correctly , but we always encourage rumors to be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism.",

      "text": "Perhaps the Apple Watch was merely the beginning of Apple's foray into the ever evolving world of wearables. Citing sources purportedly familiar with Apple's plans, Bloomberg reports that Apple is currently exploring the idea of releasing digital glasses similar, in a broad sense, to what Google released just a few years ago.\nDON'T MISS: The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2\nThe smart glasses Apple is said to be developing will reportedly lean heavily on augmented reality and will present information to wearers by relaying information gleaned from a user's iPhone. Still in the very early stages of development, Apple has already ordered \"small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing.\"\nIf development proceeds swimmingly, the report claims that we could see a pair of smart glasses from Apple on store shelves as early as 2018.\nThe glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016.\nApple's interest in smart glasses comes at an interesting time. While Google Glass wearers were ridiculed if not downright shunned, the recent release of Snapchat's Spectacles signals that the world may be more welcoming of connected glasses than they were when Google first entered the fray a few years ago.\nIt's also worth noting that Tim Cook has been unusually vocal with regards to hyping up augmented reality related technologies, even going so far as to say that Apple is \"high on augmented reality for the long run.\" For a company that's as notoriously tight-lipped as Apple, Cook's remarks are rather telling.\nAdding some more credence to Bloomberg's report, you might recall that reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo just one month ago said that Apple will release an AR related device in just one to two years. What's more, Kuo added that Apple's technology could very well be so sophisticated as to leapfrog all rival products by three to five years.\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Nintendo Switch price might been leaked early by Toys R Us See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple’s new $300 coffee table book contains 450 product photos, little else Apple’s new $300 coffee table book contains 450 product photos, little else By Joel Hruska on November 15, 2016 at 4:04 pm Comment \nWhether you love Apple or hate it, there’s no denying the company’s formidable influence on product design. Over the last 39 years, a number of books have focused on various Apple products and the inspirations behind them, from the influence of 1960s hardware on the iPod, Mac Pro, and iMac, to Steve Jobs’ influence over various aspects of the original Macintosh, as well as Apple’s other products. Apple products fascinate people in a way that hardware from Dell or HP rarely does, even though this isn’t always fair to the designers at the other firms. There’s a wealth of material for Apple to draw from, and the company’s new $300 coffee table book, Designed by Apple in California, ought to be a repository for anecdotes, explanations, and ideas. \nInstead, it’s basically “Google Image Search, Apple Hardware Edition.” \nApple, as you might expect, sees it rather differently. According to the company, this book chronicles 20 years of Apple product design “expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products.” \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words, so here are some examples of what Ives is talking about: \nNo discussion, explanation, description, or history. No trade-off analysis or cost comparison. No information on why the designers chose those materials, or deliberately echoed a previous product, or what particularly worked (or particularly didn’t ) for any piece of hardware. This is even more frustrating when you consider products like the G4 Cube, which is presented without explanation or consideration. If you aren’t already familiar with the history of Apple, you’re stuck with a picture of a weird-looking machine in a fat plastic housing. There’s no explanation of what Jobs was trying to accomplish, what the Cube’s strengths or weaknesses were, or why the system ultimately failed in the marketplace. \nImages can convey vital information, but images alone don’t tell the story of a product. A picture of an iPhone doesn’t tell me anything about what made the first iPhone revolutionary (its touch-first interface, capacitive touchscreen, and large display). Subsequent photos of iPhones in isolation, assuming the book contains them, don’t tell me anything about how the devices evolved or why. What lessons did Apple learn? Where did it succeed, where was it behind the curve? \nBack in 2012, a number of sites wrote stories about how the design of various Braun products in the 1960s influenced Apple’s lead designer, Jony Ive. Compare the image below with the shots above: \nEven this comparison of a classic iPod to the Braun T3 radio, released in 1958, tells a much better story than anything we see in Apple’s $300 self-absorbed paean. Juxtaposing the two products shows how elements of one design were incorporated into hardware built over 40 years later. A simple caption “Braun’s T3 radio, released in 1958, inspired the design of Apple’s iconic classic iPod” would put the design in at least a little context. It’s still complete fluff, but at least it’s fluff with a starting point for additional research. \nDespite Ive’s claims and Apple’s PR verbiage, this isn’t actually a book intended to teach anyone anything. If this kind of self-absorbed myopia is Apple’s new modus operandi then it’s time for the company’s competitors to start gearing up in earnest. In the past few months, we’ve seen Apple dongle-ize its products , turn owning a 15-inch laptop into a $2,000+ luxury, continue to ignore its desktop hardware, strip features from its laptops that its professional users relied upon, remove the most useful and ubiquitous product jack on the market, and call its foray into $160 plastic earrings “ courageous .” Now, the company thinks you should pay $200 (for the small version) to $300 for the privilege of printing out some images and a few cents worth of glue and leather.

      "text": "Flip \nApple is working on several new products, and the latest one is a wearable device similar to Google Glass, reports Bloomberg . The media outlet adds that the company is still exploring the smart glasses market. Hence, it cannot be said with surety when it will materialize into a finished product. No confirmed details yet \nThe earliest Apple can reveal the product is 2018, according to Bloomberg. However, there are still chances that it will take much longer for the project to be completed, or it might completely change its direction like it did with its automotive ambitions. There have long been rumors of Apple working on a secret consumer product for which it has been collecting AR talent . \nApple CEO Tim Cook has been questioned several times about AR, and every time, he said there is a lot of potential in the technology compared to its virtual reality counterpart, thus hinting at Apple’s plans to enter the space, notes The Verge. \nIn the July conference call with analysts, Cook said, “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nThen in October, Cook suggested that the company has minimal chances of leveraging VR in a mass-consumer product. Apple already in talks with suppliers \nApple was continuously hiring experts in both promising fields — AR and VR — as of September. This serves as another hint at the fact that it is probably developing products in both categories. Apple has already secured patents for things like street view in mapping apps, and for smart glasses that use full-fledged virtual reality. \nBloomberg said that to secure components such as near-eye displays, the iPhone maker has already spoken to some potential suppliers. Over the last three years, Apple has made some major startup acquisitions such as Primesense, which had AR at its focus; Metaio, which focuses on 3D mapping; and Flyby, which specializes in computer vision. \nIt appears that Apple aims to develop a pair of glasses that will be capable of wirelessly connecting with an iPhone and overlaying information on the wearer’s field of vision. As of now, the challenge lying ahead of Apple is to fit all the technology into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear.",

      "text": "Apple EarPods get the teardown treatment \nWhen Apple killed the headphone jack on the latest iPhone, we were assured it would be okay, and Apple was really just being “courageous.” Not only was there an adapter in the box, but Apple was releasing the AirPod wireless earbuds. For a mere $159, you’d never have to worry about wires again. However, they still haven’t been released. \nApple originally said the AirPods would ship in late October. When that vague time frame came and went , people started asking questions. At the time, Apple simply said it only releases products when they’re ready. The AirPods, apparently, were not ready. Here we are several weeks later, and there’s still no sign of the AirPods. You can’t even pre-order them, and they don’t appear on Apple’s holiday shopping guide. \nThe AirPods aren’t the first completely wireless earbuds—they don’t even have a wire between the left and right bud. Products like Earin and Bragi Dash have hit the market, but the reviews have been fairly awful with complaints of poor connectivity and battery life. Apple’s AirPods are even smaller than many of those similar products, so there are probably engineering hurdles still to overcome. Releasing a buggy product would just give people more reason to complain about the lack of a headphone jack on the iPhone 7. \nApple’s AirPods are designed to use Bluetooth technology with some extra Apple features overlaid on it. They work with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch running iOS 10, the Apple Watch on watchOS 3, and Macs running Sierra. Recent reports point to December as the beginning of production, indicating the device will begin shipping in early 2017. Apple has refused to offer a new release time frame. You’ll just have to make do with conventional Bluetooth earbuds… or get a phone with a headphone jack. Share",

      "text": "Apple Pay, the Touch ID-based transaction service used on iPhones and Macs alike, is no longer limited to the enabling of buying more stuff.\nNonprofit organizations such as (RED), St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and UNICEF can now accept charitable donations via its easy-to-use payment method. \nThe company announced the change in a blog post where it promoted the ease of using Apple Pay. Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, elaborated, noting \"Websites and apps tell us they see twice as many people actually completing a purchase with Apple Pay than with other payment methods,\" and that the team at Apple thinks \"offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.”\nMORE: 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try \nPart of why such an uptick could occur is that donating by Apple Pay removes all of the billing and contact forms you normally fill out. You can still opt to get messages from these organizations, as the message next to an already-checked-off box above the Apple Pay button on the St. Jude site reads \"I would like to receive or continue to receive emails from St. Jude.\"\nThe list of charities accepting Apple Pay includes the American Red Cross, charity: water, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Feeding America, Save the Children, and the WWF (World Wildlife Fund). The list of charities that will soon support Apple Pay features the American Cancer Society, PBS and its local stations and United Way.\nTo donate to a charity via Apple Pay, follow these instructions. Load the website of the charity in Safari on iOS or macOS . Open the donation page and select an amount . Pick Apple Pay as your payment method. Select Donate with Apple Pay Use the Touch ID sensor on your iPhone or MacBook Pro to complete the donation.

      "text": "Apple Asked to Investigate \"Widespread\" iPhone Bug Shutting Down Chinese Phones GO Consumer organization calls for investigation from Apple Nov 15, 2016 19:11 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ As if being in the middle of the dispute between China and the United States over import tariffs proposed by Donald Trump wasn’t enough, Apple is now forced to investigate a number of iPhones in China that are said to be suffering from a bug shutting them down at random times. The so-called China Consumer Association (CCA) has posted an announcement on its website to inform that it requested Apple to look into reports of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s models that might be impacted by a bug which appears to be shutting them down even with 50 percent battery left. According to an approximate Google Translate version of the announcement , the consumer organization has received reports from a big number of iPhone buyers, pointing out that this could be a widespread issue impacting models sold in the country. iPhones shutting down all of a sudden Only the iPhone 6 and the 6s seem to be suffering this bug, which according to the same organization, causes the devices to shut down all of a sudden even though there’s still plenty of battery power left. There are also reports of iPhones going dark when the temperature drops significantly, and CCA says that users were unable to turn their devices on after seeing the bug. “Given that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series of mobile phones have a considerable number of customers in China, and the same number reported the problems, China Consumers Association has issued a query to Apple to investigate the abnormal automatic shutdown,” the group explains, saying that it’s trying to protect the “interests of consumers.” Apple hasn’t yet issued a statement on this, and it’s not yet known why these iPhones shut down all of a sudden, but the company clearly has no other option than to investigate these reports. China is becoming a pretty hostile market for Apple, but Cupertino needs to comply with all requirements given that it’s generating substantial iPhone sales, so expect the company to do everything that’s possible to fix these bricked phones.",

      "text": "Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster GO Phil Schiller says Apple actually considered a touch Mac Nov 15, 2016 13:34 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ While Microsoft is pushing hard for touchscreens and devices that can be used with a pen, Apple sticks with a more traditional input method, going for laptops and desktops that do not feature the technology that its Redmond rival seems to love so much these days. Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller revealed in a recent interview that his company actually looked at the possibility of bringing a touchscreen on its devices, but decided to stick with the old approach that makes more sense for its users. What’s more, he described having touch on a desktop “a disaster,” pointing out that users of such devices expect to work with a mouse and keyboard and not to mix input methods with touch. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd. You can’t optimize for both. It’s the lowest common denominator thinking,” he said. Microsoft thinks otherwise Microsoft’s Surface Studio is fully based on this approach and has a 28-inch screen that also supports touch and which can be used on the desktop with a mouse and keyboard, touch, pen, or Surface Dial. But as far as Apple is concerned, this isn’t the right way to go because customers still love the mouse and keyboard, as it helps them be productive all the time at the desk. Schiller claims that Apple considered implementing touch in MacBooks and iMacs several times in the last few years, but every time, the company just decided to go with its instinct and stay away from this technology. “Our instincts were that it didn't, but, what the heck, we could be wrong - so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years. Our instincts were correct,” he pointed out. Microsoft, on the other hand, isn’t necessarily looking to launch products that rely on the traditional input methods, but to invent new categories, and this is exactly what the Surface Pro, the Surface Book, and the Surface Studio achieved. Microsoft has until now managed to achieve its goal, and with Apple going in a completely different direction, it’ll be interesting to see which company achieves better sales.",

The images were captured by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, according to Apple , and the book is dedicated to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. \nIn an excerpt from the book's foreword, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive wrote: \"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\" \nContinue reading… ",

      "text": "Photo via emojipedia The natural order of emoji has been restored. \nEarlier this month, Apple disappointed iPhone users by releasing a new peach emoji that didn’t look unmistakably like a butt. The scandalous de-assifying of the peach caused a bit of a backlash, though, and Apple has decided to restore it to its former anatomical glory in a future iOS update. \nEmoji sexters and spicy tweeters, your complaints have been heard. The latest beta version of iOS, 10.2 beta 3, dropped Tuesday with a re-revised peach that looks even more butt-like than the original. Apple Apple sometimes makes a move toward the future, knowing that its current customers will be temporarily outraged. Removing disc drives and nixing the headphone jack are calculated risks that people will soon get over. \nWith the peach, though, the company seems to have tacitly acknowledged a mistake. Perhaps Apple thought the peach was just a fruit, then discovered that no one uses it that way. To remove the peach-as-butt is to eliminate 90 percent of the meaning of that emoji. It’s nice to see Apple had the good sense to fix it.",

      "text": "Apple insider says demand is dwindling because the iPhone 7 is boring Chris Smith Pin it Share Have we reached peak iPhone 7 already? Apple kicked off iPhone 7 sales almost two months ago and saw incredible demand in spite of critics, who said the device was a “boring” update. Apple sold out of initial stock rather quickly and struggled to meet demand both in the US and in the numerous other markets where the phone was released. But an Apple insider with a very good track record when reporting on Apple’s every move now claims that we’re already past peak iPhone 7, and sales will now begin to decline. DON’T   KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note to investors that demand for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has peaked, and Apple’s suppliers will decrease their iPhone shipments by as 5% to 15% in November and December. Is the new iPhone boring after all? “As the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, which accounts for a higher share of iPhone shipments, is in stock in the main global markets, we believe overall iPhone shipments have peaked,” Kuo said in the note seen by MacRumors . “We think iPhone shipment forecasts will be revised down due to: (1) lower-than-expected demand due to a lack of spec surprises in the 4.7-inch iPhone 7; and (2) shorter times for delivering online orders of 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, which implies slowing demand. We note that the out-of-stock phenomenon also results from fixed capacity, and is not only due to robust demand.” Kuo also said that the out-of-stock phenomenon that Apple experienced after the launch of the iPhone 7 can be explained by limited supply rather than robust demand. The analyst expects Apple sell fewer iPhones on-year in the fist quarter of 2017 due to lower-than-expected demand and increased competition in China. Early reports indicated that Apple’s iPhone 7 launch may be comparable to the iPhone 6s' launch last year. Apple, however, did not confirm these estimates, as it stopped announcing iPhone launch numbers. A different report a few days ago indicated that Android has been making gains at the expense of the iPhone. At the same time, however, there are more documented Android switchers than ever .

      "text": "by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nOnce upon a time you could buy a laptop and be fairly certain that if you needed more RAM or storage in the future, you could just buy some new memory or a bigger (or faster) hard drive or solid state drive. It’s also often cheaper to buy your own than to pay for the higher-specced models. \nThese days, a lot of PC makers have opted to solder the memory and/or storage to the motherboard, ostensibly to save space in laptops that are getting thinner and thinner. \nThe latest example? Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptops. fs454 \nApple offers two versions of the 2016 MacBook Pro. There are high-end models with the Touch Bar above the number keys, and there are lower-priced models with Fn keys in that space. \nNow that both models have started shipping, reviews are starting to come in … and so are teardowns. \nBoth models have RAM that’s soldered to the main board. So if you want more than 8GB of memory, you’d best pay for it up front. There’s no way to upgrade. \nThe MacBook Pro with Fn keys does have a removable solid state drive … but it’s a non-standard size, which means that right now there’s no place to buy a replacement or upgrade. iFixit iFixit iFixit \nStill, it should make it relatively easy to repair a device with bad storage, and it does open the possibility of third-party upgrades in the future. \nWhat if you opt for the more expensive MacBook Pro with Touch Bar though? No dice. the SSD is soldered to the motherboard . fs454 \nThe 2016 MacBook Pro laptops are hardly the first Apple computers that are difficult to upgrade. The 2015 MacBook also has soldered RAM and storage, and the MacBook Air has had soldered RAM since it first launched in 2010. \nBut the inability to upgrade the latest MacBook Pro may be yet another reason some people will wonder whether the company really should have put the Pro name on its latest laptops, even if early reviews suggest they do offer strong performance.",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 9 minutes ago with 1 comment \nApple today released a number of betas to both developers and Public Beta testers. Those on the Public Beta program got new iOS 10.2 and macOS 10.12.2 Sierra builds today, while developers got watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3, as well as a new version of Safari 10.0.2 (which is bundled with the current macOS build) for older versions of OS X. \niOS 10.2 and macOS 10.12.2 Developer Beta 3 were released yesterday , alongside a new tvOS 10.1 build which contained the new TV app. There's not a lot that's new in either one, but you'll find that the new TV app should replace Videos entirely, the Feedback app has returned, and Apple has refined some of the new emojis that it introduced. \nAs for watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3, there's nothing new of note in the build. As the version number of the update indicates, there are no new front-facing features coming with 3.1.1. Of course, there is no Public Beta for watchOS (or tvOS), so if you're not a developer, you'll have to wait until December to get it. Tags",

From Apple: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/11/designed-by-apple-in-california-chronicles-20-years-of-apple-design.html Quote: Cupertino, California — Apple today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. “Designed by Apple in California,” which covers products from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. ... “Designed by Apple in California” — Small Starts at $199 (US) in small (10.20” x 12.75”) Available beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, November 16, exclusively from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and select Apple Stores.1 Available at the following US retail locations: Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue in Chicago; Apple Lincoln Road in Miami; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino. The book is on display at the Apple Stores where it is sold. “Designed by Apple in California” — Large Starts at $299 (US) in large (13” x 16.25”) Available beginning tomorrow, Wednesday, November 16, exclusively from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and select Apple Stores.1 Available at the following US retail locations: Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue in Chicago; Apple Lincoln Road in Miami; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino. The book is on display at the Apple Stores where it is sold. Ars Techinca: http://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/11/apples-latest-product-is-a-300-picture-book-of-its-hardware-designs/?comments=1 Quote: Move over, MacBook Pro—there's a new Apple book in town. It's called Designed by Apple in California, and it's a coffee table book filled with pictures of Apple's hardware. The book, like so many other Apple products, is available in two sizes: a 10.20\" by 12.75\" \"Small\" version that sells for $199 and a 13\" by 16.25\" \"Large\" version that costs $300. That's insanely priced. More like $30 for the large and $20 for the small. Edit: A few other sites https://www.extremetech.com/computing/239498-apples-new-300-coffee-table-book-contains-450-product-photos-little-else 250 pounds in the UK: http://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/technology/2016/11/apple-selling-book-250-and-yes-it-just-book On the lighter side of things, this is very courageous of Apple - after all it doesn't come with any headphone jacks. It's just a book. I'm sure that this may be the cheapest Macbook I have seen from Apple. Lol. Edited by CrazyElf - Today at 2:23 pm",

Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman it is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, Apple says The book is available in two sizes: small, starting at $199, and large starting at $299. \n… \nI fucking LOVE Apple. So much. I mean there is cocky, there is very cocky, and then there is Apple Cocky. They’ve been doing it for years so it really never comes as a surprise – but if you thought launching a new phone that didn’t even have a fucking headphone jack was the apex, you haven’t seen anything yet. A $299 book that is nothing but pictures of all of their products? And you know the thing is going to sell like fucking crazy too. Ain’t no fanboy like an Apple fanboy. \nNeed this book. Need it on my desk next to my Macbook Pro and my Magic Mouse and my Magic Keyboard and my iPhone and my Apple Watch and my iPad. Complete the collection. \nAlso can someone please tell me why we keep “paying tribute” to Steve Jobs when everybody with a brain and a set of eyes knows he is alive and well south of the border somewhere?

      "text": " 40PM from the knowledge-is-power dept. Apple has a reputation for releasing \"revolutionary\" products that carry higher price tags than competing products. Today, the company hasn't made that reputation any better as it has released a \"$299 coffee table book\" that contains 450 photographs of Apple products . The Verge reports: It's a hardcover edition, bound in linen, and is available in two sizes: $199 for a smaller 10.20\" x 12.75\" version, and $299 for a larger 13\" x 16.25\" edition. The book is simply titled Designed by Apple in California -- a name that somehow manages to be both humble and incredibly pretentious at the same time. The photos inside are all new images shot by Andrew Zuckerman, and will show off 20 years of Apple design \"in a deliberately spare style.\" In a press statement , chief designer Jony Ive described the book as \"a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,\" and hoped that it would serve as a \"resource for students of all design disciplines.\" The book is published by Apple itself, and is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. It is, undeniably, an act of corporate vanity publishing on an impressive scale, but it's one Apple deserves to get away with more than pretty much any other tech company. No one denies that when it comes to industrial design, Apple earns the praise it gets. That aside, though, the book's publication does show a certain amount of self-interest, navel-gazing, and even arrogance from Apple -- themes that were also present in September's unveiling of the new MacBook Pros. It's all very well to feel proud of the successes of the past, but we'll be interested to see if the company can justify releasing another such book 20 years from now.",

      "title": "These Tech Companies Cover Egg-Freezing And IVF",
      "text": "damircudic / Getty Images ID: 9983226 \nWhen a doctor told an Apple employee and his wife that in vitro fertilization was their only shot at a second child, they worried whether the procedure would work. But they didn’t worry about paying for it out of pocket, as most people in the United States would. \nBecause of the husband’s health insurance, Apple covered their IVF costs. Their son was born last year. “It feels like the company cares about their people, that they realize this is something that can be financially hard and emotionally hard, and it offers you options,” said the 34-year-old woman, who requested to not be identified. \nTwo years ago, Apple and Facebook made headlines when they started to foot at least of part of the bill for services like IVF and egg-freezing in an effort to recruit and retain talented employees, particularly women. And overall, the tech industry pours more money into fertility benefits than any other industry, including finance, fashion, and pharmaceuticals, according to a poll released Tuesday by FertilityIQ , a startup that collects patient feedback about fertility clinics. Google, Intel, Spotify, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and the e-commerce site Wayfair all also offer fertility benefits. \nBased on a survey of about 1,000 users, FertilityIQ collected data about how much dozens of major companies are willing to spend on fertility benefits — information that most of the companies do not publicly advertise. Coverage varies: Google and Facebook, for example, require employees to go to certain clinics, while other companies lack such restrictions, according to FertilityIQ. \nThese services aren’t cheap. Egg-freezing costs about $10,000, storage is $500 to $1,000 a year, and one IVF round goes for around $15,000. \n“We’ve heard for so long and for forever that it’s all out-of-pocket and that companies never pay for it,” Jake Anderson-Bialis, FertilityIQ’s cofounder, told BuzzFeed News in reference to fertility benefits. He added, “That’s what’s extraordinary about the tech companies, the extent to which they’ll totally cover you. It’s uncommon.” Massonstock / Getty Images ID: 9983231 \nCritics see egg-freezing subsidies as a ploy to chain female employees to their desks. “Rather than saying, ‘have your children in your own time and we’ll support you with well-paid parental leave and subsidised childcare, they’re saying, ‘work really hard through your most fertile years and then when you may not be able to have kids anymore, you can give it a shot with the eggs we froze for you as a perk,’” Harriet Minter wrote in The Guardian in October 2014, when news broke of Apple and Facebook’s subsidies. \nBut proponents say these benefits are a good thing. More women in the United States in general are having children later in life , partly because they’re busy with school or careers, or haven’t found their ideal partner. \n“Anything that gives women, and ultimately women and their partners, more options and more choice is good,” said Valerie Baker, chief of the reproductive endocrinology and infertility division at Stanford University School of Medicine, where she’s seen an uptick in patients affiliated with tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Cisco. Many patients don’t put off starting families because they’re overworked, but more often because they aren’t in an ideal relationship. “Maybe they just separated from a relationship that was longer standing, maybe it’s that they just haven’t met a person that they want to be with long-term, or a relationship’s very new,” Baker said. \nPaula Amato, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University, said, “I don’t think providing this sort of coverage gives companies a pass so they don’t have to think about providing work-life balance for women. But I think the reality is, that doesn’t exist right now. Why deprive women of that option if it’s available?” \nAfter a woman’s 20s, which are her best reproductive years, her fertility declines in her 30s. Most women are unable to have a successful pregnancy by their mid-40s. But egg-freezing does not guarantee a family later in life. While frozen eggs lead to live births after IVF nearly half the time, the odds of a live birth are higher for IVF using fresh eggs, according to a 2015 study . Joe Raedle / Getty Images ID: 9983134 \nAnd aside from working for companies that volunteer to pick up the tab, people who want fertility services have limited financial help. Although some insurers may cover egg-freezing for patients with diagnosed infertility, virtually none cover it for non-medical reasons. Wounded veterans can receive IVF coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs, and 15 states mandate some form of infertility insurance coverage, but otherwise, few health plans cover IVF. \nNor does the Affordable Care Act mandate coverage for infertility treatment. That’s highly unlikely to change under President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he will repeal some or all of the law. \n“I don’t think that coverage is going to come from the ACA,” said Judith Daar, interim dean of Whittier Law School and a clinical professor of medicine at UC Irvine. “Instead, we may be looking to this model this study talks about — the provision of care by private companies who view it as a way to compete in the marketplace for certain types of employees.” \nIntel, for example, started covering IVF, artificial insemination, and other treatments in 2007. In October 2015, it announced that it would increase coverage for fertility medical services (from $10,000 to $40,000) and medication expenses (from $5,000 to $20,000). The company also made coverage available to all employees, not just those with diagnosed infertility, and began covering the costs of freezing and storing eggs, embryos, sperm, and cord blood. On top of fertility benefits, Intel recently started reimbursing adoption costs (up to $15,000 per child) and offering eight weeks of paid “bonding” leave for new parents, both men and women, in addition to as many as 26 weeks of maternity leave. \n“You also have to make sure you’re creating a really supportive work environment where everybody, especially working parents, can really thrive.” ID: 9983118 \n“We talk about setting goals for retention and hiring and pay parity and promotion, and all those things are really important,” Danielle Brown, Intel’s chief diversity and inclusion officer and vice president of human resources, told BuzzFeed News. “But you also have to make sure you’re creating a really supportive work environment where everybody, especially working parents, can really thrive.” \nIn 2015 and so far in 2016, female employees stayed at Intel at higher rates than male employees, Brown noted. It is a reversal of a decade-long trend, she said, although it’s unclear whether the expanded fertility benefits were the direct cause. \nFertilityIQ ranked Intel as one of the most generous tech companies, second only to Spotify, which offers unlimited dollars for fertility treatment. Benefits are also generous at Apple, which covers $20,000 worth of fertility treatments, and Facebook, which covers four IVF cycles. Wayfair covers up to $40,000, according to a spokesperson, who declined to comment further. \nAs far as restrictions go, Google and Facebook limit the fertility clinics where employees can go, according to FertilityIQ. (Daar noted that this requirement may not be unusual if the companies also limit where employees can seek other kinds of medical care.) And while some companies open up their fertility benefits to all employees, others, like Bank of America, require that employees are diagnosed as infertile. That effectively cuts off coverage for women who want to become single mothers and same-sex couples, for example. A spokesperson confirmed the policy, and noted that the bank also reimburses employees up to $8,000 for adopting a child. \nOf the tech companies named in this story and contacted by BuzzFeed News, Intel alone provided an executive to discuss its fertility benefits. Spotify and Amazon did not return requests for comment, and Google, Microsoft, and Wayfair declined to comment. Apple declined to comment beyond a statement from 2014 that said in part, “We continue to expand our benefits for women, with a new extended maternity leave policy, along with cryopreservation and egg storage as part of our extensive support for infertility treatments. … We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.” FertilityIQ cofounder Deborah Anderson-Bialis. Steve Jennings / Getty Images for TechCrunch ID: 9983124 \nLast year, Anderson-Bialis and his wife, Deborah, founded FertilityIQ after they struggled to navigate fertility doctors and clinics while conceiving their child. For this survey, FertilityIQ polled more than 5,000 users, then honed in on about 1,000, most of whom said their workplaces paid for their treatments in the previous 18 months. Then they asked those people, or their companies, to provide details about their coverage. \nHowever, employers were not always willing to talk, so FertilityIQ was not able to confirm all coverage details with them. Sometimes, to figure out a company’s reimbursement policies, the team resorted to contacting the billing departments of clinics where employees sought care. \n“You imagine anyone on this planet wants to be seen as female-friendly, family-embracing — all these things that companies bend over backwards to prove to themselves and others that they are,” said Anderson-Bialis, who says that workplace-covered fertility services saw an uptick beginning around 2013. “There’s probably no benefit that’s more emblematic of that kind of gesture, and yet so few are really comfortable talking about it to anyone outside their own employees.” \nPrivately, he said, they still have concerns such as: “‘If we widely advertise this to everybody, what does that invite? Does that invite people applying for jobs and getting jobs because they know this will be paid for?’ That can cost more than their salary. At a lot of places, it probably does.” \nWhile it’s unclear what kinds of returns on investment companies are seeing, at least some women appreciate that their bosses are picking up the costs. In FertilityIQ’s survey, employees whose companies fully covered their fertility treatments said they were more grateful, more loyal, and inclined to stay longer at their workplaces than they would have been had they not had the option. \n“Maybe you always thought you’d be married with kids by age 30 — but here you are, you’re 31 and single still and you love your job,” said the wife of the Apple employee who gave birth last year. “Now you have the option of, ‘maybe you can freeze your eggs and have a family in the future.’ What an awesome gift, in my opinion.” Stephanie Lee is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nApple’s great purge of App Store apps has well and truly begun. The company announced in September that it would be removing apps that no longer worked as intended or didn’t follow guidelines from the App Store, and that process began in October. \nSo how many apps did the company remove? A massive 47,300. App removals jumped up a hefty 238 percent last month. Around 28 percent of the removals were games, with the next two top categories being entertainment, which accounted for 8.99 percent, and books, which ended up at 8.96 percent. \nMore: Judge orders Amazon to pay back parents after their kids made unauthorized app store purchases \nData about the App Store purge comes from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower , which says that while Apple does routinely get rid of outdated apps from the App Store, it’s now doing so three to four times more than it did on average between the months of January and September. \nWhen Apple first announced the purge, it said that it would send a notice to developers, who would have 30 days to update their apps before they would be removed. While there was clearly a spike in app deletions, it’s unlikely that the purge has finished — we’ll probably see more apps deleted over the next few months, and Apple will most likely keep a close tab on apps going forward to ensure that the App Store is as up to date as it possibly can be. \nWe don’t know exactly how Apple defines apps as “abandoned,” but in a message to developers , it said it would delete apps that haven’t been supported “for a long time.” In other words, it’s totally up to Apple’s discretion when it comes to the apps that are being removed. \nIt’s also important to note that despite the fact that Apple is removing so many apps, the App Store is still growing. Sensor Tower says that the App Store could double in size by 2020, to a robust 5 million apps. Also watch: Apple iPhone 6S Plus vs. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge",

      "text": "Markets Today Apple's Smart Glasses Can Succeed, But It Has to Move Fast to Beat Microsoft and Facebook The failings of Google Glass and the limitations of Microsoft's HoloLens provide an opening for Apple in augmented reality. But the clock's ticking. Eric Jhonsa Nov15,20165:01PMEST \nIf Apple ( AAPL ) ultimately produces smart glasses that prove to be a smash hit, it should send a thank-you card to Alphabet /Google ( GOOGL ) for all its missteps with Google Glass. \nAnd the company might also want to thank Microsoft ( MSFT ) for both showing how an augmented reality (AR) headset can capture imaginations and appeal to developers, and initially focusing on a headset that's only meant to be used indoors. But this assumes that Microsoft won't have enlarged its ambitions by the time Apple's own headset goes on sale. \nBloomberg, which has produced many Apple scoops since hiring the well-connected Mark Gurman away from 9to5 Mac, reported Monday that Apple is thinking about creating smart glasses that would \"connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality.\" \nIt adds Apple has \"ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing,\" and that its glasses would launch in 2018 \"at the earliest.\" Himax ( HIMX ) , which supplied the micro-displays used by Google Glass, rose 2.7% on Tuesday. \nOne big qualifier to Bloomberg's report is that Apple often \"explores\" launching products that never see the light of day. However, the report does fit with one earlier this year from The Financial Times , which said Apple has created \"a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets.\" \nApple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Phil Schiller On Removing Physical Keyboard From Mac Devices \nBack in 2008, Apple’s patent application specified that the sports monitoring system would be controlled by head gestures. However, PhoneArena has stated that the company may have realized how this manner of control would be inappropriate given that people would have to shake their heads left and right to control the device. Thus, Apple decided to come up with a revised version, and this time controls for the monitoring system rely on touch and voice commands. \nIn the illustration provided as part of the document, the earbuds that are featured have wires, so it’s not surprising if one would come up with a conclusion that the monitoring system would be incorporated into the EarPods. But AppleInsider believes this technology could actually be designed for the AirPods, since the wireless headphones already have some features that are detailed in the patent. \nUnfortunately, AppleInsider says the integration of the sports monitoring system into the AirPods would be technically difficult. Also, knowing how Apple is already struggling to manufacture the current AirPods devices, it would be unlikely for the monitoring system to be added into the mix anytime soon.

And it’s 99.9% a fact that an apple a day keeps the doctor away, so we understand each other, right? *wink-wink* As long as we get apple in someway, we’re good! Swedish Apple Pie is a great way to incorporate a sweet treat into your apple conversion of yumminess. It’s crustless, so one step omitted already and it begins with a 9″ Pie Pan, then a layer of 4 cups of chopped, firm apples tossed about with some cinnamon, sugar and cardamom and then another layer of a delicious oat crisp topping baked on top. So it’s somewhere between a pie and an apple crisp. Buttery and delicious, and totally perfect with cardamon and cinnamon infused apples.\"",

      "text": "Apple considering expansion into wearable glasses – report \nWearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality Article   11:13 AM \n(Getty Images) \nApple is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe wearable headset would show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. \nChief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. \nApple, the world's largest technology company, has ordered a small number of near-eye displays for testing but has not obtained enough for production on a larger scale, the report added. \nApple declined to comment. \nThe move would make Apple the latest tech company to venture into wearable glasses. \nAlphabet’s discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year, ending its attempt to popularize the expensive devices with consumers. \nThe device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. \nSnap, an $18 billion company which makes the popular messaging app Snapchat, also launched its own video-camera sunglasses last week.",

      "text": "videos Advertisement Apple iPad Mini 5 or iPad Pro Mini: Will it be launched by Apple in March 2017 event? By Rida Nov 14, 2016 01:43 PM EST Apple iPhone Cancelled Advertisement iPad Pro Mini or iPad Mini 5 is the most awaited Apple devices in this year. But unfortunately, iPad enthusiasts need to wait up to March 2017 as depicted from the recent rumors. Advertisement The recent rumors claimed that Apple's March event is the platform which the new iPad Mini 5 / iPad Pro Mini is expected to launch. Apple's \"Hello Again\" was the most anticipated platform for the launch of iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5. Earlier rumors that were hitting the internet assumed the launch of iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 in the October 2016 event, but no iMacs and iPads were seen in the event. According to Christian Times , the report claims that the iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 is expected to be in March event of Apple in 2017. These predictions are based on the previous launch event that was held in March which released iPad Pro and iPhone SE into the tech market. However, Apple has not released any official statement on the iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 in the last \"Hello Again\" event held of October 2016. According to PC Advisor UK , the report has all the rumors on iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 that is expected to arrive in March 2017. iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 is expected to have A9 and M9 processor, a 7.9 inch Retina IPS display which can register the pressure applied on the screen and offer differing options as a result. The new iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 will likely feature an 8MP camera at the rear and 1.2Mp at the front. The device is expected to be protected with an aluminum body i.e. a 7000-series aluminum chassis allowing the iPad to be thinner and more durable. The iPad Mini 5 / iPad Pro Mini is expected to have no headphone port and at least 32 GB of storage. In addition, there are speculations that Apple could give the next iPad Mini / iPad Mini 5 support for the NFC and 3D Touch. The new iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 is expected to be water resistant with IP68 protection, as the iPads are not yet available with water resistant technology in the market. The new iPad Mini will likely feature Apple's posh new stylus. Finally, Apple's new iPad Pro Mini / iPad Mini 5 will feature company's new operating system iOS 10 with amazing features packed in it.

Nov 15, 2016 1:52 PM \nSexting has been saved thanks to iOS 10.2 beta 3. \nThe first developer preview of iOS 10.2 redesigned every emoji to look more realistic, with more detail that would look better super-sized on macOS and iOS 10. But it turns out that people didn’t want to send a realistic-looking peach emoji (see image, right). They wanted to continue sending a peach emoji that kind of looked like a butt. \nPeach emoji in iOS 10.2 developer beta 1 \nSo, the internet mourned the impending loss of the beloved peach-butt emoji, and all the potential innuendos that came with it. But now, it appears that the grief might have been premature. The third developer preview of iOS 10.2 has the peach emoji looking like a butt again . \nPeach emoji in iOS 10.2 developer beta 3 \nWhy this matters: The fact that the peach emoji in iOS 10.2 developer beta 3 closely resembles the infamously-sexy look means that Apple was responding to users when it reverted to the original design. And when it comes to emoji redesigns, Apple has not always been so responsive . \nThis means that throughout these beta releases, Apple is actually listening to user feedback and tweaking things accordingly, regardless how silly or inconsequential they may seem.

      "text": "7 secret iOS 10 features used by the pros By Mark Jones, Komando.com \nIf you are a fan of Apple, this is a very exciting time. Earlier this year the tech giant released the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and finally made some much needed upgrades to the MacBook Pro. All of that AND 2017 is the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone, so we are expecting some very exciting things to come. \nApple even made the biggest update to its operating system in September when it released iOS 10. In fact, there are probably a number of iOS 10 features that you don't even know exist. \nTo help you have the best experience with the operating system, here are 7 iOS 10 features that you're going to love. 1. Siri announces who's calling \nWhen your iOS gadget is connected to your car or headphones through Bluetooth, Siri will let you know who's on the line when you are getting a call. This is a great safety feature for when you are driving, since you don't have to look at the phone. To take advantage of the Announce Calls feature you need to enable it. Go to Settings >> Phone >> Announce Calls. \nFrom the Announce Calls screen you have a few options to choose from. You can have Siri announce who's calling Always, when you're connected through Bluetooth to Headphones & Car, Headphones Only, or you can select Never. 2. Find your parked car \nIf your car can connect to your phone through Bluetooth or Apple CarPlay, you can get help remembering where you parked your car. Once you park, Apple Maps marks your car's location and it will be shown on the map. You have to be able to receive a GPS signal for this feature to work, so it might not function properly in an underground parking garage. \nYou will need to turn this feature on to use it. Go to Settings >> Maps and then slide the toggle to the right to enable it. BREAKING NEWS, TIPS, AND MORE LIKED WHAT YOU READ? GET MORE IN YOUR INBOX FREE. Stay up-to-date the easy way. SIGN ME UP!",

A public beta version is expected to drop in the near future.\nApple's forthcoming watchOS point update builds on the third major revision to its wearable operating system. Released in September, watchOS 3 introduced a variety of new features , first-party apps and redesigned controls to better take advantage of second-generation Apple Watch hardware.\nFor example, the side button was remapped to invoke a dedicated app dock, while onscreen controls were modified to include gestures for quick access to Control Center. The update also brought new complications, watch faces and fitness options.\nApple's watchOS 3.1.1 beta is an over-the-air download accessible via the Settings menu on Apple Watch.",

      "text": "× Close After election rupture, CEOs seek unity for staff, customers Apple CEO Tim Cook at IBM Watson headquarters in New York. CEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the November U.S. election, a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that the major brands have long espoused. Cook is telling his employees to “keep moving forward.” (Richard Drew/AP Photo)  51AM By Ken Sweet, Associated Press \nNew York — Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to \"keep moving forward.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying \"progress does not move in a straight line.\" T-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted \"let's see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!\" \nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused. \nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. \nThe men and women who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia. \n\"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory last week, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that \"it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.\" \nIt's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term. \nCEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. \nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop. \n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. \nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. \"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says. \nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. \nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. \nThere's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance. \n\"The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. \nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows \"the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.\" \nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones. \nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. \nCook didn't mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers' privacy. But he added, \"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed.\" \nMicrosoft's chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: \"We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.\" But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to \"fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\" \nFacebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network. \n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,\" he wrote. \"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.\" \nThe most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump's \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,\" adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign \"because you have no place here.\" \nMaloney later backtracked in a tweet that said \"Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.\" \nOther companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line \"had enough of this house?\" under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada.",

The device, which is still under development, would connect wirelessly to an iPhone—much like an Apple Watch does—and tell you similar sorts of information. It will be able to give you notifications, tell you how far you’ve walked and which way you’re headed, along with other tidbits that might be more useful to know as you look straight ahead, rather than down at your phone or wrist. \nApple has explored at least one design for its glasses that looks similar to some popular sunglasses already on the market. In a design mockup shared with Quartz by a source with knowledge of the project, the glasses looked rather like a pair of sunglasses made by the online glasses startup Warby Parker. This particular design wouldn’t be used for virtual reality, however. “The glasses, are cool, but not VR,” the source told Quartz. \nApple declined to comment. \nLate last week, Snap, the newly formed parent company of Snapchat, started selling Spectacles , a pair of video-recording sunglasses, out of vending machines that have been popping up in random locations across the US. The glasses also connect to a smartphone using Bluetooth, and have a design similar to the potential design of Apple’s glasses. Spectacles, however, do not have any sort of augmented-reality capabilities, though many believe that is where the wearable will eventually be headed. \nApple CEO Tim Cook has mentioned his interest in augmented reality in the past. Earlier this year on an earnings call, Cook said that games like Pokémon Go showed that “AR can be really great,” adding that the company is “high on AR for the long run,” and that the technology could represent “a great commercial opportunity” for the company. It’s unknown whether Apple’s smart glasses would be capable of augmenting the world that users see through the glasses, or whether they would just display static information, rather like the heads-up displays on found in some luxury cars . \nApple has been in search of a new product to kickstart slumping sales in recent quarters. The company released its first new product, the Apple Watch—another Bluetooth connected wearable—in 2015, but it has not yet seen the wide appeal that has been enjoyed by its other products. And the latest releases of the company’s staple products, including the iPhone, Mac computers, and iPad tablets, have seen lackluster sales and middling reviews recently. A new product like smart glasses could be what Apple needs to return to growth, although as Bloomberg reports, it’s unlikely that these glasses, if they even are released, will be available earlier than 2018, given that the glasses in question are still in the testing phase. \nSmart glasses aren’t a surefire avenue to growth. Early movers like Google Glass were reviled as expensive, awkward devices that didn’t achieve much. And while there’s been early positive reviews for Snap’s Spectacles, it remains to be seen if they’ll garner wide appeal. It’s also uncertain whether this is the sort of device that Apple customers will be clambering for. That being said, even the underwhelming Apple Watch has likely sold millions of units since its launch. \nThe challenge right now is that we don’t really know what “a product like this” is, Jackdaw Research lead analyst Jan Dawson told Quartz. “Apple tends not to enter a market unless there’s some proven demand for a product or it feels like it can create new demand, so I would expect them to work very hard to establish a clear market opportunity here before launching something.” Dawson didn’t feel that Apple’s research into smart glasses was in response to Spectacles, given that Apple has multiple glasses-related patents , spanning years of work, but will be wary of competitors’ failures: “Given the failure of Google Glass, you wouldn’t expect Apple to even want to emulate those.” Read full story",

      "text": "Apple Seriously Made a $300 Photo Book of Just Their Products, and it Costs More Than Some Phones   \nI guess every day is April 1. I guess that’s just life now. The world has embraced swirling madness, and everyone’s along for the ride. We’ve already seen BP lose it , and now none other than Apple is hopping on the crazy train with something that we want to believe is self-parody, except they’re actually selling it for real money. Designed by Apple in California is a coffee table book filled with pictures of Apple products past and present. That’s it. \nIt’s just pictures. Lest you think perhaps Apple will put in some interesting anecdotes or insight into their design work, set those thoughts aside immediately. Not only did they not do that, they explicitly did not do that as an artistic statement. Take it away, Jony Ive! \n“While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.” \nThat’s from the foreword. It doesn’t sound like the book is big on words after that point. The book contains 450 shots of products from the last 20 years set against white backgrounds and taken by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, in what I guess can be termed the Apple style. Did they include a picture of the book in the book? Maybe! I honestly hope they did. \nThe book itself is hardcover and completely white, with the photos, “printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.” It gets better — according to Apple’s own press release, they spent eight years developing this book. It’s like they wanted to preempt an Onion article. \nDesigned by Apple in California is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. It comes in two sizes, 10.2″ x 12.75″ and 13″ x 16.25″. They cost, incredibly, $200 and $300. This is too much for me this early in the morning. I want to go back to bed. You can buy the book online or at Apple stores starting tomorrow, as reluctant as I am to pass that information along.",

      "text": "Nintendo will release Super Mario Run worldwide for Apple’s iPhone and iPad on Dec. 15 in U.S. time zones, a highly anticipated launch that has a high bar for success after this summer’s Pokemon Go phenomenon.\nThe game, the first mobile edition starring one of Nintendo’s most iconic characters, will be free to download initially and include an optional one-off payment of $9.99 to unlock all of the features. In addition to English and Japanese, Super Mario Run will be available in several other languages, Nintendo said in a statement Tuesday.\nThe model of luring players with a free version and then a one-time price is “a great strategy by Nintendo,” said Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets. Many successful mobile games, such as Supercell’s Clash of Clans, which is also free but lets players buy “gems” with real-world currency, have seen annual spending of $100 a year per gamer, he said.\n“To set a low incentive and then a low total cost when engaged could set Nintendo on a differentiated path, which ultimately could be a game changer,” Campling said.\n  Super Mario Run’s pricing structure means players can feel like they’re getting a bargain, Campling said, since it’s about the same price as a one-month subscription to Netflix or Spotify and a fraction of the cost of a traditional game.\nKyoto, Japan-based Nintendo has said any anticipated impact from the new game is already included in its earnings forecast for the current fiscal period, and that Super Mario Run will also be introduced for Android-based devices at a later date.\nSuper Mario Run marks the first time Nintendo’s popular franchise is appearing on a smartphone. Shigeru Miyamoto, one of the creators of the original Mario game, gave a short demonstration of the game at Apple’s annual iPhone event in September.\nThe release follows this summer’s wildly successful Pokemon Go, which was developed for iOS and Android by San Francisco-based Niantic with Nintendo’s help and has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times, according to the game’s creator.\nIt will also beat Nintendo’s forthcoming home games console, the Switch, to market by several months. The Switch features a tablet-like display unit that can dock at home and connect with the TV, or be taken out and about with two detachable controllers for multiparty play. Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said in April that “it will allow for a whole new way to experience hardware and software together.”\nInvestors have cheered Nintendo’s shift to mobile, sending shares in Tokyo up more than 48 percent this year through Tuesday’s close. Nintendo is also planning to release mobile titles for its Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem franchises by March.\nNate Lanxon  ",

      "title": "Nintendo to release first iPhone Super Mario game on December 15,",
      "text": "LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - Nintendo will release Super Mario Run worldwide for Apple's iPhone and iPad on Dec 15 in US time zones, a highly anticipated launch that has a high bar for success after this summer's Pokemon Go phenomenon.\nThe game, the first mobile edition starring one of Nintendo's most iconic characters, will be free to download initially, and include an optional one-off payment of US$9.99 to unlock all of the features. In addition to English and Japanese, Super Mario Run will be available in several other languages, Nintendo said in a statement on Tuesday (Nov 16).\nThe model of luring in players with a free version and then a one-time price is \"a great strategy by Nintendo,\" said Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets. Many successful mobile games, such as Supercell Oy's Clash of Clans, which is also free but lets players buy \"gems\" with real-world currency, have seen annual spending of US$100 a year per gamer, he said.\n\"To set a low incentive and then a low total cost when engaged could set Nintendo on a differentiated path, which ultimately could be a game changer,\" Campling said.\nNintendo's shares rose 2.4 per cent to 25,445 yen in Tokyo. The stock is up more than 50 per cent this year, compared with a 6 per cent decline in the Nikkei 225 Index.\nSuper Mario Run's pricing structure means players can feel like they're getting a bargain, Campling said, since it's about the same price as a one-month subscription to Netflix or Spotify and a fraction of the cost of a traditional game.\nNintendo has said any anticipated impact from the new game is already included in its earnings forecast for the current fiscal period, and that Super Mario Run will also be introduced for Android-based devices at a later date.\nSuper Mario Run marks the first time Nintendo's popular franchise is appearing on a smartphone. Shigeru Miyamoto, one of the creators of the original Mario game, gave a short demonstration of the game at Apple's annual iPhone event in September.\nThe release follows this summer's wildly successful Pokemon Go, which was developed for iOS and Android by San Francisco-based Niantic with Nintendo's help and has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times, according to the game's creator.\nIt will also beat Nintendo's forthcoming home games console, the Switch, to market by several months. The Switch features a tablet-like display unit that can dock at home and connect with the TV, or be taken out and about with two detachable controllers for multiparty play. Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said in April that \"it will allow for a whole new way to experience hardware and software together.\"\nInvestors have cheered Nintendo's shift to mobile, sending shares in Tokyo up more than 48 per cent this year through Tuesday's close. Nintendo is also planning to release mobile titles for its Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem franchises by March.\nTopics:  GAMING/VIDEO GAMES JAPAN  //str.sg/4Mwc Copy",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech:\nShares of major techs are bouncing back after days of selling following the upset victory of Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election. Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are up 72 cents, or 0.6%, at $106.43, shares of Alphabet ( GOOGL ) are up $14.29, or 2%, at $767.51, shares of Amazon ( AMZN ) are up $9.30, or 1.3%, at $728.37, shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are up $1.33, or 1%, at $114.71, and shares of Facebook ( FB ) are up $1.47, or 1.2%, at $116.55.\nSpeaking of Apple, Bloomberg ’s Mark Gurman , Alex Webb , and Ian King wrote late yesterday that Apple is in “early product testing” for “ digital glasses ,” which would take an “augmented reality” approach to displaying images and information in front of the user’s gaze, similar to Alphabet’s Google’s failed “ Google Glass. ” The authors, citing multiple unnamed sources, write that the device is “still in an exploration phase,” with any possible delivery of actual product not expected before 2018.\nIn data, Internet sales, as encapsulated by “non-store sales,” were up 1.9% in October, according to the Census Bureau, after a 0.9% gain in September. More data at the Bureau’s data Web site .\nShares of cyber security technology vendor Fortinet ( FTNT ) are up 76 cents, or 2.4%, at $32.40, after Morgan Stanley ’s Melissa Gorham raised her rating on the shares to Overweight from Equal Weight, with a $39 price target, citing, among other things, “easier comps” for the company’s financials.\nShares of Nokia ( NOK ) are down 23 cents, or 5.5%, at $4.08, after the company this morning held its analyst day meeting and said its traditional “Networks” business with see sales decline “in line with its primary addressable market” in 2017. The company also announced a €1 billion share repurchase program, to be completed by the end of next year. That follows €560 million spent this year to by Alcatel-Lucent . More from CFO Timo Ihamuotila in a deck of slides on the company’s IR Web site .\nShares of Twitter ( TWTR ) are down a penny, at $19.13, even though noted fund manager Bill Miller told CNBC this morning he likes the name.\nShares of Nvidia ( NVDA ) are up $1.01, or 1%, at $84.65, after it announced this morning a deal with Microsoft (MSFT) for artificial intelligence applications in cloud computing. Nvidia says Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform will run the “first purpose-built enterprise AI framework” designed for Nvidia’s “ Tesla ” chips.\nShares of Zebra Technologies ( ZBRA ), which makes technology for traditional barcode scanning but also for the Internet of Things , are up $3.13, or 5%, at $69.94, after the company this morning reported revenue of $904 million, missing the consensus $907.4 million, but beat on the bottom line with $1.43 against $1.41 expected, and forecast this quarter’s profit above consensus despite a lower revenue outlook.\nZebra also said it appointed former Western Digital ( WDC ) CFO Olivier Leonetti its new CFO, replacing Michael Smiley , which may suggest to some investors the prospect of heightened capital returns to shareholders.",

      "text": "Perhaps the Apple Watch was merely the beginning of Apple's foray into the ever evolving world of wearables. Citing sources purportedly familiar with Apple's plans, Bloomberg reports that Apple is currently exploring the idea of releasing digital glasses similar, in a broad sense, to what Google released just a few years ago. \nDON'T MISS:  The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 \nThe smart glasses Apple is said to be developing will reportedly lean heavily on augmented reality and will present information to wearers by relaying information gleaned from a user's iPhone. Still in the very early stages of development, Apple has already ordered \"small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing.\"\nIf development proceeds swimmingly, the report claims that we could see a pair of smart glasses from Apple on store shelves as early as 2018.\n\nThe glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016.\nApple's interest in smart glasses comes at an interesting time. While Google Glass wearers were ridiculed if not downright shunned, the recent release of Snapchat's Spectacles signals that the world may be more welcoming of connected glasses than they were when Google first entered the fray a few years ago.\nIt's also worth noting that Tim Cook has been unusually vocal with regards to hyping up augmented reality related technologies, even going so far as to say that Apple is \"high on augmented reality for the long run.\" For a company that's as notoriously tight-lipped as Apple, Cook's remarks are rather telling.\nAdding some more credence to Bloomberg's report, you might recall that reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo just one month ago said that Apple will release an AR related device in just one to two years. What's more, Kuo added that Apple's technology could very well be so sophisticated as to leapfrog all rival products by three to five years.\nTrending right now: \nBest Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Nintendo Switch price might been leaked early by Toys R Us See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "How ‘Lip Sync Battle’s’ App Charmed the Record Labels — and Apple 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nWhile Spike TV’s “Lip Sync Battle” is beloved by fans and the stars who routinely suit up for the competition show, there was a final mountain to climb in becoming a cross-platform hit: the American recording industry. \nThe “Lip Sync Battle” app, announced this summer and rolled out with the show’s third season which debuted in September, has the same reliance on the pop hits we’ve seen Channing Tatum, Ben Kinglsey and Zoe Saldana belt out on the show. \nIt turns out even Music Row is not immune to the charms of the Viacom series, led by executive producers Casey Patterson and Jay Peterson in collaboration with Nadine Levitt of app developer Wurrly. Also Read: 'Guys Choice' Creator Reflects on 10 Years of Antics, A-Listers and Antlers \n“The show had some great relationships with music publishers and other licenses from the outset, because of the content used on the show,” Levitt told TheWrap. “We’ve always played by the rules. We really respect songwriters and owners. A lot of music apps just take it and beg for forgiveness afterwards.” \nIndeed, apps like Dubsmash allowed users to rip popular songs and record themselves mouthing along, which landed them in the crosshairs of copyright lawyers . var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); \nThe “Lip Sync Battle” app was smart for not only waiting for the show to permeate 150 countries and make clear its adoration for artists, but also to listen to feedback before handing fans a digital product. \n“We’ve had two seasons of knowing what the audience loves most about the show, it really gave us time to have this discussion. It gave us some runway,” said Patterson, a veteran Viacom live events producer who pivoted to her eponymous production company with “Lip Sync.” Also Read: Emmy Contender LL Cool J Teases Star He Wants to 'Ambush' on 'Lip Sync Battle' \n“To develop this app, it’s big business for us. It’s a big swing and a part of our strategy,” she added. \nUsers get to choose a snippet of a given song and layer live video with special effects and costumes. After a performance is complete you can (naturally) share it to social feeds and directly with friends. The best news is that you’re singing music people actually know. \n“Universal Music Group was the first to come on board, they were very supportive and knew how important this was to our audience,” Levitt said. \nThe app now has cooperation with all the major labels and publishers, and some of the bigger independents, including Disney, BMG, Kobalt and Spirit. \nThe app was chosen for the coveted featured spot on Apple’s official app store, a discretionary honor, and it consistently tops charts in the entertainment category per metric site App Annie. \n“What’s most unique about this app is that we’re taking people through the experience of appearing on the show,” Patterson concluded. \nWho doesn’t love to sing along? \nRead original story How ‘Lip Sync Battle’s’ App Charmed the Record Labels — and Apple At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "A pple 's iPhone is a major player in the smartphone game. But, depending on what features hold the most priority for you, there are alternatives that out-perform the cult-favorite device. While everyone's been talking about the iPhone, lots of other impressive smartphones have been released recently. From customization options and better battery life to enhanced privacy, here are five smartphones that could potentially replace your iPhone if you're ready for a change.\n1. LG G5 Modular Phones Modular phones made headlines because they offer consumers the freedom to customize their handset with specs that fit their needs. Modular phones are essentially user curated. That's exactly what the LG G5 offers — the ability to piece together modules to create a custom phone. The phone is equipped with a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM that runs on Android Marshmallow. Aside from being a modular device, LG is competitively priced. The company also offers free screen replacement for select consumers. And there's the fact that consumers won't have to play \"keep up\" with the latest iPhone model.\n2. Ulefone Power If battery life is an important factor in your choice of smartphone, then the Ulefone Power might be the phone for you. The smartphone comes with a 6,050mAh battery. In comparison, Apple's iPhone 7 has a 1,960mAh battery. The phone also offers a quick charge feature where a five minute charge provides two hours of talking time and a 30 minute charge provides one day of normal phone use. Considering the size of the battery, the phone is relatively compact.\nUlefone features a 6,050mAh battery. Source: Ulefone 3. Samsung Galaxy S8\nIt's been a rough year for Samsung after the company's Galaxy Note 7 was recalled and discontinued. Its next phone debut — the Samsung Galaxy S8 — will reportedly feature a Siri-like digital assistant, offer a 4K resolution of 3,840x2,160 pixels, have a pressure-sensitive display , be 90% screen , have two rear cameras similar to the iPhone 7 Plus and might be missing a headphone jack like the iPhone 7 . According to the Wall Street Journal , the South Korean company may launch the device in April.\n4. Silent Circle Blackphone 2 For those who value their privacy, the Silent Circle Blackphone 2 offers something most popular smartphones on the market cannot: security. Encrypted voice, text and video chat are built in. The second generation of the Blackphone, released in Sept. 2015, offers a new hardware platform, a revamped operating system and more security than its predecessor. As for a Blackphone 3, the company revealed last year that it is working on a new model but Forbes reports the company is having some financial issues that leaves its future murky.\nSilent Circle's Blackphone 2 offers users a more secure smartphone. Source: Silent Circle 5. YotaPhone W hy stick to one screen when you can have two? That's exactly what the YotaPhone offers: an LCD screen in the front and an e-ink screen in the back. The dual-screen phone allows users to customize what they want to view on each screen and offers hands-free messaging. According to industry rumors , a YotaPhone 3 is on the horizon, offering the same dual-screen phone with a better price. The YotaPhone is unfortunately not yet available in the U.S..",

      "text": "Since Apple introduced a mobile wallet on the iPhone in 2014, analysts have predicted that shoppers in bricks and mortar stores would soon routinely pay for jeans, groceries, and super-sized TVs with their phones.\nBut adoption of mobile payments by retailers has been slower than expected . Now Michael Taiano, director of the group focused on the financial industry at Fitch Ratings, says the transition maybe take even longer.\n“This could be a multi-decade change that occurs,” Taiano tells Fortune , comparing the evolution of mobile payments to rise of e-commerce. Even after more than 20 years, e-commerce accounts for only 8% of all U.S. retail spending, he notes.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nTaiano has been studying the potential of mobile payments as a possible disruptive force that could upset the status quo in banking. He published a report about the nascent industry spelling out some of the challenges on Monday.\nSeveral hurdles have slowed the mobile payments revolution, he argues. One problem is that few companies offering mobile payments apps have given consumers an economic incentive to pay with their phone. Paying with an ordinary credit or debit card is easy and familiar—and accepted at most stores. Getting consumers to change may require giving them more of an incentive to use a mobile payment apps, Taiano says.\n“It’s really about the value (proposition)—where is the value prop for mobile payments,” he says. Consumers are looking for discounts and rewards offers, but “up to now there really hasn’t been much.”\nTo learn about Apple Pay on the Mac, watch:\nThat is slowly changing. Apple, Samsung, and others have pledged to incorporate retailer rewards programs into their payment apps, but progress has been extremely slow. This week, Samsung introduced its own rewards program so consumers who use its mobile payment app can earn points towards free gear and gift cards.\nAnother problem is the proliferation of different mobile payment apps. Technology companies like Apple aapl , Google googl and Samsung have created apps, as have banks such as JPMorgan Chase jpm and Citigroup c , along with retailers themselves including Kohl’s kss and Walmart wmt .\nToo many options can create confusion, especially since different stores accept some but not all of the apps, Taiano says. Samsung Pay is the only app that can work at stores that have old-fashioned magnetic stripe readers at their cash registers, while Apple Pay requires a check out terminal equipped with a wireless NFC chip reader, for example. Some apps work only on Android while others can also work on the iPhone.\n“There probably are too many out there now—it’s just confusing,” he says. Customers “don’t know what is accepted where.”",

      "text": "Some Apple fans have held off from upgrading to the iPhone 7 because of rumors that next year’s model will include more significant improvements, particularly to the screens.\nBut a new analyst report casts some doubt on the screen rumors. Only a premium version of the iPhone Plus model will get a much sharper display by replacing current LED technology with higher contrast OLED, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report on Tuesday . Next year’s standard iPhone Plus and the smaller screened regular iPhone will stick with TFT-LCD display technology, the analyst said.\nApple aapl has improved the iPhone’s screen somewhat in recent years by increasing the range of colors it can show, making photos appear more lifelike for example. But the iPhone’s screen resolution of 750 pixels by 1334 pixels has not changed in the past three models. Meanwhile, competitors like Samsung have been adding more pixels and using OLED to create sharper on-screen images, a far more noticeable improvement than Apple’s color range improvement.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nAnalysts have said they expect that a higher proportion of iPhone owners will be interested in upgrading next year, when the device is likely to get the more significant make over. The iPhone 7 had nearly the same exterior as the prior iPhone 6S and the two year old iPhone 6, except for the elimination of the earphone jack and the addition of a two-lens camera on the Plus version.\nFortune asked Apple for comment on Kuo’s report and will update this story if a reply is received.\nAlthough many rumors about the upcoming iPhone are likely off base, Kuo has a long track record of mostly accurate predictions. Thanks to close ties to some of Apple’s Asian suppliers, Kuo has correctly predicted many iPhone developments, including the creation of the 4-inch iPhone SE and the addition of a new shiny black color option for this year’s iPhone. Still, Apple could make design changes before the new iPhones are expected to hit the market next fall.\nKuo has previously written that next year’s iPhone would move away from the aluminum body of recent years in favor of stainless steel frame wrapped in glass. The phone may also have a display that runs from edge to edge, without a bezel, like some Samsung Galaxy models.",

No thanks, not enough substance. This. Something that actually gave the buyer some value add and wasn't a mere exercise in vanity from a company that is showing clear signs of having peaked. But hey, they were imbued with some more of that stratospheric, inspiring \"courage\" and decided to make the bold move to remove the text. I'm surprised the book actually still has pages. I bet that they are saving that removal for the much more useful version 2.0, that will come with an array of adapters and dongles for you to connect the picture output directly into your brain. One dongle = one user, of course = a family of dongle buyers to view the pictures = profit. Edited by tpi2007 - Today at 4:37 pm",
