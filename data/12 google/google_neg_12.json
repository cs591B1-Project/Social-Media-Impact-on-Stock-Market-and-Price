      "text": "Old real estate maps of the Twin Cities contain details of a forgotten history Decades before Google Maps, plat maps displayed a wealth of information with hand-drawn care.

A small cul-de-sac called \"Fraternity Court\" was pasted in by an unknown hand. TOM WALLACE – Star Tribune   In the case of the plat map, an abstract is actually literal. These old sheets laid out the legal names for the streets and real estate parcels, creating a visual database of the city. They were bound in thick, important-looking volumes, printed on heavy paper that feels like a stiff bedsheet. With their simple color code — pink for brick, yellow for wood, brown for stone — and tiny hand-drawn letters that look like the calligraphy of elegant ants, they are excruciatingly detailed. They’re also pieces of conceptual art. If you wish, you can read them as a disquisition on capitalism’s ability to commodify the terrain, turn the broad open land into slices of private property with a monetary value. You can peer at a tiny line and imagine a story of two neighbors arguing over a fence, or see a block crammed with the names of businesses and imagine a Balzac novel overflowing with commerce and conflict. Plat maps remind you that everything passes — the buildings rise and fall, the names of the owners and developers bloom and fade. But the arteries and capillaries of the streets are constant. Plat maps are also quite lovely and if they’re old enough, quite rare. Plat maps from 1914. The maps mainly consist of three colors: pink for brick buildings, yellow for wood buildings and brown for stone buildings. “I would love to know how many copies were made,” says Althea Willette, plat map collector and dealer at Missouri Mouse Antiques in St. Paul. “I’d say less than 50.” But that’s per edition. As the city grew, new maps were required, and there were many editions, known by the names of their publishers. “The first real estate maps in Minneapolis were in 1885,” said Willette. “The Donelley Co. did a wonderful two-volume set in 1892. Then there’s 1903, 1914 and 1940. The 1940 one has a tremendous loss of detail. It [detail] exists, but it’s nothing to write home about. In St. Paul, the first [plat map] was done in 1884; there’s an 1887 one that’s not very nice, and 1908, that’s the D.L. Curtis edition. It’s not hand-colored.” Others were tinted by hand? “Yes! The coloring was done by women and children, according to anecdotes.” Lettered by hand, as well, with fonts invented by the artist. It’s one of those details that draws collectors like Willette to pore over old plat maps. “There’s always some interesting little remnant detail,” she says. Indeed. If you examine the maps with a magnifying glass, the colored blocks and numbers turn into something else: a historical snapshot of a bygone city. According to the 1894 maps, for example: The wasteland north of Hennepin (the North Loop, as it’s called now) was once bustling with houses and commercial buildings. The map calls it the Wilson, Bell and Wagner’s Addition, so if the area ever gets hip and hot they could call it WilBelWag. The great trough of Interstate 94 and the widening of Hwy. 55 made the area unrecognizable today. Some streets have new names (Western is now Glendale) while others, like Lakeside Avenue, have vanished entirely — along with one of the city’s most fashionable neighborhoods. A current map shows the farmers market, warehouses, parking lots. The old plat map shows a tiny residential neighborhood with curving streets and “Oak Lake Park” in the middle, complete with pond. It was a cozy enclave for the rich in the 1880s, but it lost prestige to nearby Loring Park. The creek went foul and the railroad built a sooty coal shed by the roundhouse, and that was it for Oak Lake Park. Gone and forgotten, but it still looks charming on the map. Sometimes forgotten citizens can be found on the tinted grid, demanding your attention. Plate 55 concerns the Lynnhurst neighborhood, in southwest Minneapolis. The map could be used to find your way around today; nothing has changed. But there’s one big plot of land on the corner of Lyndale and Minnehaha Parkway, which is marked NELLIE FITCHETTE. The City Council minutes from 1898 contain a note about Nellie, who objected to a payment of $600 for widening the parkway and thus eating into her property. She settled for $500, provided the city paid her immediately, put in sod to cover the damage, and exempted her from assessment due to area improvements. She was a tough nut, Nellie. There ought to be a statue. What we don’t know Run your finger along Plate 32, tracing the gash that I-35W would make in a few decades, and you find some buildings — and ideas — no longer around. There was Thomas Arnold’s School for Boys, a home for “delinquents, retarded and dissatisfied boys.” Later renamed, it was described in a Minneapolis Public School history as a “‘fresh-air school’ where students who had ‘tubercular tendencies’ studied in the dead of winter in classrooms with wide-open windows.” How that cured dissatisfaction one can only guess. Those are just a few observations from a few inches from a few maps with fairly few details. Willette has some maps that show all the business names downtown in the 1920s. Each little annotation — Uhgers Lunch, Marienhoff Tailor, Stove Repair — is a story we’ll never know. Who was the cook at Uhger’s? Did Mr. Marienhoff wince when he knelt down to measure trousers because he wrecked his back in World War I? What was life like for a stove repairman, going from house to house to fix the burners? In a way, the maps are as frustrating as they are tantalizing, because they hint at so much that we just can’t know. But we know there was a Nicollet Avenue, and while it’s different today, it’s still Nicollet. The cast of characters change, but they have the same ancestors. Plat maps are our family tree.",

      "text": " Google+\nTy Wright/Getty Images\nPresident-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Jonathan Lemire and Matthew Pennington Associated Press December 02, 2016\nNEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump spoke Friday with the president of Taiwan, a move that will be sure to anger China.\nIt is highly unusual, perhaps unprecedented, for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979.\nAdvertisement\nWashington has pursued a so-called ‘‘one China’’ policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan.\nA statement from Trump’s transition team said he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who offered her congratulations. It was not clear who initiated the call.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year,’’ the statement said.\nA Taiwanese source with direct knowledge of the call confirmed it had taken place. The source requested anonymity to speak about it before an official statement was issued on it from Taipei.\nChina’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAdvertisement\nFriday’s call is the most stark example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy.\nOver the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable.\nTaiwan split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan’s status as unsettled.\nAlthough the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it has close unofficial ties. Taiwan’s government has a representative office in Washington and other U.S. cities. The U.S. also has legal commitments to help Taiwan maintain the ability to defend itself.\nTsai was democratically elected in January and took office in May. The traditional independence-leaning policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing.\nDiplomatic protocol dictates that Taiwanese presidents can transit through the U.S. but not visit Washington.\nTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.",

      "title": "Nabokov was such a jerk",
      "text": " Google+\nBy Alex Beam December 02, 2016\nCarl Mydans/Time & Life Pictures/Getty\nVladimir Nabokov.\nTo know Vladimir Nabokov is not to love him.\nWhen Nabokov died in 1977, The New York Times hailed him as “a giant in the world of literature.” Two of his novels, “Lolita” and “Pale Fire,” landed on the Modern Library’s 1998 list of the best English novels of the 20th century. His legions of fans regard Nabokov’s failure to win a Nobel Prize as one of the great literary travesties of the 20th century.\nAdvertisement\nOnly now, 40 years after his death, are some critics daring to suggest that many of his 18 novels are mediocre at best and that his masterpiece, “Lolita,” is a gruesome celebration of pedophile rape. Moreover the cherubic writer known to us from famous Life magazine photo shoots, jauntily brandishing his butterfly net in the Tetons or the Alps, proves to be a nasty piece of work. Distasteful people can do wonderful work — Pablo Picasso was no walk in the park — but their art doesn’t excuse their noxious behavior.\nThere are currently five scholarly journals devoted to Nabokov studies. His allusive style and trilingual (English, French, Russian) wordplay are catnip for academics, who endlessly parse challenging texts like “Pale Fire” — a novel in verse, followed by obscurantist commentary — finding new apercus tailor-made for small-journal publication. Nabokov’s apotheosis in academe is quite ironical, because he and his close friend, the literary critic Edmund Wilson, shared an icy disdain for the ivory tower. They viewed universities as ATMs, handy because there were so many of them, and because they were flush with cash. Nabokov, who arrived in the United States penniless in 1940, had to rely on teaching assignments at Wellesley and Cornell to feed his family for 15 years. The moment “Lolita” made him financially independent, he fled Cornell for Switzerland and never set foot in a classroom again.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here In his lifetime, Nabokov received many contrary and often puzzled reviews. The Hollywood producer Robert Evans famously flew to Switzerland in 1968 to read an advance copy of the novel “Ada” in one day. “It was torture,” he recalled. Dwight Macdonald hated “Pale Fire” on behalf of Partisan Review, calling it “unreadable . . . too clever by half . . . Philistine . . . false” — and he hadn’t even finished his first paragraph!\nI just spent the better part of three years with Nabokov, preparing a book about his friendship and eventual blood feud with Wilson. I would argue that the first real fissure in the adulatory critical wall hailing the “literary giant” came in 1990, in George Steiner’s erudite assessment of the first volume of Brian Boyd’s Nabokov biography, “Vladimir Nabokov: The Russian Years.” Writing in The New Yorker, Steiner perceived, a lack of generosity of spirit in Boyd’s subject: “Nabokov’s case seems to entail a deep-lying inhumanity, or, more precisely, unhumanity,” Steiner wrote. “There is compassion in Nabokov, but it is far outweighed by lofty or morose disdain.”\nLast year’s 60th anniversary of the publication of “Lolita” prompted some serious soul-searching and critical revision, most forcefully from female writers and critics. Rebecca Solnit, for instance, wrote a cringe-inducing and hilarious essay, “Men Explain Lolita to Me,” including these lines: “A nice liberal man came along and explained to me this book was actually an allegory as though I hadn’t thought of that yet. It is, and it’s also a novel about a big old guy violating a spindly child over and over and over. Then she weeps.”\nAdvertisement\nI’m all for a critical reappraisal. I labored mightily to hack through “The Gift,” which novelist Robert Roper calls “less than compelling” in his recent partial biography, “Nabokov in America.” I’m a “Lolita” fan, but let’s face it, Solnit is right: This is a sprightly little tale about the serial rape of an unwilling or indifferent 12-year-old, embraced and promoted by the male literary establishment.\nI also welcome some reassessments of Nabokov’s appalling personality, which slid deeper and deeper into solipsistic self-reverence as the “Lolita” royalties rolled in.\nThe constant accrual of money and fame reinforced his certainty of his own genius, which he was never shy about proclaiming. “I think like a genius” are the first five words of his 1973 collection of interviews and essay, “Strong Opinions.”\nTo be fair, Nabokov generously supported several friends and relatives cast adrift by the 20th century European maelstroms, and there is plenty of evidence that his 52-year-long marriage to Vera Slonim was almost as “cloudless” as he claimed it was. But then there is Nabokov, the public crank.\nDostoyevsky, Nabokov told anyone who would listen, was “a third-rate writer and his fame is incomprehensible.” He called Henry James “that pale porpoise.” Philip Roth? “Farcical.” Norman Mailer? “I detest everything that he stands for.” T. S. Eliot and Thomas Mann were “fakes.” When his friend Wilson suggested that he include Jane Austen in his Cornell survey course on European literature, Nabokov responded, “I dislike Jane [Austen] and am prejudiced, in fact, against all women writers.”\nLeo Tolstoy and Nikolai Gogol: da. Everybody else: nyet.\nThat kind of chaffing can be written off to showmanship; “Look at the Harlequins,” if you will. But Nabokov’s attacks on his fellow Russian novelist Boris Pasternak were anything but amusing. The moment that Pasternak won the Nobel Prize for “Doctor Zhivago” in 1958, Nabokov waged a bitter, personal campaign against Pasternak, a nonstop stream of vitriol made less comprehensible because Nabokov knew full well how Pasternak was being persecuted back in the USSR.\nPlenty of monsters make great art, and Vladimir Nabokov was one of them.\nHaving won the much-coveted Nobel, and now supplanting “Lolita” on the American best-seller lists, “Zhivago” drove Nabokov bonkers. Nabokov suggested to anyone who would listen that the novel was a KGB plant and that Pasternak’s mistress, Olga Ivinskaya, was the real author of the book. Know them by the company they keep: It was Nabokov and the Stalinist stooges inside the USSR who pushed the ugly Ivinskaya-as-author theory.\nNabokov clearly had an idee fixe about (undeserving?) Russian writers winning the Nobel Prize. He likewise harbored suspicions that Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose work he dismissed as “juicy journalese,” was a KGB cat’s paw. “How else,” Andrea Pitzer writes in “The Secret History of Vladimir Nabokov,” “could his work appear in Russia and make its way to the West, while Solzhenitsyn himself remained free?” Ironically, after he won his Nobel Prize, Solzhenitsyn sent a note to the Academy, recommending Nabokov for the prize.\nPlenty of monsters make great art, and many of their names emblazon lists of Nobelists, poet laureates, and so. And there is no doubt that Nabokov created great art, in two languages, like Joseph Conrad, whom he predictably disdained. (“A collection of glorified cliches.”) His achievements spe ak volumes. If only he hadn’t been such a jerk.\nAlex Beam’s column appears regularly in the Globe.

      "title": "A big billboard outside Fenway Park will tell you when your train is coming",
      "text": " Google+\nBy Adam Vaccaro and Hae Young Yoo Globe Staff and Globe Correspondent December 02, 2016\nHow long will you have to wait for a Green Line train as you leave Fenway Park? A digital billboard on Landsdowne Street, across the street from storied ballpark, will help you figure that out.\nThe billboard shows information on Fenway-area subway, commuter rail, and bus departure times, as well as the number of bicycles available at nearby Hubway bike-share stations.\nAdvertisement\nThe display comes from TransitScreen, a Washington, D.C.-based startup that uses data from transportation agencies and services in more than 30 US cities to display transit information.\nThe transit information by Fenway is displayed for about 20 seconds of every minute, sharing the space with advertisements that rotate through the screen.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The company has been active in Boston since 2014, and has about 50 displays in bars, apartment buildings, and public facilities in the area, including Cambridge City Hall. Some of its displays include wait times for Uber rides, though the board outside Fenway does not.\nThat display, however, is its largest and most noticeable in the city. It’s also the company’s first outdoor billboard display in the country, according to co-founder Ryan Croft.\n“If you go to a baseball game and you’re drinking, we want to be able to promote mass transit,” Croft said.\nAdvertisement\nThat exact scenario won’t present itself for a few months. The Fenway transit information debuted on the billboard in November, after the Red Sox’ season came to a close, but it is expected to remain on display through the 2017 season, Croft said.\nTransitScreen’s usual customers include real estate developers and businesses who want to include public transit information inside their buildings. Bostonians can also find TransitScreen in a handful of Boston bars, including Boston Beer Garden, J.J. Foley’s, and Beantown Pub.\nThe Fenway billboard strategy represents a new business opportunity for TransitScreen that the company hopes to replicate elsewhere, Croft said.\nAdvertisers typically pay billboard owners to be showcased. But by Fenway, the billboard’s owner -- Columbus, Ohio-based Orange Barrel Media -- is paying TransitScreen to use its transportation display. Orange Barrel’s goal is to increase the number of eyeballs on the board by offering non-advertising content, along with its product ads.\n“What we’re trying to do is add value through content on the screens, such that people want to look at them,” said Pete Scantland, chief executive of Orange Barrel Media. “Think of it like television -- if there was no program between commercials, there’d be a lot less viewers.”\nThe company has other near-term plans in Boston, where in early 2017, it expects to launch a service allowing users within 200 feet of any TransitScreen display to access the same information on their smartphones. That system will also allow the visually impaired to receive the information audibly, Croft said.\nAdam Vaccaro can be reached at adam.vaccaro@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter at @adamtvaccaro .

      "text": " Google+\nTy Wright/Getty Images\nBy Michael A. Cohen December 02, 2016\nThroughout his business career, from the casino business to Trump University, Donald Trump has been a con man and grifter. But his life’s work in ripping people off pales next to the long con that he pulled on the American people this year.\nIndeed, rarely have so many Americans been convinced to cast a ballot that was not only a vote against their own interests, but also one that will directly harm themselves and their families. More and more, 2016 looks like an “Own Goal Election” for the millions of angry, embittered voters who backed Trump.\nAdvertisement\nLet’s start with the GOP’s political jihad against Obamacare. Republicans consistently argue that Obamacare is “hurting Americans.” But repealing the bill could cost 20 million Americans their health insurance, and many of those hurt will be Trump supporters. As Greg Sargent, at The Washington Post, reported earlier this week, the uninsured rate has dropped by 10 points since 2013 among noncollege-educated whites earning less than $36,000 a year. That’s millions of white working-class Americans who got health care coverage because of Obamacare — and who now, with Trump as president, are likely to lose it. Indeed, there’s already evidence that Republican voters are getting cold feet about fully repealing Obamacare.\nAnd what about the millions of Trump backers who voted for Republican members of Congress — even though the GOP has been angling for years to privatize Medicare and now, with Trump as president, finally has the chance to do so? Oops.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But the negative impact of a vote for Trump will also be felt in ways that will receive less attention. In May, President Obama pushed through a Labor Department rule that would help more than four million workers who make less than $47,476 a year receive overtime pay. A federal judge has temporarily stayed the rule, and Republicans in the House have made clear they intend to scrap it once Trump takes office. So all those angry working-class voters who backed Trump because Democrats are allegedly indifferent to their plight just cost themselves a raise.\nNationally, union voters only narrowly supported Clinton, and, only a few years after the auto bailout saved tons of good-paying working-class jobs in Ohio, union households there went for Trump. Now, with Republicans in full control of the White House and Congress, they can scrap Obama-era rules that require federal contractors to pay the minimum wage and offer sick leave. They can make it harder for workers to unionize, repeal long-standing rules that force contractors to pay union-level wages, and even pass right-to-work legislation that would devastate the labor movement in America. Seven hundred jobs at Carrier might have been saved in Indiana, but without a strong labor movement, American workers will increasingly be at the mercy of their corporate bosses — and guess which side the Trump administration will be on?\nBut in fairness, while Republicans may well shred the social safety net for working-class Americans, take away their health care, and limit their protections, at least Trump will go to Washington and “drain the swamp,” right?\nAdvertisement\nUh, not so fast.\nSo far, Trump has selected two members of Congress — Jeff Sessions and Tom Price — for his Cabinet, as well as three billionaires. The latter include people like Betsy Devos at the Department of Education, who has demonstrated a long-term commitment to cratering public education in America. Wilbur Ross is going to Commerce, despite his long record of laying off workers and moving US jobs overseas. Steve Mnuchin is headed for Treasury. Not only is he a former partner at Goldman Sachs, but he’s also a guy who directly profited from the housing crash. The bank he purchased in California in 2009 was known as a “foreclosure machine” that foreclosed on the homes of 36,000 people — all of which made Mnuchin a huge profit .\nStill, let’s look on the bright side: If Trump passes his tax cut, which disproportionately goes to the richest Americans, some crumbs will be left over for those at the bottom of the economic ladder.\nThis is hardly the first time voters have cast a ballot that will boomerang against them. But rarely has the effect been as pronounced. In giving Republicans full control of Washington, voters have unleashed political forces that are eagerly looking to eviscerate the social safety net and pass legislation that favors the wealthiest and best-connected Americans while ignoring the economic plight of the angry, alienated Americans who gave their trust to Donald Trump. Four years from now, the question to voters will not be “Are you better than you were four years ago?” but rather, in the immortal words of Johnny Rotten, “Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?”\nMichael A.

      "text": " Google+\nJon Chase for the Globe\nThe healthy return of captain Marvens Fedna (9) to the lineup has helped fueled Everett High’s run to the Division 1 Super Bowl.\nBy Owen Pence Globe Correspondent December 02, 2016\nThe 2015 football season was a rocky one by the lofty standards of Everett High, one beset by injuries, illness, and a failure to return to the Division 1 Super Bowl, where the Crimson Tide had fallen to Xaverian the year before.\nRunning back Marvens Fedna’s 2015 experience was something much more dire.\nAdvertisement\nAfter a stellar playoff performance on Halloween in which Fedna scored the winning touchdown in a 12-7 upset of St. John’s Prep, the then-junior’s world was altered hours later.\nWalking home just after midnight, Fedna and a group of friends were approached by two young men. While the group attempted to avoid trouble and keep walking, a man later identified as Osmin Murcia, a 19-year-old Everett High graduate, pulled a knife and tried to stab a member of the group, according to the police report.\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

As that was happening, Murcia stabbed Fedna in the back, leaving him with a “hand-sized wound” that led to multiple surgeries and a night in critical condition at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n“Honestly, it felt like it was a movie, because you couldn’t write that the way it happened,” recalled Fedna. “Having a good performance in the day and then having that be the outcome of the night, it was terrible, honestly.”\nOn Saturday afternoon, the 5-foot-9-inch, 200-pound Fedna will don his No. 9 jersey for the final time as Everett (9-2) once again finds itself opposite Xaverian (10-1) for the Division 1 title at Manning Field in Lynn.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s the culmination of a roller coaster journey that has included real blood, sweat, and tears.\n“Ever since I was cleared to do exercises again, I was doing conditioning,” said Fedna, who resumed running on Dec. 10, 2015, just over a month after the stabbing.\n“I worked out with the winter track team doing indoor track. I was doing a lot of running to get my lungs back to what they were before. It made me realize how much you can’t let anything set you back.”\n“Last year was very tough for us,” said senior quarterback Jordan McAfee, who also missed bits of the 2015 season with illness.\n“He is a great player. What he did early in that day and what happened that night, I was very shocked, but we stuck by him, had his back throughout.”\nThe praise that those around Fedna give him reflects an individual whose status as captain and leader doesn’t tell the whole story.\n“To come back from a serious stabbing, where you almost died on the operating table in the emergency room, shows something about the kid’s character,” said Everett coach John DiBiaso. “It shows you his fortitude, to come back and have a season like he’s had.”\nYet it’s Fedna’s humility and caring nature in times of adversity that often stand out. Fedna’s road back to the Super Bowl has been driven by a deep gratitude for his teammates, and a wish to share with them the moments he lost.\n“I felt bad, like I owed my teammates everything, because that should’ve just never happened,” Fedna said. “It was tough, because after that, I was hurt, I couldn’t play with my guys, and it hurt me deep.\n“Everything these guys did for me last year just helped me be so much more motivated. I was eager to get back so I could repay them; that’s the only way I felt like I could repay them, is to get back on the field and do my job.”\nOn Saturday, this group of seniors will look to claim Everett’s first title in their time at the school.\n“We’re brothers on and off the field,” said Fedna. “I live five minutes away from the school and a lot of guys come to my house, just to play video games and hang out. It was hard not being able to play with them in the playoffs last year.\n“The moment I got a chance to get back to my full abilities, it meant everything to me, because I could now be a part of the family again. Not that I ever left, but being able to play again, it meant a great deal to me. I love these guys with everything.”\nOwen Pence can be reached at owen.pence@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Thomas Farragher Globe Columnist December 02, 2016\nThomas Farragher/Globe Staff\nJason Weisman at work on Duck Creek.\nWELLFLEET — A soft rain falls just before sunrise and Jason Weisman is at work on Duck Creek armed with a knife and a bushel basket, scouring the muddy shoreline for food that supports his young family, still asleep in their beds miles down the road.\nHe’s cooked in kitchens in the North End and Allston. He’s worked on lobster boats. He’s studied painting and has a keen appreciation for art. And now, at his feet, his recognizes the artistry before him.\nAdvertisement\n“It sparkles like a diamond when the light hits it just right,’’ he tells me, holding a freshly harvested oyster, the shellfish that has become his passion and livelihood.\nHe’s got his eyes on the water and on the horizon, preferring to look ahead and forget about the economic calamity from which he is just emerging — a month-long shellfishing ban that has staggered him and his town.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The trouble in mid-October started this way: One bride got sick. Then a second bride fell ill. Presently, town health officials were deluged with reports about scores of wedding guests and restaurant patrons suffering unpleasant and telltale symptoms: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. The common thread? Raw oysters.\nNorovirus had come to Wellfleet, whose namesake oyster is a sought-after delicacy on menus around the world.\n“I really didn’t know what to do,’’ Weisman said later on Thursday morning at his home as his wife, Elisabeth Salén, fed their newly born second child.\nAdvertisement\n“This is the second-greatest source of income in the town next to tourism. There was nothing to do but sit and worry. I was like, ‘Elisabeth, how are we going to take care of these guys?’ We can’t make any money selling our oysters.’’\nNow, more than two weeks after the shellfishing ban was lifted, that worry has yet to ebb. State and local officials calculate an economic impact measured in millions, in the tearful eyes of fishing families already living on the edge, and amid fear that the town’s carefully cultivated namesake brand has been stained.\n“The most important thing to get across is that the oysters are perfectly safe to consume,’’ said Hillary Greenberg-Lemos, the town’s health inspector.\nIf they could, Weisman and Salén would place those words in big neon letters atop tall buildings. The life they’re building here depends on it.\nTheirs is a love-at-first-sight story between a young man from Franklin and a Swedish-born woman who fell in love, got engaged in a Winnebago camper, and now toil side by side at low tide in Wellfleet Harbor.\nThe rhythms of their lives are dictated by their two little boys – Leif, 2&frac12;, and Loki, 1 month – and the daily tidal chart. They run a raw bar business called Slurp-Us, selling what they harvest at events from Provincetown to Yarmouth.\nNow, they are leaning on each other again, trying to figure out what’s next after the norovirus robbed a third of their yearly income – a $20,000 kick in the stomach.\n“Everything felt so foggy,’’ Elisabeth told me. “What’s going on? I was just in shock. Things had been going so well. We felt the wind in our sails. And then it just died.’’\nBills mounted. Credit cards were maxed out. And then something happened that is not uncommon in small towns bound together by history and common cause. Help arrived. Good deeds were done. Reliable friends displayed their reliability.\nA package of Pampers appeared on their porch. So did bundles of carefully chosen groceries. A local mechanic offered a much needed $1,500 vehicle. Pay me when you can, he said. Church groups and local nonprofits tossed out urgently needed lifelines.\n“It’s beautiful,’’ Jason said. “It really restores your faith in people.’’\nAnd in one another. Jason recalls a scary incident from his life as a young single man, living alone on a sailboat. The craft was heated by a small canister of propane, which suddenly exploded, singeing his eyebrows.\n“That’s just how it was when I met Elisabeth,’’ he said. “Boom! She was drop-dead gorgeous.’’\nHolding her baby, Salén showed me the ring finger of her left hand. In the place of a wedding ring, there’s a small and elegant band-shaped tattoo. It has nine dots, signifying their wedding date: Sept. 9, 2009 – 9/9/09.\n“We do have each other,’’ Elisabeth told Jason. “We do have this family. We do live in this beautiful place. We’ll figure this out.’’\nThey are the words of a glass-half-full optimist, a woman who believes that – after this financial storm – her young family will weather anything.\nWant to toast that spirit? They’ve got a suggestion: Have some oysters with your champagne this season.\nThomas Farragher is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at thomas.farragher@globe.com .",

      "text": "Phone Comparisons: Google Pixel XL vs OnePlus 3T   Cory McNutt \nIntroduction \nDo we have a good one for you today – the new Google Pixel XL takes on the new OnePlus 3T . A few days ago we took a look at the Google Pixel and the OnePlus 3T, but we were wondering if the outcome would be any different with the upgraded Pixel XL. Like its smaller sibling, the Pixel XL uses a polished glass and metal backing that took users a while to get used to, but it is a style that tends to grow on you. The OnePlus 3T looks identical to its replacement – all metal and all business with nothing flashy about the 3T – we are not saying it doesn’t look nice. Both of these devices are solidly built and certainly can claim their spot as a flagship device. Let’s look at just what these two devices have in common, if anything, and then we will take a closer look at each one in hopes that we can determine a winner of this comparison. \nThe Google Pixel XL and the OnePlus 3T do have a few things in common. For starters, the displays are an identical 5.5-inches, and they are both using the AMOLED technology – only their resolutions are different. This makes both devices almost identical in physical size with the slightly larger Pixel XL weighing in at 10 grams heavier. Both devices use a Snapdragon 821 processor and an Adreno 530 GPU for graphics – one of the main reasons that OnePlus upgraded to the revised model. The base memory in the Pixel XL is 32GB and the base memory in the OnePlus 3T is 64GB, although they both have a 128GB option, neither has a means to expand their internal memory. Both have excellent camera areas but go about achieving those results in a different way. They both are equipped with a non-removable battery with rapid charge features. They have the usual suspects – WiFi, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS, NFC, and Type-C reversible port for charging and data transfer. \nPlease take a thoughtful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another – click on the “View Full Comparison” link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. \nSpecifications SpecOut | Graphiq \nGoogle Pixel XL \nBy now, most people know that the Nexus period has ended and is being taken over by a new Google Pixel era. This new era is where Google has its own ecosystem, much like Apple, where you purchase only Google products because they all work together. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to incorporate Goggle Assistant directly onto the device. From your Pixel XL , you can communicate directly with Google’s new Home products. Google is hoping that if you buy one device, you will want them all. For this comparison, we will be looking at how well the Google Pixel XL with its polished glass and metal construction holds up to the all-metal OnePlus 3T. \nThe Google Pixel XL sports a 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels with 531 pixels-per-inch (PPI.) Google used the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with a dual-core clocked at 1.6GHZ and a dual-core clocked at 2.15GHz and paired that to the powerful Adreno 530 GPU to handle those demanding graphics. It packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 32GB or 128GB of the faster UFS memory, as there are no means to expand the built-in memory. Google did include a large 3,450mAh battery for power, and it has rapid charge capabilities. \nIt was nice to see Goggle included the same camera in both Pixel models. When we first looked at the specifications, they seemed quite modest – with only a 12.3MP sensor for the primary camera along with an aperture of f/2.0, phase detection autofocus (PDAF,) a dual-tone LED flash, and no OIS, instead opting to use EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization.) However, after DxOMark tested the camera, it was given an 89 – the highest rating yet for a smartphone camera. Google also included an 8MP front-facing camera (FFC) that comes with a f/2.0 aperture, a 1.4µm pixel size, and 1080p video support. This combination of specs offers up great selfies to share with your friends on social media as well as video chatting. \nOne of the criticisms of the new Google Pixels is that the price is rather high for what you get as they did not include a lot of ‘bells and whistles’ such as heart rate monitor or exercise app. You will find Google Assistant built in that will work with other Google products such as Google Home. Of course, you can make Android Pay and mobile payments. It will be running Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box and receive the fastest software updates. It is IP53 rated against dust and splashing water. The Pixel XL measures in at 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6mm and weighs in at 168 grams. There are three different colors available: Quite Black, Very Silver, and Really Blue (a limited edition color.) The Pixel XL comes with either 32GB or 128GB of storage, and it will cost you about $770 for the 32GB model. \nOnePlus 3T \nThe newest OnePlus 3T has many people scratching their heads and asking themselves why did OnePlus ‘upgrade’ their OP3 so soon. The OnePlus 3 and the OnePlus 3T are identical except for a subtle color change to Gunmetal, a slightly faster processor, a larger battery, a better primary camera, and changes in storage. Otherwise, between the two devices, you cannot tell the difference. The changes are certainly an improvement over the OP3 – who doesn’t want a larger battery or better camera. Maybe OnePlus wanted to beat the holiday sales rather than wait until the usual spring launch date. We are looking at an all-metal device that has great build quality, but how does it hold up to the new Google Pixel XL? \nOnePlus is another company, like Sony, that keeps away from QHD displays and the OnePlus 3T does not deviate from the formula. It does sport the OnePlus 3’s new 5.5-inch FHD Optic AMOLED display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and 401 PPI. The new AMOLED display offers much better color contrasts than the old LCD panel and is a step in the right direction. OnePlus used the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 quad-core processor for their OP3 – however, OnePlus even upped the stakes here on the OnePlus 3T to include a Snapdragon 821 with the same sized dual-core clocked at 1.6GHz and another at 2.15GHz and running an Adreno 530 GPU for excellent graphics. OnePlus then packed in a full 6GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of the faster UFS 2.0 non-expandable internal storage, although you can now order 128GB of internal memory. \nOnePlus has done a great job upgrading the camera area on the original OP3 and now, again, on the new OnePlus 3T by using a new 16MP sensor, with fast PDAF (Phase Detection Autofocus), LED Flash, a large f/2.0 aperture, and they threw in OIS for extra stability. The FFC camera increased from 8MP to an incredible 16MP with a f/2.0 aperture for terrific social selfies and video chatting. The OnePlus 3T has a non-removable battery that jumped up from 3,000mAh to 3,400mAh in size that includes their rapid charge they call Dash Charge that will give you up to a 60-percent charge in only 30 minutes. \nOnePlus must have decided that it is okay to include both a fingerprint sensor and NFC chip on their devices starting with the OnePlus 3 and thankfully, it carried over that philosophy to the OnePlus 3T. This allows the device to make mobile payments and Android Pay purchases with a swipe of your finger. It runs mostly stock Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out-of-the-box with OnePlus’ OS called OxygenOS on top with the promise of Nougat to come. The OnePlus 3T measures 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm and weighs in at 158 grams. It will cost you about $450 USD for the 6GB/64GB model. There is a choice of Gunmetal now, and Soft Gold is to come out in December. \n…And The Winner Is… \nThe Final Word \nThis decision was both easy, yet has a tough outcome – I am picking the OnePlus 3T as the winner of this comparison. \nThe easy part was picking the Google Pixel XL as the technically superior device in specifications – it has a QHD display, is IP53 certified, available for use on all major US carriers, is running Android 7.1 Nougat out of the box, it will receive the fastest software updates, and it has Google Assistant. \nThe tough part was justifying the over $300 price difference. The biggest problem that faces the OP3T is that it only works on AT&T or T-Mobile. If you can look past that, we have the same processor and GPU, 2GB more DDR4 memory, and a larger 64GB base storage compared to the 32GB base storage on the Pixel XL. It has an excellent camera area, about the same size battery, OnePlus’ DashCharge for a 60-percent charge in only 30 minutes, and all for only $450 – too good a deal to pass up. Post navigation",

      "title": "Chef credited with inventing General Tso’s Chicken has died",
      "text": " Google+\nBy William Grimes New York Times December 03, 2016\nWicked Delicate Films via The New York Times\nPeng Chang-kuei.\nNEW YORK — Peng Chang-kuei, the Taiwanese chef who invented General Tso’s chicken, a dish nearly universal in Chinese restaurants in the United States, died Wednesday in Taipei. He was 98.\nThe death was reported by the Associated Press.\nAdvertisement\nThe British food scholar Fuchsia Dunlop has called General Tso’s chicken — lightly battered pieces of dark chicken fried in a chili-accented sweet-and-sour sauce — “the most famous Hunanese dish in the world.”\nBut like many Chinese dishes that have found favor with Americans, General Tso’s chicken was unknown in China until recently. Nor was it, in the version known to most Americans, Hunanese, a cuisine defined by salty, hot, and sour flavors.\nMr. Peng, an official chef for the Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan after the 1949 revolution in China, said he created the dish during a four-day visit by Admiral Arthur Radford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1955. On the spur of the moment, he assigned it the name of a Hunanese general, Zuo Zongtang, who had helped put down a series of rebellions in the 19th century.\n“Originally the flavors of the dish were typically Hunanese — heavy, sour, hot and salty,” Mr. Peng told Dunlop, the author of “Revolutionary Chinese Cookbook,” which is devoted to the cuisine of Hunan. “The original General Tso’s chicken was Hunanese in taste and made without sugar.”\nThe dish made its way to New York in the early 1970s after Chinese chefs in New York, preparing to open the city’s first Hunanese restaurants — Uncle Tai’s Hunan Yuan and Hunam — visited a restaurant Mr. Peng had opened in Taipei. They adapted the recipe to suit American tastes.\nAdvertisement\n“We didn’t want to copy chef Peng exactly,” Ed Schoenfeld, an assistant to the restaurant’s owner, David Keh, told the website Salon in 2010. “We added our own spin to dishes. And so our General Tso’s chicken was cut differently, into small dice, and we served it with water chestnuts, black mushrooms, hoisin sauce, and vinegar.” The chef was Wen Dah Tai.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning.\nAt Hunam, the chef Tsung Ting Wang — who was also a partner with Michael Tong in another prominent Chinese restaurant in Manhattan, Shun Lee Palace — put a Sichuan spin on the dish. He crisped up the batter and sweetened the sauce, producing a taste combination that millions of Americans came to love. He called it General Ching’s chicken. But as the dish traveled, the General Tso name adhered.\nBoth restaurants were awarded four stars, the highest rating, by Raymond Sokolov, the restaurant critic of The New York Times.\nIn 1973, with Hunan fever raging, Mr. Peng came to New York and, with Keh, opened Uncle Peng’s Hunan Yuan on East 44th Street, near the United Nations. Mr. Peng discovered, to his consternation, that his creation had preceded him, and that the child was almost unrecognizable.\nWicked Delicate Films LLC\nA platter of General Tso's Chicken.\n“New Yorkers didn’t realize he was the real thing, and some treated him like he was copying,” Schoenfeld said. The tangled history of the dish was explored in 2014 in a documentary, “The Search for General Tso,” directed by Ian Cheney.\nPeng Chang-kuei was born in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, in 1918. His family was poor.\nAt 13, after running away from home, he began serving an apprenticeship under the celebrated Hunanese chef Cao Jing-shen. Formerly a family chef to Tan Yan-kai, prime minister of the Nationalist government in the late 1920s, Cao had opened the restaurant Jianleyuan in Changsha.\nIn the 1930s, after the Japanese invasion, Mr. Peng moved to Chunking, the temporary Nationalist capital, where he began to gain renown. After World War II, he was installed as the government’s head banquet chef. He emigrated to Taiwan in 1949, leaving his wife and two sons behind, and continued to cater official functions.\nHe leaves a son, Peng Tie-Cheng. Complete information on other survivors was not available.\nNew York proved to be a fraught experiment, as Mr. Peng’s restaurant soon closed. “Doom trailed Uncle Peng,” the food critic Gael Greene wrote in New York magazine in 1973. “The pressures of Manhattan restaurant reality were too much for the brilliant teacher.”\nUndaunted, Mr. Peng borrowed money from friends and opened Yunnan Yuan on East 52nd Street, near Lexington Avenue, where Henry Kissinger, then the secretary of state, became a faithful customer.\n“Kissinger visited us every time he was in New York, and we became great friends,” Mr. Peng told Dunlop. “It was he who brought Hunanese food to public notice.”\nGeneral Tso’s chicken began to assume celebrity status when Bob Lape, a restaurant critic, showed Mr. Peng making the dish in a segment for ABC News. The station received some 1,500 requests for the recipe.\nEncouraged, Mr. Peng reopened his old restaurant as Peng’s, bringing his signature dish with him. Reviewing the restaurant in the The Times in 1977, Mimi Sheraton wrote, “General Tso’s chicken was a stir-fried masterpiece, sizzling hot both in flavor and temperature.”\nHe left the restaurant in 1981 and opened Peng’s Garden in Yonkers, then returned to Taiwan in the late 1980s and opened the first in a chain of Peng Yuan restaurants there. The menu featured General Tso’s chicken. It was listed on the menu in Mandarin as Zuo Zongtang’s farmyard chicken, and in English as chicken à la viceroy.\nIn 1990 he opened a branch of his restaurant in the Great Wall Hotel in Changsha, but it was not a success.\nAs Hunanese chefs adopted General Tso’s chicken, the dish entered a strange second career. In a sweeping act of historical revisionism, it came to be seen as a traditional Hunan dish. Several Hunanese chefs have described it in their cookbooks as a favorite of the 19th-century general’s.",

      "text": " Google+\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nA person hurried past a portrait of Sean Shinnock , who is from Massachusetts and is part of the Logan exhibit.\nBy Felice J. Freyer Globe Staff December 03, 2016\nJamie Lenis Shattuck couldn’t explain her feelings, so she kept them secret. Her childhood was full of love, free of misfortune. So why, starting when she was about 14, did she always feel so sad and hopeless?\n“I told my parents almost everything,” Lenis Shattuck said. “I couldn’t bring myself to tell them I was desperately sad. I felt it would somehow ruin their happiness.” When she left for college, the darkness prevailed. She visited a counseling center. The diagnosis: depression.\nAdvertisement\nFifteen years later, Lenis Shattuck is no longer hiding. Her portrait, more than 8 feet tall, stands among 34 photographs lining the 235-foot-long hallway between Terminals B and C at Logan Airport, part of an exhibit that debuted last week called “Deconstructing Stigma: A Change in Thought Can Change a Life.” Superimposed on each photograph is text describing the person’s struggle with mental illness.\nThe airport exhibit was created by McLean Hospital and several mental health advocacy groups to put forth, in the most public of places, the stories of people with mental illness — to combat the shame and show pathways to hope.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Lenis Shattuck, now 43, is a married mother of two in Rockaway, N.J. She keeps her illness in check with therapy, medication, and self-awareness. “Now, I can stand up and say it wasn’t laziness,” she said.\nNext to Lenis Shattuck’s photo in the Logan gallery — which does not have a closing date — is a picture of someone identified as “Howie.” Passersby might recognize his face — it’s comedian Howie Mandel, his text describing his experience with obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nMandel is one of several well-known people featured in the exhibit. Also portrayed: musicians Rick Springfield and Darryl “DMC” McDaniels, author Luanne Rice, soap opera star Maurice Benard, and football player Brandon Marshall.\nAdvertisement\nThe participants range in age from 16 to 72, and tell stories of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other illnesses. The photos were taken by freelancer Patrick O’Connor, who spent 240 hours in photo sessions, kneeling up to his neck in pond water for one and dashing into New York traffic for another. The stories and photos can also be found on the exhibit’s website, deconstructingstigma.org.\nEveryone, celebrity or not, is identified only by first name and age. None of the participants requested anonymity, but the hospital decided that, in a world where it is easy to Google and harass anyone anywhere, it was best to protect participants from that much exposure, said Adriana Bobinchock, a spokeswoman for McLean, a leading psychiatric hospital in Belmont.\nThomas P. Glynn, chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Port Authority, which runs Logan, said “Deconstructing Stigma” is an unusual exhibit for an airport. “It’s a different task for an airport to undertake a public education campaign,” he said. “We weren’t sure how the public would react.”\nBut during the week that the photos have been on display, the airport has received positive responses and many travelers are taking the time read the panels, Glynn said.\nAmong them was Kellie Ottoboni, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, who was studying the photos Friday. A recent survey of Berkeley grad students, she said, found high rates of depression. “It’s really important to just be able to talk about it openly and not feel like it’s a secret,” Ottoboni said.\nDiane Gallagher of Boston, an American Airlines agent, also stopped to read the panels Friday. “I think it’s fabulous. I think it’s necessary. I think it needs to be out there,” she said. “I love that there are all different kinds of people up there.”\nJonathan Wiggs /GlobeStaff\nPart of the exhibit of Logan.\nSean Shinnock of Somerville thinks about what it might have meant to him, if he had wandered through an exhibit like “Deconstructing Stigma” when he was 14. “Maybe it would have changed my life,” he said.\nInstead, Shinnock spent much of his life struggling alone with extreme anxiety and compulsions such as turning a light switch on and off for an hour to combat negative thoughts. He knew his feelings weren’t normal, but he was terrified of what he would learn if he sought help, and avoided getting a diagnosis until he was 32, when he was told he suffered from generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression. By that time, his life was in ruins — he was out of work, immobilized, living with his father.\nAfter treatment at McLean’s OCD Institute, a three-month residential treatment program, Shinnock, now 36, is working for a production company and pursuing a career as an artist. And his giant photo is on the wall at Logan, his story displayed for all to read.\n“I hope that somebody who may be hurting gets a little solace, that they know they’re not alone,” he said.\nGlobe correspondent Olivia Quintana contributed to this report.

      "title": "Blame millennials for Hillary Clinton’s loss? Sounds about right",
      "text": " Google+\nScott Eisen/Getty Images\nTrump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook were part of ab event titled \"War Stories: Inside Campaign 2016\" at the Harvard Institute of Politics Forum on Thursday.\nBy Aaron Blake Washington Post December 03, 2016\nHillary Clinton’s campaign has lots of excuses for losing. There’s the electoral college, James Comey, the media’s alleged over-exuberance in digging into Clinton’s email server, etc. But Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Thursday that one particular group is especially to blame: millennials.\nAs Karen Tumulty and Philip Rucker reported from the big election postmortem at Harvard on Thursday night:\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook also acknowledged that her operation had made a number of mistakes and miscalculations, while being buffeted by what he repeatedly described as a ‘‘headwind’’ of being an establishment candidate in a season where voters were anxious for change.\nHe noted, for example, that younger voters, perhaps assuming that Clinton was going to win, migrated to third-party candidates in the final days of the race.\nWhere the campaign needed to win upward of 60 percent of young voters, it was able to garner something ‘‘in the high 50s at the end of the day,’’ Mook said. ‘‘That’s why we lost.’’\nAdvertisement\nI’ll admit I was skeptical. Young people often get blamed for not showing up to vote; they’re an easy target that way. What’s more, just before the election, polls indicated that young voters — who had previously shunned Clinton — were actually rallying to her in a big way.\nDigging into the numbers, however, Mook has a point.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. The national exit poll shows Clinton underperformed Barack Obama’s 2012 share of the vote by one point with those between the ages of 30 and 44 and by three points with those ages 45 to 64. She actually overperformed him by one point with those over 65.\nView Story At Harvard, a shouting match between Trump, Clinton camps The lingering emotions of the 2016 campaign erupted as top Hillary Clinton strategists accused their GOP counterparts of fueling and legitimizing racism.\nI was inside the room at the Harvard conference\nAmong those between 18 and 29, though, she took five points less — 55 percent versus Obama’s 60 percent. Here’s how those numbers compare to 2012:\nClinton’s 55-36 margin among those ages 18 to 29 is also significantly worse than late polls suggested it would be. A mid-October poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed her leading Trump 49 to 21 with third-party candidates included and 59 to 29 in a two-way matchup with Trump — either a 28- or 30-point margin. A GenForward survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, meanwhile, had her up 41 points, 60 to 19.\nAdvertisement\nThese were large, quality surveys testing only young people, but they differed hugely from the results. Clinton’s final margin was 19.\nThey, of course, are national polls, and the race was really decided in a handful of close states — Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in particular. And sure enough, Clinton did even worse among young people in those states, according to exit polls.\nWhile Clinton’s national margin of victory among young people was only four points worse than Obama’s 60-to-37 edge, Michigan’s exit poll shows her margin among young people there was five points worse (+28 for Obama vs. +23 for Clinton). In Florida, it was 16 points worse (+34 vs. +18). In Pennsylvania, it was 17 points worse (+28 vs. +9). And in Wisconsin, it was 20 points worse (+23 vs. +3).\nCaveat: Exit polls, like any polls, are subject to error. Did Trump really only lose young people in Wisconsin by only three points? I’m very skeptical.\nBut if that number is anywhere close to accurate, it accounts for Clinton’s narrow loss in the Badger State. The exit polls suggest Clinton netted about half a point overall from young people given she won them 47 to 44 and they comprised 17 percent of the electorate. Obama, by contrast, netted nearly five points when he won them 60 to 37 and they were 21 percent of Wisconsin’s electorate. Clinton lost the state by less than a point, so that difference more than accounts for it. We’re extrapolating here, and it’s inexact, but the fact is that even if Clinton had come anywhere close to Obama’s share of the youth vote, she would have held on to Wisconsin.\nThe story is similar in Pennsylvania. Clinton won those under 30 years old 52 to 43 after Obama won them 63 to 35, and in Florida, where Clinton won them 54 to 46 versus Obama’s 66 to 32. It was closer in Michigan, where Clinton won the 57 to 34 versus Obama’s 63 to 35. But, if you run the numbers in each state, had Clinton simply come closer to Obama’s margin with young people, she would have won.\nSo if you accept the exit polls, it’s clear Clinton did significantly worse among young people, and it was more than enough to make the difference in the states that mattered. But what if she wasn’t supposed to do as well among young people as Obama did? Obama certainly had a unique appeal to them that would seem hard for an older candidate with less of a demonstrated millennial appeal to replicate.\nThat’s fair, but it’s also worth noting here just how much young people hated Trump. Harvard showed just 22 percent of young likely voters had a favorable opinion of Trump, while 76 percent had an unfavorable one. Basically every poll showed something similar.\nIt’s true that young people never seemed to love Clinton. Even Harvard’s poll showing her up big revealed that more young likely voters disliked her (51 percent) than liked her (48 percent). But it seemed their distaste for Trump was leading them to coalesce around the lesser of two evils.\nIn the end, it just doesn’t appear to have happened as much as Clinton needed it to. In short: Robby Mook was right.",

      "text": " Google+\nEPA/MICHAEL REYNOLDS\nSenator Jeff Sessions.\nBy Joshua Miller Globe Staff December 03, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, who has a long history of hard-line opposition to marijuana, could unravel the burgeoning recreational marijuana industry across the country, including in Massachusetts.\nSenator Jeff Sessions, a former federal prosecutor and Alabama attorney general, has been taking on marijuana dealers since the 1970s.\nAdvertisement\nHe said earlier this year that “good people don’t smoke marijuana” and “we need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say ‘marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.’ ”\nBecause marijuana remains illegal under federal law, Sessions, if he is confirmed, could choose to order targeted prosecutions of recreational marijuana farms and shops that are operating legally under state law. Such a move could seriously threaten the retail marijuana industry, worth a billion dollars in Colorado alone.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. The Obama Justice Department has chosen not to enforce statutes in that way, legal specialists say, effectively allowing the recreational marijuana industry to blossom in several states.\nView Story Trump picks hard-liner Sessions for attorney general Jeff Sessions is a conservative hard-liner and Trump loyalist who has faced accusations of racism.\nWarren asks Trump to withdraw AG nominee Mass. voters say ‘yes’ to legalizing marijuana 3 states OK recreational marijuana\nIt is unclear what, exactly, Sessions would do. With its limited resources, it seems unlikely the federal government would pursue smaller cases, such as those involving personal use and possession or medical marijuana, analysts say.\nBut the Sessions Justice Department could target other cases.\nAdvertisement\n“A few high-level prosecutions, send some threatening, saber-rattling letters out to business owners, and that would probably have that chilling effect. Not only on individuals who are looking to get involved as marijuana business leaders,” said Robert J. Capecchi, director of federal policies at the prolegalization Marijuana Policy Project.\nIt could also deter policy makers in states like Massachusetts and Maine looking to implement just-passed legalization referenda, he said.\nCapecchi, echoing those in the industry, said he hopes and expects Sessions would focus on issues other than working to undermine the recreational industry if the Senate confirms him as the country’s top law-enforcement official.\nAnd he pointed to comments from Trump on the campaign trail saying legalization of recreational marijuana should be up to each state.\nCapecchi, a lawyer, said it would be surprising if Sessions chooses a different path.\nIn October, Trump said, “In terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state,” according to news reports . But the president-elect’s position on drug policy has shifted over time. (He was calling for the legalization of drugs in 1990 , for example.)\nThe prospect of Sessions going after marijuana businesses that are legal under state law is setting off alarm bells among Massachusetts politicians.\n“The possibility that the federal government will change its existing policy on criminalizing marijuana concerns me,” House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo said in a statement. “I don’t want to see the Commonwealth’s law-abiding citizens confused by conflicting policies or put at risk when they have acted in good faith by obeying Massachusetts law.”\nStill, DeLeo and other Massachusetts officials say they are plowing ahead with implementing the will of the voters. Question 4 passed with more than 1.7 million votes .\n“We are continuing to move forward as the new law requires us,” Treasurer Deborah B. Goldberg, who will oversee the new industry, said in a statement. “We have no intention of changing course at this point, but will closely monitor the federal government’s view on states authorizing the recreational use of marijuana.”\nSessions’ ability to go after marijuana businesses is crystal clear, given that federal law has supremacy over state law, specialists say.\nNew York lawyer Marc J. Ross, who teaches about the intersection between state and federal marijuana law, said the federal government currently abstains from enforcement of certain parts of federal law through a memorandum issued by a top Justice Department official in 2013.​\nRobert Bukaty/Associated Press\nThat document, known as the Cole Memo , sets enforcement priorities for federal prosecutors, such as preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to cartels, and preventing violence in the drug’s distribution.\nBut those priorities do not include prosecuting marijuana businesses operating in legal, regulated markets under state law, which, Ross and other experts said, has given the recreational market room to grow.\n“But if Sessions removes that memorandum, the effective protections that exist for marijuana businesses in legal marijuana states instantly go away,” Ross said.\nThe tension between federal law and the law in states where voters have legalized marijuana for recreational use created a practical problem for the Obama administration, said Charles Fried, a former solicitor general of the United States and longtime Harvard Law School professor.\nThe Obama administration has chosen to solve it through nonenforcement, he said.\nBut “somebody who is indicted, prosecuted, and convicted has no defense by saying, ‘It’s legal on the ground in Colorado!’ Now you may have a hard time getting a jury to convict, and it may be extremely unpopular, and it may be a bad idea,” he continued, “but as a legal matter, it’s clear cut.”\nStill, say prolegalization lawyers like Capecchi, the Department of Justice can’t force state lawmakers to recriminalize marijuana possession, use, and cultivation. And the Department of Justice going after businesses legal under state law, they argue, would only succeed in driving the currently regulated industry back to the criminal market.\nShould a Sessions Justice Department step up prosecutions, the effect on Massachusetts’ nascent retail industry could be swift, drying up funding for retail marijuana endeavors.\nAnd no matter what the impact on the retail marijuana market here, the state ballot initiative legalizes home growing, possession, and use for those 21 and older on Dec. 15.\n“The short answer is: The home-grow provisions would become a lot more important,” said state Senator William N. Brownsberger, a Belmont Democrat and supporter of legalization.\nThe voter-passed measure allows adults to grow up to 12 plants per household. Doing so would let them to bypass the commercial market.\nHope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, did not respond to an e-mailed question Friday about whether the incoming administration plans to go after marijuana distributors in states where marijuana is legal.\nUriel Sinai/Getty Images\nA cannabis plant.\nJoshua Miller can be reached at joshua.miller@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nGREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images\nThis file photo taken on November 10 showed a man buying a newspaper featuring a photo of US President-elect Donald Trump.\nAP December 03, 2016\nBEIJING (AP) — The Latest on President-elect Donald Trump’s phone conversation with Taiwan’s leader (all times local):\n5:45 p.m.\nAdvertisement\nThe Chinese foreign ministry says Beijing has lodged ‘‘solemn representations’’ with the U.S. over the call between President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s leader.\nGeng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said in a statement Saturday that ‘‘It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China.’’\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Geng said, ‘‘This is a fact that is generally recognized by the international community.’’\nThe statement did not describe the details of China’s complaint to the U.S., or say with whom it was lodged.\nIt said China urged the relevant side — implying Trump’s incoming administration — to handle Taiwan-related issues ‘‘cautiously and properly,’’ to avoid ‘‘unnecessary interference’’ in the China-U.S. relationship.\nAdvertisement\n___\n5:15 p.m.\nTaiwan’s official Central News Agency says the former president of a conservative American think tank played a ‘‘crucial’’ role that led to the call between President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s leader.\nThe news agency said Saturday, citing anonymous sources, that Edwin Feulner, founder of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, was a ‘‘crucial figure’’ in setting up communication channels between the sides.\nFeulner led a delegation from the Heritage Foundation on a trip to Taiwan in October and met with Tsai, according to a release at the time from Taiwan’s presidential office.\nThat release says Tsai called Feulner a ‘‘long-time friend to Taiwan’’ and conveyed her gratitude to his foundation for its support.\n___\n2 p.m.\nOne of China’s best-known international relations scholars says President-elect Donald Trump’s call with Taiwan’s leader will not help ease Beijing’s concerns about U.S. policy toward China under the incoming administration.\nShi Yinhong of Renmin University in Beijing said Saturday that China will respond discreetly and with restraint because it wants stable relations with the U.S., but that officials are increasingly worried.\nShi says: ‘‘In the mind of Chinese leaders, concerns are mounting over about U.S. policy toward China’’ under Trump’s administration. He says Taiwan is the most sensitive and important issue in U.S.-China relations.\nHe says Trump’s call may help Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen ‘‘convince people in Taiwan that the island can establish good relations with the U.S. and encourage her to continue to resist pressure from Beijing.’’\n___\n12:10 p.m.\nChina’s foreign minister says he hopes Beijing’s relations with the U.S. won’t be ‘‘interfered with or damaged’’ after President-elect Donald Trump broke with decades-long diplomatic tradition and spoke directly with Taiwan’s leader.\nHong Kong’s Phoenix TV reports that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday the call between Taiwan’s president and Trump was ‘‘just a small trick by Taiwan.’’ He said he thought it would not change longstanding U.S. policy toward China.\nWang says the so-called ‘‘one-China policy’’ is the cornerstone of U.S.-China relations and that Beijing hoped that foundation would not be ‘‘interfered with or damaged.’’\nIt is highly unusual, probably unprecedented, for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979.\n5:15 p.m.\nTaiwan’s official Central News Agency says the former president of a conservative American think tank played a ‘‘crucial’’ role that led to the call between President-elect Donald Trump and Taiwan’s leader.\nThe news agency said Saturday, citing anonymous sources, that Edwin Feulner, founder of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, was a ‘‘crucial figure’’ in setting up communication channels between the sides.\nFeulner led a delegation from the Heritage Foundation on a trip to Taiwan in October and met with Tsai, according to a release at the time from Taiwan’s presidential office.\nThat release says Tsai called Feulner a ‘‘long-time friend to Taiwan’’ and conveyed her gratitude to his foundation for its support.\n___\n2 p.m.\nOne of China’s best-known international relations scholars says President-elect Donald Trump’s call with Taiwan’s leader will not help ease Beijing’s concerns about U.S. policy toward China under the incoming administration.\nShi Yinhong of Renmin University in Beijing said Saturday that China will respond discreetly and with restraint because it wants stable relations with the U.S., but that officials are increasingly worried.\nShi says: ‘‘In the mind of Chinese leaders, concerns are mounting over about U.S. policy toward China’’ under Trump’s administration.

All it took was a phone call.\nIn a move that reversed years of US diplomatic protocol, Trump spoke on the phone with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan. The United States broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979, and this is the first known direct dialogue between an American president or president-elect and a Taiwanese leader since that time.\nAdvertisement\nThe Twitterverse was quick to denounce Trump’s conversation as ill-conceived and troubling:\n1.

      "text": " Google+\nSteven Senne/Associated Press\nGovernor Charlie Baker.\nBy Michael Levenson and Victoria McGrane Globe Staff December 02, 2016\nAt the urging of the Obama administration, Governor Charlie Baker expressed support Friday for a sweeping medical innovation bill, a striking move just days after Senator Elizabeth Warren strongly denounced the legislation.\nWhite House aides reached out to the Republican governor earlier this week, aides said, after Warren took to the floor of the Senate to argue that the bill had been hijacked by pharmaceutical companies and stripped of funding for the National Institutes of Health.\nAdvertisement\nBaker, who typically avoids congressional debates, appeared willing to turn up the heat on his home-state senator, an influential Democrat, before the bill comes to a vote in the Senate next week.\n“Our administration supports the 21st Century Cures Act as an effort to advance Massachusetts’ leadership in biomedical innovation and expedite new ways to treat disease and addiction — including the opioid and heroin crisis that has devastated every corner of our state,” he said Friday in a statement.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. The Obama administration’s lobbying is part of a broader White House campaign aimed at rounding up support for the bill. Administration officials have been reaching out to governors of both parties, and Vice President Joe Biden, whose Cancer Moonshot Initiative would receive $1.8 billion under the legislation, has been calling congressional Democrats and urging them to vote for the legislation, according to a senior Democratic aide.\nStill, a handful of Senate Democrats have joined Warren in criticizing the bill, and Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal from Vermont who ran for president, has declared his opposition, saying the bill provides no relief from soaring drug prices.\nMassachusetts’ junior senator, Edward Markey, has pushed hard for the opioid funding included in the bill, but has not taken an official position on the overall legislation.\nAdvertisement\nWarren says she was supportive of the legislation in its early development but came to oppose it after funding that was guaranteed for the NIH in an earlier House version turned into discretionary funding when it was recently rewritten by Republican lawmakers ahead of the Senate vote.\nThat means most of the $4.8 billion the bill would provide for medical research over the next 10 years would be released in future years only if Congress votes to do so, which critics consider a dubious prospect under Republican rule.\n“Senator Warren believes if we want to boost medical innovation, we have to put real, mandatory money into NIH,” said Lacey Rose, Warren’s spokeswoman. “This bill does not include mandatory investments — it simply allows for future investments.”\nSenator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who opposes the bill, raised a similar objection.\n“We have seen these promises made and broken time and time and time again in this chamber,” said Merkley. “If you are going to make a real commitment, then why isn’t the real commitment in this bill?”\nThe original bill that was passed by the House in July 2015 included $8.75 billion in mandatory, or guaranteed, funding for medical research, almost double what the current bill promises.\nCritics also complain that in addition to not guaranteeing NIH funding, the bill makes $3.5 billion in cuts to a prevention and public health fund that backs efforts to boost vaccine usage, prevent diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s, and discourage tobacco use.\nWarren spoke out against the bill on the Senate floor Monday, saying that although the 900-page package contains some good pieces, a few she wrote herself, “I cannot vote for this bill. I will fight it because I know the difference between compromise and extortion.”\nIn addition to her doubts about NIH funding, Warren also pointed to news reports that indicate the bill would make it easier for a major Republican donor to benefit financially from selling cellular and regenerative medical therapies.\nWarren aides say her outspoken opposition has led to some positive changes.\nOne surprise addition to the bill, a provision that would have loosened rules requiring drug and device makers to report payments they make to doctors, was removed under pressure Tuesday. Warren had singled out the provision in her critique, contending the language would enable bribery.\nWarren aides say the bill was also changed on Tuesday to ensure that the federal government take into account which communities have been hardest hit by opioids, when disbursing $1 billion over two years in state grants for opioid prevention and treatment.\nAn earlier version included no such guarantee, which Warren said would have made Democratic states like Massachusetts vulnerable to political payback after Donald Trump becomes president.\n“President Trump could use opioid crisis funding as a way to punish those suffering with this crisis when their political leaders don’t follow along with his agenda,” Warren wrote in a blog post Tuesday.\nBaker’s statement trumpeted the $1 billion in opioid funding as well as the $4.8 billion in potential future funding for disease research. And he said the bill would cut red tape, easing the way for breakthrough medical devices that would boost both the economy and patient health.\n“Massachusetts is a global leader in medical research and development and a strong partnership with our federal partners is important to ensuring future advances in this field,” he said. “We further support these provisions to accelerate FDA regulatory modernization to speed up the approval process for new drugs and devices to safely enter the market.”\nMichael Levenson can be reached at michael.levenson@globe.com.",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Samantha J. Gross Globe Correspondent December 03, 2016\nThe Brookline public schools are investigating after a swastika and the word “Trump” were found written in chalk on a middle school classroom blackboard Wednesday, superintendent Andrew Bott said.\nThe hateful message was immediately reported by the classroom’s teacher to Brian Denitzio, principal of the William H. Lincoln School. “The teacher was in no way the target of this act,” Bott said in a statement.\nAdvertisement\nSusan Wolf Ditkoff, chairwoman of the School Committee, said the act was “hurtful to our entire Brookline community.”\n“While it’s important to denounce the words when silence is more comfortable,” she wrote in an e-mail to the Globe. “It’s even more important to follow words with action.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. On Thursday, Denitzio met with middle school students and staff to “clearly and emphatically explain the gravity of what occurred,” and explain how “acts like this can erode the fabric of our school community,” according to Bott’s statement.\nThe historical context of the swastika as a symbol of hate and genocide was also provided, the statement said.\n“We know that symbols and language of hate can have devastating impacts on individuals and communities,” Bott said in the statement. “We must respond to any such incident immediately and decisively.”\nAdvertisement\nOn Friday, middle schoolers spent time writing and “sharing messages of peace, inclusion and tolerance,” the statement said.\nThe Lincoln incident is the second time in three months Brookline schools have dealt with hateful messages.\nIn September, racist and homophobic graffiti was discovered on town-owned picnic tables near Brookline High School at Cypress Field.\nIn his statement, Bott said that Brookline schools strives to ensure that “we live out our core values of inclusion and tolerance.”\nIn September, Brookline High School partnered with the Anti-Defamation League to help create “inclusive school communities,” and is planning on extending the partnership into the district’s middle grades.\n“It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that we learn from them and that we continue to build practices that support our ideals and core values,” Bott said.\nSamantha Gross can be reached at samantha.gross@globe.com .

      "text": "A popular Android app on Google Play, named AirDroid could help hackers to access your Android device, security firm test reveals. A popular Android app on Google Play, named AirDroid could help hackers to access your Android device, security firm test reveals.\nResearchers at San Francisco mobile-security company Zimperium have urged the existing 10 million AirDroid users, and also the Android-owners not to use or download the app for another two weeks until the flaw is fixed completely.\nIn their testing, the researchers found the flaw gives hackers enough access to remotely execute codes on the respective devices. In a statement to Ars Technica , Zimperium explained the static encryption key used in AirDroid to safeguard data transmitted by the app is easy to locate. \"The encryption key can be easily found within the app’s code by anyone,\" they said.\nAirDroid is a remote management app developed by Chinese company San Studio. The app allows users to access and control Android devices from the Web or on a PC or Mac. Besides this, the app also offers backup and synching of data such as photos and videos.\nZimperium told Ars Technica the flaw could help “attackers to see the user's sensitive information such as the IMEI, IMSI, and so forth. As soon as the update, or fake update, is installed the software automatically launches the updated [Android app file] without ever verifying who built it.”\nSince the flaw is not likely to get fixed for the next two weeks, Zimperium is recommending users to uninstall AirDroid until the fix is executed by the developers.",

      "title": "OK Computer, Write Me a Song",
      "text": "OK Computer, Write Me a Song Google says its AI software could make creative suggestions to help musicians, architects, and visual artists. by Tom Simonite June 8, 2016 \nLast summer the Internet was overrun by psychedelic images of swirling skies sprouting dog faces and Van Gogh masterpieces embellished with dozens of staring eyes. By running their image-recognition algorithms in reverse, Google researchers had found they could generate images that some call art . At an auction in February , a print made using their “DeepDream” software fetched $8,000. \nBut although fun, DeepDream images are limited, says Douglas Eck , a researcher in Google’s main artificial intelligence research group, Google Brain. Last week he announced a new Google project called Magenta aimed at making new kinds of creative software that can generate more sophisticated artworks using music, video, and text. \nMagenta will draw on Google’s latest research into artificial neural networks, which underpin what CEO Sundar Pichai calls his company’s “AI first” strategy . Eck says he wants to help artists, creative professionals, and just about anyone else experiment and even collaborate with creative software capable of generating ideas. \n“As a writer you could be getting from a computer a handful of partially written ideas that you can then run with,” says Eck. “Or you’re an architect and the computer generates a few directions for a project you didn’t think of.” \nThose scenarios are a ways off. But at an event on creativity and AI hosted by Google last week, Project Magenta collaborator Adam Roberts demonstrated prototype software that gives a hint of how a musician might collaborate with a creative machine. \nRoberts tapped out a handful of notes on a virtual Moog synthesizer . At the click of a mouse, the software extrapolated them into a short tune, complete with key changes and recurrent phrases. The software learned to do that by analyzing a database of nearly 4,500 popular music tunes. Unfortunately, your browser does not support the audio element. A short tune written by AI, with drums added by a human. \nEck thinks it learned how to make key changes and melodic loops because it uses a crude form of attention, loosely inspired by human cognition, to extract useful information from the past tunes it analyzed. Researchers at Google and elsewhere are using attention mechanisms as a way to make learning software capable of understanding complex sentences or images. \nIdeas that helped Google’s AlphaGo software beat one of the world’s top Go players this year could also help Google’s quest for creative software. \nAlphaGo’s design made use of an approach called reinforcement learning, in which software picks up new skills a little like an animal—it is programmed to try to maximize a virtual reward (see “ How Google Plans to Solve Artificial Intelligence ”). \nThe technique is seen as one of the most promising ways to transition from machine learning that’s good at just pattern recognition—like transcribing speech—to software that is capable of planning and taking actions in the world (see “ This Factory Robot Learns a New Job Overnight ”). \nEck thinks reinforcement learning could make software capable of more complex artworks. For example, the sample tunes from Magenta’s current demo lack the kind of larger structure we expect in a song. \nMagenta’s software is all being released as open-source in the hope of helping programmers and artists experiment with ideas like that. Eck also hopes to one day get help training Magenta’s software by releasing music or other creations to get feedback from the public. \nGoogle’s project could bring more attention and resources to a field of research that has existed for a long time in academia but is smaller than areas of artificial intelligence with more obvious business applications, says Mark Riedl , an associate professor at Georgia Tech, who creates software that creates stories and video games. \nYet the effect of that could be to improve the products based on machine learning that Google and others are unleashing on consumers. Humans use their powers of creativity all the time, not just when making art, for example during conversation when we make jokes or use metaphors. Adding a tiny dash of creativity to the language used by a chatbot, for example, could make it much nicer to use, says Riedl. \nHowever, Riedl notes that Google’s move into creative artificial intelligence is unlikely to yield quick progress on a question that looms over the field of computational creativity: can a machine ever be an artist in its own right, not just a tool directed by a human artist? \nGood human artists generally start out emulating established artists before developing new styles and genres of their own, guided by an evolving artistic motivation, says Riedl. How software could develop artistic autonomy is unclear. “Neural networks are kind of in the imitation mode,” he says. “You can pipe in the works of the classics and they’ll learn patterns, but they need to learn creative intent somewhere.” Learn more about artificial intelligence at EmTech Digital 2017.

      "text": "BLU Responds to Adups Controversy, Changes to Google OTA   Daniel Fuller \nBLU, a mobile phone vendor out of Miami, Florida, specializes in refitting Chinese phones with new hardware and software to make them appealing to the US market, then selling them at budget prices. Over the years, this has led the company to strip many a default app out of the Chinese phones that they rebrand and sell, resulting in their devices becoming known for a cleaner, more stock-like Android. Having nearly finished the process of migrating away from Chinese default apps, the last one that they were still using was an over the air software updating app from a firm out of Shanghai, known as Adups . As it turns out, this software was uploading user information, such as SMS messages, to a server in China, and as soon as BLU was alerted of this behavior by security research firm Kryptowire, they plucked the offending app from their source branches, replaced it with a Google-approved alternative, and began working on patches for existing BLU phones in the wild to do the same. \nAccording to BLU CEO Sammy Ohev-Zion, BLU had no knowledge of this going on, and had even told Adups that they did not want their software on BLU devices going forward. That request was violated, which means that users of current BLU devices may have the app, and will have to wait for an update to remove it. Future BLU devices sold, including new units of the popular BLU R1 HD , will reportedly not have this issue, and patches are in the works for all affected devices currently still within their support lifetime. \nBLU has learned a valuable lesson from this debacle; the company has vowed never again to use software that they can’t personally examine the source code for, and to that end, have gone full Google, ripping out all the proprietary and third-party software they can and replacing it with Google alternatives. BLU’s working relationship with Google has reportedly grown quite deep over the years, and all BLU phones put out on the market have to pass muster against Google’s standards. Additionally, Kryptowire will be monitoring all future BLU devices and notifying them of any suspicious activity on the part of software providers. Post navigation",

Only a spokesperson for Twitter made clear the company would not cooperate.\nMicrosoft said it was \"not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point,\" while pointing to company statements on security collaboration between government and the tech industry.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter.\nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to answer the question. IBM , Apple , Google , Facebook, SRA International, and Canada's CGI did not respond to The Intercept's inquiry.\nThe Intercept says it sought answers for two weeks, reaching out to companies via phone and email.\nPresident-Elect Donald Trump and his transition team have waffled on several of his campaign promises, but they seem to still be considering a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries, and possibly of Muslim Americans. Under such a system, immigrants or citizens in a database could be subject to interrogations and other forms of monitoring.\nHow exactly such a system would work is still unclear, but it's easy to imagine information harvested from social media, big data analytics, and large-scale database infrastructure being attractive tools for anyone trying to build it.\nFor more on privacy and security, watch our video. \nIt's a bit surprising to see that Apple did not provide a reply to the inquiry, considering the months-long legal battle it waged against the FBI over providing tools to access an iPhone used by a terrorist attacker. The same could be said for Google, whose longtime motto \"Don't Be Evil\" was often interpreted as a promise to act responsibly with users' data.\nAs The Intercept's Sam Biddle made clear, providing no answer isn't the same as \"tacitly endorsing\" a Muslim registry. But the hesitancy of normally pro-privacy companies to take a position could be seen as an index of a political landscape that has shifted massively.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple Don’t Rule Out Helping Track Muslims \nIn a new report from The Intercept , 8 out of 9 major technology firms either gave no reply or took no position when asked if they would cooperate with the incoming Trump administration in building a national registry of Muslims. Only a spokesperson for Twitter made clear the company would not cooperate. \nMicrosoft said it was “not going to talk about hypotheticals at this point,” while pointing to company statements on security collaboration between government and the tech industry. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to answer the question. IBM , Apple , Google , Facebook, SRA International, and Canada’s CGI did not respond to The Intercept’s inquiry. \nThe Intercept says it sought answers for two weeks, reaching out to companies via phone and email. \nPresident-Elect Donald Trump and his transition team have waffled on several of his campaign promises, but they seem to still be considering a registry of immigrants from Muslim countries, and possibly of Muslim Americans. Under such a system, immigrants or citizens in a database could be subject to interrogations and other forms of monitoring. \nHow exactly such a system would work is still unclear, but it’s easy to imagine information harvested from social media, big data analytics, and large-scale database infrastructure being attractive tools for anyone trying to build it. For more on privacy and security, watch our video. \nIt’s a bit surprising to see that Apple did not provide a reply to the inquiry, considering the months-long legal battle it waged against the FBI over providing tools to access an iPhone used by a terrorist attacker. The same could be said for Google, whose longtime motto “Don’t Be Evil” was often interpreted as a promise to act responsibly with users’ data. \nAs The Intercept’s Sam Biddle made clear, providing no answer isn’t the same as “tacitly endorsing” a Muslim registry. But the hesitancy of normally pro-privacy companies to take a position could be seen as an index of a political landscape that has shifted massively. ",

      "text": " Google+\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\nA gun show in Fort Worth, Texas.\nBy Renée Graham Globe columnist December 04, 2016\nPost-election fears, again, are driving gun purchases — this time less by those worried about losing their gun rights than losing their lives.\nSince Donald Trump’s win last month, hate crimes nationwide have surged, and so has the number of people of color buying guns for protection. According to an NBC News report , some gun store owners have seen a four-fold increase in minorities inquiring about and purchasing firearms in recent weeks. Earl Curtis, an African-American and owner of Blue Ridge Arsenal in Virginia, told a reporter that many people of color believe “that racists now feel like they can attack . . . just because [Trump] is doing it.”\nAdvertisement\nPhilip Smith, founder of the National African American Gun Association, told the Philadelphia Tribune, “There’s a lot of fear out there on both sides that is divided racially. It’s the unfortunate reality right now.”\nHere’s what’s also unfortunate: More people of color with guns will likely result in more people of color dead or in prison. Minnesota’s open carry law did not save Philando Castile. He informed the officer who stopped his car that he was carrying a licensed gun, but was still shot to death in front of his girlfriend and her young daughter in July. In 2014, Ohio’s open-carry law did not spare the life of 12-year-old Tamir Rice , shot dead by a cop while playing with a toy gun. This past week, officials declined to charge a police officer in the shooting death of Keith Scott who may have had a gun in his possession but was not holding it when he was killed in Charlotte earlier this year. North Carolina is also an open-carry state.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning And when Marissa Alexander stood her ground in Florida against her abusive husband by firing a warning shot into a wall, she was sentenced to 20 years for aggravated assault, even though the bullet struck no one. (The jury deliberated just 12 minutes.) After public outcry, Alexander accepted a plea bargain and was released in 2015, after three years in prison.\nStill, such stories aren’t proving a deterrent. People of color, having witnessed the rancor that the nation’s next president has stirred to a boil, are arming themselves, afraid their government and law enforcement will do nothing to protect them. This recalls an even more virulent era, documented in Nicholas Johnson’s excellent 2014 book, “Negroes and the Gun: The Black Tradition of Arms,” which explores the history of African-Americans “committed to the principle of self-defense.” Unable to count on police officers to safeguard their families or property from racist gangs, some of whom had cops as members, black people were forced to fend for themselves.\nIn 1892, when at least one black person a week was being lynched in America, anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells said, “A Winchester rifle should have a place of honor in every black home, and it should be used for that protection which the law refuses to give.”\nAdvertisement\nAccording to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey , gun ownership by blacks is less than half that of whites, 19 percent vs. 41 percent. Yet attitudes are also changing: 54 percent of blacks saw gun ownership as more likely to protect people than put them at risk; two years earlier, it was just 29 percent.\nWhen citizens of color feel the incoming government will do nothing about the hate crimes endangering their lives, they will feel compelled to defend themselves. But in a nation with as many guns as people, we must find other ways of challenging conflict, especially because African-Americans, Latinos, and Muslims with firearms will always be treated as suspects, not victims.\nLike every other citizen, they should exercise their Second Amendment rights as they see fit. Still, even in a time of threat and peril, they must also carry the sobering knowledge that constitutional guarantees tend to fall short when the hand holding a gun is black or brown.\nRenée Graham is a Globe columnist.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Evan Allen Globe Staff December 03, 2016\nLAWRENCE — Lee Manuel Viloria-Paulino had brought 16-year-old Mathew Borges to his family home just once, in the middle of November. Viloria-Paulino’s tight-knit family knew only that they were classmates at Lawrence High School, a family spokeswoman said. If it was a friendship, it seemed new.\nBut a few days after that visit, Viloria-Paulino, 16, went missing. About two weeks later, on Thursday, his decapitated body was found along the banks of the Merrimack River. On Saturday, Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett announced at an afternoon press conference that Borges had brutally killed Viloria-Paulino, mutilating his body so badly that the autopsy took 11 hours.\nAdvertisement\n“This was a horrific, horrific murder,” said Blodgett at a press conference outside Lawrence District Court on Saturday afternoon. “While it shook the community, we were completely and totally resolved to bring this matter to justice.”\nInvestigators searched Borges’s home on Oxford Street in Lawrence early Saturday morning and arrested him at around 11 a.m., Blodgett said. The teenager will be charged as an adult with first degree murder and will be arraigned Monday in Lawrence District Court. Blodgett declined to discuss motive.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Viloria-Paulino’s stricken family gathered at their Lawrence home, praying, singing, and weeping, and harshly criticized Lawrence police for their initial handling of the case. When Viloria-Paulino first went missing Nov. 18, family said officers insisted the good-hearted teenager who was devoted to his family and active in his church had simply run away.\nView Story Lawrence homicide victim is identified as 16-year-old Lee Manuel Viloria-Paulino, 16, was last seen by relatives last month before he went missing.\n“We’ve been here since the beginning, asking for help,” said the teenager’s grandmother, Ivelisse Cornielle. “We are poor, we are Hispanic, they considered this a normal runaway case. I told them from day one that it wasn’t.”\nIf police had begun their search in earnest earlier, the family said, Viloria-Paulino May still be alive.\nAdvertisement\n“That’s my pain,” wept Cornielle.\nLawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera told reporters after the district attorney’s press conference that “if need be,” he would seek an independent investigation into the department’s early handling of the case.\n“Things could have been done differently early on, but I don’t know,” Rivera said. When he spoke with investigators recently, he said, everyone was doing everything they could. But the family had told him that in the beginning, they had to push for reaction.\nLawrence Police Officer William Green said that the police department treats missing person reports like “nuisances” instead of something to be investigated. Unless it’s a young child, he said, the reports are not treated with urgency.\n“It goes into a bin,” he said. “It’s forgotten.”\nGreen said he knew he would get in trouble for speaking out, but that he had complained in the past about the missing person policy and nothing had changed.\nRivera declined to comment on what Green said; police officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nFamily and friends said Viloria-Paulino had no run-ins with the law or with any gangs. Blodgett declined to say whether Borges was known to police, or to answer questions about what weapon was used or when Vilonia-Pualino died.\nNo one answered the door at the address Blodgett said Borges lived at; while one neighbor said he saw the family sometimes, others were not sure if a teenage boy lived at the address.\nViloria-Paulino’s family said he was a good boy with a moral upbringing. When he got home from school, said his grandfather Gustavo Paulino, he would hug everyone in his family and tell them he had missed them.\n“If he left the house for one hour, he’s hugging everybody,” said Paulino.\nThe family declined to comment on Borges, but said that the arrest did little to make them feel justice or closure.\n“Nothing’s gonna return our child,” said Gustavo Paulino.\n“Our concern now is that they pay attention, and this does not happen to other families,” said Corneil.\nOfficials have repeatedly said that the killing was an isolated, targeted incident, and that no one else in Lawrence was in any danger, but Viloria-Paulino’s family scoffed at that idea.\n“Nobody’s safe. Lock your doors, homeschool your kids,” said the teenager’s uncle, Julik Paulino. “If Lee wasn’t safe, nobody’s safe.”\nAs the family spoke outside their home, two photographs of Viloria-Paulino stared out from a missing person poster still hanging in the rear window of one of the family’s cars.\n“Lee, please return home,” the poster read. “We love you ”\nRelated Lawrence homicide victim identified as 16-year-old\nEvan Allen can be reached at evan.allen@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Yvonne Abraham Globe Staff December 03, 2016\nIf you’re a member of the clergy, you’re in the business of hope.\nBut for many who worship around here, that precious commodity has been in short supply lately. Some have found ways to reconcile their beliefs with support for a presidential candidate whose words and deeds mock them. Some didn’t, but have moved on. But others, even four weeks after the election, feel a sadness that has pastors summoning all of their powers of consolation.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s like a chasm has opened at their feet,” Lee Bluemel, who leads North Parish , a Unitarian Universalist church in North Andover. Some in her church see the election’s outcome as a rejection of tolerance and compassion: “They feel anxiety, despair, anger, fear, disbelief, a sense of betrayal.”\nIn liberal congregations, or those that include groups targeted by the president-elect, there is desperate need for a way forward.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. “We acknowledge that love doesn’t always win,” Bluemel said. “But that is still the path that we choose. Rather than a sentimental feeling, hope is love in action , and in taking a stand for hope, we actually create it.”\nAt Trinity Church Copley Square, which serves the rich, the poor, and many in between, there is heartbreak among some. Associate Rector Patrick Ward has reminded worshippers grappling with a post-factual world of an essential truth: Goodness prevails.\n“We know how this story ends, ultimately,” Ward said. “That doesn’t mean there is not a lot of suffering and pain and despair along the road.” He went on: “Scripture reminds us to remember history. The world has [seen] a lot worse than our president- elect, and our nation has endured a lot worse.”\nAdvertisement\nBut none of this happens on its own.\n“Christianity isn’t simply about solace,” he said. “It’s about strength, and remembering that we’re called to resist.” He cited a line from a poem by Marianne Moore : when what we hoped for came to nothing/we revived.\nWard and others see their congregations galvanizing, looking for ways to fight policies they disagree with and to connect with those in pain or feeling imperilled.\nMembers of the mostly-black congregation at Bethel AME , in Jamaica Plain, have always been acutely conscious of racial division, but they’re reckoning with the scale of what just happened: Not all Trump voters were racist, but none were sufficiently offended by racism to deem him unacceptable.\n“It’s not like [African Americans] haven’t felt attacked and unwanted before,”said associate pastor Mariama White-Hammond. “But it’s part of our tradition to imagine ...we could make America what it’s always been meant to be.” Here, as in other churches, it looks like the dawn of a new civil rights era. Those who might have come to White-Hammond for advice on how to get their kids into college now want to march on Washington.\n“I tell them we are called to take care of each other,” White-Hammond said. “That is the purpose of the church.”\nDetermination and despair are close companions. At Temple Sinai , in Brookline, members of the community are struggling to understand “why people who are not hate-filled could have voted for Trump,” said Rabbi Andrew Vogel. That a person who acts like a bully and disrespects women could succeed is hard to explain, especially to kids. Vogel tells them, “we ourselves have to continue to live by higher standards.”\nAt the heart of every sermon is the conviction that, as Martin Luther King Jr. said, “the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Those words are also a call to action, because that arc will not bend itself.\nVogel, like the others, tells his congregation that it’s OK to be upset, but that they have to keep going, working against the forces that got us here. This election has reminded us that living requires courage, he said.\nHe thinks of an old teaching:\nThe whole world is a very narrow bridge.\nThe important thing is not to be afraid.\nGlobe columnist Yvonne Abraham can be reached at yvonne.abraham@globe.com",

      "text": "Watch These Echo, Google Home Speakers Get Stuck in Infinite Loop Watch These Echo, Google Home Speakers Get Stuck in Infinite Loop 10 Comments YouTuber Adam Jakowenko 'decided to have some fun' with his Amazon Echo and Google Home. \nYou can stop fretting over the impending robot rebellion. It turns out that some smart home appliances are not all that smart. \nYouTube user Adam Jakowenko last month \"decided to have some fun\" with his Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers. Using the built-in calendar features on the voice-activated devices, Jakowenko forced the machines into an infinite loop of event planning. \n\"Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight,\" he said at the start of the video (below), waking up Amazon's digital assistant. \n\"Tonight, there is one event: At 6 p.m. there's 'Hey Google, what's on my calendar tonight?'\" Alexa announces, waking the nearby Home device. \n\"You have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m.,\" it responds evenly. \"The title is, 'Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?'\" \n\"Tonight, there is one event,\" Alexa confirms, continuing the conversation for another round. \nThe video, thankfully, lasts only 50 seconds, though you quickly get the picture. \n\"The idea came to me while sitting on the couch watching TV and we asked Google Home what was on my calendar,\" Jakowenko told PCMag in an email. \"Then the thought came, 'Alexa can also do that...I wonder if we can make them talk to each other.'\" \nAfter a few tweaks to his digital diaries, and a \"small amount of trial and error,\" the San Diego resident managed to sync the speakers to create a sort of modern torture device. \n\"It was definitely fun but certainly not something you want to listen to for hours,\" he said. \nAmazon unveiled its cylindrical speaker in November 2014—a voice-controlled device that can tell you the news and weather, create to-do lists, set a timer and alarms, play music, and even tell jokes. The $180 product also integrates with the connected home to provide local search details via Yelp, read Audible audiobooks, re-order Prime-eligible products, share sports scores and schedules, and report on traffic. \nGoogle Home, meanwhile, launched in October , promising a variety of home tasks and entertainment experiences for $130; it can stream video or audio via Cast-enabled devices and Google Play Music , dim the lights and turn off the heat, and search the Internet. Related Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: Which One Should Rule Your Smart Home? \nJakowenko, however, is not the first to pit the two speakers against each other: YouTubers Daniel Haese and GadgetUpdates recently recorded similar tests, also with entertaining results. \n\"I had only intended to make the video private and send to a couple friends,\" Jakowenko said, adding that after he shared it with the Daily Tech News Show podcast, the video went viral. \"Tom Merritt, the [podcast] host, tweeted about it and it got a bunch more hits, then a few days after that I started getting texts from friends who came across it after seeing it on Reddit,\" he told PCMag. \"The rest is history.",

      "title": "Brain behind the brand: Confessions of a Bollywood star publicist",
      "text": "A celebrity's publicist doesn't just Google for their quotes. They often manage their relationships and egos as well. Eight years into the industry, a PR manager talks about what it's like to be in her shoes - hated by all, appreciated by none\n\nLast week, it was reported that actress Shilpa Shetty's publicist who owned up to finding Animal Farm when searching the net for a book that ‘teaches you how to care for animals’ has been fired. Even as #ShilpaShettyReviews continued to trend on Twitter, Shetty took to the social media site to say that she had never read the George Orwell book. \"So recommending them to kids is out of the question! Obviously some misunderstanding.\" \nI had been interested in celebrities ever since I did a media course in college. After graduating, I joined a firm which manages celebrities and also works on promotional projects for films. That was eight years ago.\nIt's been quite a ride and I had a bumpy start. I still recall with great clarity the first time I went on field — on field in our industry means being around a celebrity during an event. It could be a party, a television appearance or, as was in this case, an interview for promoting a new release. And, the actor I was in charge of was someone known to be controversial. There was hardly an interview of hers that didn't make the news for all the wrong reasons.\n\nAs Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone took their success war to Hollywood, their publicists took to the press with articles on who took home a fatter pay \nThat day, we were at a hotel, and the actress was promoting a two-heroine movie she was a part of. The journalist, who was from a top TV channel, asked her about her equation with another actress (there has been rumours about the two not getting along), and my client blew her lid.\nShe attacked the channel, called their line of questioning tacky and stormed off the sets. It was ironic because she had been asked if she handled catfights maturely. What did the firm that represented her, and I worked for, do? Nothing.\n\nSome sections of the media hinted that the spat between Hrithik Roshan and Kangna Ranaut was orchestrated by publicists \nThat's what this actress was famous for — throwing tantrums. We realised she was doing this for her own publicity, and that it didn't make sense to go into damage control. The channel, in turn, got back with a story on the tacky films the actress had done.\nI had been attracted to the profession by the idea of moving around the famous. It never occurred to me how busy my life was going to become. But, I soon realised that a celebrity publicist, needs to keep their phone handy all the time.\n\nRanbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma got into a sticky situation with the entertainment website, Pinkvilla, in October this year. Kapoor got upset at being asked to verify his cousin Kareena Kapoor's statement that he read Pinkvilla \"five times a day\", and resorted to saying that he only read it as it published s***. He then challenged the website to carry that video. Pinkvilla not just published the video but carried a rejoinder which talked of how celeb’s publicists beg for positive stories. \nAround the release of a movie, we accompany the star everywhere — events, interviews and even to the airport. We handle their communication too, even sending emails and messages for them. Most of the bigger stars in the industry need someone to whet the interviews for them. We do that job. I handle a few \"superstars\" and, ahead of every release, of the requests they receive, they accept only three. It's we who help them decide which three.\nLife is a bit more relaxed when a film release is not around the corner, but that means little because we still have to be available 24/7. A star may want you any time. I have found actresses to be more needy than actors, as they require constant validation of how they look — if their dress is fine, if their hair is right. They also like being seen with an entourage.\nSo, if they have to go for an event, and don't have a friend to go with, they will take the publicist along. It's 'embarrassing' to make it alone. It's no wonder that you develop a bond with the star. It becomes second nature for us to always think about them, even putting them before us, our own personal life. For example, if a movie releases during a festival, which they often do, we are off promoting the movie instead of being at home with our families.\nThe bigger stars don't need as much attention, as they get press no matter what, It's the newer stars that are tougher to handle. You have to make sure you get them to various events, where they can be seen and photographed. You have to get them into magazines and newspapers, even if it means half-inventing stories they can be part of. You develop a business acumen doing this job. What that means is you become an ace at barter. For example, I may tell a journalist that I will make sure a certain celebrity is on the cover of their magazine, if they do me a favour and carry an interview with a new actor. It doesn't sound right but that's how it goes.\nIt's the relationship with the journalist — and that can be a precarious one — that we tend to a lot. Here are the things we do, which perhaps we shouldn't be doing: Sometimes, a publicist may give a journalist a story about their client, without the celebrity's knowledge, just so the journalist owes them a favour later. Often, 'who's-dating-whom' stories are leaked by the actors themselves, and later, they could feign ignorance. This is done in compliance with the newspaper/channel/magazine. For example, an actor couple may leak pictures of themselves on vacation, and in another interview speak of the media not giving them their space.\nActors think we control this stuff, when that's not true at all. They ask us to dictate headlines and determine which photographs will be published. We are pulled up when the truth appears in the press, and are asked why we didn't stop it. Many a publicist has lost the account because the celeb got bad press. Actors also think they can control movie reviews. But readers are way too smart. The stars do it anyway, and the publicist becomes the go-between in this 'doctored' publicity.\nThat is still part of the job. Often we end up handling work that is not even remotely related to our job. We end up negotiating financials for a star when on a shoot — how much will the driver or the make-up experts be paid. This is also because the star is embarrassed to do it personally. So we sit down with the magazine staff and sort out everyone's payments – right down to what lunch will be ordered. We also sometimes have to plant stories about the client's rivals — things we have heard on the job, that are usually true. I have even heard, though not encountered, of stars getting the publicist to manage the lover; reaching out, fixing a date. You can't say, no.\nHave I ever wanted to quit? Of course, several times. The job is stressful and gets repetitive. It's also tiring to think up story pitches. Hence, most end up as silly ideas. For example, you may tell a journalist that an actress has a foreign director pursuing her. But the director may never have heard of her. Or, you may try and sell a story that two actors didn't get along during a shoot, when in fact, things were fairly polite. At the end of it all, it's your love for movies and glamour, and the professional attitude of a handful of stars that keeps you willing to stay in the game.",

      "text": "print \nAntonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider I've been using Google's Pixel XL smartphone for a few weeks, and it's been highlighting the iPhone's glaringly lacking key features.\nYou should note that everything here is subjective. The iPhone has great features that the Pixel doesn't have, and the Apple ecosystem is in a league of its own. \nBut damn the Pixel is good. \nYou should also note that I'm comparing the Pixel XL experience with my iPhone 6s and not the iPhone 7 series. That's because I have more experience with the 6s Plus, as it's been my phone for the last 9 months. On top of that, the iPhone 6s Plus isn't that much different, as a whole, than the iPhone 7. The performance between both phones is still comparable, and the 7's camera upgrades aren't as important as some of the Pixel's more functional features. \nCheck out what I think makes the Pixel a better phone than the iPhone: The Pixel is lighter. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nMy iPhone 6s Plus' weight (192 grams) never bothered me until I picked up the Google Pixel XL (168 grams). The iPhone 7 Plus is slightly lighter than the 6s Plus at 188 grams, but only by 4 grams, so I'd still consider the 7 heavy compared to the Pixel. \nThe Pixel's lighter weight has no ill effect on its reliability, and it's easier to manage in your hands. The Pixel's screen is stunning. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nAbove, the Pixel XL and iPhone 6s Plus are showing the same photo on full brightness (taken with the Pixel, by the way). The iPhone's LCD screen is nice, but the colors aren't as rich, and the contrast isn't as pronounced as on the Pixel's AMOLED display. \nThe Pixel's design is more utilitarian than it is beautiful, but its sharper AMOLED screen outshines the iPhone's Retina display. \nThe iPhone 7 Plus has a 1080p screen that's fine and sharp enough, but the Pixel's 1440p screen is sharper. \nMore importantly, the Pixel's AMOLED screen makes everything it displays look better than on the iPhone's LCD display. Pictures, videos, and apps pop with inky blacks and vibrant (but not oversaturated) colors on the Pixel, which makes for a more premium and modern look overall. The Pixel has a clever way to add grip. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nI don't like cases, but I have to use one for my iPhone. As nice as the iPhone's metal back and edges are, they don't offer any grip, and I've dropped and dinged my iPhone a couple times as a result. \nThe glass inlay on the Pixel's back doesn't look particularly nice (it looks better on the white model), but it's actually a great grip for your index finger, which makes the Pixel feel more secure in your hands as you hold it. \nFast charging. SuperSaf TV/YouTube \nAbove, SuperSaf TV , a tech YouTube channel, tested the charging times of the Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus, and Galaxy S7 Edge with the chargers included in each phone's packaging. After two hours of charging, the Pixel XL is nearly 100 percent charged while the iPhone 7 Plus is dragging its feet at 72 percent. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S7 wiped the floor with the other two, having charged to 100 percent after an amazing one hour, 29 minutes. \nFast charging is actually a huge deal. The Pixel's USB-C fast charging is faster than the iPhone's comparatively slow charging, and it's one of the harder things to adjust to when I switch back to the iPhone. \nI can choose to make the Pixel work faster. \n\nI can adjust Android to make it feel faster than iOS by cutting down, or removing altogether, the animations when I open apps and swipe between screens. \niOS, on other hand, won't let me touch its animations. Pixel has better battery life, thanks to Android. \nAndroid's Doze feature is exceptionally effective. It does a fantastic job of reducing the Pixel's power consumption when I'm not using it compared to iOS on my iPhone. The Pixel is slightly smaller, but has the same size screen. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nThe difference is slight, but it's there and noticeable on a device you hold and use multiple times a day. \nThe iPhone is in the lower end in terms of screen-to-bezel ratio (67.7 percent) compared to the Pixel XL (71.2 percent). \nAntonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nI simply get along better with Android than I do with iOS. \nApple still hasn't figured out how to show me notifications in iOS as well as Android does. They're easier to manage from the Android lock screen, where I can clear notifications away with one swipe compared to iOS' swipe-and-tap to clear. I can also pull down on the notifications to peek at more details compared to iOS, too, which doesn't show me very much. \nNotifications also manage themselves better in Android. For example, when I open a new email or Hangouts conversation on my computer, Android will automatically clear those notifications on the Pixel, whereas the notification remains on my iPhone until I manually clear them. \nIt's also impossible in iOS to swipe up the control panel for things like changing the brightness when the on-screen keyboard is on. On Android, I can easily swipe down from the top of the screen to get access to the most important settings from any app, whether the keyboard is on or off. \nThe universal back-button that simply brings you back to the last screen or page you were on is incredibly useful, as it's always in the same place . On iOS, the back button for apps and screens can differ from app to app. \nThere's also the usual \"I can hide my apps in the app drawer and put them wherever I want on the home screen\" customization argument, which has been a classic Android argument since its release. \nFinally, for those who use voice-activated assistant, Google's Assistant has proven to be far more advanced than Siri, too.

      "title": "\"Unwatchable\" Saturday Night Live Actually Pretty Solid",
      "text": "Share on Google Plus Share on WhatsApp \nThe election may be over, but Saturday Night Live is still trying to convince everyone not to vote for Trump with another political cold open starring Alec Baldwin as the President-elect, this time poking fun at his tweeting habits. It's really impressive Kate McKinnon has morphed into Kellyanne Conway so she can stay at Alec's side post-election; but these cold opens are starting to feel a bit like watching someone beat a dead horse while salt is rubbed in your wounds. \n(Our TV Critic-elect, by the way, was not a fan. \"Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable!\" tweeted Donald J. Trump at 12:13am ET. \"Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad.\" Baldwin helpfully responded by tweeting back: \"Release your tax returns and I'll stop. Ha.\") \nThankfully Emma Stone as host was just the breath of fresh air we needed, with a charming monologue about how SNL was essentially her high school experience that let her walk through the backstage areas (don't you love it when we get to see the backstage areas?) \nAnd then this gem was given to the world: \nAn jaw-droopingly gorgeous pre-taped commercial of an 80's singing trio telling us the story of a candle that could be re-gifted called \"Christmas Candle\" was the best part of my holidays so far. It both looked amazing with some snazzy lo-fi-style filters to make it look more like old school television and they got REAL about re-gifting candles (and not making the mistake of pairing a candle with a lotion.) \nThis was the first of several world-class pre-taped segments. SNL has been slowly morphing into a non-live-action sketch show for some time now, and I am not complaining! From \"The Hunt For Hill\" (a parody of a supernatural investigation show looking for the former State Secretary in the Chappaqua woods like she's a cryptozoological creature such as Wendingo or Bigfoot, whatever, we'll take McKinnon's Hillary any way we can get it)... \n...to this surreal parody Playskool commercial selling a Well Playset for sensitive, introspective little boys... \n...Saturday Night Taped has frankly been knocking it out of the park. Although the live segments obviously still have the energy of uncertainty and surprise, like the cameo from Jennifer Aniston (there to plug her latest movie and looking none too thrilled about it) who joined Weekend Update to talk about Friends: \n...and stuck around for a Paley Fest round table where actresses discussed the difficulties of making it in Hollywood, where Kate McKinnon undeniably stole the scene. \nAll in all a solid offering, and as far as we're concerned the Candle Song belongs on the SNL holiday highlight reel right alongside \"Have a Happy Happy Hanukkah\" and \"I Wish It Was Christmas Today.\" \nNext SNL will return live on December 10th, hosted by John Cena with musical guest Maren Morris.",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nMon, Dec 5, 2016, 12:36 PM SGT - Singapore Markets close in 4 hrs 24 mins 8 reasons why Google’s Pixel is better than the iPhone By Antonio Villas-Boas | Business Insider – 14 hours ago Print Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider I’ve been using Google’s Pixel XL smartphone for a few weeks, and it’s been highlighting the iPhone’s glaringly lacking key features. \nYou should note that everything here is subjective. The iPhone has great features that the Pixel doesn’t have, and the Apple ecosystem is in a league of its own. \nBut damn the Pixel is good. \nYou should also note that I’m comparing the Pixel XL experience with my iPhone 6s and not the iPhone 7 series. That’s because I have more experience with the 6s Plus, as it’s been my phone for the last 9 months. On top of that, the iPhone 6s Plus isn’t that much different, as a whole, than the iPhone 7. The performance between both phones is still comparable, and the 7′s camera upgrades aren’t as important as some of the Pixel’s more functional features. \nCheck out what I think makes the Pixel a better phone than the iPhone: EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence. Get the Report Now » The Pixel is lighter. \nMy iPhone 6s Plus’ weight (192 grams) never bothered me until I picked up the Google Pixel XL (168 grams). The iPhone 7 Plus is slightly lighter than the 6s Plus at 188 grams, but only by 4 grams, so I’d still consider the 7 heavy compared to the Pixel. \nThe Pixel’s lighter weight has no ill effect on its reliability, and it’s easier to manage in your hands. The Pixel’s screen is stunning. \nAbove, the Pixel XL and iPhone 6s Plus are showing the same photo on full brightness (taken with the Pixel, by the way). The iPhone’s LCD screen is nice, but the colors aren’t as rich, and the contrast isn’t as pronounced as on the Pixel’s AMOLED display. \nThe Pixel’s design is more utilitarian than it is beautiful, but its sharper AMOLED screen outshines the iPhone’s Retina display. \nThe iPhone 7 Plus has a 1080p screen that’s fine and sharp enough, but the Pixel’s 1440p screen is sharper. \nMore importantly, the Pixel’s AMOLED screen makes everything it displays look better than on the iPhone’s LCD display. Pictures, videos, and apps pop with inky blacks and vibrant (but not oversaturated) colors on the Pixel, which makes for a more premium and modern look overall. The Pixel has a clever way to add grip. \nI don’t like cases, but I have to use one for my iPhone. As nice as the iPhone’s metal back and edges are, they don’t offer any grip, and I’ve dropped and dinged my iPhone a couple times as a result. \nThe glass inlay on the Pixel’s back doesn’t look particularly nice (it looks better on the white model), but it’s actually a great grip for your index finger, which makes the Pixel feel more secure in your hands as you hold it. \nFast charging. \nAbove, SuperSaf TV , a tech YouTube channel, tested the charging times of the Pixel XL, iPhone 7 Plus, and Galaxy S7 Edge with the chargers included in each phone’s packaging. After two hours of charging, the Pixel XL is nearly 100 percent charged while the iPhone 7 Plus is dragging its feet at 72 percent. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S7 wiped the floor with the other two, having charged to 100 percent after an amazing one hour, 29 minutes. \nFast charging is actually a huge deal. The Pixel’s USB-C fast charging is faster than the iPhone’s comparatively slow charging, and it’s one of the harder things to adjust to when I switch back to the iPhone. \nI can choose to make the Pixel work faster. \n\nI can adjust Android to make it feel faster than iOS by cutting down, or removing altogether, the animations when I open apps and swipe between screens. \niOS, on other hand, won’t let me touch its animations. Pixel has better battery life, thanks to Android. \nAndroid’s Doze feature is exceptionally effective. It does a fantastic job of reducing the Pixel’s power consumption when I’m not using it compared to iOS on my iPhone. The Pixel is slightly smaller, but has the same size screen. \nThe difference is slight, but it’s there and noticeable on a device you hold and use multiple times a day. \nThe iPhone is in the lower end in terms of screen-to-bezel ratio (67.7 percent) compared to the Pixel XL (71.2 percent). \nI prefer Android overall. \nI simply get along better with Android than I do with iOS. \nApple still hasn’t figured out how to show me notifications in iOS as well as Android does. They’re easier to manage from the Android lock screen, where I can clear notifications away with one swipe compared to iOS’ swipe-and-tap to clear. I can also pull down on the notifications to peek at more details compared to iOS, too, which doesn’t show me very much. \nNotifications also manage themselves better in Android. For example, when I open a new email or Hangouts conversation on my computer, Android will automatically clear those notifications on the Pixel, whereas the notification remains on my iPhone until I manually clear them. \nIt’s also impossible in iOS to swipe up the control panel for things like changing the brightness when the on-screen keyboard is on. On Android, I can easily swipe down from the top of the screen to get access to the most important settings from any app, whether the keyboard is on or off. \nThe universal back-button that simply brings you back to the last screen or page you were on is incredibly useful, as it’s always in the same place . On iOS, the back button for apps and screens can differ from app to app. \nThere’s also the usual “I can hide my apps in the app drawer and put them wherever I want on the home screen” customization argument, which has been a classic Android argument since its release. \nFinally, for those who use voice-activated assistant, Google’s Assistant has proven to be far more advanced than Siri, too.",

      "title": "Mastering the Owner Response to the Quintet of Google My Business Reviews - Moz",
      "text": "\nTwo dates to know: August 4, 2010 – the day Google enabled owner responses to Google My Business reviews; November 17, 2016 – the day Moz enabled incredibly easy GMB owner response functionality in the Moz Local dashboard . Why are these noteworthy events in Local Search history? \nBecause reviews and owner responses are direct reputation management, free marketing, free advertising, damage control, and quality control all wrapped up in one multi-voice song about your brand. \nWhat’s missing from the picture of this free-for-all of voices caroling sentiment about your brand? You are — the conductor ! If you’re not leading the tune — from setting customer service policies, to training staff, to managing complaints, to engaging directly with consumers online — you're giving up available reputation management controls. \nMake no mistake: No brand can prevent every sour note, but with owner response functionality, you can not only retune relationships with valuable customers, but can also protect revenue by keeping those customers instead of having to invest 25x as much in obtaining new ones. Owner response mastery is, indeed, smart business. \nFor the past six years, since Google launched owner responses as part of its local product, I’ve been studying them and acting as a consultant to a variety of local business owners and agencies regarding effective usage of this remarkable capability. Today, in celebration of Moz Local’s support of this function, I’m going to break down the types of reviews into 5 categories and offer you my tips for skilled management. With reputation and revenue on the line, every local brand needs an intelligent strategy! Getting up-to-speed on owner responses \nDuring our recent launch, a Moz community member let us know he'd never heard of owner responses before, so real quick: Many review platforms give you the option, as the business owner, to respond to reviews your customers have left you. This is normally done from within your dashboard on that platform, or, in some cases, via mobile apps . \nIn the Moz Local dashboard, the Google My Business owner response function is a real time-saver. We alert you when new reviews come in, and you simply click the ‘reply’ link to write your response. A little form pops up in which you can type away handily: \nNow let’s delve into responding to the five basic types of reviews most local brands can expect to receive. Type 1: “I love you!” Real-world example: \nDiagnosis: This is the customer every brand wants to have: the delighted evangelist who goes to the lengths of saying that nothing else on the local scene can compare to what the business offers. Honestly, reviews like this are like beautiful greeting cards validating that your business is getting it right on all points. Pure music to your ears! Owner response strategy: \nMany business owners ask if it’s necessary to respond to positive reviews. My short answer is yes , if you wish your business to come across as courteous and engaged. Part of conducting the flow of your reputation is acknowledging customer satisfaction and thanking them for the time they invest in writing such nice things about your company. It’s just good manners. \nHaving said this, I’ll qualify it by mentioning scale. If your enterprise has 100+ locations which each have 100+ positive Google My Business reviews, responding to every single one may not be the best use of your resources. Prevent the appearance of ungrateful neglect by aiming for a percentage — maybe 10% — of ‘thank yous’ in response to your best reviews. Pro tips: Your thanks can be brief, but avoid repetitiousness. Write a unique response each time. There are owner response profiles out there that have made me strongly suspect robots manage them, as in ‘thank you for your review’ written on 30 different responses. Avoid that. Remember that owner responses are content consumers read. They are, in essence, free advertising space. Don’t go over the top with this, but if a customer mentions something they love, latch onto that. In our sample review above, the owner could mention that comments like this one inspired them to bottle their hot sauce for retail sales, or they could mention that they actually just won a best-in-Bay-Area award from X publication. Think products, services, and hyperlocal/local terminology. No, don’t put the hard sell on the customer in the owner response, but use this real estate with savvy. If there’s something you think a happy customer would be excited to know, promote it in a nice, friendly way! Positive reviews indicate that a customer is already in a good, receptive mood. The more personable your owner response, the more of an impression your business can make, encouraging the customer to come back for more. Here, company culture, personality, and fun can shine. Your customer thinks you are special — act like it in the response. Suggested owner response: Hi Charley! We were just thrilled by your review — in fact, we showed it to Chef Rosa, because the pique sauce you love is based on her grandmother’s traditional recipe brought from Puerto Rico in the 1930s. It’s the real deal, and we’re actually offering it bottled for retail now right next to the hostess stand at both our San Rafael and San Francisco locations, based on diner requests. Hint: one secret ingredient is apple cider vinegar, but that’s all we can say! We’d love to see you back soon, and Chef Rosa says, “Thank you for the lovely compliment.” ‘Best in the Bay Area’ makes us all proud! Good Eating! Type 2: “My mind isn’t made up yet.” Real-world example: \nDiagnosis: A 3-star rating is the hallmark of the consumer who likes some things about your business, but isn’t totally loyal yet. They may/may not return and may/may not recommend you to others. Undecided patrons represent an exciting challenge to transform dissatisfactory aspects of your business and specific consumer sentiment, all at the same time. Owner response strategy: \nThe honesty of a less-than-5-star review, when written in detail, delivers two valuable assets to your brand: it tells you where you're hitting and where you're missing, giving you the opportunity to improve and turn a lukewarm consumer into a loyal one. \nStrategy for the owner response involves thanking for praise, accepting responsibility for faults, apologizing for disappointments, and making some kind of an offer. This offer, meant to sweeten the pitch that you hope the consumer will give your company a second chance, could be a comp or a coupon for future use, or it could simply be an explanation of how you have heard their feedback and made changes. Pro tips: Express gratitude for consumer complaints — they are valuable. Do not attempt to shift blame onto anyone else, including the customer or staff members. Document both the positive and negative sentiment of so-so reviews and use it as your playbook for keeping what’s good and improving what isn’t excellent. Be sure the customer feels heard. Cite their complaints back to them. By doing so, you are demonstrating to all future potential customers that your brand is responsive to feedback. Suggested owner response: Dear Yesenia, We’re so grateful to you for letting us know that our prices, staff, and in-hotel restaurants pleased you, and, I also want to express my thanks to you for mentioning that the housekeeping wasn’t exceptional. I need to hear that, and take full responsibility for the dusty room. I have been trying a variety of cleaning services this past year, with the goal of finding the best. While I want to be sure that every guest knows we honor any requests during their stay (just dial 9 on your in-room phone), I also want to let you know that, based on your comments, I held an all-staff meeting with our current cleaning service and have issued a new 10-point cleaning checklist (including dusting all surfaces) for each housekeeper. Should you honor us with a second stay, I personally guarantee you will find your room immaculate, and I would also like to offer your party a free breakfast in the Palm Room, as you enjoyed our restaurants. Just tell them Rob sent you, and it will be our pleasure to serve you! Thank you for your valuable and honest review. Cordially, Type 3: “There was hair in my taco...” Real-world example: \nDiagnosis: The dreaded 1-star review! The customer has a specific, legitimate complaint, and your job as the owner is to address their dissatisfaction, take responsibility, and, whenever possible, make an offer to make things right. A negative review is likely the last life preserver an unhappy customer will throw you — a last chance to earn them back with superior responsiveness. Given the cost of replacing them, rewards for the effort can be great. When a customer ‘saves you’ by making their complaints known, an adept response from you may ‘save them’ in return, earning their repeat business. Pro tips: Apologize!!! Say the words, “I’m sorry, I apologize.” No blame shifting, no lectures — just total accountability, humility, and a willingness to learn. Be as honest as possible about whatever circumstance led to the customer’s bad experience , and state what you're doing to improve that circumstance. Sometimes, the circumstances may include faults on the customer’s part. If you have to mention these in order to be honest, do so with great care and no blame, as in the sample response below. Negative reviews often run on for agonizing paragraphs and chapters, but your response should not. Be thorough, but concise. Offer something , even if it’s just a few minutes of your time on the phone, to try to make it right. Aim for a ‘wow’ factor — as in you want future potential customers to say, “Wow, this business really cares!” when they read the response. For more tips on managing negative reviews, please read Diagramming The Story of a 1 Star Review . Document all complaints; they are incredibly valuable both in terms of damage control and quality control. Consider doing a full review audit on a set schedule to catch emerging problems and resolve them. Suggested owner response: Dear Vivi, This is Dr. Tom, and I want to begin by apologizing for the inconvenience you experienced. I hate to think of you having wasted both time and gas on this. I’m so sorry. I regret that you missed the message about hours for the shot clinic on our homepage, and your review has made me concerned that other patients may be missing it, too. Thanks for alerting me to this. Here’s what we’ve done: Enlarged the homepage hours message + included those hours in the header of every website page Put this at the top of our Facebook page Updated our off-hours phone message to include the info that folks need to come in by 3:00 to ensure walk-in service. Will you give me a second chance to make this right for you? It’s so important that your pet gets proper shots. Please phone and let my receptionist know Dr. Tom is offering you a priority appointment, any day of the week, and I’d like to make friends with your pup by treating him to one of our wonderful new chew toys. Hoping to have the great pleasure of caring for you and your awesome companion animal! Kindly, Type 4: “I’m actually your competitor.” Real-world example: \nDiagnosis: Unfortunately, fake reviews happen . They may stem from unscrupulous competitors, disgruntled past employees, or individuals with personal grudges against someone at the company. The line to walk here is whether the reviews are simply false (warranting a response + Google action) or citing such defamatory or illegal practices that you should consult with a lawyer before taking any further action. Our real-world example is of the former kind — it illustrates what a fake review might look like with sentiment that is negative but not accusing the business of criminal activity. Pro tips: If research has made you aware that a review has been left by a competitor or by someone who is not a customer, that’s a violation of Google’s Review Policy . First, leave a brief owner response to the review (as shown in my sample response below) to alert consumers to the falsity of the review. Note: I don’t advise ‘outing’ the bad actor — it’s not professional. Second, follow Google’s steps for flagging the review . I suggest waiting 24 hours after doing this before moving on. Next, on that same page, you will see options for speaking directly with Google via phone, chat, or email. Contact Google to let them know about the fake review you have flagged. Hopefully, they will be able to rectify this for you and remove the review. However, if you get a rep who doesn’t seem to understand your issue, turn to the Google My Business Community , post the complete details of your scenario, and beg for a Top Contributor to help escalate your issue. Don’t expect a quick fix. You may have to be persistent to obtain resolution. But, again, please don’t take these steps if a review accuses your business of something illegal. We’ll cover that, below, in Type 5. Suggested owner response: To Our Valued Customers, Sadly, after researching this, our company discovered that this review was left by a competitor. We are taking the appropriate steps to report this to Google, and we hope having this fake review removed will encourage this unfortunate competitor to seek other, more honest forms of promoting his business. If he persists, we will engage appropriate legal counsel. SMH, Type 5: “I’m citing illegal stuff.” Real-world example: \nDiagnosis: Whether a negative review is true or false, any time illegal or dangerous behavior is cited, it’s a cue to you that you need to speak with an attorney before taking any further steps. Don’t respond and don’t attempt to have the review removed, as both could be used as evidence in a court of law . Seek an attorney well-versed in cyber law and act on his or her advice, rather than on any advice you may read on the Internet or receive from marketers, friends, etc. And if you run an SEO agency, I urge you not to advise clients on Type 5 reviews — we’re SEOs, not attorneys, and shouldn’t be consulting on legal matters. Orchestrating the ideal owner response environment \nIf you already have an excellent customer service training program in place at your business, chances are good that you will mostly be managing Type 1 and Type 2 reviews with only the occasional Type 3. Types 4 and 5 will hopefully be the exception rather than the rule. Given that one 2016 survey found that 57% of consumer complaints relate to employee behavior , we can estimate that at least half of your reputation is anchored to the quality of your staff hiring and training practices. So, definitely place first and fundamental focus there, and then manage the ensuing consumer sentiment as it flows in with these tips: Observe the typical rate at which you normally receive reviews. It could be a few per week, or if you’re managing multiple locations, numerous reviews per day. What you observe dictates how frequently you need to monitor your reviews . If you’re a Moz Local customer, we’ll conveniently alert you as each new review comes in, and you can check that as often as makes sense. Avoid unnecessary customer frustration and bad reviews stemming from bad data. There must be literally millions of negative reviews on the web citing wrong phone numbers, wrong hours of operations, wrong addresses. Do a quick citation health check to see if your major local business listings are fomenting negative sentiment. Correct problems. I’ve seen various theories about how quickly an owner should respond to reviews; my own opinion is ASAP, particularly when it comes to Type 2 and Type 3 reviews. If you are trying to catch complaints for the purpose of resolving them and winning back unhappy customers, there may be circumstances (like our example with the puppy shots) that make it vital to respond quickly to avoid customer loss. While it may be ideal to have owners be the authors of all owner responses, scale may make that an untenable situation. If you are designating a staff member or marketer to represent the owner, prevent mistakes by clearly outlining company policies, voice, permissions, and objectives with that person. Responsiveness can be a competitive difference maker. Observe your direct competitors; if they are careless about active management of reviews, you can take advantage by making your brand the one that always responds, demonstrating care and accessibility. Know that expert owner responders experience thrilling victories, like having an unhappy customer update their review and raise their star ratings after receiving a great owner reply. These are rewards that make the input of effort well worth it! \nSix years into Google’s rollout of the owner response function, I still encounter many business owners expressing fear of reviews. At the root of this, I often find that they feel powerless and overwhelmed by the prospect of managing their brand’s reputation. \nIt’s my hope that this post signals to every local business owner that you do, indeed, have significant power in this regard. Via the the right combination of skilled customer service and active review management, you can orchestrate an exceptional online reputation for your brand in concert with your customers, in harmony with your professional goals and dreams.

      "text": "print DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman. Business Insider/Sam Shead \nDeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman once again refused to say who sits on Google's mysterious AI ethics board on Monday despite having previously said he wants to disclose it to the public. \nThe board was quietly created in 2014 when Google acquired the London artificial intelligence lab. It was established in a bid to ensure that the self-thinking software DeepMind and Google is developing remains safe and of benefit to humanity. \nSpeaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Suleyman said: \"So look, I’ve said many times, we want to be as innovative and progressive and open with our governance as we are with our technology. \n\"It’s no good for us to just be technologists in a vacuum independently of the social and political consequences, build technologies that we think may or may not be useful, while we throw them over the wall. \n\"So we’ve been experimental in that respect. The ethics board is ongoing and it’s something that we have internally to oversee some of our efforts. But we’ve also tried other approaches. Most recently we got together with Amazon, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, and Google to start the Partnership on AI to look at how we develop and share best practices and deploy machine learning systems well.\" \nWhen pressed on the composition of Google's AI ethics board, Suleyman said: \"We’ve always said that it's going to be very much focused on full general purpose learning systems and I think that’s very, very, far away. We’re decades and decades away from the kind of risks that the board initially envisaged. We’re putting in place a variety of other mechanisms that focus on the near term consequences.\" \nLast year, Suleyman said he wanted to publish the names of the people who sit on the board. \"We will [publicise the names], but that isn’t the be-all and end-all,\" he said at Bloomberg's UK HQ in London. \"It’s one component of the whole apparatus.\" \nAt the time, Suleyman said Google was building a team of academics, policy researchers, economists, philosophers, and lawyers to tackle the ethics issue, but currently had only three or four of them focused on it. The company was looking to hire experts in policy, ethics and law, he said. \nWhen asked by a member of the audience at Bloomberg what gave Google the right to choose the who sits on the AI ethics board without any public oversight, Suleyman said: \"That’s what I said to Larry [Page, Google’s cofounder]. I completely agree. Fundamentally we remain a corporation and I think that’s a question for everyone to think about. We’re very aware that this is extremely complex and we have no intention of doing this in a vacuum or alone.\" \nA number of high-profile technology leaders and scientists have concerns about where the technology being developed by DeepMind and companies like it can be taken. Full AI — a conscious machine with self-will — could be \"more dangerous than nukes,\" according to PayPal billionaire Elon Musk , who invested in DeepMind because of his \"Terminator fears .\" \nElsehwere, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has insisted that AI is a threat and world-famous scientist Stephen Hawking said AI could end mankind . It's important to note that some of these soundbites were taken during much longer interviews so they may not reflect the wider views of the individuals that made them but it's fair to say there are still big concerns about AI's future. \nMedia and academics have called on DeepMind and Google to reveal who sits on Google's AI ethics board so the debate about where the technology they're developing can be carried out in the open, but so far Google and DeepMind's cofounders have refused.",

      "text": "The European Commission this week called on Facebook, Twitter, and other major tech companies to more aggressively police online hate speech or else face new legislation that would force them to do so. As The Financial Times reports , a study commissioned by Věra Jourová, the EU justice commissioner, found that Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, and Microsoft have largely struggled to comply with a voluntary code of conduct on hate speech announced earlier this year. \nEuropean governments have pressured tech companies to more proactively curb hate speech and incitement to terrorism, amid heightened racial tensions and national security concerns. The government-led effort has been particularly aggressive in Germany, where the ongoing refugee crisis has sparked a xenophobic backlash that has reinvigorated the far-right. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas recently said that Facebook should be treated as a media company, which would make it liable for any hate speech published to its platform. \n“They will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months.” Under a code of conduct announced in May, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft agreed to review and respond to “the majority” of hate speech complaints within 24 hours. According to the commission’s report, however, only 40 percent of recorded incidents were reviewed within 24 hours. After 48 hours, that figure rose to 80 percent, according to both The Financial Times and Reuters . \n“This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies,\" a commission official told Reuters. The code of conduct has come under criticism from rights groups who have argued that it delegates disproportionate responsibility to private companies, rather than governments.\nAmong the tech companies that agreed to the code of conduct, YouTube was the fastest to respond to complaints, while Twitter was the slowest, according to The Financial Times . Removal rates were above 50 percent in France and Germany, but just 11 percent and 4 percent in Austria and Italy, respectively. \nSpeaking to The Financial Times , Jourová said that tech companies may face new laws to curb hate speech if their voluntary efforts prove unsatisfactory. EU justice ministers will meet on Thursday to discuss the report’s findings. \n“If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourová told the newspaper.",

      "text": "EU to tech industry: Remove hate speech faster or we'll make you Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft aren't delivering on promises to pull harmful messages within 24 hours. Save JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images \nDespite agreeing to crack down on the spread of hate speech across their networks earlier this year , four of the world's biggest technology companies aren't delivering on their promises, Reuters reports . A review conducted by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova found that Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft failed to flag and remove offensive content within 24 hours, with less than half of cases being responded to in that timeframe. If they don't improve their response times, new legislation could be introduced to force them to do so. \n\"In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,\" a Commission official told Reuters . \"After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.\" \nIn May, Facebook, Twitter, Google (specifically YouTube) and Microsoft signed a voluntary code of conduct that would standardize the way users report hate speech and allow law enforcement agencies to act swiftly on harmful content. This included the removal of such content within 24 hours. They also committed to support educational programs and promote \"independent counter-narratives\" to hateful messages. \nAccording to the Financial Times , the report found that ( unsurprisingly ) Twitter was slowest to respond while YouTube was fastest. Jourová didn't single out Twitter, though, choosing to direct her ire at all of the companies involved: \"If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,\" she told the paper on Sunday. \nJustice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. Also on the agenda will be a discussion on how the companies are tackling \"terrorist propaganda\" and what evidence they can provide to help make convictions.",

The Blink XT will be making its in-person debut at CES in January and will start shipping the following month, but company’s offering up pretty much all you need to know about the thing right now. \nOn the face of it, the XT looks fairly similar to its predecessor, maintaining the same square form factor, but sporting a new black coat of paint. The camera also maintains the stated two-year battery life of the earlier version, (using two AAs) quite possibly the simple camera’s strongest selling point. \nThe new version bring an IP-65 waterproof rating – a necessity for any outdoor product, along with infrared shooting to catch activity at night. The camera shoots in 1080p and uses the same cloud-based software solution as its predecessor, so those who own an indoor Blink can add this to their existing home system. \nAs for what the XT doesn’t have – LTE is the biggest standout. After all, WIFI signals tend to get pretty spotty outside the walls of a house. And like the standard Blink, it’s got a pretty basic feature set to compared to a number of higher-end security cams out there. \nAt $119, it’s pricier than the regular Blink, but still pretty affordable as far as outdoor cameras go. And if you’re really feeling like playing Big Brother, the company will throw in a fee XT with the purchase of a five camera bundle. 0",

      "text": "Google's new Trusted Contacts app puts safety first Google's new Trusted Contacts app puts safety first The search giant's goal: getting you out of sketchy situations with an app that can ping certain people your exact location. \nWith Google's new Trusted Contacts app, certain people can request to see your exact location. Photo by Google \nGoogle is trying to reinvent the emergency contact form for the smartphone era. \nThe search giant on Monday unveiled a new app called Trusted Contacts , which aims to keep you safe in dicey situations -- anything from a natural disaster to a walk home on a dark street. \nThe app, only available for now on phones running Google's Android mobile software, allows you to give certain people you trust your exact location at a moment's notice, through your phone's GPS system. If you're in a place with a bad cell signal, those people will be able to see if your phone is offline. They can also see if your battery is dead. (Nervous parents, rejoice.) \n\"This thing really can be a powerful sensor to make sure you're okay,\" said David Tattersall, a Google product manager, holding up a phone during a briefing last week. \"We're actually going to help some people, and potentially save some lives.\" \nSilicon Valley companies have been getting more involved with people's personal safety, as they make more use of their massive user bases and vast technological networks to help the public. For example, Facebook has a feature called Safety Check , which it deploys during natural disasters and other emergencies. Safety Check lets people in disaster areas post on the social network that they are safe, so their friends need not worry. Google also has a crisis response webpage with a map for weather emergencies and other disasters. \nHere's how the Trusted Contacts app works: You can designate friends and family special \"trusted\" status in the app. The limit is 50 people, though most people will probably select 5 or 6, such as parents or a spouse. When those people open the app, they can see if you're \"active\" -- that is, your phone is getting reception and you've been moving about the world. If you've been staying put or your phone is offline, the app will tell your contacts the last time you were active. \nIf, say, there's been an earthquake or you've been MIA too long without any contact, you can ping those people your exact location to let them know you're safe. Or they can ping you asking you to share your location. You can either share it or deny. \nBut if you don't reply within five minutes, the app automatically sends that person your location. If your phone is offline when the five minutes expire, the app will direct that person to your last known whereabouts. \nOnce you share your location, your trusted contact will be able to see where you are on a map and track your movement. Google says that's good for a late night walk home, so a loved one can see that you got from point A to point B. When you're sharing your location, you'll see a massive banner on your lock screen with a map on it, so you won't forget you're being tracked. \nLikely worried about privacy issues, Google emphasized that Trusted Contacts is an opt-in program, and you can tweak your settings to grant and revoke a person's \"trusted\" status at any time. You'll get email alerts any time you make those changes. \nThe big drawback for the app is that it's only available for now on Android phones. That means if your husband or wife is an iPhone user, he or she can't be your trusted contact. Tattersall said Google is working on an iPhone version, but declined to give a timeline for its release.

      "text": "News \nOver the past couple of years, we've seen many iterations on the personal safety app, but the gist has always remained the same: choose a few persons you trust to share your location with all the time, or at least when you feel the need or they request it. Now Google is releasing its own official take on the matter, Trusted Contacts, and part of me is wishing this app or its functionality at least becomes integrated in all Android phones from now on. \nTrusted Contacts doesn't deviate a lot from the formula: you add your closest friends and/or family members as trusted contacts so they can: Easily see your status: if you've moved recently or you're online, it shows you were \"active recently\" to stop them from freaking out if they can't reach you. Request your location: the request shows up on your phone and you can deny it if everything is good and you're just busy, or if it goes unanswered for 5 minutes, the request passes through and your last known location is sent to them, even if you are offline now. Share your location for a period of time: if you're feeling unsafe or you tend to go to risky places or stay out at risky times, you can choose a contact to share your location with for a specific amount of time until you're safe again. Next \nTrusted Contacts is live on the Play Store now and seems to be available to everyone, but we'll update the post with the APK when we have it. Go ahead and install it now on your phone and ask your family and friends to do so too, because this is the kind of app where by the time you wish you had it, it could already be too late.",

      "text": "Google and Elon Musk open their AI platforms to researchers DeepMind Lab and OpenAI's Universe give scientists a way to test their AI \"agents.\" Share Save \nArtificial intelligence got a big push today as both Google and OpenAI announced plans to open-source their deep learning code. Elon Musk's OpenAI released Universe , a software platform that \"lets us train a single [AI] agent on any task a human can complete with a computer.\" At the same time, Google parent Alphabet is putting its entire DeepMind Lab training environment codebase on GitHub, helping anyone train their own AI systems. \nDeepMind first burrowed into the public consciousness by defeating a world champion at the notoriously difficult game Go. However, to advance deep learning further, Alphabet says that such AI \"agents\" require highly detailed environments to serve as laboratories for AI research. The company is now open-sourcing that environment, called DeepMind Lab, to any programmers that want to use it. \n\"DeepMind Lab is a fully 3D game-like platform tailored for agent-based AI research,\" Alphabet said in a blog . The agent floats around the environment, levitating and moving via thrusters, with a virtual camera that can track around its \"body.\" Google describes some of the chores it can do: \nExample tasks include collecting fruit, navigating in mazes, traversing dangerous passages while avoiding falling off cliffs, bouncing through space using launch pads to move between platforms, playing laser tag, and quickly learning and remembering random procedurally generated environments. \nThe first-person 3D environment, Alphabet explains, should make for smarter AI. \"If you or I had grown up in a world that looked like Space Invaders or Pac-Man , it doesn't seem likely we would have achieved much general intelligence.\" \nAn example of a the kind of decision-making is shown in the video below, where an agent foregoes tasty apples in favor of a bitter lemon, in order to get the ultimate reward (melon). (As a more specific example, Alphabet recently announced a partnership with Activision Blizzard, letting AI researchers attempt to build an AI agent that can master Starcraft II .) \nIt's not likely coincidental that OpenAI, spearheaded by Elon Musk, happens to be releasing a very similar platform called Universe at the same time. Like DeepMind Lab, the idea is to give researchers a way to test and train their agents. OpenAI's aim is pretty ambitious -- the release consists of \"a thousand environments including Flash games, browser tasks and games like slither.io and GTA V.\" In its blog, the group expresses its aim: \nOur goal is to develop a single AI agent that can flexibly apply its past experience on Universe environments to quickly master unfamiliar, difficult environments, which would be a major step towards general intelligence. \nOpenAI says that deep learning systems are too specialized: \"[DeepMind's] AlphaGo can easily defeat you at Go, but you can't explain the rules of a different board game to it and expect it to play with you.\" As such, it's using Universe to allow AI to run a lot of different types of tasks, \"so they can develop world knowledge and problem solving strategies that can be efficiently reused in a new task.\" \nA single Python script can drive 20 different 1,024 x 768 environments at 60 fps simultaneously. In the first Universe release, those environments include Atari 2600 games, Flash games and Browser tasks like searching for a flight. Since the agent uses a virtual mouse, keyboard and screen like a human, it can do anything we can on a computer, and the plan is to eventually run them through more complex games and tasks. An OpenAI \"agent\" plays \"Dusk Drive\" \nOpenAI has already received permission from EA, Microsoft Studios, Valve and other companies to freely access games like Wing Commander III , Portal and Rimworld for learning. It's reaching out to other companies, researchers and users, seeking \"permission on your games, training agents across Universe tasks, (soon) integrating new games, or (soon) playing the games. \nThe DeepMind Lab repository will go live on GitHub later this week (look for the link here ) and OpenAI's Universe is now available . Both companies say they want to keep their AI systems open, but reading between the lines, they have selfish reasons for doing so. AI has now progressed to the point that a lot more learning data is needed, so normally insular tech companies are now forced to collaborate with the outside world.",

      "text": "  \nGoogle introduced a new safety app on Monday that allows your closest friends and family members to see your location, even when your phone is offline. \nThe app, called Trusted Contacts, is intended to “help you feel safe and give your friends and family peace of mind,” according to a statement. \nTo use the service, you designate contacts with whom you want to share your location. If traveling or hiking, you can send a notification to the contacts to let them know you have safely arrived at their destination. \nFriends and family who are part of this trusted list can also request to see your location. If you are safe, you can deny the request, but if you don't respond within a certain amount of time the location will be sent to the person who requested it. \nTravelers will be able to use this app to let their friends know that they’ve landed at their destination, arrived at their hotel, or even summited the top of a mountain. \nIt could be especially useful for solo travelers , as the app can help rescue services locate a person even if their phone is offline. \nFacebook has used its own similar safety check that allows users to mark themselves safe in the wake of a natural disaster, terror attack or other such event. Unlike Facebook's check-in feature, however, users do not have to actively do anything, or even be online for their trusted contacts to find out where they are in an emergency. \nThe app is only available for Android , though an iOS version will be available soon, according to the same press release.",

      "text": "Google removes autocomplete suggestions about Jews, women Google removes autocomplete suggestions about Jews, women The search giant will no longer suggest you search whether these groups are \"evil.\" \nGoogle suggests the word \"bad\" to complete a search query that starts, \"Are Muslims...\" The company took down two other autocomplete suggestions on Friday but left this one as is. Photo by Screenshot by Laura Hautala/CNET \nIf you have a burning desire to ask two specific questions in a Google search, you'll have to type them all the way out. \nOn Friday, Google removed autocomplete suggestions from its search engine that suggested the word \"evil\" at the end of these two phrases: \"Are Jews...\" and \"Are women...\" It left in place, however, the suggestion of \"bad\" when users type in \"Are Muslims...\" \nThe autocomplete feature is Google's way of finishing your sentences, guessing what you want to search for. The company has deleted autocomplete suggestions in the past, including when a court ordered it to stop suggesting the word \"torrent\" after the names of popular recording artists. \nSometimes Google's suggestions are wacky or telling, like \"Is Tacoma... a city?\" (Answer: um... yes.) But the searches pondering the evilness of Jews and women led to search results that were -- not surprisingly -- anti-semitic and misogynistic. \nOne of the top hits for \"Are women evil\" leads to a post on a bodybuilding forum about how women are all indeed evil, \"In that they're only there until somebody comes and takes them from you or for as long as you have the resources to keep them.\" \nAnd for the query about Jews, the results are slightly more mixed. They include both a result from white nationalist website Stormfront saying Jews have inherited traits that lead them into usury and \"a loathing for 'productive labor,'\" and an article from Jewish magazine Tablet pondering why Jews are \"increasingly unwelcome in the 21st century.\" \nGoogle confirmed to the Guardian and the Telegraph that it removed the autocomplete suggestions from the search engine, telling the publications that its autocomplete suggestions are based on the search engine's algorithms. \nThe company did not respond to a request for comment and an explanation of how frequently it removes autocomplete suggestions or the criteria it uses to do so.
