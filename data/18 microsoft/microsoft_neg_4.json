      "text": "Microsoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store \nTo use the technology, a user should launch the Maps app and open the AR feature that activates the rear camera. The mapping system then works by correlating data from several components of the iPhone like the digital compass, gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS. The system is also said to provide users with a seamless AR experience when switching from live video to bird’s eye view. \nIn the patent, augmented reality is described as a technology that supplements reality with additional information. The implementation of this technology would be visible in the points of interest and objects that will appear on top of a video feed of the surroundings. In terms of its practicality, the “augmented reality maps” are said to come in handy for users visiting a foreign city. \nThe emergence of this new patent comes months after Tim Cook exclusively spoke with ABC News’ “Good Morning America” and revealed that augmented reality (AR) is going to be the bigger technology than virtual reality (VR) in the near future. \n\"There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality -- both of these are incredibly interesting, but my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far,” Cook said at the time. \"Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time.”",

      "text": "Microsoft developed its personal assistant, Cortana, as a method of making its computers and smartphones a little bit more personal. Now, a new patent may have unveiled how the company plans to make the virtual assistant engage in more natural conversation with users.\nIn April, Microsoft filed for a patent with the title Providing Personalized Greetings on a Digital Assistant. The purpose of this technology is seemingly to allow Cortana to deliver more personalized greetings based on user-specific and contextual pieces of information, according to a report from MS Power User .\n“A goal of the personalized greeting system described herein is to mimic a human experience with the user,” reads the application, which was made public on November 3. “Providing the same greeting to the user twice in one day is not typical of how the user would be greeted by a human.”\nMore: Some Windows Insiders report Cortana is getting some secret upgrades\nThe documentation goes on to give an example where Cortana might peek at a user’s personal information in order to give them a happy birthday message on the appropriate date. The patent also describes a mechanism where the assistant would know not to repeat that message a second time, even if the user had transitioned to another Windows 10 device.\nA ranking system would be used to prioritize different greetings based on information related to the user’s interests. News content like the performance of a particular sports team, or a local weather forecast, would also feed into the range of greetings Cortana would have access to.\nIt certainly seems like Cortana is set to receive an upgrade to her conversational skills in the not-too-distant future — but it’s less clear when this functionality will be introduced. It’s possible that it could be part of the Creators Update scheduled for March, but we already know that Microsoft has more than one major Windows 10 update planned for next year, so we might have to wait a little longer.\nSome Windows Insiders report Cortana is getting some secret upgrades Everything you need to know about Google Assistant Many Windows 10 users won’t see Anniversary Update until November",

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank  25   \nEarlier this year, Microsoft made a splash at its Ignite conference for IT professionals when it announced that it has been racking cards of programmable chips together with servers in its cloud data centers. \nThe chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), can be reconfigured after being deployed to optimize them for particular applications such as networking and machine learning. \nNow, Microsoft is investing in tools that would allow customers to program the FPGAs, said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise division, during a talk at the Structure conference in San Francisco. \nUsing those tools could help increase performance of workloads that the chips are deployed to tackle. Guthrie said he hopes businesses will see performance improvements between two or three orders of magnitude using FPGAs compared to CPUs or GPUs. \nThere are issues with just giving people raw access to the FPGAs, though. \n\"When something goes wrong, you really need to be able to debug that quickly,\" Guthrie said.\"Because it's hardware, it could brick the machine, there are lots of things that we've had to learn how to protect against.\" \nThat said, there's an advantage to be gained from using FPGAs for business applications. \nRight now, the FPGAs are being used to power Azure's Accelerated Networking feature, as well as Microsoft products like Bing. They have the ability to radically speed up some computation. \nDoug Burger, a Microsoft researcher who helped spearhead the FPGA project, said that the company's entire deployment could be used to translate all of English-language Wikipedia in a tenth of a second. \nActually writing code for the FPGAs is something that would likely appeal to a small subset of businesses. But for those companies that want access, Microsoft's cloud platform could become a more interesting choice. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "windows 10 \nMicrosoft wasn't happy last week when Google revealed a critical Windows vulnerability that had yet to be patched. The company claimed that Google's disclosure put customers \"at potential risk,\" and was set to issue a patch come this month's Patch Tuesday. \nWell, Patch Tuesday has arrived, and Microsoft has issued an update that addresses the vulnerability. The security bulletin , rated as 'important', addresses multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities including the one exposed by Google last week. \nThe vulnerability in question, which could be triggered via a win32k.sys system call, could allow an attacker to exit Windows 10's sandbox and gain administrator privileges. At the time of disclosure, Google claimed the \"particularly serious\" vulnerability was being actively exploited and urged users to both update Adobe Flash and Windows 10 as soon as possible. \nGoogle revealed details of the vulnerability to the public seven days after privately notifying Microsoft, as per their policy on actively exploited critical vulnerabilities. \nPatch Tuesday also includes a number of critical security patches that affect all versions of Windows, plus several other important patches and updates for both Internet Explorer and Edge.

      "text": "In June, 2016, Microsoft rebranded its SmartGlass “second screen” app for Android and iOS in June, 2016, as the “Xbox” app. The new app was redesigned to resemble the modern Xbox One interface, which had itself been retouched to look more like Windows 10. The app’s homepage, for example, now shows a detailed activity feed similar to the console’s, so players can see game clips and screenshots shared by their friends on Xbox Live. It’s an update that’s been a long time coming, as SmartGlass was a fickle companion for years.\nRelated: Halo on PC? Here’s how to do it, with Game Streaming in Windows 10\nSimilar to Sony’s PlayStation app, the Xbox app allows users to purchase games, share updates, view their achievements, and share updates with the their followers on Xbox Live. It also provides additional tools for viewing achievements, controlling movie playback, and accessing social elements such as profiles and messaging.\nAll it takes to gain complete control over your Xbox experience is a little bit of patience. The process for pairing your devices is now easier than ever, so read on for our quick-hit guide on how to connect your smartphone to an Xbox One, regardless if you’re using Android or iOS.\nStep 1: Download the Xbox app View photos\nxbox-app-screen-2 More Before downloading the Xbox app for iOS or Android , you’ll want to update your smartphone or tablet to the latest version of its respective operating system. iOS users need version 8.0 or higher and Android users will need version 4.0 or higher. Once updated, head over to either iTunes or Google Play store and enter “Xbox” in the search field to locate the app.\nTap the Install button to begin downloading the app to your smartphone or tablet, and launch it once installed. Then, sign into your Xbox account when prompted.\nDownload for:\niOS Android\nStep 2: Connect to your network View photos\nxbox-app-screen-3 More Navigate to Network settings on your Xbox One — and your network preferences on your smartphone — and ensure they’re connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If your Xbox One is not connected, select Set up wireless network , choose your desired network, and enter the respective password if prompted. Obviously, both devices must also be within range of your network to connect.\nWe recommend connecting your smartphone and your Xbox One to the same wireless network, as it will strengthen the connection. However, it is possible to use your cellular network to connect as well.\nStep 3: Sync your smartphone with your console View photos\nxbox-app-screen-1 More While using the Xbox app, tap the three horizontal bars in the upper-left corner to bring up the main menu. From here, you can access most features, but for now, just tap Connection . After a second, a Connect to your Xbox One option should appear near the top of the screen.\nTapping that should bring up a list of available Xbox consoles that you can connect to. Assuming yours is the only one on the list, tap the icon — labeled “Xbox-SystemOS, unless you’ve renamed it– and then “Turn on.” Voila! Your smartphone and your Xbox are now soulmates. You should now be able to use your smartphone as a controller and keyboard, though this functionality is limited to the Xbox OS. There’s currently no in-game, second-screen integration.\nStep 4: Use the app View photos\nxbox-app-screen-4 More Connecting is easy, but learning how to use the Xbox app takes a little time and understanding. Again, tapping the three horizontal bars in the upper-left corner of the app will bring up the menu, which allows you to view your profile and achievements, your recorded clips and screenshots, and access the Xbox Store, among other options. Tapping your avatar icon will bring up your friends list, while the icons next door control messages and notifications, respectively.\nBuy an Xbox One S bundle with a free game and $50 credit The best of the last-gen: Our 15 favorite Xbox 360 games The best Xbox One compatible Xbox 360 games",

      "text": "0 0 \nThe second Monthly Rollup for Windows 7 is now available for download. This update brings many security updates and quality improvements, but no new operating system features. \nWindows 7 Monthly Rollup KB3197868 brings security updates to the following Windows components: Microsoft Graphics Component, kernel-mode drivers, Microsoft Video Control, common log file system driver, Windows authentication methods, Windows operating system , Windows File Manager, Windows registry , OpenType, Internet Explorer 11, and Windows Component. \nFor the time being, the support page for KB3197868 is not available yet. In other words, we don’t really know what the specific security improvements are. Most likely, the support page should be available tomorrow since Microsoft usually publishes it 24 hours after updates hit the spotlight. \nMany users will definitely wait until tomorrow before installing the latest Windows 7 updates. Judging by users’ Windows 7 update experience, this is the best decision to take. Windows updates often bring issues of their own, and users need to know what they install before hitting the update button. \nMonthly Rollup KB3197868 also includes the content of the latest Windows 7 update, KB3197867. Again, the support page for KB3197867 is not available, so the exact content of this update remains unknown. Microsoft’s Update Catalog describes the update rather vaguely: \nA security issue has been identified in a Microsoft software product that could affect your system. You can help protect your system by installing this update from Microsoft. For a complete listing of the issues that are included in this update, see the associated Microsoft Knowledge Base article. \nWe’ll update this article as soon as Microsoft reveals the complete listing of the issues included in these updates. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft offers up to $750 off a new Surface if you trade-in an old MacBook \nRose Behar \nNovember 8, 2016 5:22pm \nMicrosoft is setting its sights squarely on Apple’s laptop customer base with a new trade-in offer that gives buyers up to $750 off a new Surface for trading in an old MacBook Pro or Air. \nTo take advantage of the offer, buyers can visit the company’s dedicated trade-in page to determine how much they’ll receive, then send in their device. Upon receipt, Microsoft will send an email to the customer with a special promo code that discounts the Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book by the amount promised. \nEligible MacBooks are listed on the trade-in page. Clicking on the particular model will bring potential buyers to a page where they are required to answer whether it works and whether they still have the charger in order to calculate the value. \nThe newer MacBook Pros bring in the most, generally ranging from around $400 CAD to $650 CAD, though we were unable to dig up which model in particular was worth $750. The highest trade-in value we found was $700, brought in by models including the Apple MacBook Pro Retina A1398 ME293LL/A 15-inch. The newer MacBook Airs, meanwhile, tend to bring in between $350 and $525. \nThe offer is valid from 9pm PST Nov. 7th to 11:59pm PST on November 22nd, available while supplies last both online and in retail stores in Canada. \nMobileSyrup has reached out to Microsoft to confirm which model or models come in at $750. Source Microsoft Paul Jerry \nI have the first 12″ macbook. I’m not trading it, but I checked and they offered $650 for it. Not sure I want what will soon be last gen surfacebook with smaller storage and heavier to carry for $1000. I do like what M$ is putting out now and next upgrade I’d seriously look at a switch, but I’m feeling like this tradein offer favours M$ more than me. Omar \nMicrosoft is trolling Apple with this offer lol… I don’t think too many will take it, though. If you have a Macbook you’re probably invested already in the Apple ecosystem, and Windows 10 isn’t that great unless you’re saavy enough to disable the spyware Microsoft has filled it with. \nBut if you want to upgrade to devices that are designed for function rather than prettiness, I think it’s not a bad deal at all.

      "title": "Microsoft Reportedly Canceled Xbox TV Streaming Stick Codenamed Project Hobart",
      "text": "11/08/16 AT 8:33 PM Close \nMicrosoft was originally planning on launching an Xbox-branded streaming stick that would function pretty much like Google’s Chromecast. However, it looks like the tech company has canceled the device’s development entirely. \nMicrosoft’s streaming stick was first leaked back in June just before the annual E3 conference. Instead of announcing the Xbox TV device, Microsoft announced the Xbox One S and next year’s Project Scorpio instead. It’s being speculated that the company decided to do this in response to the leak of Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro, according to Windows Central . \nThe Xbox streaming stick, called internally as Project Hobart, was supposedly ready to launch with Microsoft preparing to manufacture 300,000 units. The device would have been announced at the 2016 E3 conference and would have gone on sale a few weeks after the event. The Xbox TV streaming device is described as a dongle with low computational power, and it would have sold for $99. Related Stories Project Scorpio To Come WIth Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility \nWindows Central says that Hobart would have been able to run some Universal Windows Platform apps and games. The Xbox TV device is a lot more expensive than the Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV Stick and the low-end Roku because it was also capable of streaming Xbox games over WiFi — a feature that’s not available on competing devices. \nIt’s presumed that the device was able to do this through a Windows 10 Xbox app. That being said, the Hobart might have run an optimized version of Windows 10 as well. \nProject Hobart joins the growing pile of devices shelved or canceled by Microsoft. Back in 2014, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly canceled the 7-inch Surface Mini and only unveiled the Surface Pro 3, according to The Verge . \nThe company was also rumored to launch an Amazon Echo competitor last month. The device would have been powered by Cortana, Microsoft’s own virtual assistant. However, that never materialized and the company only announced the Surface Studio and the Surface Book i7.

      "text": "Microsoft is working on tools to help people use cloud-based FPGAs However, there are big challenges with programming hardware More good reads \nMicrosoft Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie speaks   November 8, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank   Microsoft \nEarlier this year, Microsoft made a splash at its Ignite conference for IT professionals when it announced that it has been racking cards of programmable chips together with servers in its cloud data centers. \nThe chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), can be reconfigured after being deployed to optimize them for particular applications such as networking and machine learning. \nNow, Microsoft is investing in tools that would allow customers to program the FPGAs, said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise division, during a talk at the Structure conference in San Francisco. \nUsing those tools could help increase performance of workloads that the chips are deployed to tackle. Guthrie said he hopes businesses will see performance improvements between two or three orders of magnitude using FPGAs compared to CPUs or GPUs. \nThere are issues with just giving people raw access to the FPGAs, though. \n\"When something goes wrong, you really need to be able to debug that quickly,\" Guthrie said.\"Because it's hardware, it could brick the machine, there are lots of things that we've had to learn how to protect against.\" \nThat said, there's an advantage to be gained from using FPGAs for business applications. \nRight now, the FPGAs are being used to power Azure's Accelerated Networking feature, as well as Microsoft products like Bing. They have the ability to radically speed up some computation. \nDoug Burger, a Microsoft researcher who helped spearhead the FPGA project, said that the company's entire deployment could be used to translate all of English-language Wikipedia in a tenth of a second. \nActually writing code for the FPGAs is something that would likely appeal to a small subset of businesses. But for those companies that want access, Microsoft's cloud platform could become a more interesting choice. RELATED TOPICS",

      "title": "Microsoft releases patch for zero-day Flash and Windows Kernel exploit",
      "text": "Microsoft released a patch on Tuesday to fix a zero-day Flash and Windows Kernel vulnerability recently outed by Google. Microsoft had stated previously a fix was being internally tested and would roll out to all relevant Windows platforms and it made good on its word.\nMicrosoft previously took the opportunity to chastise Google for releasing the breach data publicly before Microsoft was ready to release a patch.\nAt the end of October, Google, in accordance with its disclosure timeline for active vulnerabilities , publicly detailed a pair of nasty vulnerabilities in both Adobe’s Flash and Microsoft’s Windows platform. This came after a week of internal discussion with both companies, which saw the former issue a patch for their software and the latter not.\n“We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” said Terry Myerson , executive vice president of Windows and Devices Group.\nGoogle maintains however that it gave Microsoft plenty of time to respond to the news. Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google’s Threat Analysis Group reports submitted a warning to both Adobe and Microsoft over zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in Adobe Flash and Windows. The report was provided to both companies on October 21 and Adobe immediately responded on October 26 with an update to Flash.\n“The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape,” they stated on Monday. “It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD.”\nMore: Oh, look! It’s another patched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash Player software\nThis is a bug that Microsoft claims is now being actively exploited by a Russian hacking group, which it names as Strontium — though as BetaNews explains, it has gone by other names, too. This is a group previously cited as a Russian state actor, suggesting some sort of blessing from the country’s administration.\nThe attacks have involved targeted spear phishing against a subset of Windows users, though Microsoft did not detail who makes up that group, which doesn’t do much to comfort potentially affected users. It did however go out of its way to claim that Windows 10 users running Microsoft’s Edge browser were protected from it.\nAlthough Microsoft didn’t state as such, customers who use the Chrome browser should not see a problem either, as its “sandbox” capability blocks calls to a core Windows component (win32k.sys) by taking advantage of a lockdown feature built into Windows. This prevents hackers from using the newly discovered vulnerability to escape the browser’s sandbox environment.\nMore: Nvidia has licensed Rambus technology to help identify new attack vulnerabilities\nIf you are not familiar with what sandboxing does, just imagine a virtual box that keeps all running code related to the internet contained as a separate entity in the browser, preventing code, malicious or not, from spilling over into the Windows environment and executing separately. But with the new vulnerability, hackers could create internet-based malware that could slip through the container’s cracks and install on a targeted PC.\nThus, Windows customers not using Google Chrome could be subject to an attack when surfing the internet with another browser.\n“We encourage users to verify that auto-updaters have already updated Flash — and to manually update if not — and to apply Windows patches from Microsoft when they become available for the Windows vulnerability,” Google said in a statement of its own. Now that the fix has been released, users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid being subject to a hack attack.\nAdobe warned about CVE-2016-7855 last week, stating that the vulnerability enables hackers to run malicious code on a target PC using a Flash file. In turn, this code can install various threats in the PC’s system that eventually can grant the hacker full control. The problem was listed as critical and was accompanied by a patch bringing Flash Player up to version 232.0.0.205 for Windows/Mac/Chrome OS, and up to version 11.2.202.643 for Linux.\nAccording to Adobe, the targeted attacks are limited and focus on machines running Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. So far, there are no signs that hackers are targeting Linux machines as well, but Adobe released a patch for those users nonetheless.\nWeb surfers not sure about what version of Flash Player they are using can check the version number by heading here to allow Adobe’s website to scan the locally installed software. Users can also right-click on a webpage’s (many) Flash component(s) and select “About Adobe (or Macromedia) Flash Player” from the menu. Users should do this for every browser installed on the PC.\nUpdated on 11-08-2016 by Mark Coppock: Added note that the exploit has been fixed in the November 8 patch.\nOh, look! It’s another patched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash Player software Microsoft left the Secure Boot golden key sitting out in the open",

      "text": "The Latest on Election Day in North Dakota (all times local): \n8:14 p.m. \nFormer Microsoft executive Doug Burgum has defeated Rolla Rep. Marvin Nelson in North Dakota's election for governor. \nThe Fargo businessman was a heavy favorite in a state that has not had a Democratic governor since 1992. Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple decided not to seek re-election. \nThe matchup focused on qualifications to lead the state amid declining oil revenues. \nBurgum is known in North Dakota as the \"godfather of software\" for building Fargo's Great Plains Software into a billion-dollar business, which he later sold to Microsoft. \n--- \n8:10 p.m. \nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump had defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in North Dakota, continuing a decades-long trend. \nSince North Dakota became a state in 1889, Republican candidates have swept its electoral votes in all but six presidential elections. No Democrat has carried the state since Lyndon B. Johnson did so in 1964. \nTrump had support from many prominent North Dakota republicans, including outgoing Governor Jack Dalrymple, gubernatorial nominee Doug Burgum, Sen. John Hoeven and Rep. Kevin Cramer. Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp supports Clinton for president. \nTrump campaigned in Bismarck prior to the election. Former President Bill Clinton stumped in Fargo for his wife. \n--- \n2 p.m. \nFeelings are mixed among North Dakota voters when it comes to a ballot measure that would legalize medical marijuana. \nThe measure being decided on Election Day would give people the right to buy medical marijuana from state-regulated dispensaries when a doctor prescribes it. \nThirty-three-year-old Mandan insurance agent Jesse Wiedrich says he couldn't support it because \"it's too open-ended.\" \nBut 18-year-old Mandan college student Sydney Reimers says it could help a lot of sick people — especially children with seizures. And 18-year-old Bismarck college student Amanda Joyce thinks it would be a good alternative to prescription pills for many people. \n--- \n12:30 p.m. \nAfter walking a few blocks from his downtown Fargo condominium to vote, Republican governor candidate and overwhelming favorite Doug Burgum said the last few months have allowed him to focus on the future. \nBurgum knocked off the party's endorsed candidate and onetime heir apparent to the post Wayne Stenehjem, the longtime attorney general, in a contentious primary that upset many of the established Republicans. The former Microsoft Corp. executive said the general campaign gave him a chance to build relationships to help him \"be effective while governing.\" \nNorth Dakota hasn't elected a Democratic governor since 1992. \nAsked about his choice for president, Burgum said he \"voted for Republicans today\" while criticizing Hillary Clinton's stance on energy and agriculture. Burgum said Trump is an easy choice for \"anyone who cares about the economy of North Dakota.\" \n12 p.m. \nMany North Dakota voters don't have a very favorable impression of this year's presidential campaign. \nThirty-three-year-old Mandan insurance agent Jesse Wiedrich says he was so turned off by the campaigning of Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump that he opted for a third-party candidate. \nWiedrich says he knows that's kind of wasting his vote — but he didn't want either Clinton or Trump on his voting record. \nSeventy-six-year-old Mandan motel manager Patel Ghanshyam (GAN'-shum) says the language and accusations of the two candidates showed no respect. \nEighteen-year-old Sydney Reimers voted for the first time, and she thinks this might be one of the worst presidential races she'll ever weigh in on. She says she's all for a woman running for president, but she doesn't think Clinton is presidential material. \n--- \n10:25 a.m. \nSome North Dakota State University students say they felt uneasy about voting after being given confusing information about financial aid at an early voting site at the Fargodome on campus. \nFreshman Phoebe Ellis says she and others were told voting could threaten their financial aid by changing their state residency status. Assistant Professor Chelsea Pace says more than half a dozen students told her similar stories. \nIt isn't known who gave out the information. Cass County Elections Coordinator DeAnn Buckhouse says officials are looking into it. She says it would be inappropriate for a poll worker to give out such information. \nNDSU Assistant Director for Civic Engagement Hailey Goplen says federal financial aid isn't impacted by where a student votes. She says it's also unlikely that scholarships would be affected. \n--- \n9:40 a.m. \nEarly voting in North Dakota appears poised to set a record. \nThe record for early voting in the state is about 130,000 votes in the 2012 general election. Secretary of State Al Jaeger says the most recent count shows 130,169 early ballots, with about 8 percent of absentee and mail-in ballots still to be submitted to his office. \nHistorically, presidential elections have drawn far more voters in North Dakota than midterm elections. \nSeventy-six-year-old Mandan motel manager Patel Ghanshyam (GAN'-shum) came to the polls early on Monday simply because he was eager. The native of Uganda says he likes to exercise the freedom to express his views. \n--- \n8:40 a.m. \nSecretary of State Al Jaeger says voting is going smoothly so far around North Dakota. \nPolls opened at 7 a.m. across the state, and Jaeger says no problems have been reported. He's also happy that there are no storms in the forecast. \nThe National Weather Service forecast calls for balmy high temperatures across the state in the 50s and 60s. \nJaeger isn't making any predictions on voter turnout, but he says more people typically show up at the polls for presidential elections. Four years ago, turnout was about 61 percent. \nThe most popular election in North Dakota was in 1984, when turnout was 69 percent. \n--- \n7 a.m. \nPolls are opening across North Dakota and Election Day voting is getting underway. \nPolling sites can open at 7 a.m. under state law, and stay open until 9 p.m. \nVoters are greeted by some balmy late-fall weather. The National Weather Service forecast calls for high temperatures across the state in the 50s and 60s, with no rain. \nVoters will choose North Dakota's next governor and decide ballot measures that would legalize medical marijuana, raise the tax on tobacco products and guarantee certain rights to crime victims. \n--- \n00:05 a.m. \nThe most suspenseful races on the North Dakota ballot aren't at the top. \nVoters will choose their next governor and have their say in the presidential race, but Republicans Doug Burgum and Donald Trump are seen as heavy favorites. It's a handful of ballot questions that offer the most intrigue Tuesday. \nOne asks voters whether they'd like to legalize medical marijuana — giving people the right to buy from state-regulated dispensaries when a doctor prescribes it. \nAnother would raise the tobacco tax in a big way, although it would be the first time in nearly a quarter century. The money would go to public health funds, including one for veterans. \nA third would guarantee certain rights to crime victims. Related content",

The National Weather Service forecast calls for high temperatures across the state in the 50s and 60s, with no rain. \nVoters will choose North Dakota's next governor and decide ballot measures that would legalize medical marijuana, raise the tax on tobacco products and guarantee certain rights to crime victims. \n--- \n00:05 a.m. \nThe most suspenseful races on the North Dakota ballot aren't at the top. \nVoters will choose their next governor and have their say in the presidential race, but Republicans Doug Burgum and Donald Trump are seen as heavy favorites. It's a handful of ballot questions that offer the most intrigue Tuesday. \nOne asks voters whether they'd like to legalize medical marijuana — giving people the right to buy from state-regulated dispensaries when a doctor prescribes it. \nAnother would raise the tobacco tax in a big way, although it would be the first time in nearly a quarter century. The money would go to public health funds, including one for veterans. \nA third would guarantee certain rights to crime victims. Related content",

      "title": "Microsoft Releases SharePoint Server 2016 Feature Pack 1",
      "text": "  announced improvements today for SharePoint Server 2016 users and SharePoint Online subscribers, as well as for \"hybrid\" use cases. \nThere are strong indications of hybrid use among organizations, in which SharePoint Server on premises is combined with Office 365 services. A recently published vendor poll of 495 IT pros and SharePoint administrators found that 61 percent reported running \"either full cloud or hybrid SharePoint environments.\" The undated survey results were collected from client pool samplings by vendors Hyperfish, Nintex and ShareGate. \nThe new SharePoint announcements by Microsoft follow below. It's also noteworthy that the Microsoft SharePoint team and MVPs will participate in a Q&A session on Nov. 10 at noon Pacific Time, as described here . \nFeature Pack 1 Perks On the hybrid side, Microsoft has come through today with Feature Pack 1 for SharePoint Server 2016 . Microsoft is delivering Feature Pack 1 capabilities that were announced back in September . Organizations can get Feature Pack 1 through the November public update for SharePoint Server 2016. The pack unlocks some Office 365 feature improvements for organizations running SharePoint Server 2016 on their own server-farm infrastructures. \nIT pros get some management perks with Feature Pack 1. They can track administrative actions in SharePoint's central admin Web portal or management shell. They can also use two new server roles, \"Front-end with Distributed Cache\" and \"Application with Search,\" which support the new MinRole option in SharePoint Server 2016. The benefit of using the new server roles with MinRole is that it requires fewer servers to use the MinRole feature, which reduces server downtime during the patch update process. \nSome features in Feature Pack 1 are at the preview stage. There's a hybrid infrastructure auditing capability called \"Microsoft SharePoint Insights\" in the pack, as well as a \"hybrid taxonomy\" metadata classification capability -- both at preview. \nFeature Pack 1 also delivers interface improvements, such as the so-called \"modern experience\" for OneDrive for Business, which adds improved drag-and-drop capabilities for end users. There's also access to an API for OneDrive for Business, which can be used for integrating line-of-business apps. Lastly, the App Launcher tile-based interface, which provides end user access to SharePoint and Office 365 applications, becomes available with Feature Pack 1. \nOne catch is that the OneDrive for Business improvements in Feature Pack 1 will require having Software Assurance in place to use them. Software Assurance is an annuity that permits upgrades to the next software release within a contract term, but lately Microsoft has associated it with access to software feature updates. \nSharePoint Online Team Sites SharePoint Online users are starting to get the new integration of Office 365 Groups within SharePoint Team Sites. This capability is available this week for all \"first release\" testers, according to   today . It's not clear when it will be available more broadly. \nUsers of this capability will see a Create Site button at the SharePoint home page, which starts a two-step creation process. Team Sites get automatically provisioned during the creation process. \n\"When you create a group, Office 365 gives the group a shared inbox, calendar, OneNote notebook, place for files, Planner for task management -- and now a modern team site with pages, lists, libraries and team news, so the group can collaborate, communicate and coordinate,\"   \nIT pros can specify the availability of this feature for end users. They can enforce site classifications. Sites can be provisioned as \"classic, modern or custom\" using settings, which are available within the SharePoint Online Admin Center. \nSome organizations may have already built custom-site provisioning solutions. Consequently, Microsoft is promising to deliver updated guidance \"so you can provision a new modern team site connected to Office 365 Groups (instead of a classic site),\" according to the announcement, although the timeline for release wasn't specified.

      "text": "Microsoft wants to make your daily routine a little easier. The company bought to-do list app developer Wunderlist in 2015, and is now developing a new app — code-named Project Cheshire . That app is now in the private beta-testing phase, and while not too much is known about it, we now have screenshots showing it in use.\nThe app will reportedly be available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10, and the screenshots were shown off by blog Thurrott.com. While the app’s existence was known before this, we now know a little more about what it looks like.\nMore: Sunrise features come to Outlook with Evernote, Facebook, and Wunderlist integration\nThe images show a pretty basic user interface, which lets users create lists, set reminders for those lists, and sync the lists to different platforms. Based on the images, it doesn’t seem as though the app offers more than an app like Google Keep.\nproject-cheshire More The app is also listed on the Microsoft Store under “Project Cheshire,” along with a description about what the app has to offer.\n“Say hello to Project Cheshire. Introducing a brand new and simple, yet incredibly focused, to-do app that helps you get stuff done,” says the listing. “Please note that we are still in the early stages of development and are working hard in the background to deliver you the best to-do app ever. Stay tuned for updates and more here.”\nAccording to a report from TechCrunch , while the app is listed on the Microsoft Store, those who downloaded it were simply greeted with a black screen with the words “Coming soon,” so it seems as though the listing is a little premature. It also seems as though only corporate account holders can access the app, which could signal that it is more focused on the business market than the consumer market.\nDownload at Microsoft\nHighly popular ‘Sonic CD’ free on iOS for a limited time Microsoft Surface Dial ships November 10, but can be pre-ordered now for $100 Microsoft unveils pricey but powerful Surface Book update, Surface Studio at NY event",

      "text": "0 Head of Microsoft Xbox Phil Spencer unveils the Xbox One S console at the Xbox E3 2016 media briefing in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2016. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson \nMicrosoft has been trying to develop the Xbox TV for three years now. The device was expected to be announced by the tech giant early this year, but it seems that Microsoft may have completely scrapped its Xbox TV plans. \nFans expected Microsoft to launch at least one Xbox streaming device during the first half of this year. The Redmond-based company instead unveiled the Xbox One S console at the E3 conference back in June. It also disclosed Project Scorpio developments during the said event but no Xbox TV plans were mentioned. \nAccording to Windows Central , Microsoft has pulled the plug on the Xbox TV streaming stick. The cancelled launch resulted in the pull out of 300,000 ordered units. The streaming device, which had a “Project Hobart” codename, was supposed to retail at US$99 (AU$128). \nWhat led Microsoft to halt the Xbox TV launch is still unknown. The company also has a history of cancelling devices at the last second, so this is no surprise. According to The Verge , Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella shelved the Surface Mini a few weeks before it was set to launch at a conference in New York. The Windows-maker ultimately announced the Surface Pro 3 instead and provided no details regarding the Surface Mini. \nDuring the Surface Studio event in October, Microsoft also reportedly intended to announce its own version of an Alexa device. According to Windows Central , Microsoft was supposed to introduce an Amazon Echo challenger that featured Cortana. The company may have pulled the plug on the device as well since it still hasn’t seen the light of day. Microsoft also stopped the production of its wrist-worn fitness accessory called Band just recently. \nThe Xbox TV was supposed to be like a Chromecast dongle that would have allowed Xbox One users to stream games wirelessly to another TV. It also would have supposedly allowed viewing of streamed entertainment services.",

      "title": "Azure Pricing Receives an Overhaul In 2016",
      "text": "Azure Pricing Receives an Overhaul In 2016 Microsoft licensing agreements and VM rates see significant changes in October Software \nMicrosoft has made substantial changes to the Azure pricing model across the channel effective October 2016. One of the major reasons for this change was an effort to eliminate the discount complexity across various programs which were often difficult and cumbersome to explain and calculate. This will help to improve the transparency, consistency and simplicity of Azure pricing. Here we will review these changes. The minimum monetary commitment for a new Azure-only Server and Cloud Enrollment (SCE) has been raised to $12,000 per year. Note that customers with existing Software Assurance (SA) and SCE Enterprise Agreements (EA), as well as new SCE customers with other qualifying SCE products can continue to add an Azure monetary commitment for a minimum of $1,200 per year. For customers with new EA/SCE and other Microsoft Products and Services Agreement licensing, most of the Azure pricing has been level; set to match that of the web direct (azure.com) pricing. The exception is for Azure Secure Cloud Storage for EA/SCE customers where the existing discounts will remain in place. \nThis change applies to customers renewing or starting a new agreement – for those who are still within their existing agreement term, you will not be affected by these pricing changes and will have price protection; however, you will still receive any cost savings should there be a price decrease with specific Azure services that will lower your costs also. Lower Azure Pricing \nAlso this month, Microsoft announced lower Azure pricing for virtual machines (VMs). The new price went into effect October 1, and will benefit all customers across the board. Let’s review these price reductions. A1 and A2 Basic tier VMs will see lower prices by up to 50% Dv2 series VMs have reduced prices by up to 15% Compute optimized F series VMs have price reductions up to 11% New Av2 series VMs will be launched in November 2016 and will feature local SSD storage and offer up to 36% lower prices than the current A series standard VMs. \nAdditionally, Microsoft has also lowered the price for Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to Azure by approximately 50%. How about Customers in CDW’s Supported Pay-As-You-Go (Azure CSP) Plan? \nOur customers will also benefit from the cost savings from any price reductions, and so the recently announced Azure price reductions will automatically go into effect beginning October 1 for our Azure CSP customers. Additional Benefits for Volume Licensing Customers \nHere’s an overview of the several ways that volume licensing customers can save additional costs on Azure compute. \nAzure Hybrid Use Benefit (AHUB): Customers are able to leverage their existing Windows SA on-premises licensing investments to significantly reduce the cost of deploying their Windows Server VMs to Azure – for savings of up to 40%. Customers will be effectively paying for just the base rate of the VMs. Learn more here . \nIn its current form, the AHUB can only be applied when migrating existing Windows Server VMs to Azure – however, this benefit will soon become more flexible to include Azure Gallery images as well as being able to apply this benefit to lower the costs of already deployed Azure Windows Server VMs. \nWe view this as a potentially significant benefit. \nLicense Mobility for SQL Server through Software Assurance \nMicrosoft SQL Server customers with Software Assurance have the option to move their SQL Server licenses with SA coverage to Azure for significant cost savings when running a SQL Server VM in Azure. \nAzure Compute Prepurchase Option \nThe Compute Prepurchase plan is available for EA customers and allows these customers to receive up to a 63% discount on Azure VMs by prepurchasing upfront 12 months of Compute for a particular VM instance (instance family, size, region and OS). \nKeep an eye out for further news on this as Microsoft will be enhancing this option in 2017. \nAzure Enterprise Portal \nAzure EA/SCE and MPSA customers get access to the Azure Enterprise Portal, which provides comprehensive management capabilities. This is also applicable to education customers who may be using Azure via an Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES) agreement. The Portal allows an organization to provide oversight over multiple Azure subscriptions tied to an organization by providing a hierarchical structure for how Azure can be accessed and administered by different admin roles. The ability to provide delegation of admin roles allows an organization to provide a form of governance to their Azure Enterprise structure. \nMoreover, the Azure Enterprise Portal allows an organization to view their Azure usage and consumption across multiple subscriptions used throughout the organization. The Portal also provides a unique Billing API Key for each organization to be able to provide additional and powerful insights into their organization’s Azure usage via powerful visual data reporting tools such as Power BI. \nEnterprise Agreement Support Offer \nAs outlined here Microsoft is offering 12 months of Azure technical support and has also upgraded existing customers who already have a technical support plan on their Azure agreement. \nTo learn more about the value added in your EA and SA subscriptions work with your AM or ask to talk to with a CDW software expert .

      "title": "Microsoft Shuts Down Xbox TV Streaming Device",
      "text": "Microsoft appears to have pulled the plug on Project Hobart which was apparently meant to offer Xbox TV streaming through an HDMI dongle at $99. The reason for shutting it down is unknown but the fact that it wasn’t unveiled at last month’s E3 convention which was where Brad Sams, executive editor at Petri, said it would be unveiled when he wrote about in June.\n\nWhy a Xbox TV dongle anyways? Between Apple TV, Fire TV, Google’s own HDMI dongle, the $35 Chromecast, Roku boxes and a number of other ways to stream content on your TV it’s a bit of a mystery why Microsoft would even bother especially given the low-tech nature of its planned device that was meant to have a first production run of 300,000.\nMicrosoft has enjoyed a fair bit of success with its hardware offerings in the last year with the Surface line of tablets actually finding a considerable niche and user base much to the surprise of numerous tech writers and analysts. A couple of weeks ago, Microsoft also unveiled its Surface Studio for the (rich) artist and it’s an absolutely gorgeous foray into the desktop market, a first for Microsoft, and many believe that it could steal some thunder from Apple’s iMac line with a 28″ display that is a full touch screen. On top of the display that folds down and can be drawn on its “under the hood” power is truly impressive.\nMicrosoft has also recently released the Xbox One S console to favorable reviews and Phil Spencer, the chief of Project Scorpio, which will be the most powerful console gaming system every built when released next year says that the project is on track and it’s highly anticipated among proper gamers.\nWith all that technology a dongle seems a bit of a step back and may have led to the company pulling the plug.\nNew (ish) Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella hasn’t hesitated to kill projects in the past. When many expected to unveil the Surface Mini in New York City, the CEO never mentioned the device when he instead introduced the Surface Pro 3. It’s also believed that Microsoft had planned to unveil a competitor to Amazon’s Echo which runs its virtual assistant Alexa with its own device running Microsoft’s assistant Cortana just a few weeks ago. That never happened either and rumors have it it also canceled a wearable called the Band before abandoning the idea.\nAgain, there are plenty of dongles and Microsoft likely did the right thing in axing its offering.\n[ SOURCE ]\nThe post Microsoft Shuts Down Xbox TV Streaming Device appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "PS4 Pro Leaks Reportedly Forced Microsoft’s Hand With Project Scorpio Unveiling   \nPrior to E3 2016, the string of PS4 Pro leaks prompted Microsoft into unveiling the Project Scorpio, despite having only shown it behind closed doors to a handful of developers. \nThat’s according to a new report from Windows Central, claiming that the general buzz surrounding Sony’s Pro system — then known as PlayStation Neo — forced Microsoft’s hand, in many ways. Further in the piece, the outlet then goes on to suggest Scorpio will run UWP (Universal Windows Platform) games available today in native 4K, with Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 among the prime candidates. \nAs part of its mission to brings its platforms closer together, it’s said that developers need only make some “trivial” changes so that a UWP game is compatible with Scorpio. Development kits, meanwhile, are being designed as a “one-stop shop” for devs, who will be able to test their game across different configurations. \nElsewhere, a separate report from GamesBeat reveals that Microsoft spent big during the month of October, dumping $39.9 million across 16 commercials in anticipation of the PS4 Pro launch. Sony, by contrast, spent an estimated $12.1 million across 11 commercials. \nWill this have much of a bearing on the PS4 Pro’s November 10 launch? For our verdict on Sony’s mid-gen hardware upgrade, have a gander at our review .",

Graham Cluley | November 9, 2016 3:11 am | Filed under: Google , Malware , Microsoft , Vulnerability , Windows | 0 4 SHARES \nWe've just had the second Tuesday of the month, and you know what that means... Patch Tuesday! \nMicrosoft has issued a bundle of security bulletins , detailing fixes for numerous vulnerabilities, including critical remote code execution flaws in Microsoft Office, Microsoft Edge and various Windows components. \nAnd this Patch Tuesday update includes a fix for the vulnerability that Google engineers controversially chose to make public last week . \nThe security hole is said to have been exploited by the Russian-linked Fancy Bear hacking group in targeted attacks, and details were shared by Google only days after it privately told Microsoft about the flaw, and informed Adobe of an associated Flash zero-day bug. \nAlthough Adobe was able to issue a patch promptly, Google didn't wait for Microsoft to push out a patch for the security vulnerability that was known to be being exploited in targeted attacks. \nIt was clear at the time that Microsoft was highly unimpressed by Google's action: \n\"We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today’s disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk.\" \nWhether you think Google was wrong or not to do what it did, you're hopefully pleased to see that Microsoft has kept its promise and now issued a patch - meaning millions of users can benefit from protection. \nAlthough the Microsoft patch for the Google-found flaw is likely to get the majority of the media attention, it's important to recognise the latest collection of security patches from Microsoft cover a wide range of vulnerabilities. \nAs always, I strongly recommend that home users and companies update their Windows systems at their earliest convenience. 4",

      "text": "Revenue from the 2016 MacBook Pro exceeds that of Microsoft Surface Book.\nSlice Intelligence Apple's MacBook Pro , the company's newest model for power users, is generating vastly more revenue than the company's ultralight laptop that debuted a year and a half ago, an e-commerce tracking firm says.\nThe MacBook Pro revenue in its first five days has reached 78 percent of last year's MacBook , Slice Intelligence said Tuesday . In addition, the new Mac has generated nearly four times that of Microsoft's Surface Book challenger since its debut a year ago.\nThat may sound like great news for Apple , but there likely was pent-up demand for the new MacBook Pro since it's gone years without a major redesign.\nAnd shoppers showed a willingness to switch to Windows-powered machines during the long wait, Slice found. Among those who bought an Apple laptop in 2014, 40 percent bought another brand since, Slice said. The firm bases its statistics on the behavior of a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers. It tracks online sales only.\nThe new MacBook Pro is smaller and lighter, with a starting price of $1,499. Higher-end models feature a touch-screen strip called the Touch Bar instead of function keys at the top of the keyboard. Critics don't like its lack of old-style but still widely used rectangular USB ports.\nApple declined to comment.",

      "text": "Introduction and Background On operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, and using great tools like Visual Studio, it is greatly easy to upload and publish your web application projects to Microsoft Azure but what about other platforms such as Linux? Introduction and Background \nOn operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, and using great tools like Visual Studio, it is greatly easy to upload and publish your web application projects to Microsoft Azure but what about other platforms such as Linux? Microsoft has recently released PowerShell as open source project and that is a great tool to be used in the cases where you have developers who understand and can use PowerShell but if you don’t happen to have any, then you would require to use traditional tools and sometimes they will require you to manually perform these changes. In this post, I am going to cover the teams who are using Git repositories for their projects and I am going to cover how they can basically automate the publishing of their projects after each successful build. On Linux, we can basically create small scripts that run on the background just like PowerShell or the Windows command prompt terminal’s batch files. Git programs are required for this to run, actually what I am going to show in this is to execute the same commands but in a manner that most of the repository’s information is already built, the commit message is updated and the content is published to the Azure app service. The purpose of this guide is to make the entire process as easy to be understood, as A, B and C. I will be using a real world application to show you how to do what and where instead of talking generally about many things at the same time. \nBefore moving onward, a very little knowledge of how Git system works is required from you because some things might get a bit technical in the post below and thus you must have the know-how of how Git systems work in order to control the versioning of files. \nFigure 1 : Git logo. \nSecondly, you are required to know how you can use “dotnet” script to create, build and run the .NET Core applications. If you don’t know .NET Core, I will reference to a few of my own articles that are beginner-friendly which you can read to learn more on this. \nFinally, you are required to have an active Azure account with a working subscription. If you don’t happen to have on, you can get a free account with $200 credits to try out all of Azure! Once these are met, you can continue to actually using the article for something useful. Creating the application — entire part \nThis part has been shared and taught many times, on many occasions. I wrote an article on the same concept, a few days ago and I would like to refer that article to you to learn how you can create a new application with web template in .NET Core. Creating and hosting ASP.NET Core application on Linux — Nothing Third-Party , read this article for a complete overview and a walkthough for the concept of building and running the applications on Linux environment. I will move onward from this step, because you must be aware of the ways of creating your own applications. Deployment of web application to Azure \nNow comes the main part, this article entirely focusses on the deployment of applications to Microsoft Azure instead of developing an application. There would be some parts, where I will be modifying the parts, but that is just to tell you how easy it would be to redeploy the application using the automation by executing a simple command. Although it is not required but you are required to have a very basic introduction to automation tools. You can get a good tutorial about these toolings easily from any software engineering guide. Using git for deployment \nMicrosoft Azure uses many methods and ways to deploy the applications on the cloud, such as using Visual Studio to deploy the applications and leave the configurations to the tool itself. However, since Linux environments don’t have Visual Studio, most of the tasks are left with source control tools (Visual Studio Code also uses the same git programs to upload the code to repositories). I will show you, how you can create a minimal script or a program, that manages all of these tasks for you — automation program. \nOn Linux, mostly and typically, git comes pre installed in most of the Linux-distributions, such as Ubuntu, etc. However, if that is not available you get easily install it using $ sudo apt-get install git \nOr using a similar command, such as using yum etc. This would install and setup git for your environment. Once you have git installed, you need to set a few things up. Git requires the name, email address for notifying who made a change to the system. So for that we would require to execute the following commands, $ git config --global user.name \" Eminem\" $ git config --global user.email \" email@domain.com\" \nYou should pass the name and address values that you hold — I used Eminem and a random email address. And to check if your personal configurations are done correctly, you can execute the following command to test that, $ git config --list \nThese are the required configurations that you must do before you can use git for any purpose at all. \nNote : You also need to create a new web application service (Azure App Service) on Microsoft Azure so that you can deploy the application somewhere. Since I do not want to go deep into the development and starting of this session, I would like you guys to go and watch this video of mine, providing an overview of Microsoft Azure App Service (you may have to put the volume a bit higher). \nOnce you have that, you can continue onwards and actually set up repositories to deploy the application. I used the following information while creating a new service, so that if I use a name, you should know where did that come from. \nFigure 2 : Creating a new App Service. \nFigure 3 : Reviewing the information of App Service in Microsoft Azure. \nUpon creating, you can visit the web service from your browser using the link provided and on the first visit without any update, the following page is shown. \nFigure 4 : Initial page from the App Service. \nIt shows that you can deploy your web applications, from many sources, using many services such as FTP, Git etc. I will show you, how to do this using Git… There are a few other things that I would like to show you here, I will show you how to do this, using git. I will also show you, how to test the build integrity — whether build succeeds or not. I will also show you, whether git considers to commit and push the changes to the server or not. \nSo these are a few of the tests that I have prepared for the automation tool that will be helpful for us in this case. These things are not provided on the tutorials that are available online, they are just simple straight-forward ones that only show you how to do it, not whether it is helpful to do it at all. Setting up the local repository \nOn the machine side, the first thing to do is to set up a local repository for git deployments, even if you have created a project, you can still create a repository for that project and then use it as the source for your application’s content. So, for that, the following commands would work, # If you have not created a project, remove these lines. $ dotnet new -t web $ dotnet restore # The following creates a local repository $ git init \nThis would create the project, set up the repository for us under .git directory. On my machine, the following was the result of this, \nFigure 5 : Creating a new project using .NET Core. \nNot visible at the moment, however there is a special file called .gitignore, created by default and that contains really helpful ignore constraints for the git systems. However, we will look into them later as we progress. Adding remote repositories We can now set up a few remote repositories on own local machine so that once we need to publish the application, we don’t have to enter the URL of the repository every time. Instead, what we can do is, just call that alias of the repository and deploy the content there. This helps to notify the system of the locations where it needs to push the changes to. For that, first of all we need to setup our online repository to allow Local Git Deployments from Microsoft Azure and only then we can assure that we can send the code to the repository online. For that, head over to, Deployment options → Deployment source → Local git repository. Figure 6 : Deployment options in Microsoft Azure. You can see that there are other options available too, select as required and wanted. I selected the third option so that we can publish the source code from our local machines to the servers in no time at all, without having to require any third-party vendors. You need to set up the credentials, so that when you are trying to publish the applications, only you are the one in charge of pushing the changes to the server and not anyone else. Figure 7 : Setting up credentials for the deployment account. Once these things are set up, we can then move onwards to set up our local git programs to allow it to deploy the source code from our local environment all the way up to the Microsoft Azure. Stay with me. To do so, we need to execute the following command, $ git remote add repoinazure https: // <user>@<servicename>.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/<servicename>.git \nNote a few things in the previous command, the few things interesting here are that the repository always contains the name of your application service in the URL as well as in the resource file for your git processes. You need to update that, secondly, you need to update the username in the URL and as the one you used in the credentials (I used “afzaal” there). Once this is done, we can move onwards and actually push our first version of application to see, how Azure will behave. \nThe following commands take care of that, $ git add . $ git commit -m \" Some random commit message here...\" $ git push repoinazure master \nIn the previous commands, the first one takes care of the addition of files to the local tracking of the repository, to track the files that needs to be. Second command simply commits the changes and finally a push is made to the “repoinazure”, of course that is the repository where we will publish the application to. \nFigure 8 : Terminal asking for password before deployment. \nIt asks for the password and then continues to simply compress the objects, to deploy them using git protocol. \nFigure 9 : Terminal showing the progress. \nThe following is a screenshot of a process going on, during the first deployment. Next times and onwards it doesn’t take this much time and is very much simpler. \nFigure 10 : Terminal showing the processes going on at Azure during the deployment. \nHowever, we will also create a shell script that automates the deployment for us. Once it is done, the terminal will show the following results on the screen and we can know that Azure is set up for startup. \nFigure 11 : Application deployed to Azure. \nLet us navigate to the website and see if things are the way we are planning them to be. \nFigure 12 : Application’s home page after it has been uploaded to Azure. \nVoila! We have finally deployed the application to the Azure. We now need to deploy the changes and so here is where I submit my recommendations, ideas and tips. Development and redeployments \nLet us add a simple controller to this web application, and then quickly deploy that using the script that we will create to do the trick for us. In this section, I will show you a simple ASP.NET Core Web API that will be used to basically see, how early an updates get published live on the server. So, I start with adding a new controller file to the web application’s source code and then modifying it to return a few objects with some data. using System.Collections.Generic; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc; namespace WebApplication.Controllers { [RouteAttribute( \" api/people\" )] public class PersonApiController : Controller { private List<Person> _people { get ; set ; } = new List<Person> { new Person { ID = 1 , Name = \" Afzaal Ahmad Zeeshan\" }, new Person { ID = 2 , Name = \" Bruce Wayne\" }, new Person { ID = 3 , Name = \" Marshall Bruce Mathers III\" } }; public List<Person> GetPeople() { return _people; } // Rest of the stuff here... } public class Person { public int ID { get ; set ; } public string Name { get ; set ; } } } \nI just added a simple HTTP GET handler to show you how easy and simple it is to actually make the changes to your live application using git deployment from a local repository. \nNow the magic trick for kids , the following script will manage most of our tasks and will take care of them before we proceed deploying the application. if [ $# == 0 ] then echo \" Usage: automate.sh <git-remote-repository>\" exit 1 fi # Variables commit_message= \" Deployment commit on $(date \" +%B %dth, %Y at %H:%M %p \" ).\" # Run the test dotnet build if [ $? == 0 ] then # Successful attempt. # Update the git. git add -A echo \" Using commit message, \\\"$commit_message\\\".\" git commit -m \" $commit_message\" # Check if anything was commited, or whether there were no changes. if [ $? == 0 ] then # Files need to be updated # Update the azure ' s repository. echo \"Connecting to server for git push...\" git push $1 master exit 0 else echo \"No changes to be pushed to server. Terminating.\" exit 1 fi exit else # There must have been an issue in the execution. echo \"There were errors in building process, fix them and re-try.\" exit 1 fi \nThis would check if we are passing the remote repository or not, it will also build the project and then continue only if build succeeds. So, basically, this comes really handy when working with a terminal based environment especially Linux and using the git protocol for deployment. I recommend saving this as a file in your local repository, and then executing it from the terminal as a program. You can get the file from my GitHub repository too. \nFigure 13 : “autorun.sh” file available in the files. \nOnce this is done, simply create it executable and then finally execute the script to deploy it. It will go through each step and it will finally deploy the application, it would require password. I did not create the script to accept the password. \nFigure 14 : My script working and deploying the application to Azure. \nSo, let us run the system now. Once it is done, it will show you that you can now access the web application as it has been deployed successfully. Browser can confirm this, \nFigure 15 : Result of the deployment. \nTo see more information on this, we can head over to Azure to see how does the deployment affect our current source code. \nFigure 16 : Deployments shown on the Azure. \nClearly seen that now our most recent version of the deployment is being shown as the active deployment and the previous one is removed and set as Inactive. We can do deeper into them and change their status as needed but I won’t be doing that at all. Remember : Next time you want to publish the application, just use that script I provided. Final words \nMicrosoft Azure provides very simple ways of deploying the applications, there are many other ways other than Git to deploy the applications to the server. OneDrive, GitHub and other cloud storage services can be used easily to deploy the applications. \nHowever my major concern was to show how you can use the git, in a script-based environment to deploy the applications to Azure and also track when each commit gets pushed to the server. As you can see in this post, the commits are tracked on the cloud and you can change and select which commit you are interested in and set them as the active ones — such as in the case of a deletion of a file or so.

      "title": "Microsoft extends support for Kubernetes, DC/OS, on Azure",
      "text": "Microsoft has introduced extended native support for Kubernetes on its Azure cloud container service, along with upgrades support for the Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DC/OS).\nThe Redmond-based company announced the container initiatives at this week’s KubeCon event in Seattle, saying the preview release means that the Azure cloud now supports Kubernetes, Mesosphere DC/OS and Docker Swarm as container orchestration options.\nIn a blog post , Microsoft’s Corey Sanders, director of compute for Microsoft Azure, said the update means Azure becomes the first public cloud provider to support the three leading container orchestration tools. He explained that Microsoft had previously announced support for Kubernetes on Azure infrastructure back in July 2014, specifically providing support for native Azure networking, load-balancer and Azure disk integration.\n“We are taking this support even further and announcing the preview release of Kubernetes 1.4 on Azure Container Service. This deeper and native support of Kubernetes will provide you another fully open source choice for your container orchestration engine on Azure,” Sanders wrote.\nIn a second blog post, Brendan Burns, partner architect at Microsoft, who previously led development of Kubernetes while at Google, said that the introduction of Kubernetes as a supported orchestration tool on Azure means that functional clusters can be spun up quickly via the Azure portal or using a Python-based command line tool. The Kubernetes cluster is then integrated with other Azure cloud resources.\nThe announcement comes at a time when most analysts agree that enterprises are beginning to show a serious interest in the potential of containers to revolutionize their IT infrastructure, something that Sanders himself also alluded to.\n“We are seeing organizations of every size move their container-based solutions from dev/test environments to production in the cloud,” Sanders added.\nWith regard to Mesosphere’s DC/OS, Microsoft said the upgraded support includes virtual networking capabilities, job-scheduling and container orchestration based on Marathon, which is the container orchestration platform that underpins Apache Mesos. The upragde also includes faster installation of platforms like the enterprise version of DataStax Inc.’s Apache Cassandra-based database.\nIn addition to support for Kubernetes and Mesosphere’s DC/OS, Microsoft said it was releasing the code for its Azure Container Service Engine to the open-source community. The new GitHub project would share details on deploying DC/OS, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes and orchestrating containers on both the public cloud and on the Azure Stack, Sanders said.\nImage credit: Snoku via pixabay ",

      "title": "Microsoft kills Windows zero-day flaw in Nov. 2016 Patch Tuesday",
      "text": "Microsoft kills Windows zero-day flaw in Nov. 2016 Patch Tuesday by Michael Heller Senior Reporter The Nov. 2016 Patch Tuesday includes a patch for a Windows zero-day reportedly being exploited by Russian hackers, as well as bulletins experts think may be underrated by Microsoft.   Patch Tuesday Alerts –Lumension \nMicrosoft released its Nov. 2016 Patch Tuesday fixes today, including a fix for a Windows zero day vulnerability disclosed recently. \nOf the 14 total bulletins six were rated as critical by Microsoft, but one rated as important was for a Windows kernel flaw that is actively being exploited.. MS16-135 includes the fix for the escalation of privilege exploit disclosed last week by Google. Microsoft admitted this Windows kernel vulnerability was being used by the advanced persistent threat group behind the DNC hack . Microsoft came under fire for downplaying the severity of the Windows zero day and even in the Patch Tuesday listings, Microsoft gave it a priority of \"important\" instead of critical. \nCraig Young, security researcher at Tripwire, said this \"win32k kernel-mode driver update is highly critical with three vulnerabilities an attacker could use to escape low-privileged execution contexts such as a browser sandbox.\" \nThe standard critical bulletins include MS16-142 , MS16-129 and MS16-141 for Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Adobe Flash, respectively. Amol Sarwate, director of vulnerability labs at Qualys Inc., based in Redwood City, Calif., noted these bulletins still should be high priorities for enterprises. \n\"Three more vulnerabilities that were previously disclosed before availability of patches were fixed. These three issues are in IE and Edge browser and were fixed in MS16-142 and MS16-129 respectively (CVE-2016-7227 for IE, CVE-2016-7199 and CVE-2016-7209 for Edge),\" Sarwate wrote in a blog post . \nSarwate also listed MS16-133 -- the Microsoft Office bulletin -- as a top priority for enterprise, despite it not being rated as critical by Microsoft. \n\"Microsoft Office bulletin MS16-133 contains fixes for 10 vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to take complete control of the system. In addition to these 10 fixes there is an information disclosure as well as a denial-of-service crash which was fixed,\" Sarwate wrote. \"Since office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environment I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as 'important'.\" \nMS16-130 , MS16-131 and MS16-132 are the remaining critical bulletins in November's Patch Tuesday release and all fix vulnerabilities that could allow for remote code execution by an attacker. MS16-130 patches Windows itself and MS16-131 fixes Microsoft Video Control, exploitation of either issue could allow code execution. And MS16-132 resolves a bug in the Microsoft Graphics Component, which could allow an attacker to \"install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\" \nSarwate said Microsoft SQL server administrators should focus on MS16-136 which patches six vulnerabilities in the RDBMS engine, MDS API, SQL Analysis Services and the SQL Server Agent. \n\"SQL server vulnerabilities are relatively rare and although there is no remote code execution, attackers can gain escalated privileges which could allow them to view, change, or delete data and create new accounts,\" Sarwate wrote. \nYoung called attention to MS16-137 , an important bulletin for authentication on Windows. Microsoft said an attacker could use this flaw to escalate privilege but \"would first need to authenticate to the target, domain-joined system using valid user credentials.\" \nYoung said this bulletin harkened back to a patch from August (MS16-101) where \"Microsoft revealed that a [ man-in-the-middle ] attacker could force password change requests to failback from Kerberos to the less secure NTLM authentication scheme.\" \n\"Today we are learning that problems with the NTLM password change cache could be abused by an authenticated attacker to gain administrative access to a system,\" Young told SearchSecurity. \"Although NTLM is commonly considered a legacy technology, certain features within Windows still rely on NTLM where Kerberos has not been implemented. Administrators should strongly consider actions to reduce reliance on NTLM by 'Kerberizing' as many clients and applications as possible.\" \nRounding out the remaining four important bulletins in this month's Patch Tuesday are three escalation of privilege issues ( MS16-134 , MS16-138 and MS16-139 ) in the Common Log File System Driver, Microsoft Virtual Hard Disk Driver and Windows Kernel, respectively, and a security bypass patch ( MS16-140 ) for the Windows Boot Manager.

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft threw its hat into the 3D ring in a big way a few weeks ago during its Fall Windows 10 Event. Aside from its Surface Studio hardware geared for touch manipulation of 3D creations , Microsoft also revamped its Paint software to now be the home of consumer-facing 3D creation. \nMicrosoft isn’t satisfied hanging its hat on its Fall announcements and is bolstering its 3D offerings with a new patent for full-color 3D printing with mixed CMYKW materials. \nThanks to 3ders.org we get summation of the patent in laymen’s terms: \nSo how does it work? In a nutshell, this patent covers various techniques for mixing CMYKW (cyan, magenta, yellow, key or black and white) 3D printable materials and expressing the design from computer software to a physical device – from CAD model to 3D printed object.” \nUnderstandably, 3D printing is a bit more complicated and requires new processes to get solid results, but it looks like Microsoft and its Windows 10 operating system is attempting to get out ahead of the potential complications to make it as assessable as possible.

      "text": "  \nSteve Lasker, the Program Manager at Azure Developer Experiences has taken to an official Microsoft Blog to announce that Microsoft has issued Azure Container Registry preview. The move brings major upgrades to Azure Container offerings, and makes Azure a cloud provider with the broadest support for container deployments. \nThe Azure Container Registry Preview also comes after Microsoft made Azure Container Service generally available in April 2016, and after Microsoft announced container support for Azure Batch and Azure Service Fabric container support. Azure Container Registry Preview will also include a preview of Azure Container Registry, which is a private registry for hosting container images. According to Steve Lasker, Azure Container Registry has several uses such as: Store and manage images for all types of container deployments Automated Container Builds, Testing and Security Scanning Support for Store your container image in local, network-close storage on Azure Use Common Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the registry Use Azure Active Directory to manage access, including Service Principals for headless connections like automated CI/CD and vulnerability scanning Manage Windows and Linux container images in a single registry \nTo learn more about Azure Container Registry Preview, you can visit this official Microsoft website and also stay on the watch for more details during Microsoft Connect().

      "text": "  \nWhile Microsoft is currently busy transitioning its Skype messaging service from a peer to peer infrastructure to a cloud-based one , the Skype team has announced today the launch of a new Skype Insider program. Just like the company’s Windows Insider and Office Insider programs, the new initiative will allow Skype enthusiasts to get access to preview releases and provide feedback to improve the messaging app: \nAs a Skype Insider, you can help us shape your Skype experiences as: You will have early access to Skype software and services updates and improvements. You will be able to give early feedback on these improvements and as well as help us iron out any quirks before we release them broadly. On top of that you will be able to submit your suggestions on what you would like to see in the Skype app in the future \nYou can join the Skype Insider Program right now by signing up online at the Skype Insiders Registration From and you’ll be given the choice to indicate the platform you want to sign up for. The Skype team notes that this program doesn’t include the Skype Preview UWP app for Windows 10 devices (Windows Insiders on the Fast Ring can already test preview builds of the messaging app) and that you’ll be able to install preview versions alongside the regular Skype app. \nThis announcement comes just a day after the Xbox team announced the rebranding of the Xbox Preview Program as the Xbox Insider Program and we applaud the company’s naming consistency. Sound off in the comments if you’re looking forward to see what’s next for the popular messaging app.  ",

      "text": "Having since been canceled, we have been given a first look at the Microsoft Lumia 750. Based on the images, the phone carries a clean and colorful design aesthetic, though we will never know how it might have been received. More Even though there are plenty of phones that make it to the finish line and become available for purchase, there are others that remain in the shadows, never to see the light of day. Such a phone is Microsoft’s Lumia 750, which was supposed to occupy the space between the low-end Lumia 550 and the higher-end Lumia 950 and 950 XL , but was canceled before anyone could give it a chance. Now leaked images give us a glimpse of what might have been.\nAround front, the phone was rumored to feature a 5-inch, 1,280 x 720 resolution display, with a 5-megapixel selfie sensor and an 8MP main camera. Thanks to known device leaker Evan Blass, however, the first thing you will notice about the Lumia 750 is not the display or cameras, but its clean and colorful aesthetic . In terms of looks, it seems to be a combination of the Lumia 640 and Lumia 735, with the now-canceled phone possibly offered in multiple colors.\nMore: Microsoft to reportedly end sales of Lumia by end of year\nUnder the hood, Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 410 chipset and 1GB RAM were rumored to power the Lumia 750, with the meager 8GB of storage reportedly expandable through the MicroSD card slot. The 2,650mAh battery seems quite small, particularly when other phones include larger power packs, but thanks to the phone’s mid-range internals, it might have kept the Lumia 750 ticking from morning through the evening.\nFinally, the Lumia 750 might have run Windows 10 Mobile out of the box, but since the phone was in the works since 2015 , it might have also run Windows Phone 8.1.\nOverall, the Lumia 750 looks to have been a solid entrant in the mid-range phone space. The reasons surrounding its cancellation remain shrouded in mystery, though we assume they partly have to do with Microsoft reportedly doing away with the Lumia line and shifting resources to its rumored Surface Phone . Even then, Microsoft has quite the hill to climb, with the company’s mobile platform having captured less than one percent of the market.\nMicrosoft suggests it may never make another fitness band You can videoconference like never before with Hello Magnetic lace holders mean your shoes will never come undone again",

      "text": "NES Classic takes gamers back in time  00 AM By Max Parker \nWhile Sony and Microsoft push their big-ticket items this holiday season, Nintendo is taking a page from its history book. On Friday, the video game company is releasing the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) Classic. It’s a reimagining of the 1985 home game console that put the company on the map. \nThe NES Classic makes a visual statement without being a huge powerhouse that’s capable of 3-D graphics or powering a virtual reality headset. It’s a Nintendo system that literally fits in the palm of your hand. It’s instantly recognizable by anyone who owned a Nintendo in the ’80s or ’90s, or anyone who has ever seen the vintage game system. Even the controller that comes in the box is a perfect replica of the original controller. The NES Classic is undeniably adorable. \nIt’s when the system powers up that things are different. It doesn’t use the original game cartridges; they wouldn’t fit inside the NES Classic’s tiny design, even if the front hatch weren’t strictly decorative. Instead, the system comes with 30 classic games already loaded on the system. These include favorites such as the original three “Mario Bros.” games, “Punch-Out,”“Donkey Kong,”“Double Dragon,”“The Legend of Zelda” and many more. \nThe Classic boots up to a menu in 8-bit style graphics, and the user can choose from a list of games. These games are exactly the same as when they were originally released, but there’s a key improvement that brings the NES Classic to the modern era. Progress can be saved in every game on the fly. Each game has four save slots that can hold game saves at any time. It’s as easy as hitting the reset button when finished with the current game. \nThe $60 package comes with the NES Classic, a wall plug that connects to a micro-USB cord for power and one classic controller. The controller cord could stand to be a bit longer. The system is really going for the vintage feel, but it quickly reminds us just how convenient wireless game controllers have become. The games included are also a reminder of how difficult video games used to be. Another controller also would’ve been appreciated because many NES games are two-player. A second classic controller can be purchased for $9.99. \nThe NES Classic is a great excuse to show the younger generation what video games used to be like. Kids will either appreciate the punishing frustration of games such as “Ghosts ’N Goblins” or “Ninja Gaiden,” or will quit playing when they can’t beat Glass Jaw Joe in “Punch Out.” \nThe NES Classic isn’t likely to make fans out of younger gamers who have grown accustomed to the hand-holding of modern games. It’s more for players who remember the humble beginnings of home consoles, and want to relive some of those memories. \nAt $60, the NES Classic is a great item for the holiday season. Nintendo aimed to take players back in time with this device and it achieved that — what’s old is new again. \nMax Parker writes as The Game Guy at communityvoices.post-gazette.com.

      "text": "By: Daniel Calbimonte   More > Professional Development Certifications Problem \nI would like to know what books, videos, links and advice you could provide to pass the Microsoft exam Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2014 Databases (Exam 70-462)? Solution \nIn this tip, we will provide links to articles, books and other training material to help you pass the 70-462 exam. What is the 70-462 certification exam? \nThis exam is for SQL Server 2012 and 2014 focusing on Administering SQL Server. What is the price for the exam? \nIt depends on the country. In USA and Australia the price is $165. In Latin America and Africa it is usually $80 and in Europe 165. In Asia, it depends on the country. What books can I read to pass the exam? \nNone of these books covers the exam 100%, however they are a good start: The official book is the Training Kit (Exam 70-462) Administering Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Databases (MCSA) . This book is a good way to start, but reading the book several times is not enough to pass the certification. However, if you read all the book references, it will help a lot. Professional Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Administration is a very nice book to learn SQL Server Administration. It covers most of the topics in detail and in some cases it goes further. This book is not oriented to pass the exam, but it has really nice topics. Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Administration: Real-World Skills for MCSA Certification and Beyond (Exams 70-461, 70-462, and 70-463) is a book for beginners. You cannot pass the exam with this book. It is a nice book to introduce yourself to SQL Server and it has nice examples for daily administration tasks. It complements the other books. MCSA Guide to Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (Exam 70-462) does not contain as much information as the other books. It is a complementary book. I recommend it if you do not feel secure with the other books and want to read a little more. MCSE Exams 70-461 & 70-462 Self-Practice Review Questions 2015 Edition contains 100 questions to practice. The questions are not as complex as the real exam, but it is a good way to start practicing for the exam. Here is a site with free books not oriented to the exam directly, but if you read them all you will be overqualified in several topics for the exam: Other SQL Server books . Are there some practice exams? \nYes, there are several companies that offer practice exams. Here are some: Mindhub, a division of Pearson is the official practice exam. Boson offers nice practice exams and labs . It has two exams; one of them has 118 questions and another with 150 questions. The practice labs are nice because you have access to remote machines for practice. Transcender is another good choice. It includes exam questions and practice exams. It includes 132 questions. MeasureUp is another option. It contains 160 questions. Selftest is another company. It includes 50 questions. Can I access virtual labs to practice for the exam? \nIt is complicated to setup an environment especially if you are new. Microsoft offers Virtual Labs for free to practice and to checkout features. However, you can ignore the steps on the labs and do whatever you want on the labs in order to study for your exam. The environments are ready to use: Microsoft Virtual Labs Which fo MSDN or Technet StackOverFlow SQLServerCentral SQLTeam The official Microsoft is Course 20462D Administering MicrosoftŽ SQL ServerŽ 2014 Databases Another popular course is on PluralSight Microsoft Virtual Academy Udemy is offering this course at a v MSSQLTIPS webcasts Channel 9 YouTube Veam DBTNuggets",

      "text": "With Google , Microsoft and Facebook all pushing artificial intelligence, AI is becoming the next battleground for agencies, perpetually on the hunt for new service lines.\nAI basically gives machines the ability to think like humans. A simple example: You can have a one-on-one conversation with another person, but AI can talk to 500 people at the same time and make decisions based on real-time data to learn what’s going on in each conversation, explained Dave Meeker, vp of Isobar’s U.S. operations.\nIn the context of advertising and marketing, AI theoretically means more personalized and interactive consumer experience, including targeted programmatic ad buys, identification of site visitors’ decision-making patterns, conversational commerce like bots, as well as smarter search and recommendation engines on websites, according to six agency executives interviewed for this article.\nAdvertisement\nAt the moment, with the help of AI developed by big tech companies, agencies are able to serve cognitive ads and integrate voice-activated assistants in their campaigns. For instance, in September, GroupM’s MEC worked with IBM in a cognitive campaign for Campbell’s Soup, where Watson created personalized recipes as display ads for the brand on The Weather Company’s website based on a user’s location, what the weather is like in the area and the user’s ingredient preference.\nIn the same month, agency CP+B helped Domino’s release a Facebook Messenger ordering bot, and back in February, the agency added pizza-ordering support from Domino’s to Amazon Alexa, where users could ask the virtual assistant to place an order and track their order.\n“The most applicable things in AI right now are chatbot and natural-language processing,” said Joe Corr, executive creative technology director for CP+B’s Boulder office. “Utility chatbot is an easy first step. We are looking to experiment with chatbot that can reflect a brand’s voice and offer entertaining experience.”\nOf course, another important pillar of AI is creative. Saatchi & Saatchi’s Team One brought a short film that was created, concepted, directed and edited by machines to Cannes back in June of this year . While this may look like a PR stunt, it just shows that agencies are looking to learn more about the language of AI and inject creativity into AI implementation.\n“At some point, AI could even create a better ad than a creative director,” said Meeker.\nSure, why not? The thing about AI is that, like “big data,” it is affixed to lots of things. The AI market is estimated to reach $5.1 billion worldwide by 2020, up 54 percent from last year. And the media and advertising sector is expected to take the largest share of the overall AI market, according to research firm Markets and Markets. Agencies see that kind of money and smell opportunity, even though much of the AI market right now is not squarely in the services most agencies provide.\nMDC Media Partners officially debuted an agency called Born on Wednesday that is focused on AI. Partner of MDC’s investment arm KBS Ventures, Mike Nicholas found that the problem with agencies is that they are not well-versed in AI but they understand brands, while startups have intensive AI knowledge but they don’t know the commercial applications of their technology. So Born is created to examine every existing framework from different technology companies and stay on top of all emerging AI platforms from the startups. Then the agency can negotiate the ins and outs of the technology based on a brand’s needs.\n“If we cannot bridge the gap between agencies’ media knowledge and startups’ technical understanding of AI, we cannot succeed,” said Nicholas.\nAs Nicholas described, the design process in AI is based on characters and user experiences rather than on graphics or visuals. And creative character development is focused on vocabulary, diction and syntax. For instance, a creative may write copy for a brand in response to everything someone is going to say. The voice has to be reflective of the brand, not robotic. This type of character development is more like writing for a video game development or movie script development, and less like a copy treatment for an ad, he explained.\n“We are an agency that literally delivers ‘brand-as-service’ instead of brand as message,” he said.\nBorn only has four full-time employees at the moment, but it will hire more staff as needed, according to Nicholas.\nHuge, on the other hand, developed a virtual assistant called Dakota around two months ago as a use case, letting employees have conversations with AI. Dakota exists as a phone number, and it already started helping manage administrative tasks at the agency’s headquarters in Brooklyn.\nFor instance, a person can ask Dakota, “Who is the expert on retail?” Dakota may answer “Emily.” If the person wants to set up a meeting with Emily, Dakota can pull her schedule and further book a meeting.\n“We’ve learned from Dakota that it’s important to narrow the context in conversation with a chatbot,” said Bernardo Rodriguez, the agency’s managing director for business strategy. “So a brand may not be able to manage general complaints with a single bot, but it can develop a bot to specifically handle billing complaints, for instance.”\nMDC and Huge aside, Team One assembled an in-house team of six to focus on AI, where they work with clients and partners like IBM Waston and Google, and address AI at industry conferences. This framework is reminiscent of the agency’s virtual reality lab that was developed back in April of this year. The lab model proves efficient for Team One as it allows the agency to prototype, pull partners and in-house talent who are passionate about a specific topic, according to Joe Demiero, management director of digital for Team One.\n“Our VR lab started by two people in the closet, and now it’s a 500-person team,” he said. “I think AI will be the same.”\nOf course, not every agency plans to set up a separate entity or an in-house team to implement AI. GroupM and Isobar have run a few AI campaigns for brands like Google and Campbell’s Soup, but the technology doesn’t affect any internal structural changes at the two agencies.\n“We fundamentally believe the tactics that AI brings to the table are already integrated into the work we do,” said Cary Tilds, chief innovation officer for GroupM. “All of our teams must understand AI. We don’t need to form of separate group to show that we are invested in it.”",

      "title": "NooBaa Announces Microsoft Partnership: Azure Marketplace Availability and Accelerator Participation",
      "text": "NooBaa today announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft, which includes NooBaa’s native integration with Azure Blob Storage, availability of the NooBaa software-based storage solution in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, and Microsoft’s selection of NooBaa as a member in the Microsoft Accelerator program. NooBaa’s software solution provides a new architecture for a flexible compute and storage fabric that seamlessly spans enterprise datacenters and public cloud providers. In addition to supporting heterogeneous on-premises storage resources, NooBaa now allows customers to pool public cloud capacity from Microsoft’s Azure Blob Storage in addition to other cloud providers. NooBaa’s support for multiple public clouds reduces vendor lock-in and facilitates simple application and data migration between resource pools.\nThe NooBaa storage solution is now also available directly through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. NooBaa represents the first multi-cloud-capable storage solution in the Marketplace and provides access to Azure Blob Storage capacity via the popular S3 API, which has emerged as a de-facto standard for Dev-Ops and cloud computing. The NooBaa Azure Marketplace Edition can be deployed for free and automatically integrates with Azure compute and capacity resources.\nIn addition to NooBaa’s availability in the Azure Marketplace, NooBaa has also been selected by Microsoft to join the exclusive Microsoft Accelerator program . The Accelerator program provides NooBaa working space, and valuable access to mentoring, funding, facilities, and direct access to Microsoft customers. According to Navot Volk, Managing Director of Microsoft Accelerator, “We only accept 3.5% of the applicants into the accelerator so we’re extremely selective about the companies we work with. NooBaa is unique because their technology is impressive, they deliver a unique value proposition for Microsoft’s IT customers, and they align perfectly with Microsoft’s strategic vision for hybrid computing.”\nAccording to James Staten, Microsoft’s Chief Strategist for Cloud & Enterprise, “This blended model lets you stop worrying about where your apps are, and focus more on how to leverage the right resources for the right value…hybrid is not a temporary state but the new normal.” NooBaa supports hybrid computing by creating and automating a continuous capacity fabric across on-premises and public cloud resources, with flexible capabilities for data placement and migration. With NooBaa, customers can more easily move workloads between cloud providers without application changes.\n“It’s becoming clear that Microsoft is going to be a dominant market force for enterprise hybrid cloud computing over the next few years. Being admitted to the Accelerator was a huge win because it allows us to focus on important things like Azure integration and customer feedback,” according to Yuval Dimnik, NooBaa’s CEO, “we’re getting access to some amazing people and resources that are accelerating our progress. Plus I have to say the food is amazing!”\nAbout NooBaa\nNooBaa is the new way for enterprises to create and consume cloud services. It allows large enterprises to improve flexibility while reducing vendor lock-in and costs. Co-founded in 2013 by leading storage and security experts Yuval Dimnik and Guy Margalit, NooBaa has offices in Herzliya, Israel and Silicon Valley, California. Privately-held, NooBaa has received venture capital funding from JVP , OurCrowd and prominent industry leaders. For more information, visit http://www.noobaa.com .",

      "text": "Check it out \nThat’s all well and good, but what I’d like to know is why Microsoft is busying itself building a new to-do app when it already owns a perfectly good one. \nThe company acquired Berlin-based task manager Wunderlist back in June 2015; the app reported 13 million users at the time and has since added more functionality and become available in the Windows Store, while already supporting iOS, Android and Web users. \nIt also does a whole lot more than just list your tasks: You can share files, delegate items to people and discuss them and publish lists on the Web. \nWhether or not Wunderlist is perfect is a matter of debate, or rather, a matter of choice. There are tons of to-do apps out there and they suit different kinds of users with different needs. However, if Microsoft is going to throw its hat into the ring, it better be prepared to fight a difficult and bloody battle. \nMost to-do apps on the market right now have been around for years and have gone through loads of changes, adding and removing features, streamlining interfaces, and fighting hard to woo users away from incumbents – Wunderlist included. \nAs Thurrott.com notes, It’s possible that Project Cheshire is the next phase of Wunderlist – but in that case, it seems like an awful lot of unnecessary reworking for a tool that already does what it says on the tin pretty well. Sure, there might be room for an app with a radically different approach, like this one for Android designed by a teenager , but Project Cheshire seems to be just another list manager at present. \nHopefully things will change by the time Project Cheshire is ready for public release. We’ve contacted Microsoft to learn more and will update this post if there’s a response.",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft discovered a rather significant security flaw in the Windows 10 operating system last week and today the company has fixed it with a new security update. The security flaw itself allowed for attackers to take advantage of certain privilege settings which would allow them to potentially install and run applications. Russian hackers were said to have been taking advantage of the situation . Here’s Microsoft’s official statement on the fix: \nThis security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system. \nThis security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings section. The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory. \nThe security update should have already installed in the background on most Windows 10 devices . If not, an update can be force by opening up Settings, Update & security, and clicking on ‘Check for updates’. In this story stream:",

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 8, 2016 5:25 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nEarlier this year, Microsoft made a splash at its Ignite conference for IT professionals when it announced that it has been racking cards of programmable chips together with servers in its cloud data centers. \nThe chips, called field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), can be reconfigured after being deployed to optimize them for particular applications such as networking and machine learning. \nNow, Microsoft is investing in tools that would allow customers to program the FPGAs, said Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise division, during a talk at the Structure conference in San Francisco. \nUsing those tools could help increase performance of workloads that the chips are deployed to tackle. Guthrie said he hopes businesses will see performance improvements between two or three orders of magnitude using FPGAs compared to CPUs or GPUs. \nThere are issues with just giving people raw access to the FPGAs, though. \n\"When something goes wrong, you really need to be able to debug that quickly,\" Guthrie said.\"Because it's hardware, it could brick the machine, there are lots of things that we've had to learn how to protect against.\" \nThat said, there's an advantage to be gained from using FPGAs for business applications. \nRight now, the FPGAs are being used to power Azure's Accelerated Networking feature, as well as Microsoft products like Bing. They have the ability to radically speed up some computation. \nDoug Burger, a Microsoft researcher who helped spearhead the FPGA project, said that the company's entire deployment could be used to translate all of English-language Wikipedia in a tenth of a second. \nActually writing code for the FPGAs is something that would likely appeal to a small subset of businesses. But for those companies that want access, Microsoft's cloud platform could become a more interesting choice. RELATED TOPICS",

Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 8, 2016 3:59 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft has patched 68 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office, Edge, Internet Explorer and SQL Server, two of which have already been exploited by attackers and three that have been publicly disclosed. \nThe patches are covered in 14 security bulletins , one dedicated to Adobe Flash Player which is upgraded through Windows Update in Windows 10 and 8.1. Six of the bulletins are rated critical and eight are rated important. \nAdministrators should prioritize the Windows patches in the MS16-135 bulletin, because they address a zero-day vulnerability that's already being exploited by a group of attackers known in the security industry as Fancy Bear, APT28 or Strontium. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2016-7255, was publicly disclosed by Google last week, only 10 days after notifying Microsoft about it. This caused a bit of friction between the two companies. \nGoogle gives vendors only seven days to fix vulnerabilities or to publish mitigation advice if those flaws are found to be exploited in active attacks. Microsoft disagrees with that policy and feels that Google's decision to make details about this vulnerability public put customers at increased risk. \nAnother Windows security bulletin that should be prioritized is MS16-132 . It's rated critical and fixes multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities, including another zero-day flaw that, according Microsoft, is already being exploited by attackers. \nThe vulnerability is located in the Windows font library and can be exploited through specially crafted fonts embedded into websites or documents. Successful exploitation allows attackers to take full control of the affected systems, Microsoft said in the security bulletin. \nThree other critical vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Edge, covered in the MS16-142 and MS16-129 bulletins, have been publicly disclosed before being patched. However, according to Microsoft they haven't been exploited in attacks yet. \nThe Office security bulletin, MS16-133 , is rated as important, but covers remote code execution vulnerabilities that can be exploited through specially crafted documents. \n\"Since Office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environments I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as ‘Important',\" said Amol Sarwate, director of the Vulnerability Labs at security vendor Qualys, in an analysis of the patches. \nMicrosoft SQL Server administrators should prioritize the MS16-136 bulletin which covers vulnerabilities in the RDBMS engine, MDS API, SQL Analysis Services and the SQL Server Agent. \n\"SQL Server vulnerabilities are relatively rare and although there is no remote code execution, attackers can gain elevated privileges which could allow them to view, change, or delete data and create new accounts,\" Sarwate said.

      "text": "Microsoft revealed some time ago that it wanted to bring the cumulative update scheme from its Windows 10 operating system to Windows 8.1 and 7.\nThe new scheme started in October 2016 and brought along with it massive changes in regards to the downloading and deployment of updates for Windows 7 and 8.1 operating systems.\nThe move removed control from admins and home users alike, as it introduced an all or nothing approach to updating.\nPreviously, you could install or block individual updates, for instance if they caused issues on the system. With the new scheme, you cannot do that anymore as all updates are deployed as a single update. This means that you need to remove the whole update -- all good ones and the ones causing issues -- if you run into issues.\nThe new updating scheme raises another question: how are bugs caused by security updates handled ? If they are patched by non-security updates, then security-only systems won't get them.\nMicrosoft's updating terminology is atrocious \nBut there is another issue, one that has not been talked about that much. Microsoft publishes two update packages for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 each month.\nOne includes only security updates released in that month, the other includes those security updates and non-security updates. The second may furthermore include patches from previous months on top of that.\nThe designated names for these updates are:\n[month] Security Only Quality Update for [operating systems]. Example: November, 2016 Security Only Quality Update for Windows 8 and Server 2008 R2 [month] Security Monthly Quality Rollup for [operating systems]. Example: November, 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 The naming scheme is confusing in my opinion even though there are indicators that tell you which is which.\nHere are the pointers:\nThe security-only update package for a given month has \" security only \" in the title. The all updates package for a given month as \" rollup \" in the title. This is the only way to distinguish between those two update packages. It is important for Windows users and administrators who only want to install the security updates but not the regular updates.\nIt is unclear why Microsoft made them sound this similar. While I can understand the company's desire to reflect that both include security updates, it would have been better if it would have picked a slightly different terminology for the updates:\nSecurity Only Update for Rollup Update for This would make things a lot clearer and prevent much of the confusion surrounding the current terminology for update packages for Windows.\nNow you : What's your take on the new updating terminology?\nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "Microsoft Issues Windows 10 Patch for Security Flaw That Google Revealed Patch is part of monthly cumulative update for Windows Microsoft Edge users on Windows 10 Anniversary Update already covered Microsoft identified Strontium as group that were targeting users \nMicrosoft has issued a patch for the critical Windows 10 system vulnerability brought to light by Google last week , it said in its security bulletin announcement on Tuesday. The Redmond-based software giant had expressed its displeasure with the disclosure by the search giant, which had cited the bug’s active targeting as its reasoning for going public. \nThe fix is available as part of Windows’ monthly updates. Microsoft claimed the vulnerability did not affect anyone using Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and any attacks could also be detected using Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. For everyone else, hackers who manage to successfully exploit the vulnerability “could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights”. ( Also see: Microsoft Says Russia-Linked Hackers Exploiting Google-Discovered Windows Flaw )\nAfter Google’s Threat Analysis Group reported their findings, Microsoft traced the activity to a hacker group it calls Strontium, which mostly dabbles in “low-volume spear-phishing”. According to Microsoft, Strontium has been linked with more zero-day exploits to their name than any other group in 2016. The group mostly targets government agencies, diplomatic institutions, and military organisations, along with defence contractors and public policy research institutes. \nAnd owing to the risk involved, Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group VP Terry Myerson believes coordinated vulnerability disclosure is better for customers. “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” he added. \nNow that Microsoft has a patch out, you should check the updates section to ensure you’re in the clear. And if you’re yet to update Adobe Flash, get on that pronto .",

Skype Insiders will also be able to contribute to the direction the product goes in, as well as help the Skype team improve the user experience.\nPlanned new features include group video calls, one on one VoIP audio calls, and Emoji. Skype Insiders can get the latest updates on the desktop as well as mobile versions of the app. Skype is available for Windows, Macintosh and Linux based computers, as well as smartphone operating systems including Android, iOS and Windows.\nSkype Insiders will be able to test the updates and provide feedback to Microsoft, to fix the issues before a wider roll out of the features. Users will also be able to submit suggestions to the Skype team, requesting of new features they would like to see in the product.\nUsers can sign up for the Skype Insiders program from here . There is a clause that prevents users from disclosing sensitive and confidential information about new updates for a period of years, and the clause holds even after the user discontinues the program, or Microsoft decides to terminate the participation by the user. The Skype Insiders program involves using a separate beta build of the application, which can be installed along with the vanilla version.\nThe post Skype launches Skype Insiders Program for beta-testing new features appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Microsoft rolled out this month’s Patch Tuesday fixes only a few hours ago, including an update that addresses the Windows security flaw that search giant Google made public last week. Google discovered an unpatched vulnerability in Windows and after notifying Microsoft, it decided to make it public, adding that exploits were already spotted in the wild. Google’s security effort has a policy that gives companies 7 days to fix found security flaws, and in the case of Microsoft, the public disclosure was made after 10 days. Microsoft blamed Google for posting details online, explaining that with this decision the company made Windows users vulnerable to attacks and promised to release a fix on Patch Tuesday. Today, this fix is finally available in the form of MS16-135, an upda...",

      "text": "AvePoint, the Microsoft Cloud expert and leader in data protection, and the Centre for Information Policy Leadership (CIPL) at Hunton & Williams, LLP, a global privacy think tank, today announced from the halls of the IAPP Europe Data Protection Congress the availability of the first-ever global benchmark report for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Launched in May 2016, the survey compiles responses from 223 predominantly multinational organizations on their preparedness for GDPR implementation. The European Union GDPR marks the beginning of significant changes to how companies manage and process personal data, their privacy compliance programs, as well as IT systems and infrastructure. The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC and will come into force in May 2018.\n“The GDPR signals the start of a new generation of data privacy laws and practice in Europe and beyond,” said Bojana Bellamy, President, CIPL. “The new law will affect the risk profile of organizations, impact their management, use and sharing of data, as well as their IT systems and infrastructure. But GDPR also represents an opportunity for organizations to consider data privacy compliance more strategically and holistically, as it becomes key to their data strategy and the digital transformation of their business.”\nThe report highlights nine key trends that relate the most to everyday business and compliance concerns, including:\nGDPR Impact: Respondents believe that the aspects of the GDPR that will have the largest impact on their organizations are the requirements for a comprehensive privacy management program, use and contracting with processors, as well as data security and breach notification. As expected, senior management is most concerned about the GDPR’s enhanced sanction regime and the data breach notification requirements, as well as how the regulation will impact their data strategy and ability to use data.\nData Transfers Outside the EU: Organizations appear to use a wide variety of mechanisms today for data transfer related to internal human resources (HR), consumers/customers, and vendors. According to responses, they will continue to do so after the GDPR is implemented. The most popular mechanisms today are, in descending order: Model Contracts, consent and necessity for contracts, as well as Privacy Shield.\nCompliance Technology Tools and Software: Currently, organizations do not appear to widely use or have access to technology tools and software to aid with data privacy compliance tasks. Only a minority of organizations use technology to automate and industrialize their data protection impact assessments (DPIAs), data classification and tagging policies, data processing inventories, and delivery of the new data portability right.\n“This GDPR survey report is designed to help organizations understand and benchmark the key operational impacts of the regulation and to support their internal change management program,” said Dana Simberkoff, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, AvePoint. “We hope that this report will allow organizations to accelerate their progress toward true operationalization for GDPR readiness.”\nTo access the full report, please visit the AvePoint website.

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft’s Photosynth service only has a few months left to live. After initially killing the mobile application last year, Microsoft has now announced that the website will also be shutting down soon. \nFor those of you not familiar with the service, Photosynth allows users to create a panorama, or a sphere, by stitching together images. Users could then look around, and experience a place in full 360-degree views, essentially creating a VR experience. Unfortunately, Photosynth never really caught on, partially because the results were only viewable inside of the app. \nThough other services now offer the same functionality, Photosynth was among the first and it featured some very impressive technology for its time. Despite its possible appeal for VR enthusiasts, its time now seems to be over. \nMicrosoft shut down the mobile Photosynth app more than a year ago , when it scuttled a number of other services as well. At the time the company told users to back up their Photosynth panoramas to the service’s website. Now, Microsoft announced that the Photosynth website will also be shutting down on the 6 th of February 2017. \nThose of you who want to download and save their panoramas or creations can do so by logging in and hitting the export button. Microsoft has also created a Photosynth Offline Viewer so you can access your content locally.",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft has just filed a patent for a new accessory for their Surface Pen. The proposed object would act as both a strap for holding a Surface Pen in place against a Windows 10 device and also as a method for charging the pen. As can be seen in the image below, the concept shows miniature strap that connects to a USB port. The strap would hold the Surface Pen while wires within it would connect to the USB connector and charge it when plugged into a powered on machine. Surface Pen Patent \nHere’s the relevant passage from the overly-long, though not unexpectedly so, patent filing . \nInductive peripheral retention device techniques are described. In one or more implementations, an apparatus includes a plug configured to removably engage a communication port of a device to form a communicative coupling with the device. The plug is securable to and removable from the device using one or more hands of a user. The apparatus also includes a peripheral securing portion connected to the plug and configured to removably engage a peripheral device via an inductive element formed as a flexible loop and configured to form a communicative coupling between the peripheral device and the device. \nIn one or more implementations, inductance is detected of a flexible element configured to transfer power to a peripheral device via inductance. Responsive to a determination that the detected inductance is above a threshold, a first power mode is utilized in which a first amount of power is provided to the flexible element. Responsive to a determination that the detected inductance is below a threshold, a second power mode is utilized in which a second amount of power is provided to the flexible element that is less than the first amount of power. \nA patent filing doesn’t necessarily guarantee that a company will produce a product but it is interesting to see what sort of ideas Microsoft is considering for future product releases. Would you use an accessory such as this one? Let us know in the comments below. In this story stream:",

      "title": "Microsoft to retire Security Bulletins in January 2017",
      "text": "Microsoft announced on yesterday's Patch Tuesday for November that it plans to retire the publication of Security Bulletins in January 2017.\nSecurity bulletins like MS16-129 reveal information about patched vulnerabilities. This includes information about the vulnerability, affected software, severity ratings, deployment information and more.\nThe company has created a new portal called Security Updates Guide which can best be described as a searchable database of security updates released for Windows and other products. Microsoft plans to make it the sole destination for security update information starting February 2017.\nInstead of publishing bulletins to describe related vulnerabilities, the new portal lets our customers view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database.\nSecurity Updates Guide \nThe Security Updates Guide database lists publication dates, KB Article IDs, and the affected products in a table.\nIt features a data filter at the top to limit the listing to a particular time period, and a text search option that enables you to find updates by product, KB article or CVE.\nA search for Windows 7 returns updates that are released for the operating system for instance, while a KB ID search that particular update.\nA new Rest API can be leveraged to obtain \"Microsoft security update\" information. This eliminates the need for companies and individuals to use screen-scraping or other methods to obtain update information.\nThe table looks less useful from a user perspective. One reason for that is that it does not highlight KB article titles. While you know that updates apply to your systems or products by looking at the \"applies to\" column, there is virtually no information on the update itself.\nYou do need to click on the KB article link to open it to get the information. It is unclear yet how this will work when security bulletins are not released anymore.\nThe KB article 3197867, which is the Security Only Quality Update for Windows 7 for November 2016, links to security bulletins for instance. If those are not published anymore, it seems likely that the links will point to KB articles instead as well.\nMicrosoft notes that Security Bulletins will be published until January 2017. After the January 2017 update, information is published only to the Security Updates Guide.\nSecurity update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide.\nIt remains to be seen as to how this will work out in the end as we don't know all the facts yet.\nNow You : What's your take on the announcement?\n \nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Microsoft to retire Security Bulletins in January 2017 appeared first on gHacks Technology News .",

      "text": "  \nIn June, 2016, Microsoft rebranded its SmartGlass “second screen” app for Android and iOS in June, 2016, as the “Xbox” app. The new app was redesigned to resemble the modern Xbox One interface, which had itself been retouched to look more like Windows 10. The app’s homepage, for example, now shows a detailed activity feed similar to the console’s, so players can see game clips and screenshots shared by their friends on Xbox Live. It’s an update that’s been a long time coming, as SmartGlass was a fickle companion for years. \nRelated: Halo on PC? Here’s how to do it, with Game Streaming in Windows 10 \nSimilar to Sony’s PlayStation app, the Xbox app allows users to purchase games, share updates, view their achievements, and share updates with the their followers on Xbox Live. It also provides additional tools for viewing achievements, controlling movie playback, and accessing social elements such as profiles and messaging. \nAll it takes to gain complete control over your Xbox experience is a little bit of patience. The process for pairing your devices is now easier than ever, so read on for our quick-hit guide on how to connect your smartphone to an Xbox One, regardless if you’re using Android or iOS. Step 1: Download the Xbox app \nBefore downloading the Xbox app for iOS or Android , you’ll want to update your smartphone or tablet to the latest version of its respective operating system. iOS users need version 8.0 or higher and Android users will need version 4.0 or higher. Once updated, head over to either iTunes or Google Play store and enter “Xbox” in the search field to locate the app. \nTap the Install button to begin downloading the app to your smartphone or tablet, and launch it once installed. Then, sign into your Xbox account when prompted. Download for: iOS Android Step 2: Connect to your network \nNavigate to Network settings on your Xbox One — and your network preferences on your smartphone — and ensure they’re connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If your Xbox One is not connected, select Set up wireless network , choose your desired network, and enter the respective password if prompted. Obviously, both devices must also be within range of your network to connect. \nWe recommend connecting your smartphone and your Xbox One to the same wireless network, as it will strengthen the connection. However, it is possible to use your cellular network to connect as well. Step 3: Sync your smartphone with your console \nWhile using the Xbox app, tap the three horizontal bars in the upper-left corner to bring up the main menu. From here, you can access most features, but for now, just tap Connection . After a second, a Connect to your Xbox One option should appear near the top of the screen. \nTapping that should bring up a list of available Xbox consoles that you can connect to. Assuming yours is the only one on the list, tap the icon — labeled “Xbox-SystemOS, unless you’ve renamed it– and then “Turn on.” Voila! Your smartphone and your Xbox are now soulmates. You should now be able to use your smartphone as a controller and keyboard, though this functionality is limited to the Xbox OS. There’s currently no in-game, second-screen integration. Step 4: Use the app \nConnecting is easy, but learning how to use the Xbox app takes a little time and understanding. Again, tapping the three horizontal bars in the upper-left corner of the app will bring up the menu, which allows you to view your profile and achievements, your recorded clips and screenshots, and access the Xbox Store, among other options. Tapping your avatar icon will bring up your friends list, while the icons next door control messages and notifications, respectively.",

      "text": "By Boyd Chan Neowin LLC @therealboydchan · 4 seconds ago \nBack in March, Microsoft launched SharePoint Server 2016 before later releasing the RTM version to the public on May 4, in conjunction with a Future of SharePoint event held in San Francisco which outlined the company's roadmap for the product. The following month, Microsoft released its SharePoint mobile app for iOS before bringing it to Android and Windows Mobile later this year. \nNow, Microsoft has released the first major update to SharePoint Server 2016, called 'Feature Pack 1', delivered as part of the November 2016 Public Update and bundles a number of new features, which include: \nAdministrative actions logging \nThis feature will help streamline troubleshooting issues related to administrative changes by logging actions undertaken via the central administration website or the management shell. \nMinRole enhancements \nMinRole helps simplify the deployment process by ensuring that services are operating on the correct servers within a farm, based upon a set of predefined server roles. \nOneDrive for Business modern experience \nAn updated user interface has been introduced into OneDrive for Business, bringing with it a refreshed layout and functionality already found in its Office 365 counterpart. However, this particular feature will require an active software assurance contract at the time of updating to Feature Pack 1, otherwise the feature must be disabled. \nCustom tiles \nThe app launcher, used to access SharePoint and Office 365 services, now includes the ability to add individual SharePoint sites, external sites, legacy apps, or anything accessible via a URL. \nOneDrive API \nFeature Pack 1 integrates a new API which integrates the ability to access content in OneDrive Personal and OneDrive for Business as well document libraries in SharePoint Online. \nRounding out Feature Pack 1 are two hybrid capabilities which have been made available in preview form. \nHybrid Auditing enables audit logs from on-premises installations of SharePoint 2016 to be collected and uploaded to Office 365 where centralized auditing and reporting functions can be accessed. The second capability, dubbed Hybrid Taxonomy , enables information structures to be deployed across a farm running SharePoint Server 2016 in conjunction with Office 365.",

      "text": "Microsoft November Security Updates Include Fix For Zero-Day Flaw In total, company released 14 security bulletins, six of which addressed Critical flaws Microsoft’s monthly for November include fixes for four previously disclosed vulnerabilities, at least one of which, is already being actively exploited in the wild. \nThe flaw being attacked (CVE-2016-7255) exists in the Windows kernel and allows threat actors to escalate privileges on vulnerable systems. \nSecurity researchers from Google’s Threat Analysis Group who late last month described it as enabling a security sandbox escape. At the time, the Google researchers said they had decided to release details of the bug because attackers were already exploiting it in the wild in conjunction with a separate flaw in Adobe Flash. \nGoogle’s decision to go public before a patch became available earned it a rebuke from Microsoft , which however also warned \nMicrosoft Security Bulletin MS16-135 , \n“Since there is a Windows vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild, admins should really focus on verifying that their Windows clients are up to date before focusing on their servers,” he says. “We recommend that admins set their user’s workstations up for automatic updates when possible,” \nIn addition to the Windows kernel flaw that is \nHe identified the three flaws (CVE-2016-7227, CVE-2016-7199, and CVE-2016-7209) as existing in Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge browser and fixed via the MS-16-129 and MS-16-142 security bulletins, both of which Microsoft rated as critical. \nFrom a patch deployment standpoint however, enterprises should focus on first deploying the fix for the Windows Kernel-Mode flaw that Google disclosed. Also important is a fix for a critical Open Type Font remote code execution vulnerability that Microsoft addressed in its MS16-132 released Tuesday, Sarwate says. \nAdministrators should also not overlook the patches for vulnerabilities in IE and Edge, he says. “Browsers are like gateways to the Internet and desktop administrators should focus on browser patches MS16-142 and MS16-129,” he says. In addition, enterprises might want to pay immediate attention to the Security Update for Microsoft Office (MS-16-133) released today even though Microsoft has only given it an ‘Important rating he said. \n“Starting last month as all patches are now included in one bundled fix, it’s more of a question of identifying your resources and applying the patch bundle, Sarwate says. \nMeanwhile, in a separate announcement, Adobe Tuesday released security updates for its Adobe Connect for Windows web conferencing software and for for Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Chrome OS. \nThe update for Adobe Connect addresses an input validation error that could be used to launch cross-site scripting attacks. Adobes Flash Player update for November has fixes for nine critical vulnerabilities, the most severe of which would allow an attacker to take complete control of a vulnerable system.

      "text": "Share \nAn alternative small business lender has now switched its hosting platform to Microsoft Azure in a move the firm says represents its strong growth trajectory. \nFolk2Folk announced Tuesday (Nov. 8) that it has gone live on Microsoft Azure cloud after being hosted on Rackspace, though the company said it would continue to use Rackspace to optimize its cloud apps. The company, which launched in 2013, said the migration will allow the company to be hosted on the cloud and yet still focus on expansion. \n“We were sold on the benefits of the cloud but didn’t want to set up the solution ourselves because it would have taken focus away from growth, which is a key priority for us,” said Folk2Folk IT Director Karl Straw in a statement. \nThe U.K. company focuses on providing loans to small businesses rejected by traditional banks for financing. \nFolk2Folk will first migrate its loan management system to Microsoft’s Azure cloud, with its financing system following suit, according to reports. Its loan management system, FolkLMS, manages the company’s relationship to investors, Straw explained. \nAccording to the executive, the company had previously hosted its servers in-house and was paying for a disaster recovery service. \n“We chose Azure because it’s a great platform for our business,” Straw added. “We are growing rapidly and are in constant need of bigger, better environments. To do this with our own equipment or a normal hosting environment would have been very capital-intensive.”",

First and foremost, there are users complaining that KB3200970 fails to install just like the previous cumulative updates, explaining that the operating system attempts the install but then restores the previous settings and boots to the desktop.

      "text": "Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit v2.0 Beta 1 InfoWorld Rating Learn more on Microsoft Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit is an open source, unified deep learning toolkit with new C++ and Python APIs. Follow InfoWorld | Nov 9, 2016 \nLike Google, Microsoft has been differentiating its products by adding machine learning features. In the case of Cortana , those features are speech recognition and language parsing. In the case of Bing, speech recognition and language parsing are joined by image recognition. Google’s underlying machine learning technology is TensorFlow . Microsoft’s is the Cognitive Toolkit. \nBoth TensorFlow and Cognitive Toolkit have been released to open source. Both are complex frameworks that implement many neural network and deep learning algorithms. Both present challenges to developers new to the area. Cognitive Toolkit has recently become easier to install and deploy than it was, thanks to an automatic installation script. Cognitive Toolkit may be a little easier to use than TensorFlow right now, but that is balanced by TensorFlow’s wider applicability.",

      "text": "Pinterest \nRumour has it that Microsoft’s upcoming -and highly anticipated – console, the Xbox Scorpio (or Project Scorpio), will come with a rather interesting feature: it will be able to run UWP (Universal Windows Platform) PC games on the Windows 10 Store at a native resolution of 4K. \nAccording to a report by Windows Central, a credible source has informed the tech site that Microsoft’s Xbox Scorpio console will be able to run UWP-based PC games in 4K without the need for developers to ‘port’ the game or require any additional developments. All of this is possible thanks to the alleged 6 TFLOPS of compute performance of the console, which is significantly higher than the PlayStation 4 Pro’s 4.2 TFLOPS figure. \nIn addition to that, the feature is also possible partly due to the Universal Windows Platform, which is a standardised development API for the Windows 10 family. This means that should a developer choose to develop a game natively for UWP, the game should be playable on both a Windows 10 PC and the Xbox Scorpio console. \nOf course, developers aren’t required to only create games that will only run at 4K for the Xbox Scorpio. Instead, developers can also opt to make 1080p games with higher graphical fidelity that will take full advantage of the Xbox Scorpio’s powerful hardware. Current games that are rumoured to have already been optimised for 4K on Xbox Scorpio include Gears of War 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider. Microsoft Introduces New Surface Book With Better Graphics and Longer Battery Life \nThis comes as great news for console enthusiasts because it’s about time consoles are fitted with high-end hardware and performance. That said, it’s still far too early to tell whether this will be the case, as the Xbox Scorpio is only due for launch in the second half of next year. \n(Source: Windows Central , TweakTown ) 3",

      "title": "Microsoft patched six Critical and eight Important security flaws in Windows last night",
      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nYesterday was Patch Tuesday , so Microsoft has released the usual series of fixes and improvements for its software. We’ve already noted all the new features that are coming with Windows 10 build 13393.447 , as well as patches headed to older versions of Windows 10. \nNow, Microsoft has published its monthly security bulletin, detailing some of the security fixes that were part of yesterday’s patches. The company fixed six flaws deemed Critical in Windows, as well as a further eight considered to be Important in Windows, Windows Server, Office and Internet Explorer. \nHere are some of the highlights from last night’s critical updates: \nMS16-129 addresses a critical vulnerability found in Microsoft Edge, which at worst, could allow for remote code execution on affected machines. The flaw could be exploited if a user visited a maliciously crafted webpage. Users running with fewer privileges could be less impacted. \nMS16-142 addresses a similar vulnerability inside of Internet Explorer. An attacker who tricked the user into viewing a maliciously crafter webpage could gain access to the affected system and elevate his privileges. He’d then be able to run code remotely and take complete control over the target machine. \nMS16-130 has to do with a security flaw inside of Windows, which could eventually allow for remote code execution if a locally authenticated attacker ran a specially created script on the affected system. \nMS16-131 is another vulnerability inside of Windows, having to do with Microsoft Video Control. The issue could allow for remote code execution because of a problem with the way Microsoft Video Control stores objects in memory. An attacker could gain full access to the system if it convinces a local user to open a local malicious file or program. Interestingly enough, Microsoft has patched this component of Windows a number of times during the past few months, but critical issues seem to keep popping up. \nMS16-132 is once more Windows vulnerability that relates to the Microsoft Graphics Component. Windows Animation Manager improperly handles objects in memory, leaving the door wide open to attack if a user visits a malicious website. A successful exploitation of the issue could leave the attacker with full control over the system. \nMS14-141 is the final critical bulletin among yesterday’s patches. It contains relates to critical vulnerabilities found in Adobe Flash Player, and contains fixes for nine flaw registered by Adobe. \nAs mentioned above, besides the patches deemed to be Critical, the update also contains a number of Important bug fixes for security issues in Windows, Windows Server, and Office. None of the reported flaws are being exploited in the wild according to Microsoft.",

      "text": "Layer2, specialist for portals based on Microsoft SharePoint technologies regarding data integration, is always up-to-date for its customers with new solutions for SharePoint and Office 365.\nHamburg, Germany - November 7,\nFor more than 25 years of experience in IT infrastructure, consulting, service and support, and more than 10 years in the fields of Microsoft SharePoint and .NET-programming, the German company Layer2 offers a broad variety of deep technical knowledge with a focus on business end-users and customers.\nToday, Layer2 is also a specialist for creating and developing innovative products, solutions, and features specifically based on Microsoft technologies like SharePoint, Office 365, and Azure with a major focus on Data Integration , Collaborative Knowledge Management , and Cloud Computing .\n\" Our main focus at Layer2 Solutions is to develop products and features for data integration to help companies quickly solve issues regarding data integration, synchronization, backup, or migration with Microsoft SharePoint portals. As data and cloud technologies continue to grow, we have to be always up-to-date and regularly developing new solutions to satisfy all our customers' needs \" says Matthias Hupe, General Manager of Layer2 Solutions.\nLayer2 Products reduce costs and optimize collaboration.\nLayer2 Products are characterized by adding additional features to Microsoft portals and to help customers work better and faster with their software without any programming knowledge.\nThe Layer2 Cloud Connector , built for integration projects from cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-on-premises, prevents data islands caused by insufficient integration strategies in companies. As one of the market-leading tools for Microsoft Cloud data integration, the Cloud Connector is known for closing those gaps by integrating and syncing 100+ various IT systems and apps (for example: SQL/ERP/CRM) seamlessly via Layer2 Data Providers.\nThe new feature \"Dynamic Columns\" adds data calculations, transformations, and customer-specific business logics via C# to give customers even more flexibility to keep their data automatically in sync.\n\" The Connector highly reduces the dependency on corporate IT and directly empowers departmental subject matter teams to get things done faster with significantly reduced complexity, risks, and costs \", says Frank Daske, Business Development Manager at Layer2.\nThe Layer2 Business Data List Connector , specifically optimized for SharePoint Server on-premises , solves typical issues with SharePoint external data integration. The product enables a simple and codeless way to connect external data to native SharePoint lists, while all native SharePoint features are available for the connected lists, including views, search, managed metadata, lookups, offline and mobile access, change notifications, and workflows. All desired data, populated to lists, are presented without any restrictions with the full read-only and also write-back (CRUD) functionality of native SharePoint lists.\nFor optimizing Knowledge Management in SharePoint on-premises, the Layer2 Knowledge Management Suite improves the collaboration and end-user adaption to enable better organizational intelligence in companies and organizations, by increasing the benefits and reduce the risks of customization projects. This product assigns consistent and accurate managed metadata to items and documents automatically in Microsoft SharePoint for better navigation, search and findability.\nCustomers integrate enterprise data sources quickly with new solutions.\nTo be up-to-date regarding data integration, Layer2 regularly develops new solutions for its customers and their various needs like Office 365 , Microsoft Flow , Azure Logic Apps and Office 365 Groups .\nStarted in 2011 with Office 365 Integration, Layer2 was one of the first movers to focus their integration projects on the cloud-based Office 365. Since then the Layer2 Cloud Connector functions as a \"Swiss-Army Knife\" of Microsoft Office 365 data integration and connects and syncs content from almost any corporate data source, e.g. databases, local file systems, web services, or SharePoint on-premises content directly with each other in the cloud.\nSince many typically commonly used backend applications for data integration are missing in the new Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, or Office 365 Groups, customers have the chance to take advantage of the Layer2 Cloud Connector, which is able to connect missing enterprises backend systems like vendor specific SQL/ERP/CRM to Microsoft Azure Logic Apps for triggering actions and integrating data or to Microsoft Flow to copy or move structured data or documents between apps. Concerning Office 365 Groups, the Connector closes any gaps to notify group members about any data changes by posting Group Cards with almost any enterprise data.\n\" The solution makes it easier for small and medium sized businesses to exchange data with partners, and allows larger enterprises to go beyond integration by leveraging the growing set of scalable Azure services to extract value from all data sources, across any devices \", says Wolfgang Cords, Founder and General Manager of Layer2.\nFree Trials can be downloaded at the company's homepage: www.layer2solutions.com\nFull press release available here .\nRelated Links\nLayer2 Solutions\nLayer2 Products\nRelated Files\nBusiness-Data-List-Connector-for-SharePoint.pdf\nOffice-365-Cloud-Connector-for-SharePoint.pdf\n 25 Years of Layer2: Technology Experience in IT, Cloud and On-Premise Data Integration\n ",

      "text": "Lumia McLaren is one of the most exciting Microsoft devices that never came to be, even though on paper everything seemed to be quite fabulous. And although the company shut down the project before it even got to see daylight, the Lumia McLaren, also known as Lumia 1030, made the rounds several times, with photos and leaks providing us with a closer look at the device that could have been. Now a photo published by leaker Evan Blass shows the Lumia 1030 once again, and although there’s nothing too exciting to see here, it’s also worth a look at given the fact that it’s a Windows phone that could have helped the platform grow bigger – we all know that things aren’t going very well for Microsoft’s mobile operating system and devices like this could have contributed to better adoption figures. Leaving the innovative features aside, such as the exploding live tiles, the Lumia McLaren looks quite appeal...",

The searchable database is available here . Microsoft says that starting with February 2017, the searchable database will replace its convoluted Security Bulletins system. \n\"Security update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide,\" the Microsoft team said in a statement published yesterday. Many expected Microsoft to retire its Security Bulletins system \nMany industry experts have expected Microsoft to retire its Security Bulletins after in August the company announced a new cumulative update model for Windows 7 and 8.1, modeled after Windows 10. \nThe company announced that instead of multiple smaller update packages that fixed individual issues, it will be delivering one single update per month, including all fixes. \nMicrosoft said that two updates will be available each month for each operating system, one including all OS updates, and one that included only security-related fixes. \nThe all-in-one update, which also includes the security fixes, will be delivered via the normal Windows Update system, while sysadmins looking for the security-only package will have to download and deploy it from WSUS, SCCM, and the Microsoft Update Catalog. New security updates database simplifies searching for specific patches \nThe new security updates portal allows users to search updates by CVE, KB number, product, or release date, and will help system administrators identify the month and update package in which security fixes were released by Microsoft's staff. \nMicrosoft also announced that a RESTful API will be available for system administrators and developers that want to programmatically interact with the new security updates database.",

      "text": "Microsoft Patches Windows 10 Flaw That Google Revealed Last Week  48 PST \nAbout a week ago, Google publicly revealed that there was a security flaw in Microsoft’s Windows operating system. Flaws do pop up every now and then as hackers can get pretty creative with how they go about their hacks, but what Microsoft did not appreciate was the fact that Google made it public before they could fix it. \nThe company then announced that they would be fixing it next week , which is this week, and the good news for Windows users is that it looks like the patch has already been made available . According to Microsoft , “This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.” \nMicrosoft also stated last week that there were hackers who had already taken advantage of the security flaw. This came in the form of a group of Russian hackers who called themselves Strontium, and apparently they conducted some low-volume phishing campaigns as a result of this flaw. In any case your computer should be relatively safe once you have patched it. The patch will also contain fixes for six critical flaws, so if you haven’t done so already, you should probably go ahead and update your Windows computer. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "Microsoft patches 68 vulnerabilities, two actively exploited ones Two of the patched flaws are already being exploited and three have been publicly disclosed More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 9, 2016 3:16 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft has patched 68 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office, Edge, Internet Explorer and SQL Server, two of which have already been exploited by attackers and three that have been publicly disclosed. \nThe patches are covered in 14 security bulletins , one dedicated to Adobe Flash Player which is upgraded through Windows Update in Windows 10 and 8.1. Six of the bulletins are rated critical and eight are rated important. \nAdministrators should prioritize the Windows patches in the MS16-135 bulletin, because they address a zero-day vulnerability that's already being exploited by a group of attackers known in the security industry as Fancy Bear, APT28 or Strontium. \nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2016-7255, was publicly disclosed by Google last week, only 10 days after notifying Microsoft about it. This caused a bit of friction between the two companies. \nGoogle gives vendors only seven days to fix vulnerabilities or to publish mitigation advice if those flaws are found to be exploited in active attacks. Microsoft disagrees with that policy and feels that Google's decision to make details about this vulnerability public put customers at increased risk. \nAnother Windows security bulletin that should be prioritized is MS16-132 . It's rated critical and fixes multiple remote code execution vulnerabilities, including another zero-day flaw that, according Microsoft, is already being exploited by attackers. \nThe vulnerability is located in the Windows font library and can be exploited through specially crafted fonts embedded into websites or documents. Successful exploitation allows attackers to take full control of the affected systems, Microsoft said in the security bulletin. \nThree other critical vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Edge, covered in the MS16-142 and MS16-129 bulletins, have been publicly disclosed before being patched. However, according to Microsoft they haven't been exploited in attacks yet. \nThe Office security bulletin, MS16-133 , is rated as important, but covers remote code execution vulnerabilities that can be exploited through specially crafted documents. \n\"Since Office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environments I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as ‘Important',\" said Amol Sarwate, director of the Vulnerability Labs at security vendor Qualys, in an analysis of the patches. \nMicrosoft SQL Server administrators should prioritize the MS16-136 bulletin which covers vulnerabilities in the RDBMS engine, MDS API, SQL Analysis Services and the SQL Server Agent. \n\"SQL Server vulnerabilities are relatively rare and although there is no remote code execution, attackers can gain elevated privileges which could allow them to view, change, or delete data and create new accounts,\" Sarwate said.

      "text": "Microsoft Announces New Portal for Software Security Updates GO All details will be posted on the Security Updates portal Nov 9, 2016 10:44 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has recently introduced a preview of its new Security Updates Guide portal and now the company is making a change that will put it at the core of update information provided to users. Specifically, long-time Microsoft users might know that the company is posting security update information on TechNet on a website called Microsoft Security Bulletin , but since the firm is overhauling the way security patches are shipped to users, a new channel to provide this info is being developed as well. More recently, Microsoft introduced a preview of the Security Updates Guide , a new portal that includes pretty much everything you need to know about security vulnerabilities using a single and comprehensive online database. Full transition to the security portal Starting with January 2017, this new portal will become the only source of information regarding security updates, with Microsoft explaining that the Security Bulletin website will be used just one more time next month on Patch Tuesday. Microsoft goes on to explain the main advantages of its new service, pointing out that users can sort and filter security vulnerability and update content by CVW, KB number, or product, but also to filter out products that aren’t of your interest. You can also “leverage a new RESTful API to obtain Microsoft security update information,” Microsoft explains, and “this eliminates the need for you to employ outdated methods like screen-scraping of security bulletin web pages to assemble working databases of necessary and actionable information.” The first time when the new Security Updates Guide page will be used to provide users with information regarding security patches is January 10, when Microsoft kicks off the first Patch Tuesday release cycle of 2017. Users can already try out the new website at this point, but the TechNet page survives as well until January, so you can access whichever you like more for the next one month and a half.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft yesterday announced that Azure Government Cloud has expanded its FedRAMP Provisional Authorization to Operate with the addition of five new services. The new services added are Service Bus, Notification Hubs, Site Recovery, StorSimple, and Backup. All these have received Joint Authorization Board (JAB) approval for addition to Azure Government’s P-ATO at the High Impact Level.\nAzure Service Bus : Provides cloud-enabled communication with enterprise messaging and relayed communication to help connect applications, services, and devices. Service Bus connects applications running on Azure, on-premises systems, or both. A feature of Service Bus is Event Hubs which is a highly scalable, publish-subscribe service that can ingest millions of events per second and stream them into multiple applications.\nAzure Notification Hubs : A massively scalable mobile push notification engine for quickly sending millions of notifications to iOS, Android, Windows, or Kindle devices, working with APNS (Apple Push Notification Services), GCM (Google Cloud Message), WNS (Windows Push Notification Services), MPNS (Microsoft Push Notification Service), and more.\nAzure Site Recovery : Orchestrates replication of on-premises physical servers and virtual machines to the Azure cloud or to a secondary datacenter allowing organizations to meet BCDR (Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery) objectives.\nAzure StorSimple : An integrated storage solution that manages storage tasks between on-premises devices and Microsoft Azure cloud storage. StorSimple is an efficient, cost-effective, and easily manageable storage area network (SAN) solution that eliminates many of the issues and expenses associated with enterprise storage and data protection.\nAzure Backup : A simple and cost-effective backup-as-a-service solution that extends tried-and-trusted tools on-premises with rich and powerful tools in the cloud. It delivers protection for customers’ data no matter where it resides – in the enterprise data center, in remote and branch offices, or in the public cloud – while being sensitive to the unique requirements these scenarios pose.\nThere are now 18 Azure Government offerings that meet the FedRAMP High baseline standard.",
