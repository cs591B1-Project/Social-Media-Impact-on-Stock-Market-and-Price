      "title": "30 fun Google Home Easter eggs to try - CNET",
      "text": "When compared with Amazon's Echo , Dot and Tap speakers, Google Home is missing some of the flair. It doesn't have native support for nearly as many smart home devices. Its list of commands isn't nearly as developed. And it's missing some smaller, simple features, like a sleep timer.\nBut if Google is known for one thing, that's sprinkling Easter eggs throughout its products. Like the Alexa voice assistant on Amazon's speakers , Google Home's voice assistant has an expansive list of Easter eggs and it's only going to grow from here. Easter eggs may seem silly or like a waste of time, but they sometimes help the speaker seem less creepy and, in a sense, more natural.\nHere are 30 Google Home Easter eggs to try yourself.\nFunny \"OK, Google, make me a sandwich.\" \"OK, Google, how old are you?\" \"OK, Google, make me laugh.\" \"OK, Google, what am I thinking right now?\" \"OK, Google, do you ever get tired?\" \"OK, Google, what is your quest?\" \"OK, Google, did you fart?\" Interactive games \"OK, Google, are you feeling lucky?\" \"OK, Google, crystal ball.\" \"OK, Google, Mad Libs.\" Singing \"OK, Google, beatbox.\" \"OK, Google, can you rap?\" \"OK, Google, sing a song.\" \"OK, Google, sing 'Happy Birthday.'\" 9 7 ways Google Home outsmarts Alexa Pop culture \"OK, Google, Hodor.\" \"OK, Google, wubba lubba dub dub.\" \"OK, Google, up, up, down, down, left, right, B, A.\" \"OK, Google, do you like Star Trek or Star Wars?\" \"OK, Google, aren't you a little short for a storm trooper?\" \"OK, Google, set phasers to kill.\" \"OK, Google, what is the loneliest number?\" \"OK, Google, here comes dat boi.\" \"OK, Google, who's the fairest of them all?\" \"OK, Google, where's Waldo?\" Random \"OK, Google, surprise me.\" \"OK, Google, give me a random number between X and Y.\" \"OK, Google, read a poem.\" \"OK, Google, bark like a dog.\" \"OK, Google, do you speak Morse code?\" \"OK, Google, do a barrel roll.\" Bonus Instead of the typical wake commands (\"Hey, Google\" or \"OK, Google\"), you can say, \"OK, Boo Boo.\" Google Home will recognize this phrase as the wake phrase and listen to your following command. It's way more fun to say than, \"Hi, Google.\"\nSince Google Home is powered by Google Assistant, many of these Easter eggs will work on the Google Pixel phones , as well as in the Allo chat app .

      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor 'Millions' of subscribers watched, Amazon says. And it was a hit with critics, too. \nYou may have noticed that a car show premiered on Amazon last week. Unless you live in a cave. On Mars. \nSuch was the publicity around the first episode of The Grand Tour , even people with no interest in cars or internet TV knew about it. And it seems all the teasers , trailers , and stunts paid off, as the show’s launch was the biggest debut in Amazon Prime Video’s history. \nAccording to Amazon, “millions” of subscribers watched the episode in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and Japan. Exact viewing figures have not been released, but they will far exceed the the number of subscribers through repeat viewings - I have watched it twice myself. \nTake into account all the people who have watched the episode through some other means, and the number grows significantly again. \nIt was a busy episode, that started with a magnificently over-the-top, Mad Max-esque sequence which followed Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May to a mini Burning Man festival in the Californian desert where their tented studio had been set up. \nThen there were the regular segments to explain, the new track to explore, and the big film to show. All of which was thoroughly entertaining, if not quite fully bedded in. \nMost importantly, though, the chemistry between the three presenters was completely intact, and the banter merciless. \nThe show was a critical success, too. The Guardian called it “a brilliant, beautiful spectacle”, while the London Evening Standard opined “The Grand Tour is stunningly beautiful.” Digital Spy added: “They've sort of somehow come up with the world's first scripted comedy factual show, and it works perfectly.\" \nOnline, it is rated at 9.6 from over 10,000 votes on IMDb, and 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Viewers have rated it at 4.9 out of five on Amazon, after 15,000 votes. \nThere are 11 more episodes in this first season - absolutely nothing is known about at least seven of them - and it will be very interesting to see if The Grand Tour can maintain or even build its momentum.

      "text": "Amazon wants to be “the world’s premier destination” for tickets. \nAmazon is planning on expanding its fledgling ticketing business by expanding into the US, Europe and Asia, according to a series of job listings.\nAs Recode reports, Amazon is looking for people to “position Amazon Tickets as the world’s premier destination for purchasing tickets.”\nThe listings also suggest the company is planning to integrate tickets sales into its Prime service with something called Prime Tickets, the specifics of which are unknown.\nAmazon launched its ticketing arm in the UK last year, offering customers the chance to buy tickets for West End musicals such as The Book of Mormon and concerts by artists including Ariana Grande and Drake.\nAmazon Tickets has attempted to differentiate itself from competitors such as Ticketmaster by declaring additional fees up front. It also ties into a customer’s Amazon account, making it more convenient for regular shoppers.\nAs Recode points out, Amazon would face stiff competition from Ticketmaster and Live Nation in the US, which regularly make exclusive deals with promoters and artists to get access to the best seats for sale.\nTicketing isn’t the only arm of it business Amazon has expanded this year. Last month it launched its Amazon Music Unlimited streaming service , which it’s offering to customers for just $3.99 a month with the purchase of an Echo speaker.\nThe post Amazon takes on Ticketmaster with planned US ticketing service appeared first on FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. .",

      "text": "November 23, 2016 Filed Under: Amazon , Roundups by Lil' Luna 0 This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy here . It’s always fun to buy gifts for other people, especially for kids. They’re usually easier to shop for than adults and can usually tell you right up front what they are hoping to get for their special day or for Christmas. Having said that, there are some indecisive children or some kids who only want super expensive items. With that in mind, I thought I would compile some of the Best gifts for Kids 6 and older that range in price, but remain fairly inexpensive. All of these items can be found on Amazon, and fortunately most of them are Prime products, so if you Amazon Prime, they are shipped for free. SWEET! My kids love all things artsy and anything than can help with their creativity, so many of the items on this list are just that. I’ve noticed most kids like these along with some of the other items, so I hope this list comes in handy when you are doing some of your holiday and birthday shopping. I’d also love to hear some of the things you plan to get your own kids, so be sure to leave a comment below so I can update this list with even more ideas. 😀 Best Gifts for Kids 6 and Older:",

      "title": "Vodafone Partners With Lingokids to Bring English Learning to Every Home",
      "text": "The launch follows a recent wave of big moves in the online education market. Amazon recently introduced Amazon Inspire, a platform that organizes educational resources in a user-rated directory. Another big project was recently announced by Google’s Rich Miner, co-founder of Android, whom embarks on a new stealth educational project. Also notable in the early childhood EdTech space, VIPKID, a communications marketplace that connects American teachers with Chinese kids, announced a $100m funding round that follows ABCMouse’s recent $150m round at $1b valuation earlier this year. Lingokids, which counts close to 1M registered families worldwide, has been beta-testing its new format since July. Following their launch earlier this year, the adaptive language learning platform has been growing over 25% month-over-month in terms of both registered users and revenues. Now with this partnership, Lingokids will offer Vodafone clients the ability to pay for their subscriptions via their mobile phone bill while enjoying additional exclusive benefits.\nThe partnership comes at an exciting time for the company as they are accelerating growth and product development. Vodafone users will be able to enjoy access for their children to the recently launched Lingokids \"Guides\" that offers users a fun and immersive English learning experience while tracking their performance and dynamically adapting lesson difficulty based on machine learning.\nRecognizing that children form deep relationships with adults, such as Bob McGrath of Sesame Street and Fred Rogers of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, Lingokids chose to bridge the gap between children and gameplay in a similar way by introducing real-life teacher figures in the experience.\n“The power of this new format is that we combine clips of real-life teachers together with interactive activities, such as games, videos and traceables in a seamless stream of activities. Most learning platforms don’t create an emotional connection with the child, despite research showing that children learn better from people with whom they have an emotional relationship with. With Guides we’ve created a format where the emotional bond created by the storytelling of the teachers drives the learning experience. It builds a safe, familiar learning environment for children during the most critical stage of their development: early childhood,” said Jens Peter de Pedro, Experience Director at Lingokids.\nWe’ve all seen children as young as ages 2 and 3 using mobile devices skillfully. Parents love the idea of their kids learning and playing at the same time, but most of them have been telling Lingokids that they didn’t like the lack of a human connection. “We didn’t want to create a simple directory of educational resources or a communications marketplace. Guides is human from an emotional point of view and smart from a machine-learning recommendations point of view,” says Cristobal Viedma, CEO.\nAbout Lingokids\nLingokids, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2014, develops a mobile service to learn English for kids ages two to six. Their language learning platform is available by subscription from $90 a year. Lingokids has offices in San Francisco and Madrid.\nLingokids has raised $1.2 million in seed funding to date from Dave McClure’s 500 Startups, Japan’s SHOzemi Innovation Ventures, and angel investors such as Carina Szpilka, VP of Unicef, and Gwynne Shotwell, President & COO of SpaceX.\nSources:\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2016/08/03/vipkid-nabs-100m-to-link-chinese-kids-with-native-speakers-to-learn-english/\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2016/05/03/age-of-learning-a-quiet-giant-in-education-apps-raised-150m-at-a-1b-valuation-from-iconiq/",

      "text": "Amazon made good on its promise to delete “incentivized” reviews Posted Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures back Apptopia’s next-gen app intelligence platform \nAmazon is making good on its promise to ban “incentivized” reviews from its website, according to a new analysis of over 32,000 products and around 65 million reviews. The ban was meant to address the growing problem of less trustworthy reviews that had been plaguing the retailer’s site, leading to products with higher ratings than they would otherwise deserve. \nIncentivized reviews are those where the vendor offers free or discounted products to reviewers, in exchange for recipients writing their “honest opinion” of the item in an Amazon review. However, data has shown that these reviewers tend to write more positive reviews overall, with products earning an average of 4.74 stars out of five, compared with an average rating of 4.36 for non-incentivized reviews. \nOver time, these reviews proliferated on Amazon, and damaged consumers’ trust in the review system as a whole. And that can impact consumers’ purchase decisions. \nAccording to recent findings from ReviewMeta , a business that analyzes millions of reviews to help consumers find those they can trust, Amazon has been rapidly deleting incentivized reviews – even retroactively. \nThis is especially interesting because Amazon had said at the time of the ban’s announcement that it would only remove incentivized reviews from older products if they were “excessive” or if they didn’t comply with the prior policy. \nBut apparently, Amazon is going back to remove a large number of older reviews, as well. Above: percentage of incentivized reviews per day since 8/1/2016 \nReviewMeta checked up on Amazon’s progress by analyzing its own dataset of around 65 million reviews across 32,060 products in all categories. \nIt found that Amazon had deleted over 500,000 reviews, 71 percent of which were incentivized. The average rating for these deleted reviews was 4.75 stars – clearly much higher than the typical average. Some products even saw thousands of reviews removed – like this cosmetic scrub , which had 9,000 reviews removed, for example. Above: average rating for all reviews per day since 8/1/2016 \nThe company then analyzed a subset of products from over the past two weeks to get a sense of how many incentivized reviews still remain on Amazon’s site. \nAcross the over 10 million reviews analyzed (a dataset based on those consumers entered on the ReviewMeta website), only 1.5 percent of the reviews were incentivized. \n“This is considerably less than we were seeing previously,” says Tommy Noonan, ReviewMeta CTO. “For every incentivized review we found on Amazon, there were 2.6 in our database that weren’t there anymore,” he adds, referring to the deleted reviews. \nWhat the figures seem to indicate is that, though Amazon is deleting a large number incentivized reviews, it hasn’t managed to catch all of them. Part of the problem could be that incentivized reviews are still rolling in, despite Amazon’s ban. \nThat said, the number of incentivized reviews has dropped significantly following the ban, and this, in turn, has lowered the average rating for all reviews. The day before the ban was enacted, for instance, the average rating for all reviews that day was 4.73; on November 1, the average rating for all reviews had dropped to 4.65. \nWhat’s also interesting, Noonan notes, is that Amazon’s product ratings were largely unaffected, despite the mass deletions. The product ratings – that is, when Amazon tells you that a product is “4.5 out of 5 stars” – appear to have already been adjusted to discount the incentivized reviews when calculating the overall rating. \n“We’re seeing that many incentivized reviews effectively carry zero weight in Amazon’s product ratings,” says Noonan. \nThis is likely due to the fact that a majority (95%) of the incentivized reviews didn’t have the “Verified Purchaser” tag attached – meaning the customer had bought from Amazon directly. And unverified reviews were already carrying no weight in Amazon’s rating system. (The exception being if they were the only reviews a product had, in which case they were used to calculate the overall score). \nNoonan concludes that Amazon’s actions have sufficiently addressed the problem with its ban. \n“It’s obviously not 100% perfect,” he says. “It seems [Amazon has] removed a majority of the incentivized reviews and pretty much put an end to more being created. They effectively killed this industry,” he adds. \nFeatured Image: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images 0",

AMAZON TO EXPAND ONLINE TICKET PLATFORM: Amazon plans to widen its online ticket sales in various international markets, and will possibly launch Prime Tickets as part of the company's Prime membership program. Recode: “Amazon launched its online ticketing business just last year, but it already has plans to expand it in Europe, Asia and potentially the U.S., according to a series of job listings posted recently. The hiring efforts are part of a new initiative to 'position Amazon Tickets as the world’s premier destination for purchasing tickets,' according to one posting. The job listings also hint at plans to integrate ticket sales into the Prime membership program with something Amazon is calling Prime Tickets, the details of which were not laid out. ... An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. The initiative is being led by a vice president, Ian Freed, who has been with Amazon for more than a decade and once served as CEO Jeff Bezos’s technical assistant.” http://on.recode.net/2f2KELC 2. MACY’S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE DEBUTS 360-DEGREE LIVE STREAM: For the first time, this year's Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York will have a 360-degree live stream, available on Verizon’s YouTube page. NBCUniversal, Verizon, and Macy’s made the announcement in a joint statement.

      "text": "masterone 1. I bought a dick pump from Amazon. That shit was uncomfortable. Did a drive-by dumpster toss a week later.\n— MEplusYOURMOM \n2. I tried stamina-rx. I bought it from the gas station and was super anxious so I thought I’d give it a test run before the big show. Well about 30 minutes later I started sweating my ass off, my face was flushed, my heart starting beating out of my chest, and I got the worst stomach ache ever. I was only 18 and couldn’t tell my mom I was dying because of dick pills, so I laid on the floor and accepted that this was how I was going to die.\nOh and I never got any benefit either. All the side effects, on the brink of death with a soft dick. I did jelq for 2-3 years and that did help a lot but I took it too far and injured myself. I cut that shit out and just chilled on jacking willy so much.\n— base4yoface \n3. When I was younger around 18-19 I was really insecure about my penis size, mostly because I watched A LOT of porn and thought that every girl could only get off with a mandingo sized dick. This obviously led to a lot of insecurity about my penis size which was average at around 5.5″. So one day I remember seeing one of those porn site ads “grow your penis up to 8″ in a month!” and figured what the hell a month is no time at all and I’ll have a monster dong in 4 weeks! So I went to the site and bought one, $120 if I remember correctly which was a lot of money for me at the time. I remember ordering and then canceling the order about twice out of fear, then I guess I finally said screw it, ordered it and walked away.\nThe next day I got the shipping update and I nervously began pacing around my parents house plotting how to get the big brown box from the mail box to my room unnoticed so no one would ask “whats in the box” and leave me red faced and stammering while coming up with something to say. Few days go by and the mail comes, I bolt out the door to the mailbox, grabbed the box, dropped about 3 envelopes on the ground and bolt back inside. The mail on the ground was a casualty of war and I left it behind.\nAnyways so I had it in my hands, it was a bathmate or something like that, a water penis pump. I went to the shower and began pumping the shit out of my dick. Hurt like a son of a bitch, felt like I put my dick in a shopvac and my insides were being pulled out through my urethra. But I could tell my dick was getting bigger already so I suffered through the pain. 15 minutes later I pop the thing off and my god was my dick engorged! It was the dick of my dreams, little did I know the results only lasted a couple hours but in that time I had to of jerked it about 5 times, and stood in the mirror staring at it for another 30 minutes before it shrunk back down to a stub. So I pumped for a month and actually saw some result, was thicker mostly. I kept at it for maybe another 3-4 months consistently and kept an eye on my “gains” and to my surprise my dick was actually growing. But one day I got a little too cocky and over pumped and my dick started hurting along the right side and I was properly freaked out. I quit right then and there and threw the damn thing away after breaking it into tiny pieces so that it couldn’t be recognized. All in all, my dick did grow, it’s about 6.5″ now and slightly more girthy.\nWould I do it again? Hell no, its not worth it. After my penis injury scare I realized that its more embarrassing having to go to the hospital and tell them that I broke my dick in a penis pump than it is to have a average sized dick. After I got laid for the first time at 20 (late bloomer) I realized dick size didn’t even matter to most women and if it did that they aren’t the type of person I would want a relationship with anyways. I now have more self confidence than I did but I don’t contribute any of that to my magnum dong.\n– PenisPumpThrowaway \n4. The best method I have found for penis enlargement is losing weight. I was overweight most of my life but senior year of high school I decided to get in shape. By sophomore year of college I was in great shape and my ween appeared to be at least 2 inches bigger. I mean… I’m sure that wasn’t true, but it looked like a completely different wang.\nI’m sure this isn’t quite the answer folks are looking for… but if you’re a bit pudgy and concerned about the size of your penis, try to get in shape. It’s not easy, but it is awesome.\n— whiteshadow88 \n5. I’m 19 years old and this is my story.\nJust this May, I was with a new girlfriend from university. We’d been together only three weeks but we’d had sex quite a number of times. While she was giving me oral sex, she told me that my penis was a lot smaller than the other guys she’s been with. Let me be clear that she was literally holding it while she said this.\nNow I didn’t know how to take this. Stupid, insecure me being a hopeless romantic wanted to improve myself for my girlfriend. I’m fairly normal in terms of size, 5.75 long and 5 around, but I was seriously hurt by this comment.\nI went online and found a website claiming to increase your size. These guys preached a technique called jelqing, and the idea is to grip your shaft from the base at around 50% erection and milk it. So I did this ‘jelqing’ for two weeks, following some regimen they had for beginners.\nAt the end of the second week, I woke up to find that I could no longer get hard. I assumed maybe I overworked it, whatever. This lasted for five days and I was panicking. The day I went to a clinic to find out what was wrong, I was finally getting erections again at about 30%. They referred me to a urologist and I explained to him what happened. He said to take a rest for 6 weeks, hopefully everything will be okay.\n6 weeks passes and I still can’t achieve a full erection. My maximum was 70% and I was having weird symptoms with my member. I had developed a torsion of maybe 10 degrees, as in the head was rotated. Nothing too grotesque as I’ve seen other guys born with this naturally, but it just wasn’t straight anymore. The other symptom led to seaches online pointing to something called ‘hard flaccid,’ something not medically recognized as a real symptom. My penis would not go soft basically. It felt rubbery and stiff all the time, and it only relaxed to what I was used to if I was urinating or laying down on my back. It’s resistant to being moved and prevents me from getting an erection while standing up.\nI saw two more urologists and two clinic doctors and told them what was going on. I made sure to be clear about the exact motions I made when I was trying this jelqing nonsense. One told me to have a cystoscopy done and the other said to take another 2 months rest. Cystoscopy came out clear. He still had no idea what was going on and said take a few months’ rest like the other doctor said.\nNow, I’ve got another urologist appointment with the cystoscopy urologist in December after rest. He’s probably going to schedule me for a pelvic MRI but we have no idea what’s going on. There’s apparently no scar tissue, but my penis is stiff unless I’m resting on my back or after urinating.\nObviously my gf broke up the week after I had my issue. I don’t blame her for anything, it was my own insecurities that led me to my decision. I’m a young guy who didn’t know how to deal with the situation and I ended up doing something stupid. I’ve been majorly abstinent over the course of these four months or so. I didn’t touch anything down there until about two weeks ago. It’s been a challenge but I’m putting my health first.\nPlease be happy with what you have. Don’t let other people put you down and recognize that a good partner would accept you for who you are. Be secure in what you’ve been given. A small, working dick will always be better than a broken 7-inches.\nOh, and if by some miracle one of you have heard of a similar situation to mine or recognize the problem, please let me know. I’ve been to counseling offered by my university to get over this mentally, but I’m going to stay positive in that I might one day recover.\n— Wanderervagrant \n6. Okay, here’s the thing. I tried them.\nFirst off, they don’t work as people think they would . There’s usually stuff in it that increases the flow of blood, so your penis looks more swelled up. They also usually contain zinc, which makes you cum more. Some of the herbs make you last longer.\nAll of those three things is good for your self-confidence. And so, in a weird way, they so work! However, I cannot recommend it to anyone.\nIt’s way better to take your multi-vitamins, drink lots of water, exercise regularly, wear loose underwear and generally be aware of penile health. Manscaping is also a very solid option. It’ll not only make it look bigger, its more appealing to almost every woman I’ve ever met.\nBut the most important thing is to be happy about your dick. I’ve got an average (5 inch) penis, but I was convinced I couldn’t satisfy any woman ever. And honestly, when I was under that impression, it killed my self confidence and I couldn’t act sexy because I didn’t feel sexy.\nSo, fuck all the nonsense. Your dick is your dick. Most probably, it’s fine. If it is too short, learn how to go down on your partner. Treat that pussy like a temple. Get some toys. This is the 21st century my man, there’s a ton of options s available!\nConfidence is more than the size of your dick. Read books, have opinions. Instead of wasting your money of those shitty pills, upgrade your wardrobe. Be happy with yourself. Women find that damn sexy.\n— fumblebuck \n7. Definitely DON’T TRY THIS !! I lost my ability to get and keep a normal erection at the age of 18 (I’m 25 now), lost almost all sensitivity in my penis. Fucked up my sexual life. I was struggling with suicidal thoughts for years. Doing therapy has helped but the stigma is still there.\nI didn’t treat the problem at the time because of shame, lack of money and health insurance. How do you explain your parents and friends that you have ED for such a stupid accident??\nThe funny thing is that I initially came across those exercises (jelqing and stretching, the latter caused the worst damage) while searching how to straighten the curvature, not for an enlargement method. Even though I’m slightly below average, it wasn’t a big deal (no pun intended).\nI needed to get this off my chest. Please, don’t make the same mistake I did. It’s not worth taking the risk\nTL;DR: don’t jelq (can damage vessels), don’t stretch (can damage nerves).\n— throwawaypermaed \n8. Not enlargement but once tried a weird knock-off viagra bought online. Gave me the dongest of dongs for a good few hours but also made my vision go BLUE. Everything BLUE. Slept it off and woke up to normal vision.\nLooked in the mirror — left pupil about twice the size of the right. That was 6 years ago. Left pupil still a constant 20% or so larger than the right to this day, so I guess I enlarged something…\n— jonnyapps \n9. My uncle had a pump surgically inserted into his stomach, connected to a balloon inside of his dick. You press a button on his stomach and his dick inflates – instant hard on. I am not joking.\n— RedPillBill \n10. I dated a guy who said he wore one of those penis stretchers (NSFW) . It sounded like a torture device. He had to wear it for hours a day. For months at a time.\nHe said he gained… I don’t even remember. It was enough for it to matter to him. He was fine the way he was. He would have been fine had he done nothing to change his size.\nOne of the things I took away from dating him is how insecure men can be about their penis size. So whenever I date anyone, I always tell them the very specific details in how I love their penis. I never lie – that would be too tough to maintain long-term – but I always find something. Huge girth. Love the way it curves. The hardest I’ve ever been with. I can barely fit it in my mouth. Whatever. I don’t understand the penis-insecurity but I am going to do my best to rid this world of penis insecurities, one cock at a time.\n— thisis4reddit \n11. I tried Enzyte for about a week or so once years ago and it did help. Not with length but with girth. Didn’t tell my gf at the time and she noticed she was more filled out with me inside her. It was nice lol.\n— TheKILLSMASH \n12. Yeah they work, but it is very possible to overdo it and permanently damage yourself.\nWith a pump you can gain about an inch in girth and length before it becomes unnatural – thing is if you have a foreskin that will balloon when you thrust and you’ll end up stuck. Not the greatest thing in the world… especially if you unkindly wind up accidentally hitting cervix even without using any “enhancement.”\nNow, you may think that knotting your GF or wife sounds fun, and it is. Thing is, it is her body and it is seriously not cool to be stuck in someone who is having instant regret.\nThat isn’t permanent, some people say it can be but I’m pretty sure they’re exaggerating. On the plus side, they make you super sensitive, and can be used on women as well… just don’t overdo it.\nTension machines take much much longer and have permanent results. Thing is, they can result in ED. Those are mostly recommended for medical applications – and they are effective. They suck for foreplay.\nSides that, take Zinc while you’re in puberty. No idea if it actually works, but anecdotally it can. All in all, I’d say risking your procreative ability isn’t worth it.\n— ThrowawayKnotted \n13. Not so much dick enlargement, but dick hardening yeah. They seemed like they either kinda worked, but were not reliable.\nEnded up finding that using kegel exercises while jacking off was the answer. And give yourself the rule you gotta be rock hard before you can finish.\nDicks have muscles too, go figure.\n— greyflcn \n14. I can say with certainty that there are methods that work. There’s a giant penis enlargement community out there which has developed tons of methods for penis enlargement. It goes way beyond just penis pumping.\nI gained 0.5 inches in length very easily, and have gained some girth too, although that was much harder. Other people have gained way more than I have. There are two very good penis enlargement forums that I don’t want to mention here cause I don’t know if they’ll get overloaded with traffic.\nThe thing about it though is that people either don’t want to believe it, or they don’t want to put in the effort for it to happen. I’ve told at least a couple friends about it and neither tried it more than once or twice and then gave up. Other people are maniacal about it and will do whatever it takes to get a bigger cock.\nEdit: I’m talking about manual penis enlargement, not some BS pills or creams or supplements.\n— mikesalami \n15. I used a pump about 3 times a week over the period of 4 or 5 months. I gained like a quarter inch in length. Also it stays a bit bigger when flaccid now which is kind of nice. The purpose was actually more to gain girth which didn’t happen at all.\nThe catch was that I got some minor stretch marks on my shaft. Not from the permanent growth, but from the swelling while pumping. I think I could have avoided them if I hadn’t pumped as hard. Some people also do things like wear condoms while pumping to keep the swelling down.\nAnyway, the marks faded over time and they aren’t noticeable, so I don’t have too deep of regrets. But I don’t think I’d recommend it. You’re not going to go from small to average, or from average to big or anything. There’s more damage to be done than good.\n— BaggyHairyNips \n16. So i’ve been using a penis pump for about 3 years now, and also using extenders (that keep your penis stretched for long periods of time), as well as manual exercises here and there.\nIt has worked for me…but very slowly and takes a lot of time. I have gained about an inch in girth, and a bit more than half an inch in length during these years. that’s unpumped and under normal conditions.\nIt takes a lot of time and effort, and honestly, if you are doing this for women or whatever, it won’t be worth it. It’s better to invest your time in that actual woman, hanging out, having sex, ect. But I like pumping, and women tend to dislike it, but some like it now and then.\nPumping does give your temporary gains, and those temporary gains can get more and more significant the more you pump. Those temporary gains are a blast to me. I know it’ll “deflate” back to normal in some hours, but it’s a blast while it’s large. it gets addictive, too. You try to chase that huge pump you had a few days ago, but your body just isn’t there sometimes. It’s like working out. Somedays you can run 10 miles and feel great, or your breaking personal lifting records. Somedays you can barely put a dent in your usual routine.\nIn my opinion, I think stretching is the most effective way to enlarge the penis. The issue is, manual stretches can give you some gains when you first start (some of those early games is just stretching the ligaments attached to your penis, bring it “out” more). but after that, it takes a lot more time to get more and more gains. So extenders are useful, you wear them under your clothes and such, but are uncomfortable, annoying, difficult to fit, and expensive.\n— throwawaypump333 \n17. I’ve been doing penis exercises for about a year now. Went from 6 inches on a good day to 7 inches regularly.\nThere’s a risk of breaking your penis doing it but there is a subreddit for guidance.\n— JohnSmith199X \n18. I literally damaged the nerves on my dick and can no longer sustain an erection through jelqing methods.\nDon’t fucking do it.\n— dickdontwurk \n19. There are definitely sure ways to increse your penis size. One of them is called “jelqing” and there are websites dedicated to it with hundreds of thousands of members (and just as many testimonials).\nThe thing with penis enlargement is that just like working out, any product that guarentees results without effort (pills, shakes, surgeries) are for the most part complete bullshit.\nWhat you want is to create a routine similar to a workout routine only for your dick. Starting out you want to pursue the method refered to as jelqing. But after you max out your gains or if you want to add more intensity you can add in “hanging” or some devices (after researching which is best suited to your routine).\nWorking out your penis is just like working out your body. If you do it wrong your going to injure yourself, and if you do it really wrong you could have permanent injuries. This usually puts guys off but its really easy to avoid injuries if your smart about it.\nAs for me I went from 6.4 erect length to 7.2 and from 4.8 girth to 5.2. Great for my confidence and yea theres a difference with sex. My results aren’t even that great there are guys who go crazy with it and get massive gains. It took me about a year of doing it 4 times a week to reach where I am.\n— Grillmybutthole \n20. I use a product called the bathmate x30 and intermitant jelqing, used it for about 6 months straight, I have gained girth .25 of an inch. Gained about half an inch in length. If you keep on your bathmate regimen you will see an increase in flacid size, if you stop it goes back to the slightly improved permanent size. It’s a little bit of an annoyance to draw baths on the regular but if you are commited it’s no issue and you will get gains.\nOne thing to note, I have noticed a reduced sensitivity on the glans. It’s harder for me to ejaculate and I last much longer and alot of the times I can’t even get off 100% from sex. Is it worth it? I would say yes although I miss the super sensitivity pre pumping but I’m sure my g/f doesnt lol\n— cheesymold \n21. There are several methods that are known to give permanent gains:\nJelqing (slight length/girth increases that cap out for length around an inch and girth at roughly half an inch)\nClamping (over long periods of time can gain 1-2 inches of girth)\nHanging (some people have reported .5-1 inch length gains and up to 3 inches length gains)\nI have been hanging for a few years on and off. My penis size started at 6 inches and now I am around 8.25 inches with slightly more girth. Planning on hanging until I have 10 inches but the way I had initially been hanging was wrong (noosing instead of holding tissue) and I have been trying to get the tissue to adapt.\n— frankieat ",

      "text": "\nAmazon's first Lightning Deal on Thanksgiving might be one of the better PlayStation 4 sales we'll see this season. The catch is that it's going to sell out extremely quickly.\nThe bundle is a newly-released PS4 Slim (retails for $300) with Uncharted 4 , Fallout 4 , and Skyrim Special Edition for $249.99. Those who are looking to get in on the most current model of the PS4 will find themselves with long-lasting role-playing games to spend some quality time with.\nBut, again, it's going to sell out fast. It's 10 percent claimed at time of writing. Better decide quickly.\n(For those of you who are curious, here's an updated list of some of the better game deals on Amazon right now.)\nPlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Console - Uncharted 4 Bundle + Skyrim Special Edition + Fallout 4 [Amazon] ",

It challenges the amazing Google Home and Amazon Echo. By: FE Online | Published: November 24, 2016 5:54 PM China is a huge market for any technology related product, and a thing which Google and Amazon smart speakers cannot do is speak their language. But LingLing’s DingDong can. \nLingLong DingDong is a gadget with a funny name, but what it does is far from it. It challenges the amazing Google Home and Amazon Echo. China is a huge market for any technology related product, and a thing which Google and Amazon smart speakers cannot do is speak their language. But DingDong can. LingLong is a company which is a joint venture between iPlytek and JD.com, and its first product LingLong is their answer to Google Home and Amazon Echo. A Wired report says, “The company claims the DingDong understands roughly 95 percent of the population.” LingLong DingDong, at 9.5 inches length, weighs almost 1.3 kgs and is available in black, white, purple and red colour variants. The smart home speaker costs $118 which is around Rs 8,000. \nThe smart home speakers like these can be used to control appliances in the house, make enquiries about outside conditions like traffic and weather, play music etc. A BBC report says, “The makers of DingDong have also been promoting its educational tools, including being programmed with simple English lessons for children developed by a private education company.” According to the report in WIRED, LingLong is planning to imbibe artificial intelligence to DingDong and take on the competition to Echo and Home even further. It is also reported to be open to third party developers so that it reaches the pulling capability at lower costs. The report also says that LingLong may also work with Amazon to incorporate DingDong into Echo, which will help Amazon make inroads into China, a high potential market. WIRED quoted the head of Sales and Marketing, Lv Fang, as saying, “If they (Amazon) want to sell the Echo in China, maybe they will use our voice engine.” \nAmazon’s Echo is a device which controls home appliances which include electricals by using smart voice activation tech. Echo by Apple has been a surprise success as many companies which manufacture smart-home appliances have integrated this device. Even Alphabet Inc, part of Google had recently brought the ‘Google Home’ device at the annual I/O developer conference in 2016, two years after Amazon. \nAccording to Wired report, LingLong hopes to work with Amazon to put DingDong into Echo. This could pave the way for Amazon to bring Echo into the Chinese market. The site quoted Lv Fang, head of sales and marketing, who said, “If they want to sell the Echo in China, maybe they will use our voice engine.”  ",

If you're looking for some protection, Amazon sells the 8GB model in a bundle with a case and a screen protector at $51. The 16GB version is currently priced at $53.33, 24% down from its usual price of $69.99. For a better overall experience, you may want to get the Amazon Fire HD 8. Usually priced at $90, the tablet currently goes for just $60. Some of the upgrades that the Fire HD 8 brings over the cheaper 7\" Fire include a larger and crisper display, better speakers, and better battery life. Also, the Fire HD 8 comes with 16GB of integrated storage space at this price. You can bundle the HD 8 with a screen protector and a case for $83, which isn't a bad deal overall.",

      "text": "November 24, 2016 Share \nIt’s a fantastic time of year to buy gadgets if you want to save money. You’ll need a few ingredients you can’t buy at the store, though, including patience, dedication and a will to win. Black Friday deals are worth it if you can win some, but it’s not always easy to do. Heck, we couldn’t even get an NES Classic the other week, and we were running store-to-store and trying to buy online at the same time. Luckily we have a few tips for how to win on Amazon if you’re looking for hot deals this Friday. 1. Use your Echo or Fire TV \nYou laugh, but you can actually save money on Amazon by using Amazon products. The company is offering exclusive deals through Amazon Alexa , which can only be accessed through the Amazon Echo family of products, the Fire TV and certain Amazon Fire TV tablets. All you need to do is say “Alexa, what are today’s deals?” She’ll read off what’s currently being offered, and you can order it right away. These are only available through Alexa, so you have an upper leg on folks who don’t own a gadget that has the voice assistant. \nOrder This From Amazon 2. Use your smartphone \nThis is a trick that can be used for more than just saving money on Black Friday. I always suggest you use your smartphone to buy the hot deals instead of, or in tandem with, a computer. It’s how I got Bruce Springsteen tickets through a TicketMaster app, for example, and it’s one of the easiest ways to buy new iPhones while Apple’s website is slammed during a new iPhone launch. If there’s a specific deal you’re after, consider loading up the Amazon app on your phone to get the product instead of your computer. 3. Setup one-click ordering \nSet up one-click ordering on your Amazon account before Black Friday. That way, when the deals go live and you see something you like, you can tap a single button and have your shiny new 4K UHD TV on its way. You won’t need to try to move through Amazon’s process entering a credit card or your address. Just be careful about leaving this on if you don’t want to accidentally order something in the future, I’ve tapped that button instead of “add to cart” more than once. 4. Refresh the page \nAmazon will hate me for saying this because it’ll add strain to its servers, but it’ll also help you out big time: refresh the page as often as you can until the deal you’re looking for goes live. Ctrl R is the default keyboard shortcut to do so. Once the deal goes live, you should be among the first to see it available, allowing you to tap the one-click order button (see the tip above to get that all setup). 5. Get an Amazon Prime membership \nThis might be the most obvious but it’s also the most important. Make sure you have an Amazon Prime membership before Black Friday. Not only will you get access to free two-day shipping and a whole library of music and movies, which is just a bonus going into the lounge-around holidays, but you’ll get access to deals that might only be available to Prime members . Amazon likes to take care of Prime subscribers, so my guess is the best deals will be available to those who have the premium service. Black Friday",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nWhen most people hear the word tablet, they almost immediately think of the iPad. Apple has dominated the tablet space, but Amazon's line of Fire tablets give the iPad a run for its money.\nThere are a few different models of Fire tablet, each one with some specific pros and cons.\nWhether you're looking for a bigger or smaller screen, or value pixel density over stereo speakers, this guide breaks it down.\nFire tablets are the best values in the business, and for most people they're a great tablet option.\n7\" Fire Tablet Amazon \nThe 7-inch Fire tablet is Amazon's base model, and while it's less powerful than its older siblings, it does share some common features with them. \nIt runs the same operating system (Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\"), has front- and rear-facing cameras, and access to Amazon's large library of content, be it Kindle books or Prime Video streaming. The Amazon app store was also pretty robust when I used it last month, with many popular apps like Netflix and Angry Birds available. \nIt only has one speaker, though, so don't expect to be kicking out the jams without connecting it to a Bluetooth speaker.  In that same vein, this tablet's less-than-HD screen means it won't be the best for watching TV or movies, but at 7 inches, it's bigger than your phone.\nWhen we reviewed this tablet last year, we said it was the new standard for a $50 tablet, and that's still the case. If you want to casually browse the web, stream Netflix, or play games on a flight, the standard Fire tablet is the perfect solution.\nFire Tablet, $49.99, available from Amazon \n\n\nFire HD 6 Amazon \nIf you're still looking for a good deal on a tablet, but want one that's a little more capable, the Fire HD 6 is a good compromise.\nFor an additional $20, you're getting a higher-resolution screen and the most pixel-dense tablet in Amazon's entire line. That means text will be more crisp, and the user interface in general will look cleaner on the HD 6 than any of Amazon's other tablets. It's one inch shorter than the base Kindle Fire, meaning if you're rocking a large phone like the Galaxy S7 Edge  or iPhone 6S Plus , having a device with a screen this size might be redundant.\nThe Fire HD 6 shares the same camera system with the standard Fire tablet, but has Dolby audio built-in. It still only has one speaker, but the sound quality should be better. It also picks up an extra hour of battery life, taking it up to a respectable 8 hours. Because of its pixel-dense screen and small size, the Fire HD 6 is ideal for people who don't mind reading on a smaller tablet screen. It's also a good choice for those who want a small tablet that's under $100 with an HD screen.\nFire HD 6, $69.99, available at Amazon \n\n\nFire HD 8 Amazon \nThe Fire HD 8 might have the same screen resolution as the Fire HD 6, but its larger screen size and better internals make it a more capable tablet. \nWith a higher-resolution front- and back-facing camera, the Fire HD 8 is a better choice if you chose to be a tablet-wielding photographer. That also means your conversations over Skype, or any other video-messaging service, will also be cleaner. The Fire HD 8 also supports the wireless AC standard, currently the fastest form of WiFi out there. Finally, along with the bigger screen size comes duel stereo speakers, making this tablet much more multimedia friendly.\nThis is the tablet to buy if you're looking for a big-but-not-huge travel tablet. It's the iPad Mini's size, but at less than half the price; and even better, you can expand its internal storage with a MicroSD card. \nFire HD 8, $149.99, available on Amazon \n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nSteve Kovach, Business Insider\nWhen most people hear the word tablet, they almost immediately think of the iPad. Apple has dominated the tablet space, but Amazon's line of Fire tablets give the iPad a run for its money.\nThere are a few different models of Fire tablet, each one with some specific pros and cons.\nWhether you're looking for a bigger or smaller screen, or value pixel density over stereo speakers, this guide breaks it down.\nFire tablets are the best values in the business, and for most people they're a great tablet option.\n 7\" Fire Tablet Amazon The 7-inch Fire tablet is Amazon's base model, and while it's less powerful than its older siblings, it does share some common features with them.\nIt runs the same operating system (Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\"), has front- and rear-facing cameras, and access to Amazon's large library of content, be it Kindle books or Prime Video streaming. The Amazon app store was also pretty robust when I used it last month, with many popular apps like Netflix and Angry Birds available.\nIt only has one speaker, though, so don't expect to be kicking out the jams without connecting it to a Bluetooth speaker. In that same vein, this tablet's less-than-HD screen means it won't be the best for watching TV or movies, but at 7 inches, it's bigger than your phone.\nWhen we reviewed this tablet last year, we said it was the new standard for a $50 tablet, and that's still the case. If you want to casually browse the web, stream Netflix, or play games on a flight, the standard Fire tablet is the perfect solution.\nFire Tablet, $49.99, available from Amazon\nFire HD 6 Amazon If you're still looking for a good deal on a tablet, but want one that's a little more capable, the Fire HD 6 is a good compromise.\nFor an additional $20, you're getting a higher-resolution screen and the most pixel-dense tablet in Amazon's entire line. That means text will be more crisp, and the user interface in general will look cleaner on the HD 6 than any of Amazon's other tablets. It's one inch shorter than the base Kindle Fire, meaning if you're rocking a large phone like the Galaxy S7 Edge or iPhone 6S Plus , having a device with a screen this size might be redundant.\nThe Fire HD 6 shares the same camera system with the standard Fire tablet, but has Dolby audio built-in. It still only has one speaker, but the sound quality should be better. It also picks up an extra hour of battery life, taking it up to a respectable 8 hours. Because of its pixel-dense screen and small size, the Fire HD 6 is ideal for people who don't mind reading on a smaller tablet screen. It's also a good choice for those who want a small tablet that's under $100 with an HD screen.\nFire HD 6, $69.99, available at Amazon\nFire HD 8 Amazon The Fire HD 8 might have the same screen resolution as the Fire HD 6, but its larger screen size and better internals make it a more capable tablet.\nWith a higher-resolution front- and back-facing camera, the Fire HD 8 is a better choice if you chose to be a tablet-wielding photographer. That also means your conversations over Skype, or any other video-messaging service, will also be cleaner. The Fire HD 8 also supports the wireless AC standard, currently the fastest form of WiFi out there. Finally, along with the bigger screen size comes duel stereo speakers, making this tablet much more multimedia friendly.\nThis is the tablet to buy if you're looking for a big-but-not-huge travel tablet. It's the iPad Mini's size, but at less than half the price; and even better, you can expand its internal storage with a MicroSD card.\nFire HD 8, $149.99, available on Amazon\nFire HD 10 Amazon The top of Amazon's tablet line, the Fire HD10, is all about the larger screen. I tested this tablet out a few months ago and, even as a staunch iPad lover , I came away impressed. It's fast, light, has pretty good battery life, and the brushed metal option feels just as premium as an iPad.\nI dinged this tablet a bit for its screen resolution, which I wish was higher, but besides that, there's not a whole lot I could find wrong with it. It has the same camera system, WiFi speed bump, and stereo speakers as the HD 8. Really, the only difference is the screen size.\nThe Fire 10 HD is an excellent tablet choice if you want a \"full sized\" tablet that's capable of doing a whole heck of a lot, with a budget price. It's the tablet I recommend to everyone who doesn't like iOS, because this is a great piece of hardware.\nFire HD 10, $179.99, available at Amazon\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "text": "Newegg is now throwing in an extra battery, a charging cradle for the battery, and the LG Cam Plus (a 360-degree camera). Thanks, Saad. \nThe LG G5 is one of the odder phones that came out in 2016; its \"Friends\" module integration was a complete failure , its build quality is lackluster, and it hasn't sold particularly well. It's obviously not the best smartphone on the market, but it's still a pretty decent one - one that you can now pick up in an unlocked variation for just $399.99 from Amazon. \nI personally own a T-Mobile G5 and have been satisfied with it, for the most part. Admittedly, the build quality and design aren't great, but show me another flagship smartphone that has an IR blaster and a removable battery in 2016 (the vastly more expensive V20 not included). In addition, it actually performs more fluidly than both my Galaxy S7 edge and HTC 10, has a nice set of cameras on the back, and its 1440p LCD display isn't too shabby either. \nAmazon is currently offering the G5 in both Titan (gray) and Silver colors at that $399.99 price point. This RS988 model is compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile, and (surprise!) Verizon. Since the device is shipped and sold by Amazon, you'll also get fast shipping if you're a Prime member (I'm eligible for free same-day shipping, though YMMV). We don't know how long this deal will last for, so if you're interested, you should jump on it as soon as possible. \nNewegg is also offering the unlocked G5 for $399.99 in Titan and Silver . Thanks, Raiders12. End of Update \nNewegg is now throwing in an extra battery, a charging cradle for the battery, and the LG Cam Plus (a 360-degree camera). Thanks, Saad. End of Update",

This is a buy one get one free deal with code B1G1SAVE . \n\n-BEST GRILL ACCESSORY for barbecuing small foods like onions, peppers, mushrooms, and shrimp. Never lose your food again.\n\n-EASY to USE - Curved handles allows for easy carrying. Use as Wok pan to stir fry chopped chicken, beef or pork. Nothing beats great smoky BBQ flavor.\n\n-KEEPS FOOD INSIDE - Raised edges prevents food from escaping. Perfectly sized grill holes (a little bigger than a pencil eraser) allows heat and smoke to pass through without letting food run away.\n",

      "text": "News \nAlthough the Google Home has recently been released , Amazon's Echo/Dot/Tap devices are still excellent. With far more abilities than Google Assistant has at the moment, Alexa is still the king (or queen?) assistant platform for controlling smart home devices and communicating with online services. Now you can grab Amazon's various Alexa-powered devices for lower prices. \nThe largest cut is on the Amazon Echo, the company's main smart speaker with Alexa. It's only $139.99, a very respectable $40 drop from the original $179.99 price. The second-generation Echo Dot, essentially the Echo without built-in speakers, is $10 off at only $39.99. Finally, the Amazon Tap (a portable Echo) is $40 off at just $89.99. \nIf you're thinking about buying any of these, the links to the Amazon pages are down below. Source:",

      "text": "Woolies sees Amazon as a serious threat National Breaking News Business Business Date Print \nWoolworths is treating the potential arrival of online retail giant Amazon in Australia as a real threat, setting up a special team to deal with the new competitor. \nAmazonFresh, the online supermarket subsidiary of the American e-commerce company, is reportedly planning to launch in Australia as early as next year. \nWoolworths chairman Gordon Cairns revealed the group has set up a team to look at the Amazon \"threat\". \n\"We didn't want to distract people in the supermarket business worrying about how to compete with Coles and Aldi today (with) worrying about Amazon so we have set up a separate unit,\" Mr Cairns told the group's annual general meeting on Thursday. Advertisement \nHe said US retail expert Kathryn Tesija, a director on the Woolworths board, has been providing coaching and insights. \nThe former US Target executive told shareholders that Amazon was a real threat. \n\"They are a formidable competitor. They will be someone we will take seriously,\" Ms Tesija said. \nWoolworths has the advantage of being an entrenched player in the supermarket business, she said. \n\"Woolies has a number of different stores and the best locations in major cities in the country; and they built that over 91 years which Amazon can't replicate anytime soon.\"",

      "text": "Woolies views Amazon as a real threat Breaking News Business National Business Date Print \nWoolworths is preparing for the \"Amazon threat\" by setting up a special team to deal with the online retail giant's potential arrival in Australia. \nAmazonFresh, the online supermarket subsidiary of the American e-commerce company, is reportedly planning to launch in Australia as early as next year. \nWoolworths says it sees Amazon as a serious disrupter, and chairman Gordon Cairns revealed the group has set up a team to look at the \"threat\". \n\"We didn't want to distract people in the supermarket business worrying about how to compete with Coles and Aldi today (with) worrying about Amazon so we have set up a separate unit,\" Mr Cairns told the group's annual general meeting on Thursday. Advertisement \nHe said US retail expert Kathryn Tesija, a director on the Woolworths board, has been providing coaching and insights. \nThe former US Target executive also told shareholders that Amazon was a real threat. \n\"They are a formidable competitor. They will be someone we will take seriously,\" Ms Tesija said. \nWoolworths has the advantage of being an entrenched player in the supermarket business, she added. \n\"Woolies has a number of different stores and the best locations in major cities in the country; and they built that over 91 years which Amazon can't replicate anytime soon.\" \nColes and German discount retailer Aldi have declined to say whether they have also set up teams to analyse the potential threat Amazon would pose. \nA spokesman for Coles said the group was focused on continuing to deliver competitive food prices, while an Aldi spokesperson said it welcomed competition and was committed to being the price leader. \nRoy Morgan Research chief executive Michele Levine doubts the arrival of Amazon would spark another price war. \n\"Amazon would target people who are early adopters of technology and can afford to pay the service that solves their problems,\" she said. \n\"If Amazon can bring a really good grocery delivery service that gives people what they want, when they want it and they get fresh produce, they can probably charge more for it. \n\"That's where the winning disrupter will be rather than cutting margins further.\" \nWhile the supermarket giants are moving towards online shopping, their technology is still \"a bit clunky\", Ms Levine said. \n\"Amazon is definitely an extraordinary company. It's hungry and it is looking at Australia as a small but affluent market with rich pickings to be had.\"",

      "text": "Is Amazon's Shipping Policy A Form Of Consumer Fraud? {{article.article.images.featured.caption}} Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe \nWhen I encounter large companies acting in what appears to be a fraudulent matter, I presume I’m not special and that the company is harming the public in general. At that point I go slightly nuts and get far too aggressive (my wife says the right word is “rude”) on the phone with customer support people who are not fundamentally at fault. \nThis happened yesterday with Amazon. I tried to wiggle out of my bad behavior to my wife using economics. I explained to my wife that being aggressive is a form of economic signaling to make people take your concerns seriously. But she would have none of that. “Rude is rude. Imagine you were at the other end of that call? How would you like being treated that way?” \nShe’s right and I hereby issue a blanket apology to anyone in a customer support role that I’ve treated rudely over the phone in my 65 years on the planet. I also hope to be better behaved in the future. \nNow to my concern about Amazon’s shipping policy. And this is not connected to Amazon Prime, which has been the subject of several different class action lawsuits. \nOn Monday (November 21st, Today is November 23th), I purchased a birthday present for my wife directly from Amazon. Her birthday is on Saturday, but I wanted to ensure it arrived in time given the holiday traffic. So I paid an extra $30 for next day delivery. But at the back of my mind I sensed I had just thrown away $30. I buy a lot of things from Amazon and, while I haven’t documented the number of cases, I have often paid for next-day delivery, yet the package didn’t arrive on time. \nI checked yesterday (Tuesday) using Amazon’s tracking info and all looked good. The present would arrive by 8 PM. But when 8:30 PM showed up on the clock and the package hadn’t arrived, I called Amazon’s customer support. After the usual wait time, the Amazon support person came on the phone and was extremely polite. She immediately got UPS on the phone. UPS said they had no record of receiving the package, whereas Amazon’s tracking said they had. I asked (with a rude tone of voice) how could that be? Isn’t it the same electronic system being used? No answer. I wasn’t sure they were getting my question, so I asked a few more times. Still no answer. UPS: We never received it. Amazon: We can’t say where it is until UPS scans it. “But your system shows it handed over to UPS?” No answer. \nThe UPS person, who was also very polite, signed off. I asked the Amazon person, still amazingly polite, to please issue a refund for the $30. No, it’s not yet midnight and, in any case, you need to contact the shipper, UPS, for a refund? \n“But I paid Amazon the $30?” \n“Yes, but the shipper is responsible.” \n“I write a column for Forbes that covers consumer fraud. This sounds like consumer fraud. Can you please have a supervisor call me. Here’s my number.” \n“Please hold on.” \n“Ten minutes on hold and the supervisor was on the phone.” Also very polite. “My colleague was wrong about the refund. I’m also going to refund your payment and extend your Amazon Prime service for one month.” \n“Thank you. But I’m interested in a bigger question. If Amazon sells expedited shipping and the parcel doesn’t arrive on time, which Amazon can tell from its electronic tracking system, does Amazon refund the expedited shipping fee automatically? Or does the customer have to call?” \n“The customer has to call.” \n“But many customers don’t have time to call and be kept on hold and then reach someone and then told they have to argue with UPS and then be kept on hold to talk to a supervisor. You know from your electronic records when a customer paid for expedited shipping and it didn’t take place. Also, shouldn’t Amazon go back in its electronic records and discover all the people who paid for expedited shipping that wasn’t provided and issue them refunds? Aren’t you engaging in consumer fraud?” \n“No one has ever suggested this before. I’ll send an email to our technical team and maybe they’ll consider doing this. Have a lovely Thanksgiving.” \nNow my blood was boiling. So was my wife’s who thought I had used an angry tone of voice and was abusing powerless people in a huge company. \nThis morning I checked on Amazon. From their tracking system, the package sat with UPS for 24 hours in Kentucky and supposedly was sent out for delivery at 6:32 AM. It’s exactly four hours later – no package. Amazon’s system now “guarantees” delivery by 8 PM. \nButton line. Amazon should immediately implement an automatic refund policy re charging customers for shipping services that they don’t then provide. And the company should refund all payments for shipping services that were paid for, but weren’t provided in the past. Amazon has the electronic means to do this. Not doing so truly does represent a form of theft. If Amazon’s refund policy is not corrected immediately, I would hope some enterprising lawyer starts a class action suit against the company. ",
