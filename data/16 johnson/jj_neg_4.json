      "text": "A federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements.\nA lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product.\nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants.\nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product’s effectiveness to patients and their doctors.\n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,” said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. “This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.”\nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal.\n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.”\nThis is the third bellwether — or test — trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies.\nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week’s ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling.\nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies.\nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017.\n32.776664 -96.796988 ",

      "text": "  Corporate Johnson & Johnson and DePuy to Appeal Jury Verdicts in ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal Hip Trial \nDecember 1, 2016 – Johnson & Johnson and DePuy will immediately begin preparing post-trial motions challenging the verdict returned against the companies today by a jury in a federal multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas. The trial consolidated six individual cases chosen by the plaintiffs’ executive committee concerning DePuy’s ULTAMET ® Metal-on-Metal Articulation hip replacement. \n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokesperson for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.” \nThe companies filed numerous motions related to rulings that undermined the ability to properly and fairly defend against the allegations, including the decision to try the cases of the six plaintiffs together. During trial, the companies were forced to move for mistrial six times. The companies have strong grounds for appeal and remains committed to the long-term defense of the allegations in these lawsuits. \nIn the first MDL bellwether trial in October 2014, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Johnson & Johnson and DePuy. In a state case in 2015, a judge in Maryland granted summary judgment in favor of Johnson & Johnson and DePuy and dismissed the case. In the second MDL bellwether trial in early 2016, a jury found against Johnson & Johnson and DePuy, and the companies have appealed. \nFor additional information on ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, please visit: www.UnderstandingULTAMET.com . \nMedia Contact Information",

      "text": "(CNN) — A federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements.\nA lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product.\nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants.\nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product’s effectiveness to patients and their doctors.\n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,” said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. “This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.”\nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal.\n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.”\nThis is the third bellwether — or test — trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies.\nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week’s ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling.\nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies.\nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017.",

(Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Safe Kids Worldwide) Jason Kempin Previous Next \nJohnson & Johnson was hit with a $1 billion penalty by a Texas jury after the company was found responsible for hiding problems with hip implants. \nA federal jury found the major pharmaceutical company responsible and awarded $30 million in actual damages for the six plaintiffs along with $1 billion in punitive damages, Bloomberg reported . \nThe company denied any wrongdoing and plans to appeal, according to the International Business Times . \nAbout 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Johnson & Johnson after problems occurred with Pinnacle hip replacements. Patients have said the metal-on-metal hip replacements causes metal poisoning. The lawsuit claimed Johnson & Johnson knew about the problems but pushed sales for profit, according to Bloomberg. \nThe company's DePay unit, which makes the hips issued a statement saying the companies plan to appeal the decision. \n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokesperson for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.”",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $1 billion for faulty hip implants J&J still faces almost 9,000 lawsuits accusing the company of mishandling the metal-on-metal hips December 3, 2016 Last Updated at 00:32 IST email this article Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy: Image: Reuters ALSO READ Johnson & Johnson in talks to buy Actelion for $17 billion Johnson & Johnson warns diabetic patients: Insulin pump vulnerable to hacking Johnson & Johnson loses $70M to woman in lawsuit against baby powder Johnson & Johnson in talks to acquire Actelion Boris Johnson appointed Britain's foreign minister Johnson & Johnson was ordered by a Texas jury to pay more than $1 billion to patients who claimed the company hid flaws in its Pinnacle artificial hips that had to be surgically removed, in J&J’s second loss linked to the implants. Officials of J&J’s DePuy unit, which makes the Pinnacle hips, knew the devices were defective but failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the risk they would fail, the federal jury in Dallas determined Thursday. J&J still faces almost 9,000 lawsuits accusing the company of mishandling the metal-on-metal hips. J&J stopped selling the devices in 2013 after the US Food and Drug Administration toughened artificial-hip regulations. At $1.04 billion in actual and punitive damages, it’s the third largest jury award of 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest, for $3 billion, came in June in a breach of contract case brought by Hewlett-Packard against Oracle.“The jury is telling J&J that they better settle these cases soon,” Mark Lanier, who represented the group of six hip patients who sued J&J and DePuy. “All they are doing by trying more of these cases are driving up their costs and driving the company’s reputation into the mud.” J&J’s DePuy unit acted appropriately in designing and testing the product, spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said in a statement. The companies have strong grounds for appeal and remain committed to the long-term defense of the lawsuit allegations, according to the statement. Lawyers for J&J said US District Judge Ed Kinkeade’s rulings barred J&J from providing “a fair presentation to the jury.”“Now the appellate court will need to review errors” made by the judge, John Beisner, one of J&J’s attorneys, said in an e-mailed statement. The company will ask Kinkeade not to schedule any more trials until the appellate review is completed, he said. The verdict continues a losing stretch for J&J before US juries this year. Six of the seven largest product-defect verdicts in the US this year have been against J&J units, including three in lawsuits claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer. J&J won the first Pinnacle hip case to go to trial in October 2014 after a jury rejected a Montana woman’s claims that the devices were defective and gave her metal poisoning. In March, a Dallas jury ordered J&J to pay $502 million to a group of five patients who accused the company of hiding defects in the hips. A judge cut that verdict in July to about $150 million. The Pinnacle devices weren’t covered by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J’s $2.5 billion settlement covering its ASR line of artificial hips. In 2010 J&J recalled 93,000 of those implants worldwide, saying 12 per cent failed within five years. The company still faces 8,900 suits over Pinnacle hip failures, according to a May filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. That figure is up from 8,300 suits the company listed in an October 2015 regulatory filing. The Pinnacle cases have been consolidated before Kinkeade, who agreed to combine the six cases in the most recent trial. California residents Marvin Andrews, Kathleen Davis, Rosa Metzler, Judith Rodriguez, Lisa Standerfer and Michael Weiser each had Pinnacle hips removed after they failed, according to court filings. The group alleged their DePuy hips leached cobalt and chromium material into their bloodstreams, leading to the device failures and surgical removal. They claimed J&J officials knew their metal-on-metal design would cause such injuries but pushed ahead with the product to rack up billions of dollars in sales. The plaintiffs also contend DePuy officials rushed the Pinnacle hips to market with little testing and turned a blind eye to studies that showed metal-on-metal prosthetics posed a deterioration risk for human tissue and bone. The consolidated case is In Re DePuy Orthopaedics. Pinnacle Hip Implant Products Liability litigation, 11-md-2244, US District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The lead case in this trial was Andrews v DePuy Orthopedics, No. 15-cv-03484-K, US District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas).",

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $1 billion settlement Plaintiffs sued over artificial hip replacements Author: By Emily Smith and Keith Allen CNN Published On: Dec 02 2016 05:50:06 AM CST Updated On: Dec 02 2016 07:12:36 AM CST Mario Tama/Getty Images (CNN) - \nA federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements. Related Content Swimming, aerobics, racquet sports slash risk of death \nA lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered \"serious medical complications caused by defective\" metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product. \nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants. \nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product's effectiveness to patients and their doctors. \n\"Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we've known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,\" said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. \"This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.\" \nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal. \n\"We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,\" said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. \"DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.\" \nThis is the third bellwether -- or test -- trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies. \nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week's ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling. \nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies. \nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay record $1 billion for faulty hip implants Johnson & Johnson to pay record $1 billion \nThe jury concluded that J&J officials failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the risk of failing hip implants. \nThe jury concluded that J&J officials failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the risk of failing hip implants. Jef Feeley and Tom Korosec Bloomberg \nA Texas jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $1 billion to patients who claimed the company hid flaws in its Pinnacle artificial hips that had to be surgically removed, in J&J's second loss linked to the implants. \nOfficials of J&J's DePuy unit, which makes the Pinnacle hips, knew the devices were defective but failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the risk they would fail, the federal jury in Dallas concluded Thursday. The verdict includes more than $30 million in actual damages for the six plaintiffs and more than $1 billion in punitive damages, according to court filings. \nJ&J still faces almost 9,000 lawsuits accusing the company of mishandling the metal-on-metal hips. J&J stopped selling the devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration toughened artificial-hip regulations. \nAt $1.04 billion in damages, it's the third-largest overall jury award of 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The largest, for $3 billion, came in June in a breach of contract case brought by Hewlett-Packard Co. against Oracle Corp. The punitive award against J&J was the largest against a company this year, according to Bloomberg data. Such punishment damages are intended to dissuade defendants from continuing sanctioned practices. \n\"The jury is telling J&J that they better settle these cases soon,\" said Mark Lanier, who represented the group of six hip patients who sued J&J and DePuy. \"All they are doing by trying more of these cases is driving up their costs and driving the company's reputation into the mud.\" \nJ&J's DePuy unit acted appropriately in designing and testing the product, spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said in a statement. The companies have strong grounds for appeal and remain committed to the long-term defense of the lawsuit allegations, according to the statement. \nLawyers for J&J said U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade's rulings barred J&J from providing \"a fair presentation to the jury.\" \n\"Now the appellate court will need to review errors\" made by the judge, attorney John Beisner said in an e-mailed statement. The company will ask Kinkeade not to schedule any more trials until the appellate review is completed, he said. \nThe verdict continues a losing stretch for J&J before U.S. juries. Six of the seven largest product-defect verdicts in the U.S. this year have been against J&J units, including three in lawsuits claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer. \nJ&J won the first Pinnacle hip case to go to trial in October 2014 after a jury rejected a Montana woman's claims that the devices were defective and gave her metal poisoning. In March, a Dallas jury ordered J&J to pay $502 million to a group of five patients who accused the company of hiding defects in the hips. A judge cut that verdict in July to about $150 million. \nThe Pinnacle devices weren't covered by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J's $2.5 billion settlement covering its ASR line of artificial hips. In 2010 J&J recalled 93,000 of those implants worldwide, saying 12 percent failed within five years. \nSince the six hip recipients who sued J&J were all California residents, that state's law governs the handling of punitive damages awarded in the case. California has no cap on punishment awards, so it may be difficult for the company to argue that this part of the verdict should be reduced under state law. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has said such bad-conduct awards must be proportional to compensatory damage verdicts that underlie them and has limited punitive verdicts to 10 times a plaintiff's actual damages. \nThe company still faces 8,900 suits over Pinnacle hip failures, according to a May filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . That figure is up from 8,300 suits the company listed in an October 2015 regulatory filing. \nThe patients in the cases before Kinkeade alleged their DePuy hips leached cobalt and chromium material into their bloodstreams, leading to the device failures and surgical removal. They claimed J&J officials knew their metal-on-metal design would cause such injuries but pushed ahead with the product to rack up billions of dollars in sales. \nThe plaintiffs also contend DePuy officials rushed the Pinnacle hips to market with little testing and turned a blind eye to studies that showed metal-on-metal prosthetics posed a deterioration risk for human tissue and bone. \nKinkeade has scheduled another test trial involving claims by 10 hip recipients for September 2017, according to court filings. \nDespite its pledge to appeal Thursday's verdict, J&J shouldn't wait for an outcome to approach hip patients with settlement offers, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan law professor, who teaches classes about how drugs and medical devices are developed and regulated. \n\"They may think they have good defenses to these claims, but they don't seem to be working with juries,\" Gordon said in an interview Thursday. \"There's no easy way out of these cases now that they have a billion-dollar verdict against them. They better start thinking of how they can settle these claims before the price goes up any more.\" \nWith assistance from Margaret Cronin Fisk",

      "text": "A Dallas jury commanded Johnson & Johnson to pay up $1 billion to plaintiffs claiming injury from from the company’s metal-on-metal hip implants. This follows a $500 million verdict concerning the same implants, handed down in March this year.\nThe 6 plaintiffs reported injuries such as tissue death and bone erosion that they blamed on the device design. Jurors at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas found that the Pinnacle Ultamet hip implants, manufactured by J&J’s DePuy Orthopaedics business, were “defectively designed” and that J&J and DePuy did not warn consumers of the risk, Reuters reported . The trial consolidated 6 cases out of the more than 8,000 lawsuits the company is facing over the Pinnacle implants.\nIn a victory for J&J, the jury ruled against the plaintiff in the October 2014 case, denying her the $1.5 million she was seeking in damages. But this verdict and the $500 million one from March don’t paint a pretty future for J&J. The company may catch a break as, in July, a federal judge cut the $500 million verdict to $151 thanks to a Texas law that curbs punitive damages. But J&J isn’t out of the woods yet, as the plaintiffs in that case are appealing the judge’s decision, according to Reuters.\nJ&J will immediately appeal the verdict, the devicemaker said in a statement.\n“DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain,” said Mindy Tinsley, a DePuy spokeswoman.\nWhile the company denies misconduct, it stopped selling the implants in August 2013, following an FDA announcement saying it would step up its review process for new versions of the product.",

      "text": "Email \n(CNN) — A federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements. \nA lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product. \nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants. \nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product’s effectiveness to patients and their doctors. \n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,” said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. “This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.” \nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal. \n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.” \nThis is the third bellwether — or test — trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies. \nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week’s ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling. \nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies. \nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017. ",

(Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Safe Kids Worldwide) Jason Kempin Previous Next \nJohnson & Johnson was hit with a $1 billion penalty by a Texas jury after the company was found responsible for hiding problems with hip implants. \nA federal jury found the major pharmaceutical company responsible and awarded $30 million in actual damages for the six plaintiffs along with $1 billion in punitive damages, Bloomberg reported . \nThe company denied any wrongdoing and plans to appeal, according to the International Business Times . \nAbout 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Johnson & Johnson after problems occurred with Pinnacle hip replacements. Patients have said the metal-on-metal hip replacements causes metal poisoning. The lawsuit claimed Johnson & Johnson knew about the problems but pushed sales for profit, according to Bloomberg. \nThe company's DePay unit, which makes the hips issued a statement saying the companies plan to appeal the decision. \n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokesperson for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.” ",

      "text": "Email \nIf you’re looking for a company that cares, look no further than Johnson & Johnson. It might be an enormous corporation, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a soul. Johnson & Johnson just proved that it’s completely committed to customers by releasing an 8,000-calorie shampoo that people can eat if they get trapped in the shower. \nAmazing! It’s incredible to see a company that’s so committed to the safety and well-being of its customers! \nAccording to Johnson & Johnson executives, the new 8,000-calorie Aquafeast shampoo will offer all of the same fortifying and moisturizing properties of traditional shampoo, but it will also contain high concentrations of carbohydrates, fat, and vitamins so that people can squirt it into their mouths to survive when they find themselves unable to leave the shower for days at a time. \nIt looks like this is a company that is not prepared to let its customers starve to death in the shower. If people become trapped under an avalanche of lotion bottles or their hands become too slippery to pull back the shower curtain, all they need to do is reach for a bottle of Aquafeast to feed themselves during the long days and nights that they spend imprisoned in the shower. Customers will be able to survive for days, and when they’re finally rescued from the shower, they’ll be healthier than ever! \n“At Johnson & Johnson, we understand the pain families feel of discovering the starved and withered bodies of their loved ones lying on the shower floor after being trapped there for weeks,” said Lydia Strickland, a Johnson & Johnson PR executive, in a press release earlier today. “A single bottle of Aquafeast shampoo contains enough calories to survive in the shower for up to six days. Whether our customers get trapped in the shower because their arm is stuck in the drain, or they become lost and don’t know which direction leads out of the shower, our calorie-rich shampoo will provide them with the nutrients they need to survive, while at the same time offering a cleansing experience designed to leave their hair feeling soft and looking vital.” \nThis is a company that knows how to treat its customers! Johnson & Johnson even included a mixture of coconut oil and vinegar to dull the bitter taste of the 18 natural extracts that leaves hair silky and tangle-free. While the taste of soap is still overpowering, Johnson & Johnson claims that the taste of vinegar and coconut is still unmistakable, so if you get trapped in the shower, you’ll be able to enjoy the great flavors of Johnson & Johnson’s survival shampoo until a rescue team arrives. \nIncredible. Showering just became a whole lot safer, and it’s all thanks to Johnson & Johnson and its new highly caloric shampoo. Here’s hoping more companies start showing the same commitment to customer safety that Johnson & Johnson does!",

      "text": "A Texas jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $1 billion to patients who claimed the company hid flaws in its Pinnacle artificial hips that had to be surgically removed, in J&J's second loss linked to the implants.\nOfficials of J&J's DePuy unit, which makes the Pinnacle hips, knew the devices were defective but failed to properly warn doctors and patients about the risk they would fail, the federal jury in Dallas concluded Thursday.\nThe verdict includes more than $30 million in actual damages for the six plaintiffs and more than $1 billion in punitive damages, according to court filings.\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS J&J still faces almost 9,000 lawsuits accusing the company of mishandling the metal-on-metal hips. J&J stopped selling the devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration toughened artificial-hip regulations.\nAt $1.04 billion in damages, it's the third-largest overall jury award of 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe largest, for $3 billion, came in June in a breach of contract case brought by Hewlett-Packard Co. against Oracle Corp. The punitive award against J&J was the largest against a company this year, according to Bloomberg data.\nSuch punishment damages are intended to dissuade defendants from continuing sanctioned practices.\n\"The jury is telling J&J that they better settle these cases soon,\" said Mark Lanier, who represented the group of six hip patients who sued J&J and DePuy. \"All they are doing by trying more of these cases is driving up their costs and driving the company's reputation into the mud.\"\nJ&J's DePuy unit acted appropriately in designing and testing the product, spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said. The companies have strong grounds for appeal and remain committed to the long-term defense of the lawsuit allegations, according to the statement.\nLawyers for J&J said U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade's rulings barred J&J from providing \"a fair presentation to the jury.\"\n\"Now the appellate court will need to review errors\" made by the judge, attorney John Beisner said. The company will ask Kinkeade not to schedule any more trials until the appellate review is completed, he said.\nThe verdict continues a losing stretch for J&J before U.S. juries. Six of the seven largest product-defect verdicts in the U.S. this year have been against J&J units, including three in lawsuits claiming its talc products cause ovarian cancer.\nJ&J won the first Pinnacle hip case to go to trial in October 2014 after a jury rejected a Montana woman's claims that the devices were defective and gave her metal poisoning.\nIn March, a Dallas jury ordered J&J to pay $502 million to a group of five patients who accused the company of hiding defects in the hips. A judge cut that verdict in July to about $150 million.\nThe Pinnacle devices weren't covered by New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&J's $2.5 billion settlement covering its ASR line of artificial hips. In 2010 J&J recalled 93,000 of those implants worldwide, saying 12 percent failed within five years.\nSince the six hip recipients who sued J&J were all California residents, that state's law governs the handling of punitive damages awarded in the case.\nCalifornia has no cap on punishment awards, so it may be difficult for the company to argue that this part of the verdict should be reduced under state law.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has said such bad-conduct awards must be proportional to compensatory damage verdicts that underlie them and has limited punitive verdicts to 10 times a plaintiff's actual damages. » Next page...

      "text": "Email \nA federal jury in Dallas has ordered Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics to pay more than $1 billion to a group of plaintiffs over artificial hip replacements. \nA lawyer for the six plaintiffs said they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal Pinnacle implants. The jurors found that the companies failed to warn patients and their doctors about risks related to the defectively designed product. \nEach of the patients had to undergo a second, or revision, surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least one had received double hip implants. \nThe jury awarded more than $30 million in actual damages and more than $1 billion in punitive damages. Jurors ruled that Johnson & Johnson and DePuy were negligent in designing the implant; failed to warn physicians and patients about concerns over the product; failed to recall it; and intentionally misrepresented the product’s effectiveness to patients and their doctors. \n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice,” said lead attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston. “This jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.” \nBoth Johnson & Johnson and DePuy denied wrongdoing and said they will appeal. \n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokeswoman for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.” \nThis is the third bellwether — or test — trial of thousands of similar lawsuits filed against the companies. \nIn March, a Dallas jury awarded more than $500 million to a group of plaintiffs who suffered similar complications from the hip implants. The judge in that case, who also presided over this week’s ruling, later reduced the amount of awarded damages to $154 million, citing Texas law. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have appealed that ruling. \nIn the first trial, in 2014, a jury ruled in favor of the medical companies. \nA fourth bellwether trial is scheduled for September 2017. 32.776664 -96.796988 ",

The jurors said the hip implants were defectively designed and that JNJ and its DuPuy Orthopaedics unit failed to warn patients about the risks. JNJ, which still faces nearly 9K lawsuits over the implants, stopped selling the product in 2013 after the FDA toughened regulations on artificial hips; it plans to appeal the verdict. ",

Sun / Grant Welker Sun staff photos can be ordered by visiting our SmugMug site. \nLOWELL -- UMass Lowell's M2D2 startup lab has been named one of a small number of training facilities run by the conglomerate Johnson & Johnson. \nM2D2, or Massachusetts Medical Device Development Center, will be the company's seventh so-called JLab, university and company officials announced Thursday at event for innovation networking. \nJohnson & Johnson has so-called JLabs at Kendall Square in Cambridge, Houston, Toronto, San Diego and two in San Francisco, putting Lowell in some exclusive company. \n\"It's nice to be recognized by Johnson & Johnson,\" said Steven Tello, a co-director of M2D2, his dry words illuminated by a big smile. \n\"I'm not excited. No Published Caption Sun staff photos can be ordered by visiting our SmugMug site. I'm ecstatic,\" added Stephen McCarthy, another co-director, just as happy as his partner in regards to the news. M2D2 had worked for three years to try getting the affiliation with Johnson & Johnson, he added. \nThe medical-device and pharmaceutical company was also named on Thursday as the facility's first founding sponsor, the highest-level donor counted by M2D2. \nFinancial terms were not disclosed. \nNew Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson's sponsorship also includes a medical-device start-up competition called the Quickfire Challenge in which the winner will get lab space in M2D2 for free for one year, with access to Johnson & Johnson mentoring. \nThe winner will be announced in May, when the JLab is officially launched. Advertisement \n\"We're really excited about this collaboration because M2D2 has really built something interesting in this med-tech incubator,\" said Lesley Stolz, the head of JLabs California. \nOpening a lab in Lowell \"felt like a perfect storm,\" she said, mentioning the proximity to the Cambridge lab and Massachusetts' success in life sciences. \nKadir Kadiresan, a senior vice president for new ventures at Johnson & Johnson, said that for medical-device companies, having access to UMass Lowell and the UMass Medical School in Worcester is critical. \n\"This space has been a lifeline for many of early-stage medical-device companies around Massachusetts,\" he said. \nM2D2 opened in 2010 in Wannalancit Mills on Suffolk Street and expanded to the 110 Canal building in the Hamilton Canal District in 2015. It has launched four companies, including Anterios, which was bought for $90 million in June by the giant Allergan. \nM2D2 already has sponsorships from several others in the industry, including American Instrument Exchange, Becton Dickinson and Boston Scientific. \nThe head of the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center, a state agency and major supporter of incubators in the state, lauded M2D2 for the partnership with Johnson & Johnson. \n\"This partnership with J&J will further accelerate M2D2's ability to deliver exciting medical device innovations, and further cement the Merrimack Valley as a leading geography for corporate-academic collaborations in the life sciences,\" said Travis McCready, the agency's president and CEO, in a statement. \nFollow Grant Welker on Twitter and Tout @SunGrantWelker.",

      "title": "My Dividend Growth Portfolio",
      "text": "Click to enlarge \nCCC List members \nGeneral Mills (NYSE: GIS ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ), McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ), Altria (NYSE: MO ), PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ) and AT&T (NYSE: T ) are straight picks from the CCC list. They are solid DG stocks that are frequently part of a DG portfolio. I got them at prices I thought were good values. I will keep them as long as they keep increasing dividends and don't get too overvalued. The positions with whole share counts are positions that I have trimmed back and haven't bought new shares in since I trimmed. \nCummins (NYSE: CMI ), Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are also DGI stocks but they are more cyclical or volatile in their share prices. I buy more when I see them at a good discount to fair value. MSFT is such a small position because after I first bought it, the price ran up well beyond what I wanted to pay for more shares. \nChevron-Texaco (NYSE: CVX ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) are my energy stocks. I once had ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ) but I sold that at the start of the year when I saw that low oil prices put its dividend at risk. I put about a third of that cash each into CVX and XOM. \nDominion Resources (NYSE: D ), Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ), and Southern Company ( SO ) are my utilities. These are solid companies that are growing nicely. Chowder's comments on them are what initially drew my interest. I once held WGL Holdings (NYSE: WGL ), but its price ran up so high that its dividend yield fell too low, so I rolled the money from that position into D and DUK. \nKraft-Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC ) is a stock I got from when Heinz acquired Kraft. Since the takeover, it has done as well for me as Kraft had done. I got almost $4,000 from the special dividend and invested that into other positions in the portfolio. \nREITs \nChatham Lodging (NYSE: CLDT ), Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR ), EPR Properties Trust (NYSE: EPR ), LTC Properties ( LTC ,) Reality Income (NYSE: O ), Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE: OHI ), STAG Industrial (NYSE: STAG ) and Ventas (NYSE: VTR ) are my core eREIT stocks. Brad Thomas originally pointed them out in various articles he has written over the years. They provide a good solid base of dividend payments, which I tend to invest in companies that grow faster. CLDT, EPR, O and STAG pay monthly. I used about a third of the cash I got when I sold COP to add to my LTC position. \nCare Capital Properties (NYSE: CCP ) is a REIT that I first got shares when they were spun off from VTR. I liked the dividend and built it up to a full position. At this point, I am monitoring them to see if they can do well in their market. At some point, I might sell and roll some of the cash into OHI, which is in a very similar market. \nVereit (NYSE: VER ) is a REIT I own due to owning both of the REITs that merged to form it. Because of a lot of issues, including accounting fraud and a total switch out of management the price of this is down a lot. Brad Thomas had given advance warning that something wasn't right with the company, but I failed to act. I am not buying any more of this stock, and as it makes sense, I am reducing my exposure to it. \nMLPs \nKinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI ) is my sole remaining MLP. I once held Linn Energy (LNCO) as well, but sold out of it when they announced they were eliminating the dividend. Actually, neither LNCO nor KMI is technically an MLP, as both are C-Corps, but they are MLP adjacent and other than for tax purposes act much like MLPs. \nI am still debating what to do with KMI, I wrote an article about one tactic I am trying in order to recover from the big price drop before and after they had to cut their dividend. In the Lessons Learned section, I cover what happened and what I learned from holding both KMI and LNCO. \nPreferred Stocks \nI hold several issues of preferred stock. ARR PRB and MITT PRB are preferred shares from ARMOUR Residential REIT (NYSE: ARR ) and AG Mortgage Investment Trust (NYSE: MITT ). Brad Thomas wrote about them and their good yield. I hold them mostly for the immediate income boost and because I see their dividend as a lot safer than the common shares of mREITs. For the most part, after holding several mREITs a few years back, I don't invest in mREITs because their share price and dividends are too volatile. Even though Scott Kennedy provides excellent articles on how to invest in mREITs and how the companies are performing, the time to manage then was just not worth the effort to me. \nVER PERF is the preferred issue from Vereit (formerly ARCP). During the depths of its issues with accounting and the old management, I switched some of my common shares for the preferred shares to reduce my risk from the company. This has been a nice steady payer. I bought it below par, so I have a small profit on the shares, and from time to time, I have contemplated selling it. I'll most likely keep these and sell more of the common. \nExperimental Stocks \nLadder Capital (NYSE: LADR ) is an mREIT that does commercial lending. It is much simpler than those mREITs like ARR, MITT or AGNC Investment (NASDAQ: AGNC ) that work with residential mortgages. Brad Thomas initially brought my attention to the company and I opened a half position in it. Right now, it's generating a good yield and I am watching it to see both how it does and how much time it consumes to monitor it. Usually, I don't worry much about price, but I am keeping an eye on the price as well (I am up 27%), just in case it doesn't work out and I sell it. \nFord Motor (NYSE: F ) is another experimental stock. Several years ago, I bought several stocks because I liked something about what they were doing. One company, for instance, had an interesting technology, a novel and cheap way to clean water after it was used in fracking. I bought Ford because I liked that they didn't take a government bailout. For the most part these stocks didn't work out, although since I mostly kept the positions small, they didn't cost me a lot of money. \nFord was the only one that worked out, as it pretty much became a DG company. It isn't currently increasing its regular dividend, but it is issuing a special dividend that so far makes up for that. I'll likely hold this for another year as I monitor it to see how the dividend issue plays out. \nOthers \nVector Group Ltd. (NYSE: VGR ) is a strange company that is part Tobacco Company, part real-estate Company. The thing that attracted me to it, was that every year it pays a stock dividend of 5%. Lots of articles have been written about it, most of them negative, but it has a long history of paying out $0.40 a share in quarterly dividends and that once a year 5% stock dividend. I have held it for several years, and it just keeps rolling along. The dividends help me grow other positions, because I don't add shares other than the stock dividend. \nHow I handle dividends \nThere have been a lot of articles on how to handle dividend reinvestment. Some like to just roll the dividends back into the companies that produced them. Since most brokers don't charge a commission for that, an argument can be made that this is the most efficient way. Others accumulate the dividends until they have $1,000 (or some other figure designed to minimize the impact of commission charges), and then use that cash to buy a stock from their watch list that is currently trading at the best value of their candidates. \nFor a long time, I was in the DRIP crowd. It's simple and easy and not paying commissions is very attractive. It also has the added advantage of not missing any dividend payments from the new shares purchased. I still think it makes the most sense for smaller portfolios. \nAbout a year ago, I determined that my IRA account had large enough dividend payments that the accumulate strategy might be cost effective. So looking at how much cash my dividends put into my account each month and the commission my broker charged, I decided I would accumulate dividend cash until I collected $1,500 and I would then make a targeted purchase from my watch list. However, I kept the drip on for any positions that were not a full position and for which I wanted more shares. \nSo MSFT, PEP and DUK are still currently dripping their dividends. I currently have more than $1,500 in cash, so I will be purchasing shares of VTR on December 6th. One feature I like that my broker, Sharebuilder, offers is that I can purchase a fixed dollar amount of shares every Tuesday. I use this to purchase shares with my accumulated dividends (this feature also has a lower commission charge). \nSo far, the accumulate method is working well. I have so far collected $17,581 in dividends up till the end of November. Last year I collected a total of $17,446. My goal for this year is $19,385. That leaves me about $1,800 short of the goal, with my December dividends roughly expected to be around $2,500. Since my goal was to grow dividends this year as much as last year (when I was doing all DRIP), I have most likely beaten that goal. My projected dividends (based on annual rates and shares currently held) for the next 12 months is $21,070 so I am well on my way to making my goal for 2017 of $21,538. \nLessons Learned \nOver the time I have been managing this portfolio I have learned a number of important lessons. I share them in the hope that my experiences can save others the cost I incurred while learning them. \nOne big lesson I learned was gained by investing in mREITs like AGNC (I held others as well, but that was my biggest position). It's a fairly obvious lesson, or so it seems in hindsight. Never invest in a company where you don't understand, at least at a basic level, how they make their money. The problem I ran into with mREITs, is that I missed how the interest rate spread was far more important than what interest rate they were getting on the mortgages they were buying. \nI also missed that their leverage was tied to the value of those mortgages. So I foolishly assumed that rising interest rates would allow them to pay more dividends. In part I based that assumption on the fact that when rates decreased they had to cut dividends, so I thought it was logical that with rising rates, they wouldn't have any trouble with income! Scott Kennedy pointed this out in his articles analyzing mREITs, but I discounted that information because I was so sure that increasing rates had to increase their income. \nMy next lesson was about companies that built an income stream very much dependent on hedges to get the price they needed for their products. Not being as wary of that issue as I should have been allowed me to be surprised by the problems that LNCO got into. Linn Energy built a massive infrastructure that generated lots of cash, provided they could get around $90 a barrel for oil (and similar high prices for natural gas). \nThey had plenty of hedges to ensure they got that price. Everything was fine until oil stayed low so long that Linn began to run out of hedges. It came down pretty quickly after that. From that experience, I learned that if a company can't be profitable at the current market price for their products, they aren't a good investment any longer if that low price lasts very long. \nKMI taught me that while it is true that share price has little impact on the operations of most companies, that isn't true of all companies. How a company finances growth can impact how much influence share price has on the operations of the company. KMI is one of those companies that financed its growth by selling shares to get much of the cash it needed to grow. Many REITs are similar and so too are MLPs. Concerns about the price of oil and its impact on KMI's ability to pay the dividend had a huge negative impact on the price of its shares. \nSo much so that it became too expensive to sell shares to fund growth projects. At that point, credit agencies forced a cut in the dividend, so that cash flow could be used for internal funding (and some repayment of debt). From this I have learned that for some companies, share price is one of the fundamental metrics for the company. \nNote: I hope you all got something out of this article.

      "text": "AbbVie Inc. ( ABBV - Free Report ) and partner Janssen, Johnson & Johnson’s ( JNJ - Free Report ) pharmaceuticals subsidiary, presented encouraging results on their cancer drug Imbruvica at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).\nAbbVie’s share price has risen 3.3% in the past one month, comparing favorably with a decline of 1.3% for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.\nData from a phase II study (n=63) showed that nearly half of the patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) had a complete or partial response when treated with the company’s hematological cancer drug Imbruvica. In the study, 79% of patients experienced some tumor reduction and overall response rates (ORR) was 48%. Safety data from the study was consistent with previous Imbruvica studies.\nWe remind investors that AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for a label expansion of Imbruvica to include the treatment of MZL in September.\nImbruvica became part of AbbVie’s portfolio following the Pharmacyclics acquisition last March.\nImbruvica is presently approved for quite a few indications. The drug is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, who have received at least one previous therapy and for CLL patients with deletion 17p. It is also approved for the treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.\nImbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand its label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Imbruvica is in phase III studies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” with the treatment featuring in several company-sponsored studies. A registrational study for graft versus host disease (GVHD) is also underway.\nIn separate press releases, AbbVie announced five-year cancer-research collaborations with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Northwestern University's Lurie Cancer Center.\nAbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nABBVIE INC Price and Consensus\nABBVIE INC Price and Consensus | ABBVIE INC Quote:\nAbbVie’s key drug Humira has been performing well. However, quite a few companies are working on bringing Humira biosimilars to the market. Amgen, Inc.’s ( AMGN - Free Report ) Humira biosimilar Amjevita received FDA approval in Sep 2016. Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s ( MNTA - Free Report ) biosimilar version of Humira, M923, is in a phase III study.\nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit\nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

      "text": "AbbVie Inc. ( ABBV - Free Report ) and partner Janssen, Johnson & Johnson’s ( JNJ - Free Report ) pharmaceuticals subsidiary, presented encouraging results on their cancer drug Imbruvica at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH).\nAbbVie’s share price has risen 3.3% in the past one month, comparing favorably with a decline of 1.3% for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.\n\nData from a phase II study (n=63) showed that nearly half of the patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) had a complete or partial response when treated with the company’s hematological cancer drug Imbruvica. In the study, 79% of patients experienced some tumor reduction and overall response rates (ORR) was 48%. Safety data from the study was consistent with previous Imbruvica studies.\nWe remind investors that AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for a label expansion of Imbruvica to include the treatment of MZL in September.\nImbruvica became part of AbbVie’s portfolio following the Pharmacyclics acquisition last March.\nImbruvica is presently approved for quite a few indications. The drug is currently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, who have received at least one previous therapy and for CLL patients with deletion 17p. It is also approved for the treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.\nImbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand its label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Imbruvica is in phase III studies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” with the treatment featuring in several company-sponsored studies. A registrational study for graft versus host disease (GVHD) is also underway.\nIn separate press releases, AbbVie announced five-year cancer-research collaborations with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Northwestern University's Lurie Cancer Center.\nAbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Health J&J questions fairness of hip implant trial, US$1 billion verdict Johnson & Johnson will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of US$1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its Pinnacle hip implant. Posted 07 Dec 2016 19:10 Updated 07 Dec 2016 19:20 Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, speaks at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon in Boston, Massachusetts September 11, 2015. REUTERS/Brian Snyder A \nREUTERS: Johnson & Johnson will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of US$1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its Pinnacle hip implant. \nAlthough legal experts think J&J faces an uphill battle, both they and investors believe the Texas jury's penalty, the largest product liability verdict so far this year, is unlikely to stand. \nIn the two-month trial, five separate people from California argued that design flaws in the metal-on-metal implant made by J&J subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics caused tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries. \nIt is the second large verdict against J&J in the Pinnacle implant litigation, which has been consolidated before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Kinkeade in Texas. In July, another jury awarded six Texas plaintiffs US$500 million. Both cases were so-called bellwethers, intended to gauge the value of claims for more than 9,000 other pending implant cases. \nJ&J said in a statement it was confident in its appeal prospects and would not settle. It also said it stood by the safety of its product. \nLast Thursday's verdict has had little impact on J&J stock. Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with ESquared Asset Management, said investors assume large health products companies will occasionally be sued and lose and that the costs are ultimately manageable. \nJ&J said it will ask Kinkeade to reduce or throw out the jury award before appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. According to the company, the multi-plaintiff format stacked the deck against it by parading a series of victims in front of the jury and exaggerating the number of complaints about the implant. \nThe company won the first bellwether trial in a case involving a single plaintiff in 2014. The next is scheduled for September 2017, and Kinkeade has not decided how many plaintiffs will be involved in that trial. \nThese results \"perfectly illustrate the distortions and confusion inherent in multi-plaintiff trials and underscore the extent of the legal errors that have been repeated,\" said J&J defense lawyer John Beisner. \nBut several legal experts said such a challenge faced long odds. Lynn Baker, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted trial judges are normally given great leeway in managing their cases and multi-plaintiff trials were a long-established means of clearing dockets faster. \n\"I would not expect J&J to succeed on a claim that they were prejudiced by the multi-plaintiff bellwether format,\" she said. \nJ&J also said the judge allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer. \nUniversity of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias said an appeals court was unlikely to overturn the verdict on such grounds though. \"Unless there is clear prejudice on the part of the jury, you’ve got to defer to the factfinder,\" he said. \nBut even without showing its trial was unfair, the professors said J&J's case was strong for having the US$1 billion award reduced on the grounds that it is excessive. \nKinkeade cut the US$500 million July verdict to US$151 million. \nAndrew Bradt, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has held punitive damages should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages. The US$1.041 billion award was mainly punitive, with just US$32 million in compensatory damages. \nBradt said the final award could be even lower than US$320 million, since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs' injuries rather than as a broader deterrent. \n(Reporting By Erica Teichert; Editing by Anthony Lin and Grant McCool) - Reuters",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, speaks at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon …\nBy Erica Teichert\n(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of $1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its Pinnacle hip implant.\nAlthough legal experts think J&J faces an uphill battle, both they and investors believe the Texas jury's penalty, the largest product liability verdict so far this year, is unlikely to stand.\nIn the two-month trial, five separate people from California argued that design flaws in the metal-on-metal implant made by J&J subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics caused tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries.\nIt is the second large verdict against J&J in the Pinnacle implant litigation, which has been consolidated before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Kinkeade in Texas. In July, another jury awarded six Texas plaintiffs $500 million. Both cases were so-called bellwethers, intended to gauge the value of claims for more than 9,000 other pending implant cases.\nJ&J said in a statement it was confident in its appeal prospects and would not settle. It also said it stood by the safety of its product.\nLast Thursday's verdict has had little impact on J&J stock. Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with ESquared Asset Management, said investors assume large health products companies will occasionally be sued and lose and that the costs are ultimately manageable.\nJ&J said it will ask Kinkeade to reduce or throw out the jury award before appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. According to the company, the multi-plaintiff format stacked the deck against it by parading a series of victims in front of the jury and exaggerating the number of complaints about the implant. \nThe company won the first bellwether trial in a case involving a single plaintiff in 2014. The next is scheduled for September 2017, and Kinkeade has not decided how many plaintiffs will be involved in that trial.\nThese results \"perfectly illustrate the distortions and confusion inherent in multi-plaintiff trials and underscore the extent of the legal errors that have been repeated,\" said J&J defense lawyer John Beisner.\nBut several legal experts said such a challenge faced long odds. Lynn Baker, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted trial judges are normally given great leeway in managing their cases and multi-plaintiff trials were a long-established means of clearing dockets faster.\n\"I would not expect J&J to succeed on a claim that they were prejudiced by the multi-plaintiff bellwether format,\" she said.\nJ&J also said the judge allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer. \nUniversity of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias said an appeals court was unlikely to overturn the verdict on such grounds though. \"Unless there is clear prejudice on the part of the jury, you’ve got to defer to the factfinder,\" he said.\nBut even without showing its trial was unfair, the professors said J&J's case was strong for having the $1 billion award reduced on the grounds that it is excessive. \nKinkeade cut the $500 million July verdict to $151 million.\nAndrew Bradt, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has held punitive damages should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages. The $1.041 billion award was mainly punitive, with just $32 million in compensatory damages.\nBradt said the final award could be even lower than $320 million, since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs' injuries rather than as a broader deterrent.\n\n(Reporting By Erica Teichert; Editing by Anthony Lin and Grant McCool)",

      "text": "The Health Warrior: Why Danai Gurira Is Helping Johnson & Johnson Fight HIV/AIDS Published December 7, 2016 \nTaubert, company group chairman of The Americas Pharmaceuticals at Johnson & Johnson, shares what it meant to be named to Fortune’s annual list. \nBy Sheila Weller Jennifer Taubert \nWhen Fortune ‘s 2016 Most Powerful Women list was released recently, there were nine first-timers on the roster, including Jennifer Taubert , company group chairman of The Americas Pharmaceuticals at Johnson & Johnson ( No. 8 on the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies list). \nIn a nutshell, she’s tasked withoverseeing and leading the growth of existing and new business in Canada, the United States and Latin America, and creating innovation along the way. \nIn honor of her inaugural year as a Fortune Most Powerful Woman, we sat down with Taubert to find out what it felt like to be recognized, what inspires her high-profile work—and what she plans to accomplish from here. Q: What was your initial reaction when you heard you were being named a Fortune Most Powerful Woman? A: Jennifer Taubert: I felt honored and humbled to be on this year’s list of most powerful women leaders—many of whom I personally respect and admire. There are so many talented female executives throughout Johnson & Johnson and beyond our corporate walls who make a significant impact every day in the work they do. For me, it’s inspiring.This is a wonderful reflection of the great work our organization does, and it energizes me to strive to make an even greater difference for patients. Q: Did you always have your sights set on being an influential force in the healthcare world? A: I always loved science and medicine, particularly the way medicine works throughout the body. I also lost my mom to lung cancer when I was in my early 20s. My sisters were younger and still at home, and I experienced firsthand the impact it had on families. So I always had a strong desire to work in healthcare, coupled with a passion to help people based on what I experienced in my own life. I never dreamed I would be given the opportunities I actually have been given. My dreams have grown incrementally, as I’ve gained more experience and had more opportunities to work for a number of terrific people throughout my career. \n“Part of the fun of working in healthcare is the next discovery is literally around the corner. Our work is never done, and that keeps it exciting.” \nQ: What are you proudest of having accomplished at Johnson & Johnson in the past year? \nA: I am really proud that, in the last year, we were able to help 15 million people throughout the Americas with our products because patients really are at the center of all that we do. One special product we were able to launch in the last 18 months is Darzalex®, for the treatment of multiple myeloma . It received two breakthrough therapy designations from the FDA, based on the significance of the innovation, coupled with the level of unmet medical need that there is for the treatment. \nWe developed, got FDA approval for, and launched Darzalex in truly record time to get it to the patients who need it. It was a real source of pride for us. Q: What drives you to do the work that you do? A: For me, it’s really aboutthe patients we are working very hard to help. We get to learn about their journeys, and I think their bravery and how they handle themselves in the face of a heartbreaking condition is truly remarkable. \nMentoring is something that is also really important to me. I’ve provided advice and guidance to some remarkable young women through the Fortune /U.S. State Department Global Women’s Mentoring Partnership . And even though I am mentoring them, I learn and get just as much out of it as they do. Q: What do you hope to still achieve? A: Part of the fun of working in healthcare and pharmaceuticals is that the next discovery is literally just around the corner. Our work is never done, and that keeps it exciting every day. In terms of the future, I really want to see us continue to make key partnerships throughout the healthcare system, so we can work together to better understand patient behavior and truly deliver better health outcomes. This way, we’re not just providing a pill or an injection; we’re providing comprehensive and integrated solutions to help people live longer, healthier and happier lives. Share this:",

      "text": "Why is Johnson & Johnson getting into startups? When you've run out of ideas, you buy someone else's. Save Andrew Harrer / Bloomberg via Getty \nEveryone knows Johnson & Johnson , the conglomerate behind Band-Aid, Tylenol and Johnson's Baby Shampoo. By comparison, very few folks outside the tech industry will have heard of Hax , a Shenzen-based startup incubator. Now, however, the pair are hooking up to find, develop and invest in startups that want to develop a consumer healthcare device. If you're dreaming up a gadget that'll help keep babies safe, ease period pain or seal wounds faster, then applications are due before the end of the year. \nThe program is broken down into a variety of segments that match Johnson & Johnson's actual consumer healthcare business. Startups are encouraged to join a track if they're working on a skincare, baby care, wound care, oral care or feminine care product. Winners will be offered space at Hax's Shenzen HQ and support with prototyping, sourcing, supply chain, marketing, PR and everything in between. \nHax has previous when it comes to turning weird and wacky ideas into products that people may actually want to buy. For instance, it's the accelerator behind the Electroloom t-shirt maker , Bartesian cocktail robot and Prynt iPhone case printer . It's also done plenty of work with health tech startups, including the Darma smart cushion , Focus headset and the Melon EEG headband . \nIt's not the first time we've seen this happen; in November, chemicals giant Reckitt Benckiser teamed up with Indiegogo to the same end. On the surface, it looks like marketing fluff: A big company teaming up with startups to find the next big thing. But these companies spend billions on R&D, so it's unlikely that they'd need some kid, fresh out of high school, would they? According to Johnson & Johnson's financials, all of that research cash is coming to nought, and it's hurting its bottom line. \nJohnson & Johnson's over the counter business, which covers baby shampoo, toothpaste, skin creams et cetera, is losing sales. In fact, most of its divisions have been reporting negative growth since late 2014, and there's plenty of doom and gloom. The obvious reason for this is because most of the good ideas have already been used up, and you can't improve Tylenol much beyond how it is right now. Not to mention, of course, that it's hard to justify spending dollars on a box of Band-Aids when you can grab an off-brand version for cents. \n\"Do you like spending $20 a month on brand-name razors? – 19 of those go to Roger Federer\" \n- - Michael Dubin, Dollar Shave Club pitch video. \nThen there's the fact that modern-day talents are less inclined to go work for a big company than before. When the creator of the Big Mac, Michael Delligatti, died, his obituaries noted that McDonalds never compensated him for his blockbuster idea. Throw in the cult of the entrepreneur and the easy access to cash via investors and crowdfunding and it's easy to see why folks go it alone rather than toiling away without credit in Johnson & Johnson's basement. The rewards are potentially much greater if you do it all yourself. \nFor all of Johnson & Johnson's research and development cash, it's clearly coming up empty for reasons to justify buying its products. So, instead, it's hoping that someone else has an idea that it's not yet thought of. Maybe, in the future, these firms will stop trying to develop their own products and just buy up whatever's looking to be the next hot new thing. ",

      "text": "Business Close \nA rendering of metallic debris caused by an improperly implanted hip, as shown in instructional material about the proper positioning of a hip socket, sent from DePuy to doctors. (2010 file photo provided by DePuy Orthopaedics via The New York Times) Johnson & Johnson questions fairness of hip implant trial, $1 billion verdict By Erica Teichert Reuters 2 hrs ago ( … ) \nA rendering of metallic debris caused by an improperly implanted hip, as shown in instructional material about the proper positioning of a hip socket, sent from DePuy to doctors. (2010 file photo provided by DePuy Orthopaedics via The New York Times) \nJohnson & Johnson will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of $1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its Pinnacle hip implant. \nAlthough legal experts think Johnson & Johnson faces an uphill battle, both they and investors believe the Texas jury's penalty, the largest product liability verdict so far this year, is unlikely to stand. \nIn the two-month trial, five separate people from California argued that design flaws in the metal-on-metal implant made by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics caused tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries. \nIt is the second large verdict against Johnson &Johnson in the Pinnacle implant litigation, which has been consolidated before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Kinkeade in Texas. In July, another jury awarded six Texas plaintiffs $500 million. Both cases were so-called bellwethers, intended to gauge the value of claims for more than 9,000 other pending implant cases. \nJohnson & Johnson said in a statement it was confident in its appeal prospects and would not settle. It also said it stood by the safety of its product. \nLast Thursday's verdict has had little impact on Johnson & Johnson stock. Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with ESquared Asset Management, said investors assume large health products companies will occasionally be sued and lose and that the costs are ultimately manageable. \nJohnson & Johnson said it will ask Kinkeade to reduce or throw out the jury award before appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. According to the company, the multi-plaintiff format stacked the deck against it by parading a series of victims in front of the jury and exaggerating the number of complaints about the implant. \nThe company won the first bellwether trial in a case involving a single plaintiff in 2014. The next is scheduled for September 2017, and Kinkeade has not decided how many plaintiffs will be involved in that trial. \nThese results \"perfectly illustrate the distortions and confusion inherent in multi-plaintiff trials and underscore the extent of the legal errors that have been repeated,\" said Johnson & Johnson defense lawyer John Beisner. \nBut several legal experts said such a challenge faced long odds. Lynn Baker, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted trial judges are normally given great leeway in managing their cases and multi-plaintiff trials were a long-established means of clearing dockets faster. \n\"I would not expect Johnson & Johnson to succeed on a claim that they were prejudiced by the multi-plaintiff bellwether format,\" she said. \nJohnson & Johnson also said the judge allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer.",

      "text": "Tweet Share The logo of healthcare company Johnson & Johnson is seen in front of an office building in Zug, Switzerland July 20, 2016. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/Files More By Erica Teichert (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of $1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its Pinnacle hip implant.

J&J also said the judge allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer. University of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias said an appeals court was unlikely to overturn the verdict on such grounds though. \"Unless there is clear prejudice on the part of the jury, you’ve got to defer to the factfinder,\" he said. But even without showing its trial was unfair, the professors said J&J's case was strong for having the $1 billion award reduced on the grounds that it is excessive. Kinkeade cut the $500 million July verdict to $151 million. Andrew Bradt, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has held punitive damages should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages. The $1.041 billion award was mainly punitive, with just $32 million in compensatory damages. Bradt said the final award could be even lower than $320 million, since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs' injuries rather than as a broader deterrent.

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – December 07, 2016 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE:( JNJ - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Wells Fargo ( NYSE:( WFC - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Wal-Mart ( NYSE:( WMT - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Kimberly-Clark ( NYSE:( KMB - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and NIKE ( NYSE:( NKE - Free Report ) – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog: Top Research Reports for Today Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Johnson & Johnson ( NYSE:( JNJ - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Wells Fargo ( NYSE:( WFC - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and Wal-Mart ( NYSE:( WMT - Free Report ) – Free Report ). Johnson & Johnson shares have bucked the broader healthcare slump this year and are up almost 9% year-to-date. While the company is faced with a number of headwinds like unfavorable currency movements, increased competition from generics, pricing pressures and an uncertain global macroeconomic backdrop, the analyst believes that JNJ's diversified business model, deep product pipeline, lack of cyclicality and financial strength position it for continued momentum going forward. We saw this in the company's Q3 earnings report when it beat on the top- and bottom-lines and provided favorable outlook. The analyst expects these trends to continue in the coming periods as well. (You can read the full research report on Johnson & Johnson here. ) Wells Fargo has long maintained a reputation for disciplined and reliable operations and an attractive retail banking franchise. Recent quarterly results showing strong growth in loans and deposits reconfirm the bank's inherent strengths, but they have been totally offset lately by the sales practices controversy that has already cost the well regarded CEO his position. The new management team is making all the right moves and further downside risks in the stock may be low at this stage (the stock is down only 0.1% year to date vs. a roughly 14.6% gain for the peer banks), but it will likely take a while for clouds to fully lifted. (You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here . ) Wal-Mart ’s shares have surpassed those of other supermarkets, gaining more than 14% year-to-date. Though the company is facing a number of headwinds, estimates and share price of Wal-Mart has been rising since the company reported its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Wal-Mart posted positive earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter, but top-line marginally fell short of expectations after surpassing the same in the preceding two quarters, possibly due to deflationary pressure hurting comparable store sales. Nevertheless, the analyst likes Wal-Mart’s focus on building its e-commerce capabilities, forays into new markets, expanding product assortments and implementation of innovative ways to drive traffic. (You can read the full research report on Wal-Mart here . ) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Kimberly-Clark ( NYSE:( KMB - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and NIKE ( NYSE:( NKE - Free Report ) – Free Report ).

      "title": "Johnson & Johnson Must Pay $1 Billion over Faulty Hip Implants",
      "text": "Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and its subsidiary DePuy has been ordered by a federal jury in Dallas to pay more than $1 billion to settle allegations that the company hid flaws in its Pinnacle hip implants that had to be surgically removed. [1]\nSource: CNN The jury concluded that DePuy, the maker of the artificial hips, knew the devices were defective, but failed to warn doctors and patients that the implants could fail. The verdict includes more than $30 million in actual damages for the 6 plaintiffs and more than $1 billion in punitive damages, court filings show. [2]\nIt is likely that the $1 billion award will be reduced . In July, the judge presiding over this case reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas law that limits punitive damages awards.\nThe 6 individuals involved in the case allege they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal (MoM) Pinnacle implants. Each of the patients had to undergo revision surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least 1 patient had received double implants. [1]\nThe lead attorney in the case said:\n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice.\nThis jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.”\nMetal-on-Metal Hip Implants: A Timeline Source: Daily Mail Prior to 1976, the FDA had no control over medical devices. However, thanks to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that changes, and the agency gains full authority over metal-on-metal hip implants. [3]\nSince the devices were marketed prior to the passage of the act, MoM hips are classified as “high-risk” (Class III). Despite the classification – and despite concerns over potential metal ion toxicity even before 1976 – the FDA still allows medical device makers to employ the 510(k) “fast-track” regulatory process for the implants.\nOver the years, many changes are made to the design of metal-on-metal hip implants. One of those major changes occurs in 2004, and is quickly approved using the FDA’s 510(k) expedited approval system. Studies later reveal that this design change contributed to high rates of failure, metal ion debris, and increased wear. \nArtificial hips were designed to last about 15 years. However, in 2010, DePuy recalled 2 of its hip implants – the ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System – after data from the National Joint Registry in England and Wales revealed that 12-13% of patients needed additional surgery within the first 5 years. \nIn 2009, Japanese surgeons contacted DePuy Orthopedics to express concern over health risks associated with the device. The hip system, as it turned out, had a flawed design which caused it to generate metal debris (metal ions) and cause tissue to necrotize.\nBy January 2013, there were more than 3,000 hip replacement lawsuits pending against DePuy over bodily harm allegedly caused by the Pinnacle device. That same year, the subsidiary stopped selling the metal-on-metal hips after the FDA strengthened its artificial hip regulations. [3] [2]\nAs of the end of 2016, J&J and DePuy have been slammed with more than 8,400 lawsuits over the device.\nMetallosis Metallosis is a fancy word for metal poisoning . It occurs when microscopic metal particles are shed by devices like hip and knee implants into the blood stream and surrounding tissues. These particles – made up of a blend of different metals including chromium, cobalt, nickel, titanium and molybdenum – can cause toxic levels of metal to build up in the body. [4]\nRead: 6 Foods for Natural Heavy Metal Chelation \nMetallosis commonly causes:\nCardiomyopathy (heart problems), including heart failure Psychological status change (depression, anxiety and other mental problems) Visual impairment that may lead to blindness Cognitive impairment Nerve problems Thyroid problems Auditory impairment that may lead to deafness Skin rashes Noise coming from the hip Infection Implant loosening Sources:\n[1] CNN \n[2] Reuters \n[3] Parker Waichman LLP \n[4] Drugwatch \nCNN \n\nDaily Mail \n",

      "title": "Better Buy: Johnson & Johnson vs. Eli Lilly",
      "text": "Just ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) announced the third late-stage clinical failure for its Alzheimer's disease candidate. The stock had given up some ground this year, and following the flop, it's down about 20% in 2016. Meanwhile, it's hardly been a banner year for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) , but its stock is up about 10.2% this year.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nAlthough the drug's success seemed highly unlikely, the market has since cleaved around $10 billion from Eli Lilly's market cap, and the market thumping has driven the big pharma's dividend yield higher than Johnson & Johnson's. Let's have a closer look at both companies to see which is better positioned to reward investors over the long term.\nArguments for Johnson & Johnson J&J has a leading medical-device presence and a consumer-goods segment stuffed with iconic brands, so its prescription-drug sales made up less than half of its total revenue during first nine months of the year. This diversification provides a great deal of stability, but it has also limited growth lately. In the first nine months of the year, medical-device and consumer sales grew slightly on an operational basis, but unfavorable currency fluctuations led to revenue contractions in both segments.\nFortunately for J&J, 8% growth in pharmaceutical sales pulled total revenue 2.9% higher during the first nine months over the prior-year period. Branded drugs enjoy wider profit margins, which helped the bottom line grow by a slightly more encouraging 4.4% over the same time frame.\nAlthough prescription drugs aren't J&J's largest segment by revenue, the company's research and development budget outshined every drugmaker on the planet except Roche last year. Its efforts have been well rewarded. In the third quarter, year-on-year sales of seven branded drugs in its lineup grew by more than 10%. Leading the charge was Imbruvica, which bounded forward 89.7% to an annualized run rate of $3.4 billion. Earlier this year, it became the first chemotherapy-free treatment option for newly diagnosed patients with the most common form of leukemia, and several late-stage trials under way could expand its use even further.\nJohnson & Johnson chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky. Image source: Johnson & Johnson.\nWhile J&J's share of annual Imbruvica sales rolls toward peak estimates north of $7 billion, a handful of candidates coming through the pipeline could keep things moving. For example, sirukumab, developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline , significantly reduced pain and joint damage for rheumatoid-arthritis patients who don't respond well to existing treatments. In September, the partners submitted applications to U.S. and EU regulators just before manufacturing concerns upended the FDA's review of a potential competitor from Regeneron and Sanofi, called sarilumab. Further out, 28 late-stage studies under way should produce a steady stream of drug applications and new revenue streams.\nArguments for Eli Lilly & Co. While the market has pounded Lilly's stock following the third late-stage trial failure of its troubled Alzheimer's disease candidate, solanezumab, investors should be much more concerned with its aging product lineup. The main U.S. patent for its largest revenue stream, Humalog, expired years ago. The next two in line, Cialis and Alimta, face exclusivity losses in major markets next year. Combined, these three products accounted for about 35% of the $5.19 billion in total third-quarter sales.\nWith a bit of luck, a trio of recently launched drugs might be able to stem losses from its current leading products. Lilly's next-generation type-2 diabetes products, Trulicity and Jardiance, look promising, as does psoriasis treatment Taltz. Trulicity beat out Novo Nordisk 's Victoza again for a spot on its preferred formulary, and Jardiance is the first of its class to prove it can significantly reduce patients' risk of heart attack and stroke. Taltz is expected to generate more than $5 billion in peak annual sales. One in 10 U.S. adults has diabetes now, and its prevalence is rising quickly, which suggests that annual sales of Trulicity and Jardiance could climb to several billion dollars each.\nImage source: Eli Lilly & Co.\nLilly's late-stage development pipeline isn't as robust as J&J's, but given the company's total trailing-12-month revenue of just $20.8 billion, expanding the top line isn't as much of a challenge, either. In the long run, five phase 3 trials with new entities, plus 10 studies that could expand the use of commercial-stage drugs, might be enough to return the pharma's top line to a peak reached in 2012.\nRunning the numbers Following its Alzheimer's meltdown, Eli Lilly shares have fallen to about 18.9 times this year's earnings estimates. That's pricier than J&J's stock, which is trading at about 16.8 times its 2016 earnings forecast.\nIn return for a higher price, Lilly shares offer a larger dividend of about 3.1% versus just 2.8% for J&J's stock. But after only two consecutive annual increases, Lilly's dividend track record doesn't hold a candle to J&J's 54-year streak.\nIf your main concern is safety and stability, Johnson & Johnson stock is well worth the extra expense. If you're willing to accept some risk, though, Eli Lilly looks like the better stock to buy right now.\n10 stocks we like better than Eli Lilly and Co.\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "title": "Johnson & Johnson Must Pay $1 Billion over Faulty Hip Implants",
      "text": "(Before It's News)\nNatural Society\nJohnson & Johnson (J&J) and its subsidiary DePuy has been ordered by a federal jury in Dallas to pay more than $1 billion to settle allegations that the company hid flaws in its Pinnacle hip implants that had to be surgically removed. [1]\nSource: CNN The jury concluded that DePuy, the maker of the artificial hips, knew the devices were defective, but failed to warn doctors and patients that the implants could fail. The verdict includes more than $30 million in actual damages for the 6 plaintiffs and more than $1 billion in punitive damages, court filings show. [2]\nIt is likely that the $1 billion award will be reduced . In July, the judge presiding over this case reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas law that limits punitive damages awards.\nThe 6 individuals involved in the case allege they suffered “serious medical complications caused by defective” metal-on-metal (MoM) Pinnacle implants. Each of the patients had to undergo revision surgery to replace the devices and repair tissue damage and bone erosion. At least 1 patient had received double implants. [1]\nThe lead attorney in the case said:\n“Once again, a jury has listened to the testimony of both sides, and returned a verdict affirming what we’ve known all along: a responsible company would settle these cases and take care of their injured consumers, rather than forcing them through expensive and vexatious litigation just to delay justice.\nThis jury spoke loud and clear, and I hope J&J will finally listen.”\nMetal-on-Metal Hip Implants: A Timeline\nSource: Daily Mail\nPrior to 1976, the FDA had no control over medical devices. However, thanks to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, that changes, and the agency gains full authority over metal-on-metal hip implants. [3]\nSince the devices were marketed prior to the passage of the act, MoM hips are classified as “high-risk” (Class III). Despite the classification – and despite concerns over potential metal ion toxicity even before 1976 – the FDA still allows medical device makers to employ the 510(k) “fast-track” regulatory process for the implants.\nOver the years, many changes are made to the design of metal-on-metal hip implants. One of those major changes occurs in 2004, and is quickly approved using the FDA’s 510(k) expedited approval system. Studies later reveal that this design change contributed to high rates of failure, metal ion debris, and increased wear.\nArtificial hips were designed to last about 15 years. However, in 2010, DePuy recalled 2 of its hip implants – the ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System – after data from the National Joint Registry in England and Wales revealed that 12-13% of patients needed additional surgery within the first 5 years.\nIn 2009, Japanese surgeons contacted DePuy Orthopedics to express concern over health risks associated with the device. The hip system, as it turned out, had a flawed design which caused it to generate metal debris (metal ions) and cause tissue to necrotize.\nBy January 2013, there were more than 3,000 hip replacement lawsuits pending against DePuy over bodily harm allegedly caused by the Pinnacle device. That same year, the subsidiary stopped selling the metal-on-metal hips after the FDA strengthened its artificial hip regulations. [3] [2]\nAs of the end of 2016, J&J and DePuy have been slammed with more than 8,400 lawsuits over the device.\nMetallosis\nMetallosis is a fancy word for metal poisoning . It occurs when microscopic metal particles are shed by devices like hip and knee implants into the blood stream and surrounding tissues. These particles – made up of a blend of different metals including chromium, cobalt, nickel, titanium and molybdenum – can cause toxic levels of metal to build up in the body.
