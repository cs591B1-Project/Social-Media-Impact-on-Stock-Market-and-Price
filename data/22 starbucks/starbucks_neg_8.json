      "text": "Starbucks' Giant Classic Mug Holds 138 Ounces of Coffee By: Katherine Pendrill   store.starbucks & brandeating This holiday season, it seems that Starbucks is sticking to the motto 'bigger is better' with the debut of its Giant Classic Mug. While the company describes the cup as being intended for \"decorative purposes only,\" the mug could be the perfect accessory for those who refuse to order anything smaller than a venti. Just as the name suggests, the Giant Classic Mug is an extra-large coffee cup capable of holding 138 ounces of rich, caffeinated goodness. This translates into roughly the size of eight grande coffees, which clock in at 16 ounces each. While those numbers may sound outrageous, this new mug is not the biggest cup that Starbucks has sold. In fact, the brand's Big Logo Mug held a whopping 640 ounces of liquid, making it the ultimate novelty gift for coffee fans.",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – A man caught on camera unleashing a nasty tirade on a Starbucks employee said he did it because it took too long for her to make his coffee.\nIt happened Wednesday at coffee chain’s storefront near the University of Miami. \nPart of the exchange between David Sanguesa and employees at the restaurant was caught on cell phone video.\nAt one point, Sanguesa demands to know the woman’s name and calls her “garbage” and “trash”. Another man behind the counter intervened, telling Sanguesa that he can’t talk to her like that. The two then got into an argument until Sanguesa stormed out of the restaurant in disgust. \nSanguesa claims the woman deliberately took a long time to make his order because he is white and voted for Donald Trump. \n“I was not served coffee and they said names, and I was called names from college kids, horrible names and I got upset, and I was wrong for getting upset but I didn’t deserve that discrimination or racism because of who I voted for,” said Sanguesa.\nIn response to the cell phone video, which was posted online, Starbucks issued the following statement. \n“Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.” ",

Nike, Starbucks, and Gap Urge Trump to Stay in the Paris Climate Deal \nMore than 360 businesses and investors called on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and world leaders on Wednesday to continue to support agreed curbs on global warming and to speed up efforts to move to a low-carbon economy. \nIn a statement addressed to Trump , U.S. President Barack Obama, members of the U.S. Congress and global leaders, the group, called 360+, reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change. \nThe 360+ group includes companies such as DuPont dd , Gap gps , General Mills gis , Hewlett Packard hpq , Hilton hlt , Kellogg k , Levi Strauss & Co., L’Oreal USA, Nike nke , Mars Incorporated mars , Schneider Electric sbgsy , Starbucks and Unilever ul . \nThe Paris Agreement, aiming to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions this century, came into force on Nov. 4 and now has backing from 110 nations including the United States. \nThe Nov. 7-18 meeting in Marrakesh is where U.N. officials and government representatives are trying to work out the details of the pact. However, Trump ‘s victory in the U.S. election last week has overshadowed the event. \nTrump has threatened to tear up the U.S. commitment to the accord. \nThe 360+ group called on U.S. leaders to continue to participate in the Paris Agreement, support the continuation of U.S. commitments on climate change and continue to invest in low-carbon solutions at home and abroad. \n“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,” the group said, in the statement presented at U.N. climate talks being held this week in Marrakesh, Morocco. \n“Implementing the Paris Climate Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy prosperity to all,” the group added.

      "text": "Starbucks' Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew is new this holiday season and features cold brew coffee mixed with cinnamon, anise, nutmeg, and vanilla flavors (a combination mulling spice syrup and vanilla syrup) and topped with a splash of house-made sweet cream.\n\nI picked up a 31-oz Trenta for $3.95 (mostly because a 12-oz Tall was already $3.25 so for 70 cents more...).\n\nWhile it might be too cold in more wintry areas, a holiday-themed iced drink works out quite well in the fall and winter here in Los Angeles.\n\nThis is basically Starbucks' Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew but with the addition of mulling spice syrup. You get the same smooth coffee flavor tinged with a lightly sweet creaminess plus a familiar dose of holiday spices. It's like pumpkin spice but without the pumpkin and maybe a third of the sweetness.\n\nStarbucks Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew is ideal for those who want the familiar holiday/pumpkin spices but find other Starbucks holiday drinks too sweet (or calorie-laden). I enjoyed it very much.\n\nNutritional Info - Starbucks Spiced Sweet Cream Cold Brew (16 fl oz) \nCalories - 120 (from Fat - 50) \nFat - 6g (Saturated Fat - 3.5g) \nSodium - 25mg \nCarbs - 16g (Sugars - 16g) \nProtein - 1g \nCaffeine - 185mg Read more at Brand Eating !

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – A man caught on camera unleashing a nasty tirade on a Starbucks employee said he did it because it took too long for her to make his coffee. \nIt happened Wednesday at coffee chain’s storefront near the University of Miami. \nPart of the exchange between David Sanguesa and employees in the crowded restaurant was caught on cell phone video. \nAt one point, Sanguesa calls the woman “garbage” and “trash”. He then tells her that he voted for Donald Trump to which she replies “so what.” He then demands his money back and is given it. \nA man behind the counter tries to intervene, telling Sanguesa that he can’t talk to people like that. The two then got into an argument until Sanguesa stormed out of the restaurant in disgust. \nSanguesa claims the woman deliberately took a long time to make his order because he is white and voted for Trump. \n“I was not served coffee and they said names, and I was called names from college kids, horrible names and I got upset, and I was wrong for getting upset but I didn’t deserve that discrimination or racism because of who I voted for,” said Sanguesa. \nSanguesa did not say why he thought his race or voting choice offended the woman. On the cell phone video, you don’t hear anyone call Sanguesa names. \nIn response to the cell phone video, which was posted online, Starbucks issued the following statement. \n“Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.”",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images A heated confrontation between a Starbucks customer and several employees is drawing national attention – and showing the continuing tension across the country since the election of Donald Trump. The viral video taken from the location across from the University of Miami campus on U.S. 1 in Coral Gables shows David Sanguesa arguing with a barista behind the counter, calling her “trash” and saying “Trump, Trump. You lost” while demanding his money back before again calling her “garbage” and “plain trash” Anti-Trump Protest Scheduled on University of Miami Campus A different employee confronted Sanguesa, who claimed he was discriminated against because he is white and had a Trump sign on his car. The second employee repeatedly asked Sanguesa not to talk to her like that, after which the two exchanged more heated words and Sanguesa threatened to “punch out” the barista before walking out. NBC 6 reached out to Starbucks’ corporate offices for a comment. They send back the following statement: “Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing.

      "text": "Time To Start Buying iShares Philippines (Seeking Alpha) \nOn Thursday, the Vetr crowd downgraded its rating of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) from 4.5 stars (strong buy) to 4 stars (buy). Interest in the stock is still high as 90 percent of Vetr crowd's ratings are bullish. \nThe downgrade comes after some recent tension between the coffee chain and supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. Several news stories and video clips have surfaced showing Trump supports confronting employees. \nPrior to that, Starbucks fell short of sales and earnings expectations, especially following the introduction of its rewards program. However, shares have been on the rise in recent weeks, gaining 3.97 percent since November 10 to hit $55.90 today. \nThe Vetr crowd's target price for the stock has increased slightly to $61.81, still shy of the average analyst target price of $64.53. More than 2 percent of Vetr users are holding Starbucks in their watchlist. Latest Ratings for SBUX",

Restraining orders were issued in all three cases.\nThe incident, which happened at 4:30 pm yesterday, features Sanguesa berating a black female cashier before threatening to fight a patron who confronted him for being an asshole.\n“You’re trash,” he said to the cashier. “Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jbdcl (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\nJorge de Cárdenas, the man who captured the tirade on video, said the man claimed he was the victim of “anti-white discrimination” because he and his female friend had to wait too long for their order. “He started disparaging the staff,” Cárdenas told the Miami New Times . “One patron called him an asshole, so he said, ‘Fuck you, bitch.’ That’s when I started filming.”\nIf you aren’t completely enamored with this douchenozzle yet, please let me provide you with another tidbit about his character. The Miami Herald reported today that Sanguesa has been sending that newspaper racist, sexist letters for years.\nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. “I hate Cubans…. all pieces of shit… including Jose Fernandez.\nAll that racist, entitled bullshit I guess I’ll put behind me. But there’s something about that face.

      "text": "11/17/2016 4:00 PM ET | Filed under: Politik • Donald Trump • Business Blitz • Twitter • Crazzzzy • Viral: News • Controversy \nDonald Trump has promised to make America great again — and for one supporter, that apparently means a much shorter wait time for coffee. \nA man was recorded berating a female employee at a Starbucks near the University of Miami, repeatedly yelling \"Trump\" in her face. \nVideo: Jon Stewart On The ONE Question No One Asked Trump! \nEye witness Jorge de Cárdenas posted the video to Twitter on Wednesday, showing the sweater-vest wearing Trump supporter asking the cashier for his money back. \nThe man reportedly complained that the employees were taking too long for his order, and blamed \"anti-white discrimination\" on his unbearable wait time. \nAfter asking for a refund, the bitter patron went on a pointed tirade against the female employee, barking: \n\"You're trash… I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You're garbage. You're complete trash.\" \nHe then asked for the worker's name so he could report her to corporate. \nThe incident escalated when another customer defended the employee, telling the cranky Trump supporter to \"take it outside.\" \nDe Cárdenas told the Miami New Times he thought the two men \"almost came to blows,\" recalling: \n\"He said it was 'anti-white discrimination,' so he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said, 'F*ck you, b*tch.' That's when I started filming.\" \nYikes. Tensions sure are high in this post-election political climate — especially when you're an under-caffeinated d*ckhead. \nCh-ch-check out footage of the incident (below) to see things get heated. \n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy",

      "text": "Trump Supporter Claims “White Discrimination” While Losing It on Starbucks Worker No word yet on whether the man was ordering a pumpkin spice latte. Jack Buehrer Image via Flickr/Gage Skidmore, Sandra Rodrigo \nThe good vibes just keep on coming in post-Trump America. The Miami New Times reports that an enraged customer at an area Starbucks screamed at a black employee for taking too long with his order. After shouting the word \"Trump!\" at the worker, the man claimed he was a victim of what he called \"white discrimination.\" \nJorge de Cárdenas, another customer at the South Dixie Highway coffee shop, told the New Times that he started filming the altercation on his phone after patrons began jumping in to defend the employee. \n\"He said it was 'anti-white discrimination,'\" Cárdenas said of the sweater vest-wearing Trump supporter. \"So he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said, 'Fuck you, bitch.' That's when I started filming.\" \n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy — jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nThe two-minute video, which has since been shared over 2,500 times on Twitter, shows the white, middle-aged man announcing to the black female employee that he \"voted for Trump,\" before repeating the President-elect's name. He then calls the employee \"garbage\" and \"complete trash\" before getting into a verbal altercation with yet another customer. \n\"There's no need to talk like that,\" the customer says in the video. \"You want to talk like that, take it outside. But do not talk to other people that way.\" Ultimately, the Trump supporter storms out of the store, shouting \"Ridiculous!\" as his blond, shoulder-length hair flutter in the wind. \nSince Election Day, the Southern Poverty Law Center has recorded some 400 instances of harassment and hate in the U.S. And though the incident at Starbucks luckily didn't turn to violence, the restaurant industry hasn't been immune to these instances of racism and misogyny. Last week, a Trump supporter allegedly called a TGI Friday's server the N-word on a receipt , and over the weekend a female Hillary Clinton supporter was punched in the face by a man at a restaurant in Brooklyn . \nGiven the fact that the Republican candidate won the election, what are Trump supporters still so upset about? \n\"The funny thing, besides just the concept of 'anti-white discrimination,' is just yelling 'Trump!' for no reason,\" Cárdenas said. \" Like, dude, you won.\"",

Jorge de Cárdenas posted the video to his Twitter account Wednesday afternoon, stating “#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination.” In the video the sweater-vested man can be heard asking for his money back and yelling, “You’re trash,” to the female barista. “Cause I voted for Trump.

      "text": "Trump Voter Blasts “White Discrimination” at Starbucks Posted by : Macy Kain   \nFor the record, the following individual does not necessarily represent ALL Donald Trump supporters. \nBut he may very well be a solid representation of Florida Man in general. \nAround 4:30 on Wednesday afternoon, the patrons at a Starbucks location near the University of Miami were sitting back and relaxing, sipping on what we have to presume were quite a few Pumpkin Spiced Lattes. \nBut their calm coffee experience was interrupted by a disgruntled customer who was simply aghast over how long it was taking for the barista to fulfill his order. \nThe barista was African-American, which would typically be an irrelevant detail. \nExcept this unhappy shopper started to scream “TRUMP” at the employee, claiming that the delay on his order was due to “anti-white discrimination” and threatening to punch those around him. \nHe also referred to another employee as “complete trash,” another as a “bitch” and demanded a refund. \n“I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back,” the man yelled. \nWhat happened when a fellow patron tried to calm the Trump voter down? \nDid the two men come to blow? And also: What the heck is wrong with people?!? \nWATCH THE ENTIRE UGLY SITUATION UNFOLD NOW: \nRead more here:: THG \n\nMacy Kain is a lover of television.

      "text": "Twitter Composite\n\nA video of a Michael Bolton clone going haywire on a Starbucks employee near the University of Miami by screaming “Trump!” after he said it took to long for his order is going viral today.\nThe man has been identified as David Sanguesa, a Miami real-estate developer who, according to Miami New Times , has been sued by at least three women for either domestic or repeat violence in Miami-Dade County court. Restraining orders were issued in all three cases.\nThe incident, which happened at 4:30 pm yesterday, features Sanguesa berating a black female cashier before threatening to fight a patron who confronted him for being an asshole.\n“You’re trash,” he said to the cashier. “Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jbdcl (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\nJorge de Cárdenas, the man who captured the tirade on video, said the man claimed he was the victim of “anti-white discrimination” because he and his female friend had to wait too long for their order. “He started disparaging the staff,” Cárdenas told the Miami New Times . “One patron called him an asshole, so he said, ‘Fuck you, bitch.’ That’s when I started filming.”\nIf you aren’t completely enamored with this douchenozzle yet, please let me provide you with another tidbit about his character. The Miami Herald reported today that Sanguesa has been sending that newspaper racist, sexist letters for years.\nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. “I hate Cubans…. all pieces of shit… including Jose Fernandez.\nAll that racist, entitled bullshit I guess I’ll put behind me. But there’s something about that face. If you don’t change it, David, I’m going to change it for you.\nFlorida Trump voter who had viral meltdown at Starbucks says he has mental illness and was off his meds https://t.co/R9s0oqLSoP pic.twitter.com/8DD2gFz2E9 \n— Billy Corben (@BillyCorben) November 17, 2016 \n\nGrown up Beans from Even Stevens or nah?\nTwitter\n\n[h/t Death and Taxes ]\n",

      "text": "  FoxNews.com   livefyre Email Print  (Reuters File Photo) \nA customer at a Miami Starbucks was filmed yelling at a female employee behind the counter after his coffee order was reportedly delayed.\nJorge de Cárdenas was working at a coffee shop location near the University of Miami around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday when he says a man became disgruntled while waiting for his beverage at the pickup counter, reports Miami New Times. \n\"He said it was 'anti-white discrimination,'\" Cárdenas says, \"so he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said, 'Fuck you, bitch.' That's when I started filming.\"\nMEXICAN BEER INDUSTRY ALREADY FEELING THE EFFECTS OF TRUMP'S PROPOSED POLICIES \nCárdenas claims the man called the employee, who appears to be African-American, “trash” before he began filming the altercation.\nIn the clip, the man shouts, \"I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back.”\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\n“Congratulations,” the employee can be heard saying off-camera in a slightly sarcastic tone.\nThe man then demands to know the employee’s name.\n\"What is your name?\" he asked. \"What is your name? I want your card. You are garbage. You are complete trash.\"\nAs the man continues to yell at the employee, another customer can be heard trying to step in.\n“You do not talk to other people that way,” the customer says before adding, \"There's no need to talk like that. You want to talk like that, take it outside. But do not talk to other people that way.\"\nSTARBUCKS RAISES COFFEE PRICES AGAIN  \nCárdenas, who follows the altercation until the man walks out of the Starbucks with a blonde companion, says the two male customers “almost came to blows.” He was shocked at how quickly the situation escalated.\n\"The funny thing, besides just the concept of 'anti-white discrimination,' is just yelling 'Trump!' for no reason,\" Cárdenas says. \"Like, dude, you won.\"\nA representative for Starbucks was not immediately available for comment.",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe Donald Trump voter seen berating a Starbucks worker in a new viral video is a Miami home builder who has repeatedly been accused of violence against women and was arrested in 2014 for allegedly threatening to kill his wife, records show. \nDavid Sanguesa, 53, is seen on the video calling the female employee “trash” and declaring, “‘Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.” \nSanguesa claims that Starbucks workers refused to give him the coffee he paid for because they had somehow divined he was a Trump supporter. Sanguesa, whose truck has a Trump sign attached to its tailgate, contends that he was the victim of “racism” and “discrimination” at the hands of the Starbucks workers. \nThe patron who filmed Sanguesa’s antics (which can be viewed below) contends that he became upset because his order was taking too long. \nAccording to court records, three women have filed court petitions accusing Sanguesa of domestic violence or repeat violence, actions that resulted in the issuance of injunctions against Sanguesa and his enrollment in a court-ordered treatment program. \nIn February 2014, Sanguesa was arrested following a confrontation with his wife in their South Miami home. Sanguesa’s spouse told cops that during an argument he threatened to kill her. The woman charged that when she tried to dial 911, Sanguesa grabbed the phone from her, “causing a scratch” on her forearm. Sanguesa’s wife said she was carrying the couple’s 14-month-old son when Sanguesa took the phone from her. \nSanguesa (seen in the above mug shot) fled the residence before police arrived, but was arrested three days later. He was charged with misdemeanor battery and tampering with a witness, a felony. Sanguesa was later released from custody on $5000 bond and a judge ordered him to stay away from his wife. Prosecutors subsequently declined to pursue the charges against Sanguesa, whose rap sheet includes a pair of drunk driving busts. \nSanguesa, who graduated from Texas A&M with a psychology degree, relocated his construction/remodeling business from Houston to Miami in 2004. A 1996 Houston Business Journal story reported that Sanguesa was in charge of the construction of former President George H.W. Bush’s home in the city’s Tanglewood section. \nWhen not haranguing low-wage workers, Sanguesa is a triathlete who loves to “swim, travel, exercise, diving, boating and fishing,” according to his LinkedIn page. Sanguesa also reports that he volunteers at a Catholic church, where he reads epistles to congregants at a Sunday morning mass. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy",

      "text": "In News by Maggie Serota / November 17, 2016 Share < br />this article: \nMiami real estate developer David Sanguesa joins Luke “Mac and Cheese Asshole” Gatti and Zack “Go Cook My Fucking Burrito, Bitch!” Fisher in the pantheon of entitled white men who have starred in viral freakout videos. \nIf you somehow missed the video of Sanguesa screaming at a Starbucks employee , calling her “trash,” and screaming his allegiance to Donald Trump in the middle of a Coral Gables, Florida, Starbucks, then here’s the video taken by witness Jorge de Cárdenas: #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination” pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \nThe local ABC News affiliate caught up with Sanguesa in a more subdued moment. \n“She just refused to serve us,” Sanguesa told Local 10 News. “She did not want to serve us.” \nThe “us” he’s referring to is a broker he met at the shop, who happened to have a Trump sign on her truck. \nHe then admitted that he did apologize, but apparently, he’s not that sorry because he insisted that the barista’s slow service was “completely discrimination and, to me, racism because of our support for Donald Trump.” \nBeing racist against white Trump voters isn’t a thing, dude. \nAfter trying to pass the incident off on a missed dose of medication for an undisclosed mental illness, Sanguesa said that he got a call from Starbucks’ corporate office apologizing for the incident, which sounds like bullshit given his behavior in the video. A rep from Starbucks said they are investigating the incident. \nAccording to some information dug up by the Miami New Times , it looks as if Sanguesa might have a history of failing to control his anger. At least three women have sought restraining orders against him for domestic or repeat violence, although one of those cases was dropped. In 2014, he was charged with misdemeanor battery and “one felony count of tampering with a witness, victim, or informant.” The State Attorney’s Office didn’t follow through with the charges and the case is closed. \nThe Miami Herald is quite familiar with the 52-year-old, as he has been sending the paper disturbing racist, misogynist, and homophobic letters for years. \nIn one email sent this month he said Obama has caused 95 million people to lose their jobs by “pushing a sick, left wing agenda of not working… living off the government… trying to get rid of Jesus Christ, abortion, homosexuality, lesbians, transgender… Hollywood trash… we are Miami destroyed… by people who hate the USA.” \nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. “I hate Cubans…. all pieces of s—… including Jose Fernandez.” \nHe ended the email: “Viva Fidel Castro!! \nTrying to blame an employee for refusing to give him a latte because he’s a Trump supporter is kind of a reach because it’s Florida, a state Trump won in the 2016. Surely, the woman working the counter has seen plenty of Trump signs over the past year and change and wasn’t especially traumatized by some dude in a sweater vest voted Republican. \nBut yeah, maybe he’s a victim of racism. That’s entirely plausible.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nDavid Sanguesa said he was having a bad day. \nBut it seems Sanguesa has had many bad days. Wednesday was just the latest. That was the day he was captured on video angrily yelling “Trump!” and “I voted for Trump!” at a barista at a Coral Gables Starbucks when he felt he didn’t get his tall vanilla latte quickly enough because he is white. Then he demanded his money back, calling her “trash” and “garbage.” \nPrevious bad days: the one in 2008 when he was arrested on a DUI charge. The one a week later when he was again charged with DUI. And the day in 2014 in when he was charged with domestic violence, which was later dropped. And there were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \nSanguesa, 53, was identified Thursday after the video went viral. He told the Miami Herald he had apologized to Starbucks — then did a quick turnaround threatening to sue the company for discrimination and causing him to lose business. \n“I had a bad day. I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized,” Sanguesa said Thursday morning. \nIn a second interview with the Herald, he added: “My attorneys want to file a lawsuit. No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against. \n“She wouldn’t serve me,” he said. “She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn’t give me my coffee.” \nOn Thursday Starbucks said in a statement that the company embraced “diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing.” \nSanguesa mentioned that he suffers from a mental illness he didn’t name, though he did not blame that for his outburst. He said something similar to WPLG Local 10, telling the station that he had not taken his medication Wednesday. \nSanguesa, a regular at the Coral Gables Starbucks on South Dixie Highway for over a decade, is well known to South Miami police, who said they have been to his home several times, once arresting him for a domestic dispute in 2014. The case was later dropped. \nOver the years he’s sent several reporters at the Herald angry emails often directed at Obama, women and Cuban Americans. \nIn one email sent this month he said Obama has caused 95 million people to lose their jobs by “pushing a sick, left wing agenda of not working... living off the government... trying to get rid of Jesus Christ, abortion, homosexuality, lesbians, transgender... Hollywood trash... we are Miami destroyed... by people who hate the USA.” \nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. “I hate Cubans.... all pieces of s---... including Jose Fernandez.” \nHe ended the email: “Viva Fidel Castro!!” Related content",

The 23-year-old beauty wore a small t-shirt that slightly exposed her midriff and a pair of distressed blue jeans. \nSome might call her a poor man’s Kate Upton, but Charlotte is making quite a name for herself in Hollywood as she’s currently working on two films set for release in 2017. Charlotte’s latest film “The Late Bloomer,” in which she’s credited as “Attractive Woman,” hit theaters earlier this month.

      "text": "November 17, 2016 5:46 PM ‘Tis the season for Christians’ holiday cup anger at Starbucks This year, Starbucks chose an all-women holiday cup design, with 13 women artists, six from foreign countries. Joseph Pisani AP i \nOh no, not the holiday Starbucks cups again. \nWith the election still a raw, open wound, Starbucks unveiled its new holiday cups. \nWe can’t handle this. \nLast year, Starbucks’ decision to have a plain red cup was met with derision by those who said it was too politically correct for choosing inclusive subtlety over an overt “Merry Christmas” message. \nDonald Trump, then a long-shot presidential candidate, shared this view. \n“If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you. That I can tell you,” Trump said last November. \nWell, you’re not going to believe this: Trump is president-elect. \nI don’t think those in charge of the holiday cups believed it would happen. \nI think they were imagining their cups would be unveiled after the election of Hillary Clinton as America’s first woman president. \nThis year, Starbucks chose an all-women holiday cup design, with 13 women artists, six from foreign countries. \nThe cups celebrate internationalism and women – losers in this election. \n“Merry Christmas” is not on the cups. Just red-and-white cups with reindeer, snowflakes and other generic holiday designs. \nThis might have been harmonious with a President-elect Clinton, but seems jarringly out of step with this new direction we seem to be on. \nIf Starbucks knew Trump was going to win, the cups would have been designed by 13 angry white guys from the Rust Belt. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks’ global chief marketing officer, said in a press release. \nWhat’s a shared spirit? Nothing we’ve had lately. \nStarbucks should have figured that out earlier this month when it unveiled a green cup featuring a mosaic of humanity, “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” company chairman Howard Schultz said. \nBut some took it as a slap at Christmas and subtle promotion of green as an Islamic color. \nTrump supporters on Twitter called the cup “political brainwashing” and part of the “war on Christmas.” \nThat was the cup that was supposed to unify us, to smooth things out before the holiday cup of all those foreign women artists. \nThe good news for Starbucks is there’s still time to fix this. The holiday season is just beginning. \nA new option should be added for those who want a cup designed by an American man – not one of those gay ones from the “elite” parts of the country, either. \nSure, it can have designs. But it’s gotta say “Merry Christmas.” And if you’re from some other faith, you can opt for a “Merry Christmas, Jews” cup or a “Merry Christmas, Muslims” choice. \nThat’s our only hope of getting through this holiday-cup season unscathed. \nThat I can tell you.",

      "text": "Starbucks , Nike and more than 360 other businesses and investors have called on President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders to remain committed to the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,\" the group said in a statement released and presented at United Nations climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Wednesday .\nOther signers include conglomerate Unilever, chemicals giant Dupont, and technology company Hewlett Packard.\nThe Paris treaty was signed by nearly 200 countries to try and restore greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels by the year 2100 . A major goal is to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\nA number of the world's largest companies are urging President-elect Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Backers of climate change action are concerned because there's good reason to expect that the United States might try and walk back its efforts to limit emissions in Trump's administration.\nThe president-elect has called climate change a \" hoax ,\" promised to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency , and appointed Myron Ebell — who has argued greenhouse gas emissions could actually be beneficial — to lead his EPA transition effort.\nEven Exxon Mobile, the oil and gas multinational that has had a fraught relationship with climate change activists in the past, backs the Paris agreement.\nSuzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, tweeted about the company's ongoing support of the treaty on Nov. 10, the morning after the election.\nThe Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange https://t.co/X7JubyyArv\nOf course, other countries in the agreement may fight back in the event that the U.S. tries to back out.\nFormer French President Nicholas Sarkozy — who will also likely be his center-right party's nominee for President — has floated the idea of imposing a tariff on U.S. imports to make up for reneging on the Paris agreement's financial commitments.\nThat would need to be approved by other countries in the EU for it to have the desired effect, although it would pack a punch — Europe is still the United States' biggest trading partner.\nThe clock is ticking: September 2016 was the hottest September in 136 years , as long as records have been kept.",

I already spoke with corporate office. Corporate office said I can have any drink I want with any name I want on it,” the man can be heard saying. “That’s the name I want to be heard and seen as.” \nHe then questions the barista as to whether he’s “refusing to do that.” The barista then replies, saying, “Yeah, we’re calling the cops.” \n“You can call the cops,” the man then says. \nA year ago, President-elect Donald Trump told a rally that “maybe we should boycott Starbucks.” Trump was referring to Starbucks taking “Merry Christmas” off its cups.

Apparently this man was upset because he wasn't served his coffee quickly enough. \nBut on Thursday, he claimed his meltdown was actually the result of a \"bad day,\" telling the Miami Herald : \n\"I had a bad day. I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized.\" \nWe all have bad days. That doesn't give him the right to yell at this poor woman and tell her she's \"garbage.\" \nBelieve it or not, the 53-year-old had even more douchebaggery up his sleeve. He told the Herald that he's SUING the Coral Gables coffee shop, saying: \n\"My attorneys want to file a lawsuit. No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against. She wouldn't serve me. She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn't give me my coffee.\" \nThe pissed patron also mentioned to the outlet that he suffers from a mental illness. However, he did not disclose the name of the condition. He did tell WPLG Local 10 that he hadn't taken his medication that day, but also clarified that his outburst wasn't related to his illness . \nThe Herald also revealed David has been charged with domestic violence, as well as multiple DUIs, in the past. \nAs for the coffee chain, they have since issued a statement on inclusion and discrimination after video of the meltdown went viral, saying: \n\"Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.\" \nWhatever his mental illness, we seriously hope he gets the help he needs and soon. Because it is not okay to go around acting like a human turd by treating others like that!",

      "text": "Angry White Man At Starbucks Hurls ‘TRUMP’ As A Racial Slur (TWEET/VIDEO) By R.L. Paine   Subscribe \nIn Presidential-elect Donald Trump’s great “again” America, white men are allowed to jump to the front of the line when ordering a coffee at Starbucks. At least that appears to be the fiction that some Trump supporters have created. \nAccording to patrons at a Starbucks near the University of Miami, one such dandy erupted with rage when his coffee was taking just too long. Image via Twitter screengrab \nWitnesses say the man began yelling “Trump!” at a black employee. He then claimed “anti-white discrimination” because, well, nothing screams discrimination like having to wait in line for coffee. \nHe went on to call another employee “garbage,” and then started threatening to punch a good Samaritan who stepped in. \nCustomer Jose Cardenas told the Miami New Times that the man : “Started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said, ‘Fuck you, bitch.’ That’s when I started filming.” \nHis film captured the enraged dandy spouting : “I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back.” \nCardenas added his own spot on commentary to the situation : “The funny thing, besides just the concept of ‘anti-white discrimination,’ is just yelling ‘Trump!’ for no reason. Like, dude, you won.” \nThankfully the incident ended without violence.

      "text": "Comment \nSometimes even the best agreements arising out of the world of business negotiations are liable to fail and such is the case with the dispute between food giants Starbucks and Kraft (now Kraft-Heinz). A three-year dispute between Starbucks and Kraft Foods over distribution of Starbucks packaged coffee in grocery stores was resolved when an arbitrator determined that Starbucks had breached its agreement with Kraft and ordered the coffeemaker to pay the food giant $2.75 billion, Stephanie Strom reported in The New York Times. \nThe dispute dates back to an agreement negotiated in 1998 when Kraft began selling Starbucks packaged coffee through grocery stores. In 2010, with sales of its ground whole bean coffee reaching $500 million annually, Starbucks offered Kraft $750 million to end their negotiated agreement. \nStarbucks wanted greater flexibility to sell the single-serve coffee pods that were taking off in the market at the time. The company’s agreement with Kraft limited Starbucks to selling pods that worked in Kraft’s Tassimo machines. Starbucks was in danger of being left behind in a race for market share against Green Mountain Coffee’s Keurig system and K-Cup single serving packs. \nKraft objected to the deal termination, but Starbucks broke off the business relationship nonetheless and began selling K-Cup packs. Discover step-by-step techniques for avoiding common business negotiation pitfalls when you download a copy of the FREE special report, Business Negotiation Strategies: How to Negotiate Better Business Deals , from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. \nAfterward, Starbucks’ share of the single-serving pod market has grew 18.4% according to Strom. And, no longer sharing profits with Kraft, Starbucks saw profits for its grocery store products (including bottled drinks) climb by 47% over two years, with $1.4 billion in revenues in fiscal 2013. \nThe parties’ disputes over Starbucks’ termination of their partnership moved to arbitration when the two sides were unable to settle on their own. The payment was made to Mondelez, a snack and confectionary business that spun off Kraft in 2012. \nStarbucks disagreed with the arbitrator’s decision. “We believe Kraft did not deliver on its responsibilities to our brand under the agreement,” the company said in a statement. \nRelationships and Business Negotiation : Adaptable Agreements for Changing Conditions \nThe business dispute illustrates how fluid the nature of marketplace trends can cause negotiated business agreements to become undesirable over time. In their original agreement, Kraft and Starbucks would have been wise to agree upon set times for renegotiation , during which they would have had leeway to revisit existing deal terms in the face of changed economic and industry conditions. \nThey could also have negotiated conditions for ending the agreement early, such as cancellation penalties and other forms of compensation. \nIn business negotiations , there is often little way of telling how an agreement will unfold over time. Smart negotiators anticipate this uncertainty – and the potential for a costly business dispute – and build mechanisms for coping with it into their deals.

NEW YORK – If President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink. \nIn an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama. \n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.” \nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco. \nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change. \nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions. \nBy Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN ",

(CBS Miami) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Friday, November 18, 2016, 2:39 AM \nA foul-mouthed Florida man accused a Starbucks barista of purposely not serving him because he's white and voted for Donald Trump, video shows. \nThe vest-wearing man in the video from Wednesday quickly went viral and was eventually identified as David Sanguesa of Miami. \nSanguesa can be seen in the bizarre video posted to Twitter pacing back and forth inside a Starbucks after a black female barista allegedly didn't get him his tall vanilla latte quickly enough. \n\"Just give me my money back; I want nothing to do with you,\" Sanguesa, 53, yells at the unnamed barista before claiming he wasn't served because he \"voted for Trump — Trump!\" \nWriter of hoax news stories says he helped get Trump elected \nThe angry coffee craver then started hurling insults at the mum barista, calling her \"trash\" and \"garbage,\" at which point a concerned customer stepped in. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n\"Don't talk to other people that way,\" the customer tells Sanguesa. \n\"Don't tell me what to do,\" Sanguesa fires back. \"She did discrimination of race.\" \nSanguesa did not return multiple requests for comment from the Daily News, but told the Miami Herald Thursday he had apologized to Starbucks for having \"a bad day.\" He also said he suffered from a mental illness and was off his meds when he raged inside the coffee shop. \nBut just hours later, Sanguesa flipped and told the Herald in a second interview that he was furious about having been \"refused service.\" Sanguesa calls the mum barista \"trash\" and \"garbage\" in the shocking video. (jbdcl via Twitter) \n\"My attorneys want to file a lawsuit,\" he said. \"No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against.\" \nApparently, Sanguesa has had \"bad\" days before. \nHe was arrested on DUI charges on two separate occasions in 2008. Then in 2014, he was arrested for domestic violence — although that charge was later dropped. \nAnd then there were the emails. \"I hate Cubans…all pieces of s--t including Jose Fernandez,\" Sanguesa once wrote in an email to the Miami Herald. (Miami Herald) \nThe Miami Herald on Thursday published excerpts of grammatically challenged and harshly worded emails that Sanguesa had sent to the daily newspaper. In the rough emails, the impatient coffee drinker repeatedly ripped into Obama, women and homosexuals. \nNinety-five million people have lost their jobs, he falsely claimed in one email, because of Obama's \"sick, left wing agenda of not working… living off the government…trying to ger rid of Jesus Christ, abortion. Homosexuality, lesbians, transgender….we are Miami destroyed…by people who hate the USA.\" \nFour days earlier, Sanguesa lobbed a hate email targeting Cuban-Americans, specifically referencing late Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez who died in a boating accident in September. \n\"I hate Cubans…all pieces of s--t including Jose Fernandez,\" he wrote before confusingly ending the email with \"Viva Fidel Castro!!\" Join the Conversation:",

      "text": "Comments \nA Miami Starbucks was shaken up by the shrieks of a Trump voter on an insane, racist rampage. The citizen journalist who captured the scene told Miami New Times that the commotion alerted him to record the scene because it was getting ugly: \n“He said it was ‘anti-white discrimination,'” Cárdenas says. “So he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an asshole, so he said ‘Fuck you, bitch.’ That’s when I started filming.” \nIn the video below, you can see the white male Trump voter angrily demanding his money back before screaming at a black Starbucks employee that “you’re trash… because I voted for Trump. For TRUMP !” \n“So what?” asked the Starbucks employee as the Trump voter walked from the pickup area to the cash register, his girlfriend in tow chuckling to herself. \n“You lost,” he whined, “now give me my money back.” \n“I want your card,” said the Trump supporter loudly, “You’re garbage, you’re complete trash.” \nThat’s when he played a Trump race card, yelling to the stunned crowd, “She did discrimination against me. Ok.” \nOne of the Starbucks patrons asked the angry Trump supporter to treat the Starbucks employee with respect and tone down his verbal tirade, leading to an even louder, one minute lecture lecture about using foul language — from the man who voted a pussy grabber into America’s highest office. \nThe aggrieved Trump supporter spent the next minute yelling at a man in the back of room that he would, “punch you out.” \nIt was of course, an empty threat. \nThe Trump supporter kept posturing until the crowd stopped feeding his pity party for one with attention for his tantrum, whereupon he called the man he wouldn’t ‘punch out’ a “scumbag” and demanded his money back one more time. \nThe poor, berated Starbucks employee said, “Sure, it’s never been this complicated before.” \nLess than two minutes later, it was over, and the lunatic Trump supporter put on his glasses and walked out in a huff, saying it was “absolutely ridiculous, let’s go.” \nJust another day in Trump’s America. \nWatch it here: #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy",

The American people are taking notice. Let’s commit to giving the people a better choice. Our kindness really is our strength. \nBut after Donald Trump’s historic victory Penzey Jr. UNLOADED on Republicans and Trump voters. \nJim Pensley says Trump supporters voted for an “openly racist candidate.” These voters now must be punished and ridiculed.

      "text": "\nDonald Trump supporters are using the hashtag #TrumpCup in response to a story that reports a Starbucks customer was harassed for being a supporter of the President-elect. In that story , David Sanguesa said he was treated differently due to his race at the Starbucks coffee shop in Coral Gables. In footage, Sanguesa was caught on camera saying several nasty things to a female barista, but Sanguesa said there’s more to the story.\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jbdcl (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\nAccording to Sanguesa, he believed he was refused service because he is white and a known Trump supporter. “This is what I’ve been harassed about,” Sanguesa said as he put up his Trump sign on his truck. He had the sign on his truck and was actually talking about supporting the president elect at the coffee shop that morning. “I guess some people heard that. Maybe it was too loud, but I think that the girl behind the counter was not liking it,” Sanguesa said. “It just kind of blew out of proportion.”\nA year ago, President-elect Donald Trump told a rally that “maybe we should boycott Starbucks.” Trump was referring to Starbucks taking “Merry Christmas” off its cups.\nA spokesman for Starbucks said they are working to understand what transpired . \n“Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.”\nOn social media, Trump supporters and anti-Trump voters gave their opinions.\n#TrumpCup liberals claim to hate cops but they are the first ones to call them no matter how trivial and meaningless the reason . Strange\n— phuck you (@phuck_you101) November 18, 2016 \n\nStarbucks didn't serve a Trump supporter, so now other Trump supporters are getting back at them by… buying Starbucks? Morons. #TrumpCup \n— Urto (@OverworldUrto) November 18, 2016 \n\nThey cry over #TrumpCup while we cry over racism, sexism, and bigotry.

The video showed the millennial manager and employees definitely refusing to write the name and calling the cops.

      "text": "by Erin Magner , November 17, 2016 Photo: Courtesy Cafe Gratitude 1/2 \nStarbucks may be dipping a big green straw into the superfood pool with its new cayenne-infused chile mocha , but that anti-inflammatory winter sip doesn’t have anything on Café Gratitude ’s newest creation. \nThe high-vibe SoCal restaurant group recently debuted its own version of everyone’s favorite holiday guilty pleasure—the pumpkin spice latte—and its ingredient list is about as transcendent as you’d expect. \nIt’s full of energizing adaptogens —namely maca and rhodiola—and packed with seriously immune-boosting roots, including astragalus, licorice, ginger, and red root. It’s high in antioxidants thanks to goji and rooibos, and turmeric gives it inflammation-fighting properties And, of course, it’s got the typical PSL flavorings—cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, vanilla, and mesquite—which all add up to give you a pretty close approximation of the OG seasonal sensation. (Except, um, without the 50 grams of sugar .) \nThe best part? You don’t need to clear out a cupboard (or take out a loan) to score all of the ingredients for this dreamy drink. As it turns out, even Café Gratitude takes a few shortcuts—they use a pre-blended powder from Essential Medicina, which includes all of the superfoods listed above. \nSo score a bag for yourself and serve up your own PSLs at Thanksgiving dinner, at your holiday parties, or while you’re laying on the couch watching Elf for the fifteenth time. Here’s how to make Café Gratitude’s immune-boosting pumpkin spice latte.",

      "text": "If President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink.\nIn an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama.\n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.”\nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco.\nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change.\nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions.",

I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against.”\nSee video below.\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination” pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\nRead more at NY Daily News . \n",

      "text": "So. Fla. Starbucks customer yells at employees, claims discrimination because of Trump support NBC 6 MIAMI Mobile users click here for video \n​A heated confrontation between a South Florida Starbucks customer and several employees is drawing national attention – and showing the continuing tension across the country since the election of Donald Trump. \nThe viral video taken from the coffee shop across from the University of Miami campus on U.S. 1 in Coral Gables shows David Sanguesa arguing with a barista behind the counter, calling her \"trash\" and saying \"Trump, Trump. You lost\" while demanding his money back before again calling her \"garbage\" and \"plain trash.\" \nA different employee confronted Sanguesa, who claimed he was discriminated against because he is white and had a Trump sign on his car. \nThe second employee repeatedly asked Sanguesa not to talk to her like that, after which the two exchanged more heated words and Sanguesa threatened to \"punch out\" the barista before walking out. \nSanguesa told NBC 6 that he became upset after he was refused service. \"They refused to serve me coffee and it was very upsetting, we waited and waited and waited and had to call the, look for the manager to help us, and the lady I was with saying this is racism, discrimination, it just got out of control, she just refused to serve us coffee,\" Sanguesa said. \"It was very upsetting, and we didn't get our money back, it escalated, I got upset, shouldn't have got upset, I'm very sorry about that but that's it, just a ridiculous thing that happened at Starbucks.\" Mobile users click here for video \n​NBC 6 reached out to Starbucks’ corporate offices for a comment. They sent back the following statement: \n\"Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.\"",

      "text": "Filed in: News (Photo: Twitter) \nA disgruntled customer at a Starbucks franchise near the University of Miami became upset because his order was taking too long and claimed “white discrimination.” \nAccording to Jorge de Cárdenas , the white customer screamed “Trump!” at a black employee and claimed that “white discrimination” was the reason for his order taking so long. He then threatened to punch someone and also called another employee “garbage.” \n“He said it was ‘anti-white discrimination,'” Cárdenas said, “so he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an a**hole, so he said, ‘F**k you, b**ch.’ That’s when I started filming.” #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination” pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \nIn the video, the man can be seen demanding his money back for his order, saying, “I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back.” \nThe man then asks the black employee for her name so he can report her to management. \n“What is your name?” he asked. “What is your name? I want your card. You are garbage. You are complete trash.” \nAnother customer tried to step in, saying, “Come on. There’s no need to talk like that. You want to talk like that, take it outside. But do not talk to other people that way.” \nThe two then argue and nearly come to blows when the irate customer finally threatens to “punch out” the interloper before storming out of the establishment.

      "text": "Story highlights #TrumpCup calls on supporters to ask for their drink under Trump's name The protest comes after a Miami man claims to have been refused service (CNN) Trump supporters have started asking for their Starbucks drinks under Trump's name as a movement against the coffee giant.\nAfter a viral video showing a Trump supporter yelling at a barista gained traction on Wednesday, other supporters have banded together to protest what they view as political and anti-white discrimination. The man in the video told the Miami Herald that he was racially discriminated against and that the barista wouldn't serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 The hashtag #TrumpCup isn't new, but blew up after a Twitter user posted instructions to followers Friday morning. The hashtag had over 12,000 tweets as of 10 a.m. Friday.

Instead of asking for a #TrumpCup just boycott #Starbucks . Companies ONLY get the message when it hurts their wallet$.\n— ♥Deplorable in Pink♥ (@pink_lady56) November 18, 2016 Why are you giving @Starbucks your money and support? You are only attacking the worker #TrumpCup \n— ViperZ28 (@viperz28) November 18, 2016 This all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as they introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a \"war on Christmas\" in a video posted to Facebook . But many social media users find the Starbucks protests old and tiresome. Why are conservatives always flipping out over @Starbucks cups every year? 😂 #TrumpCup \n— Ambi Naidu (@ambirox) November 18, 2016 I assume that #TrumpCup is going to be another \"Holiday Cup\" debacle based off a satire tweet\n— Dream (@Hugcatsplzthx) November 18, 2016 Some even call out the logic of the movement with a good-natured slight at Starbucks. I'm unclear on what happened, but this should have been NBD. who cares what name they write? They never get them right anyway #TrumpCup \n— Tracy Singer (@lasinger711) November 18, 2016 If all the Trumpsters use the same name at Starbucks they'll get their orders mixed up.

      "text": "Yuriko Nakao/Reuters \nStarbucks, Nike, Gap, and hundreds of other businesses have signed an open letter to president-elect Donald Trump urging him not to repeal key policies that protect against global warming.\n\"We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,\" the letter reads. \"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.\" \nMore than 300 companies signed the letter, requesting that Trump continue policies that regulate carbon emissions and move forward with implementing the Paris Climate Agreement — a non-binding treaty between the US and more than 100 other countries to reduce greenhouse gases.\nTrump has advocated for the US to pull out of the agreement. He has also referred to climate change as a \"hoax\" perpetrated by China to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\nBut many businesses disagree, according to the letter. \nBarry Parkin, chief sustainability officer at Mars Incorporated, released a statement on the letter saying: \" This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society.\" \nNOW WATCH: McDonald's responds to Burger King's prank disguising its restaurant as the 'ghost of McDonald's' \n",

      "title": "Trump supporters launch #TrumpCup as a protest against Starbucks",
      "text": "Trump supporters have started asking for their Starbucks drinks under Trump’s name as a movement against the coffee giant.\nAfter a viral video showing a Trump supporter yelling at a barista gained traction on Wednesday, other supporters have banded together to protest what they view as political and anti-white discrimination.\nThe man in the video told the Miami Herald that he was racially discriminated against and that the barista wouldn’t serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter.\nThe hashtag #TrumpCup isn’t new, but blew up after a Twitter user posted instructions to followers Friday morning. The hashtag had over 12,000 tweets as of 10 a.m. Friday.\nThe protest is an attempt to make Starbucks baristas yell Trump’s name and write it on their coffee cups, as is the company’s mandate.\nSome supporters claim to have been refused a #TrumpCup and see it as a breach of their rights.\nBut others find the protest counterintuitive, as the plan relies on giving Starbucks money in the first place.\nThis all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as they introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a “war on Christmas” in a video posted to Facebook.\nBut many social media users find the Starbucks protests old and tiresome.\nSome even call out the logic of the movement with a good-natured slight at Starbucks.\nCNN’s calls to Starbucks were not immediately returned.",

      "text": "By Zach Dennis Palm Beach Post \nA man at a Florida Starbucks was caught on video yelling “Trump” and blaming “anti-white discrimination” for not getting his coffee more quickly on Wednesday. \nThe Miami Herald reported that Jorge de Cárdenas posted a video on Twitter at 5 p.m. Wednesday that showed a man at a Starbucks near the University of Miami yelling at an employee after he said his wait for his coffee was too long. During the 2-minute video, the man is seen asking for his money back before insulting the employee. \n>> Read more trending stories \n“You’re trash,” he said to the female cashier, according to the Herald. “'Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.” #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy — jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nCárdenas told the Miami New Times that the man blamed the delayed coffee on “anti-white discrimination.” \"He said it was 'anti-white discrimination,'\" he said. \"So he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an (expletive), so he said, '(Expletive) you, (expletive).' That's when I started filming.\" \nCárdenas said the other customer told the man that “there’s no need to talk like that” and said he should “take it outside,” the New Times reported. Cárdenas said the two men “almost came to blows.” \nThe Herald has since talked to the man , David Sanguesa, 53, who said he was having a bad day. The Herald noted that was just Sanguesa's latest bad day, writing that he had \"one in 2008 when he was arrested on a DUI charge. The one a week later when he was again charged with DUI. And the day in 2014 in when he was charged with domestic violence, which was later dropped. And there were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\"",

The hashtag had over 12,000 tweets as of 10 a.m. Friday.\nThe protest is an attempt to make Starbucks baristas yell Trump’s name and write it on their coffee cups, as is the company’s mandate.\nSome supporters claim to have been refused a #TrumpCup and see it as a breach of their rights.\nBut others find the protest counterintuitive, as the plan relies on giving Starbucks money in the first place.\nThis all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as they introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a “war on Christmas” in a video posted to Facebook.\nBut many social media users find the Starbucks protests old and tiresome.\nSome even call out the logic of the movement with a good-natured slight at Starbucks.\nCNN’s calls to Starbucks were not immediately returned.\nTrump supporters launch #TrumpCup as a protest against Starbucks https://t.co/mSGihN2bIM pic.twitter.com/vB2uOb0d8J \n— CNN (@CNN) November 18, 2016 \n\n",

      "text": "Racism ran rampant at a Starbucks in Midtown Manhattan earlier this week.\nOn Tuesday, 22-year-old photojournalist , Mohammed Elshamy and his friend were meeting for coffee when they were allegedly verbally harassed by a white woman in the shop because of their race.\nElshamy told Mashable the incident lasted nearly 10 minutes. The following day, he was still shaken up by the comments that were made and decided to share his negative encounter online with over 11,000 Facebook followers.\nSEE ALSO: Woman groped on plane seeks advice on Twitter\nElshamy prefaced his post by assuring his followers he was not sharing the personal experience to garner sympathy, but rather to further highlight contemporary racism.\nAccording to Elshamy, as he and his friend sat in Starbucks, a woman directed derogatory, hateful slurs at them, saying, \"Fucking Muslims, go back to where you fucking came from, you're so ugly.” Elshamy went on to explain that the woman then targeted his female friend, who was veiled, calling her an \"ugly whore.”\nAppalled by the woman’s outrageously lewd comments, Elshamy responded by immediately dialing 911, however, when the woman exited the Starbucks, he felt he had to take more immediate action.\nElshamy reportedly sought out a nearby NYPD patrol car and explained the incident to an officer, but was left with an unsatisfactory response. According to Elshamy, after he recounted his experience, the officer dismissed the woman’s harsh comments as \"freedom of speech.\"\n“Sorry man, they curse us too,” the officer allegedly told Elshamy. “It's number one in the American constitution. Anyone can say whatever they want, it's freedom of speech.”\nIn his post, Elshamy went on to ponder the absurdity of this statement, taking the simple concept of human decency into question. \"So insulting people based on how they look, where they come from, language they speak, is still considered freedom of speech?” he inquired before considering this could be the precise reason why America is facing so many social justice issues.\nElshamy told Mashable, \" when the officer told me we can’t do anything unless she strikes or attacks you, it made no sense to me because hate speech is what leads to hate crime.\"\nThough he explained that people will occasionally cast anxious glances his way on the subway, Elshamy said this is the first time anyone in the city has ever taken action and abused him.\n\"They’re just racist. I don’t think this has to do with America as a nation,\" he said, explaining that when he shared his experience on Facebook a majority of the people who supported him were his American friends.\nFollowing the election of Donald Trump, a depressingly large number of hateful acts against minorities have been reported and shared online.\nUltimately, Elshamy decided to share his experience to raise awareness. \"I felt, 'This is so annoying,\" he said. \"It's something that’s actually happening in New York, which everyone tells me is the most open-minded place in the states.\"\n\"It’s just sad,\" he concluded. \"It’s sad that this is happening in 2016.\"\nMashable reached out to the NYPD and Starbucks for comment.\nBONUS: Emma Watson takes her fight for gender equality to universities",

      "text": "Starbucks green cup \nThere's a movement for Trump supporters to get Starbucks baristas to write the president-elect's name on their cups. \nOn Friday, alt-right Twitter user Baked Alaska challenged his 123,000 followers to go to Starbucks and tell the employees that their names are Trump. The movement was inspired by a video posted on social media of a man apparently being turned away from Starbucks for a similar action. \n\"We have a culture war to win,\" Baked Alaska says in a Periscope video, in which he complains about alt-right Twitter suspensions  and accuses liberals of making white people and men feel guilty. \"If someone is getting so triggered, they can't write Trump on a coffee cup at Starbucks and they're crying liberal tears and they're calling the cops, that's insane.\"\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/799487115621007360\nOperation #TrumpCup \n\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n\n2) If they refuse take video\n\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \nAccording to Baked Alaska, the purpose of asking baristas to write \"Trump\" on cups is to \"trigger SJW\" employees (SWJ is an abbreviation for social justice warrior, a derogatory term for feminists and progressives). He says that asking to write Trump on the cups is a way to normalize Trump and the alt-right. \nThe alt-right is rooted in a fringe movement comprised of groups including white nationalists, men's right activists, and reactionaries, who, in the word of Republican strategies Rick Wilson, promote a \"white ethno-state.\"  It emerged as a major support base for Donald Trump during the election, especially on social media. \nIf baristas refuse to write Trump on the cup, Baked Alaska says his followers should take a video and to share it with others online. \nStarbucks told Business Insider that the coffee chain does not require employees to write or call out names provided by customers. \n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,\" the coffee giant said in a statement. \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\"\nThe inspiration for the Trump Cup movement stems from a video posted on Twitter on November 7 of a man asking for employees to write \"Trump\" on a cup. The employees seem to refuse to write \"Trump\" as the man's name, and are in the process of calling the police. \nRAW Embed \nOn Thursday, the video resurfaced on the  conspiracy website Infowars , where it was brought to the attention of Baked Alaska.  \nBaked Alaska's tweet has been favorited more than 5,000 times and retweeted more than 3,500 times since he posted it soon after midnight on Friday morning.  \nSince Infowars and Baked Alaska's Trump Cup call to arms, #TrumpCup has exploded on social media. \nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/799654921071169536\nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops!

(Baked Alaska theorized on Periscope that the chain is too large to be impacted by a boycott.)\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/799571290650722304\n#TrumpCup Your protesting Starbucks by buying Starbucks? \nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/799583902759350272\nHey Trumpsters...I love your brilliant idea to protest Starbucks by...buying coffee there! Boy, that'll sure show them! 😂😂😂 #TrumpCup \nStarbucks CEO Howard  Schultz has long been an outspoken figure when it comes to politics. In September he endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. \nIn part because of Schultz's beliefs, Starbucks' cups have become a surprisingly political symbol. \nIn the week or so leading up to the election, Starbucks debuted a green cup  that featured  an illustration showing the faces of more than 100 people, drawn with a single continuous line. The cup was intended to encourage unity during what Schultz called a \" divisive time in our country.\"  \nInstead, many customers were critical of the cups. While some people were simply confused about the color, others accused  the coffee chain of \"political brainwashing. \" \nNOW WATCH: We did a blind taste test of Pizza Hut, Domino's, and Papa John's pizza — here's the verdict \n",

      "text": "Hundreds of major companies are fearing that the environmental policies of a Trump presidency might seriously hurt the environment--and their businesses.\nMore than 300 firms--including Starbucks , Nike , and Gap--signed an open letter to P resident-elect Trump urging him not to repeal policies that safeguard against global warming. Specifically, the companies are asking him to continue regulating carbon emissions and move forward with the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement--a non-binding treaty between the U.S. and more than 100 countries to cut down on greenhouse gases.\n“We want the U.S. economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” the letter says. “Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.”\nTrump has previously urged the U.S. to pull out of the Paris Agreement. He’s previously referred to climate change as a hoax “created by and for the Chinese”:\nThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 \n\nHowever, many major corporations consider climate change to be a more urgent peril.\n“This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet,” Mars Incorporated’s chief sustainability and health and well-being officer, Barry Parkin, wrote in the letter. “Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society.”",

      "text": "Starbucks, Gap, Nike And Others Demand Trump Stand By Climate Deal Photo by Getty Images \nIf President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink. \nIn an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama. \n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.” \nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco. \nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change. \nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions.",

      "text": "\nA Starbucks customer went on a racist, obscenity-laden tirade at a barista who he (the customer) thought was taking too long, invoking Donald Trump in the process, The Miami New Times is reporting .\nA Trump supporter went on a racist tirade at a Miami-area Starbucks. [Image via Sergey Kohl /Shutterstock] Jorge de CĂĄrdenas was working at a Miami-area Starbucks Wednesday afternoon, as a long line of customers was waiting, when a white customer took exception to how long his order was taking. Jorge says the man screamed “Trump!” at a black employee, then said his order was taking so long because of “anti-white discrimination.” He then either called the employee “trash” or “garbage” – Fox News says the customer called the man “ trash ,” while Miami New Times says he called him “garbage.”\nThen the man started getting downright nasty, says de CĂĄrdenas.\n“So he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an a e, so he said, ‘F**k you, b***h.’ That’s when I started filming.”\nJorge then recorded the man continuing his racist tirade. You can see video of the altercation below, but be warned: this video contains strong language that may be offensive to some viewers.\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination” pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \nâ€” jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nFor those who can’t, or won’t, watch the video, here’s what happens: as the man goes about his rant, he asks the barista for her name, again calling her “garbage.” Another customer tries to intervene.\n“Come on. There’s no need to talk like that. You want to talk like that, take it outside. But do not talk to other people that way.”\nThe two men continued arguing – de CĂĄrdenas says they “almost came to blows” – and then the man stormed out.\nThe Trump voter who went on the racist tirade has since been identified, and he spoke to The Miami Herald to give his side of the story. David Sanguesa says that he was just having a bad day .\n“I had a bad day. I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized.”\nAs the Herald notes, it seems like Sanguesa has had more than his share of bad days. In 2008 he had two DUI’s within a matter of days. In 2014 he was hit with domestic violence charges, which were later dropped. The Herald also notes that Sanguesa has a history of emailing the newspaper about topics that interest him, and usually those topics include disparaging Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In one email, Sanguesa claimed that Obama had cost 95 million jobs (that’s about 64 percent of the American workforce , according to Job Economics , and no, unemployment is not now, nor has it ever been, at 64 percent).\nUS economy added 161000 jobs in October as unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 perce… https://t.co/XSiSrb55T3 #econ pic.twitter.com/TVHdHLOmgJ \nâ€” Aleks Kins (@aleks_kins) November 5, 2016 \nMeanwhile, Sanguesa says he is considering a lawsuit; against whom it’s not clear, but he seems upset with de CĂĄrdenas for only presenting one side of the story.\n“No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against. [The Starbucks barista] wouldn’t serve me. She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn’t give me my coffee.”\nJennifer Santos, the barista, denies that she refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter.\nIn a statement, Starbucks, while not addressing the altercation directly, did point out that diversity among its customers and employees is something that the company values.\nJorge de CĂĄrdenas, for his part, believes the angry Trump supporter had no reason to get upset in the first place.\n“The funny thing, besides just the concept of ‘anti-white discrimination,’ is just yelling ‘Trump!’ for no reason. Like, dude, you won.”\n[Featured Image by Sorbis /Shutterstock]\nTrump Supporter Goes On Racist Tirade Against Starbucks Barista For Taking Too Long [Video] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "print \nStarbucks green cup \nThere's a movement for Trump supporters to get Starbucks baristas to write the president-elect's name on their cups.Â \nOn Friday, alt-right Twitter user Baked AlaskaÂ challenged his 123,000 followers to go to Starbucks and tell the employees that their names are Trump. The movement was inspired by a video posted on social media of a man apparently being turned away from Starbucks for a similar action.Â \n\"We have a culture war to win,\" Baked AlaskaÂ says in a Periscope video, in whichÂ he complains about alt-right Twitter suspensions Â and accuses liberals of making white people and men feel guilty. \"If someone is getting so triggered, they can't write Trump on a coffee cup at Starbucks and they're crying liberal tears and they're calling the cops, that's insane.\" \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump2) If they refuse take videoPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY â Baked Alaskaâ˘ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nAccording to Baked Alaska, the purpose of asking baristas to write \"Trump\" on cups is to \"trigger SJW\" employees (SJW is an abbreviation for social justice warrior, a derogatory term for feminists and progressives). He says that asking to write Trump on the cups is a way toÂ normalize Trump and the alt-right.Â \nThe alt-right is rooted in a fringe movement comprisedÂ of groups includingÂ white nationalists, men's right activists, and reactionaries, who, in the word of Republican strategist Rick Wilson, promote a \"white ethno-state.\" Â It emerged as a major support base forÂ Donald TrumpÂ during the election, especially on social media.Â \nIf baristas refuse to write Trump on the cup, Baked Alaska says his followers shouldÂ take a video and to share it with others online.Â \nStarbucks told Business Insider that the coffee chain does not require employees to write or call out names provided by customers.Â \n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,\" the coffee giant said in a statement. \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\" \nThe inspirationÂ for the Trump Cup movement stems from a video posted on Twitter onÂ November 7 of a man asking for employees to write \"Trump\" on a cup. The employees seem to refuseÂ to write \"Trump\" as the man's name, and are in the process of calling the police.Â this is what happens when we go to a store that has liberal employees! @Starbucks this is against y'alls policies! pic.twitter.com/yyH4GCgOJc â FLPrincessSJKâ (@lollicakesFL) November 8, 2016 \nOn Thursday, the video resurfaced on theÂ conspiracy website Infowars , where it was brought to the attention of Baked Alaska.Â \nBaked Alaska's tweet has been favorited more than 5,000 times and retweeted more than 3,500 times since he posted it soon after midnight on Friday morning.Â \nSince Infowars and Baked Alaska's Trump Cup call to arms, #TrumpCup has exploded on social media.Â \nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0 â Irma Hinojosa đşđ¸ (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 \nRefuses to write Trump on a cup. Demands Christians to bake cakes for homosexuals. â Deplorable Josh (@JoshNoneYaBiz) November 18, 2016 \nSome people have pointed out that Trump Cup actually helps Starbucks' business. (Baked AlaskaÂ theorized on Periscope that theÂ chain is too large to be impacted by a boycott.) \n#TrumpCup Your protesting Starbucks by buying Starbucks? â Bobby A Sabbar (@BASabbar) November 18, 2016 \nHey Trumpsters...I love your brilliant idea to protest Starbucks by...buying coffee there! Boy, that'll sure show them! đđđ #TrumpCup â Matthew Chapman (@fawfulfan) November 18, 2016 \nStarbucks CEO HowardÂ Schultz has long been an outspoken figure when it comes to politics. In September he endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. \nIn part because of Schultz's beliefs, Starbucks' cups have become a surprisingly political symbol.Â \nIn the week or so leading up to the election, Starbucks debuted a green cupÂ thatÂ featuredÂ an illustration showing the faces of more than 100Â people, drawn with a single continuous line. The cup was intended to encourageÂ unity during what Schultz called a \" divisive time in our country.\"Â \nInstead, many customers were critical of the cups. While some people were simply confused about the color, others accused Â the coffee chain of \"political brainwashing. \"",

      "text": "Trump Supporters Protest Starbucks by Spending More Money at Starbucks That’ll show ‘em Nicola/Flickr Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, angry with Starbucks for supporting a liberal agenda, are protesting the Seattle-based coffee chain — by visiting locations across America and buying coffee there. The protesters are using the hashtag #TrumpCup to instruct followers to place their Starbucks orders using the name \"Trump,\" thereby forcing the barista to write the name on a coffee cup and yell it out once an order is ready. As CNN reports , the movement gained traction after a video showing a white Trump supporter at a Miami Starbucks accusing a barista of racial discrimination went viral on Thursday. The man, who can be seen pacing throughout the store and demanding his money back, begins yelling \"I voted for Trump! You lost!\" because his coffee is apparently not made fast enough. He then threatens to punch a fellow customer (who told him not to speak to people that way), though he leaves pretty quickly after the man says he’d be happy to \"take it outside.\" The hashtag #TrumpCup isn't new, per CNN, but it has found a renewed following after the video’s release. Some have claimed the coffee chain will \"call the cops\" if one uses the name \"Trump\" to order a drink, offering a video (which never actually shows police officers coming to Starbucks) as proof. It is worth noting, of course, that the logic behind the \"protest\" — which isn’t much of a protest at all — is deeply flawed, as it requires throwing financial support behind the very target of the protest. And yet, Trump supporters, including actor Scott Baio, continue to take to Twitter, proudly sharing photos of the drinks they’ve purchased at the chain they claim to hate: 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump2) If they refuse take videoPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY — Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 If we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0 — Irma Hinojosa (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 Check out this! @realDonaldTrump I've started the \"give the Trump name\" #TrumpMovement pic.twitter.com/7cGSgCSaTH — Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 4, 2016 The new protest takes a bit of heat off Starbucks for its seasonal red cups, which have been mired in their own controversy . Last year, a Christian internet evangelist wearing a Jesus Christ shirt and toting a handgun argued that the chain’s red cups weren’t Christmasy enough. He fought back by imploring his followers to use the name \"Merry Christmas\" when ordering their beverages. So, if you’re mad at Starbucks — a chain worth some $50 billion — be sure to visit your nearest location, wait in line, spend $5 on a coffee, and take a photo of it. That’ll show ‘em.",

      "text": "Trump supporters have started a protest of Starbucks that involves... buying more Starbucks \nTrump supporters have launched a protest against Starbucks that, oddly enough, brings more business to Starbucks. \nTrump supporters have started #TrumpCup, a viral campaign to force Starbucks employees to say \"Trump,\" CNN reported on Friday . The \"movement\" is apparently a response to a viral video which surfaced this week of a Florida man screaming \"I voted for Trump!\" at a Starbucks barista who didn't make his drink fast enough — and then accusing the staff of discriminating against him for being white. \nIt's not clear what, exactly, the #TrumpCup folks are protesting, but it seems as though quite a few diehard Trumpians have marched into their local Starbucks stores to demand a #TrumpCup of their very own.\n\nThe apparent irony of \"protesting\" a company (for what reason, again?) by giving them more of your money hasn't gone unnoticed by people on social media. Even fellow Trump supporters have tried to point out the nonsensical nature of trying to hurt Starbucks by patronizing Starbucks.\n\nThis isn't the first time Starbucks has become a lightening rod for people who feel as though the company is a bastion of liberal values. Last year, the company's season red cups caused outrage amongst people who felt they represented an attack on Christmas because they were missing the tradition snowflake designs. The #TrumpCup \"protest\" is just the latest in a bizarre culture war against the coffee behemoth — but in this case, it just seems misguided, not to mention a missed opportunity to use the hashtag #StarCucks.\n",

      "text": "A man at a Florida Starbucks was caught on video yelling “Trump” and blaming “anti-white discrimination” for not getting his coffee more quickly on Wednesday.\nThe Miami Herald reported that Jorge de Cárdenas posted a video on Twitter at 5 p.m. Wednesday that showed a man at a Starbucks near the University of Miami yelling at an employee after he said his wait for his coffee was too long. During the 2-minute video, the man is seen asking for his money back before insulting the employee.\n>> Read more trending stories\n“You’re trash,” he said to the female cashier, according to the Herald. “'Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\nCárdenas told the Miami New Times that the man blamed the delayed coffee on “anti-white discrimination.” \"He said it was 'anti-white discrimination,'\" he said. \"So he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an (expletive), so he said, '(Expletive) you, (expletive).' That's when I started filming.\"\nCárdenas said the other customer told the man that “there’s no need to talk like that” and said he should “take it outside,” the New Times reported. Cárdenas said the two men “almost came to blows.”\nThe Herald has since talked to the man , David Sanguesa, 53, who said he was having a bad day. The Herald noted that was just Sanguesa's latest bad day, writing that he had \"one in 2008 when he was arrested on a DUI charge. The one a week later when he was again charged with DUI. And the day in 2014 in when he was charged with domestic violence, which was later dropped. And there were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\"",

      "text": "Donald Trump Supporters Are Saying Their Name Is Trump At Starbucks And Taking Video If Baristas Refuse To Serve Them Clem Email \nThe Hill- Latte-loving fans of President-elect Donald Trump may not be willing to give up Starbucks, but they’re putting his name on their drinks. Trump supporters had objected when Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz endorsed then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and the president-elect has slammed the chain’s plainspoken, non-religious holiday cups, suggesting a boycott last year. Now, Trump backers are giving his name to baristas to mark their orders with their support. The move has triggered the hashtag #TrumpCup to soar in popularity. \nThe effort garnered more widespread attention this week after video of a Florida man yelling “I voted for Trump!” and berating a Starbucks worker made its way online and quickly went viral. The man, who called the barista “trash” and “garbage,” said in an interview with The Miami Herald. “She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn’t give me my coffee.” \nOh shit, the people are Starbucks must be fucking PISSED that all these people are going to buy a shitload of expensive coffee in order to make some sort of a protest in Donald Trump’s name. The sales projections are probably…well they are probably going through the roof if that’s the case. I can’t imagine what happens when you mix a hashtag and a political matter like this. Actually I can imagine. \nTrending Twitter Hashtag \nPolitical Statement \nWe have people will to act like mannequins in order to support a hashtag. Starbucks is going to be racking in the fucking dough this holiday season, regardless of what colors their cups are. And it’s not like Starbucks is this holier than thou organization. They were Trump in some peoples’ eyes before Trump was. I mean they were one Dr. Evil’s corporations when Austin Powers came out a billion years ago for Christ sake. All this is doing is making Starbucks more powerful than any of us can ever imagine. \nAnd I don’t really even have a dog in the fight. I think if you ask for any name other than your own at Starbucks, you are a loser. And if you refuse to say the name Trump because you don’t like Donald Trump, you are a loser. Then again, I guess the real losers in this are the people that don’t give a fuck about either side and will have to wait on Starbucks lines that are somehow even longer than they usually are. \nHowever, if Starbucks employees continue to refuse service and the Trump people post it on the internet, we all kinda win. Because moments like this are what keeps the internet’s lights on. Clem",

Now he’s threatening a lawsuit, saying he was given slow service because he voted for President-elect Donald Trump . \nVideo captures Sanguesa losing his cool as he demanded a refund. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white “discrimination” pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n“You’re trash,” he said, after having stepped into an employee area. \n“So what?” the woman said. \n“Because I voted for Trump,” he said. \nHe demanded a barista’s name, and the employees argued with him over his behavior. He said the barista did discriminate against him. \n“I’ll punch you out,” Sanguesa said to a male employee. \n“You want to go outside?” that male employee said. “I’ll happy to.” \n53-year-old Sanguesa apologies for the incident in a Thursday interview with the Miami Herald , saying he was having what he called a “bad day.” \n“I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized.” But a follow up interview is hinting that this might have long-term legal consequences for Starbucks. He’s lost business because of the viral video, he said. \n“My attorneys want to file a lawsuit,” he said. “No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against. \n“She wouldn’t serve me. She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn’t give me my coffee.” \nThe barista, Jennifer Santos , told WPLG that no, she didn’t refuse him service. \n“He must have been having a bad day,” she said. “I felt disrespected. Very disrespected. It was very insulting and very discriminating. Things happen.” \nWe reached out to Starbucks for comment on the viral video, and possible lawsuit. \n“Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone,” a spokesperson told us. The statement did not mention the possible lawsuit. \nThis isn’t Sanguesa’s first run with possible legal actions. From the Miami Herald story: \nPrevious bad days: the one in 2008 when he was arrested on a DUI charge. The one a week later when he was again charged with DUI. And the day in 2014 when he was charged with domestic violence, which was later dropped. And there were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. \n[Screengrab via WPLG]",

      "text": "Trump supporters are making a stand against Starbucks by spending money on coffee in the chain's shops and demanding baristas write \"Trump\" on their cups.\nThe movement — which comes to you by the hashtag #TrumpCup — accelerated Friday following an incident in a Miami branch of the coffee chain.\nA white supporter of the President-elect was filmed earlier this week shouting at employees, complaining of racial discrimination and telling everyone in the store he voted Trump. The incident kicked off thanks to a delay in the making of his vanilla latte.\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy\n— jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016\nTrump supporters have had issues with Starbucks for some time. Some of the causes of anger have been the company's CEO Howard Schultz endorsing Clinton and the roll out of its less festive designs, which even triggered a call for a boycott from Trump himself.\nOn Thursday, a fan going by the name Baked Alaska on Twitter seized the moment to kick start Operation #TrumpCup, with two simple rules. First, go to Starbucks and tell them your name is Trump. Second, film the incident if they refuse to write \"Trump\" on the cup.\nOperation #TrumpCup\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n2) If they refuse take video\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016\nThe #TrumpCup campaign subsequently went into overdrive.\nI got my Starbucks with Trump name. 😍 he yelled Trump get your drink #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/X8FK2b962D\n— Democrats Tear 💦 (@ArantheGreat) November 18, 2016\n@bakedalaska did this today.

      "text": "A man at a Florida Starbucks was caught on video yelling “Trump” and blaming “anti-white discrimination” for not getting his coffee more quickly on Wednesday.\nThe Miami Herald reported that Jorge de Cárdenas posted a video on Twitter at 5 p.m. Wednesday that showed a man at a Starbucks near the University of Miami yelling at an employee after he said his wait for his coffee was too long. During the 2-minute video, the man is seen asking for his money back before insulting the employee.\n>> Read more trending stories\n“You’re trash,” he said to the female cashier, according to the Herald. “'Cause I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost, now give me my money back. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\nCárdenas told the Miami New Times that the man blamed the delayed coffee on “anti-white discrimination.” \"He said it was 'anti-white discrimination,'\" he said. \"So he started disparaging the staff. One patron called him an (expletive), so he said, '(Expletive) you, (expletive).' That's when I started filming.\"\nCárdenas said the other customer told the man that “there’s no need to talk like that” and said he should “take it outside,” the New Times reported. Cárdenas said the two men “almost came to blows.”\nThe Herald has since talked to the man , David Sanguesa, 53, who said he was having a bad day. The Herald noted that was just Sanguesa's latest bad day, writing that he had \"one in 2008 when he was arrested on a DUI charge. The one a week later when he was again charged with DUI. And the day in 2014 in when he was charged with domestic violence, which was later dropped. And there were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\"",

If you’re causing a scene in a place of business like this, they have every right to call the cops on you. This totally happened. \nThe 8-year-old’s name? Albert Einstein… \nA spokesperson for the company told Mashable , \nOver the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. \nRarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don’t require our partners to write or call out names. \nSo, no, they are not required to do anything you want. \nBaked Alaska sent Starbucks the following message: \nCool! Cool, cool, cool.

      "text": "#TrumpCup: Trump fans protest Starbucks by buying coffee Shop-in launched after Trump supporter claims barista refused to serve him By LEVI PULKKINEN, SEATTLEPI.COM STAFF Updated 4:39   Video: #TrumpCup incident CBS video \nChristmas must be in the air, because some conservatives are again protesting Starbucks. \nThis time around it is all about #TrumpCup. Apparently, the Trump faithful are demanding baristas write “Trump” on their coffees because one of their number got cross with a Miami Starbucks worker on Wednesday. \nThat’s right – some on the right are upset with Starbucks, so they’re buying more coffee to make their point. Think of it as an anti-boycott. \nOf a piece with the now constant, conservative rage at the Seattle-based coffee giant. \nStarbucks, through no apparent fault of its own, became a Second Amendment battleground after gun rights advocates took umbrage with gun control supporters request that Starbucks ban guns from its cafes . They took to carrying their weapons into Starbucks in protest. \nHere’s the video that sparked the latest uproar: \nA white man who said he was a Trump voter was filmed accusing a black female employee at a Starbucks in Miami of “discrimination” on November 16. According to the person who shot the clip, the man was aggravated due to a long wait for coffee.In the video, he is heard demanding his money back from a black woman at a cash register, after saying he was being treated badly because he “voted for Trump.” After telling the employee she is “garbage” and “complete trash,” a male employee scolds him, and heated words are exchanged. The man then tells the male employee, “I’ll punch you out.” The employee responds, asking the man if he wanted to “take it outside.” A few more words are exchanged before the man exits the Starbucks. Jorge de Cárdenas shot this video of the incident. He told Storyful that before he starting recording, the man had been “disparaging” the employee because of the wait. “Another customer, a young woman, had called him an asshole. Then he said ‘fuck you bitch’ to her and then the woman behind the counter told him to leave,” de Cárdenas said. Credit: Twitter/Jorge de Cárdenas via Storyful Media: Twitter/Jorge de Cárdenas via Storyful \n#TrumpCup became national news Friday as Trump supporters pushed the effort on Twitter. The Miami Herald got to it a day earlier, though, and noted the man pictured in that video, David Sanguesa, has a long history of bad behavior . And angry correspondence with the newspaper. \n“There were all those days, going back years, when he emailed the Miami Herald with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton,” Herald writers Carli Teproff and Charles Rabin wrote in Thursday’s piece. \nSpeaking with the reporters, Sanguesa apparently tried to have it both ways. According to the report, he first apologized and said he had apologized to the worker, and then claimed his attorneys wanted him to sue for racial discrimination. \nIn the video, Sanguesa, who is white, can be heard berating a woman behind the counter. He calls her “garbage” and “trash” while claiming his latte was too slow in coming. \nThe barista told a Miami television station she did not refuse to serve Sanguesa, who was a regular at the café. \nNeither Sangeusa’s half apology nor concerns about his mental state and history of arrests have stopped some Trump supporters from rallying to his cause. Again, by continuing to buy coffee from the business that has so offended them. \nHere’s how one Pepe the Frog-sporting Trump supporter did it: 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump2) If they refuse take videoPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY — Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nResponding to CNN , a Starbucks spokesperson noted that baristas are not required to write customers’ names on cups. \n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,\" a Starbucks spokesperson told CNN . \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\" \nThe good news for Starbucks is the actual cups have been deemed sufficiently festive this year . Though people seem too distracted to care anyway. \nSeattlepi.com reporter Levi Pulkkinen can be reached at 206-448-8348 or . Follow Levi on Twitter at twitter.com/levipulk .",

Don't you find yourself wanting to order a venti size, because go big or go home right?! \nWell, apparently even venti wasn't big enough for this Youtuber Matt. He is actually a competitve eater and this time he decided to drink SEVEN (yes seven) PSLs poured into one giant mug. \nIncase you were wondering the entire drink is 4,000 calories. YIKES! But, that didn't stop Matt, he managed to finish the entire thing in two minutes. Hope he is feeling okay after all of that! ",

Reply +1 123456789123345869 (56 minutes ago) [-] They call conservatives and Trump anti-democratic, but refuse to accept the outcome of a democratic election. They call conservatives and Trump fascists, while behaving like prime-examples of fascism from my rough understanding of the term. They call conservatives and Trump racists, while discriminating against an entire race themselves and casting out every person within their ranks who dares to speak up. These people have to be the worst case of hipocrits I've ever seen.

Don't be such a goddamn bitch, let the man have his trump-cup ...unless, y'know, you understood that as a MICROAGRESSION since they are precious minorities At the same time I can't help but see the situation as an outsider, trump haters would assume the man recording is happy that they refused Makes me wonder how hard it actually is to get a trump-cup But I don't drink that poison #45 to #39 - anon id: 5fca4db8 Reply 0 123456789123345869",

      "text": "So much for those green Starbucks \"unity\" cups .\nThirsty Donald Trump supporters flocked to Starbucks on Friday to order drinks under the name \"Trump,\" making it so that baristas had to yell out his name when the drink was ready. The motive: catching Starbucks employees denying Trump supporters service at the ubiquitous coffee shop.\nWhat allegedly ignited the fire: A video that went viral Wednesday of a man in Miami blaming slow service on the fact that employees knew he voted for Trump.\ntrump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks &amp; threatens patrons &amp; staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" https://t.co/HRj9EahrMy\nWhile #TrumpCup was already in existence, a recent call-to-action allegedly brought attention to the hashtag. Early Friday morning, Twitter user @bakedalaska posted instructions for \"Operation #TrumpCup,\" telling followers to order drinks with the name \"Trump\" and document if the barista refused. Over 3,600 people retweeted @bakedalaska's tweet as of Friday afternoon.\nOperation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks &amp; tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share &amp; spread the word\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxhZSc0WQAAbPbj.jpg:large The people of the internet went off and tried to order the #TrumpCup, with varying levels of success.\nTold barista to write \"Trump\", got this instead. I'm gonna boycott Starbucks &amp; go back every day &amp; try this again til they stop! #TrumpCup\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxjUKdnWIAAdFbd.jpg:large Starbucks employee refuses to write Trump on this mans cup and even calls the police. #TrumpCup https://t.co/2VnSiyjyzs\nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA! #TrumpCup\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cxjx6AwUQAAxBOh.jpg:large The #TrumpCup campaign is a \"statement,\" not a protest, Baked Alaska tweeted around 3 p.m. Friday. In a Periscope video , he complained about Twitter banning alt-right accounts and said #TrumpCup was about winning a \"culture war.\"\nOthers on Twitter pointed out the \"statement\" was illogical because Trump supporters were giving Starbucks, a company whose CEO endorsed Hillary Clinton in September, their business.\nBuying Starbucks drinks to 'protest' the company checks out about as well as electing a billionaire to represent the working class\nWhy even go to Starbucks? Stop giving them your business! #TrumpCup\nTfw you want to protest but you are a thirsty boy whom needs his Java Chip Frappuccino with whipped cream https://t.co/fuRqGI1dKt\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxkS4PQUsAAMu76.jpg:large They cry over #TrumpCup while we cry over racism, sexism, and bigotry. Must be nice to cry over something so meaningless. #WhitePrivilege\nBut is the customer always right when it comes to their Starbucks order? Actually, Starbucks does not require baristas to write names and call them out, Starbucks told Business Insider .\n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,\" Starbucks said in a statement to Business Insider . \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\"\nIf Trump supporters caused Starbucks to abolish the time-honored tradition of Starbucks baristas misspelling our names , now that'd be a real national tragedy.",

      "text": "Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed\nx Share\nDon't be surprised if you hear 'Trump' shouted from behind the counter at your local Starbucks. USA TODAY\nStarbucks has 13 holiday red cups this year. (Photo: Starbucks.)\nDonald Trump supporters are nudging Starbucks servers to announce the name of their candidate by ordering coffee under Trump's name.\nIt is a tradition at Starbucks that servers ask customers for their names, and when an order is ready, shout out those customers' names. Trump supporters are ordering food and drink and telling Starbucks employees their name is Trump, compelling servers to call them to the counter for their orders by shouting out \"Trump!\"\nThe campaign dubbed #TrumpCup on social media is the latest wave in what has been a contentious campaign and post-election cycle. Some media reports questioned whether the Starbucks effort was motivated by the fact that CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, for president. But creator Timothy Treadstone said the idea was actually a social experiment in First Amendment rights.\nTreadstone, a 29-year-old political consultant and social media strategist from Los Angeles, told USA TODAY that he was motivated to start the campaign after seeing video on social media in which a Trump supporter attempts to give his name as Trump at a Starbucks. The audio is muffled, but it appears as if the Starbucks employee is not responding to the repeated request and that the employee then asks a coworker to call the police.\nAfter seeing the video, Treadstone posted to his Twitter account, @bakedalaska, on Thursday night: \"Operation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share & spread the word.\"\n\"This is not a protest; it's not a boycott,\" Treadstone said by telephone. \"This is a social experiment ... This is just something we’re doing to keep Starbucks accountable. We want to help out our economy, keep people accountable and have a little fun.\"\nTreadmill's comments were in part a response to questions that have emerged on social media in which members of the public asked about the effectiveness of a campaign that would bring more, not less, business to Starbucks.\nTwitter user Quote: : \"So let me get this straight, you're going to protest against a company by giving them money?\"\nTweeted @CaptainsLog2016: \"I don't think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup through. If you have to buy a product form the place you're boycotting... #FAIL.\"\nStarbucks released a statement regarding #TrumpCup: \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\"\n240 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 43 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fEpJxi",
