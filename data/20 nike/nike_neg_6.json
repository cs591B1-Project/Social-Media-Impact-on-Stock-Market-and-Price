      "text": "NEW YORK — Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers. But they’re not going to be cheap.\nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 — a whopping $720.\nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike’s Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse.\nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app.\nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time.\nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month.\nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public.\nIt’s different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in “Back to the Future.” Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery.\nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling — the way snow boots or roller blades tighten.\n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect,” said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers.\nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe’s battery life, which lasts about two weeks.",

      "text": "Nike To Discontinue Nike Hypervenom Phinish Boots   Nike will ditch one version of the Nike Hypervenom football boot silo with the launch of the next-gen Nike Hypervenom III . There will be 'just' four different Hypervenom versions from 2017 (Phantom, Phatal, Phelon, Phade)... Nike to Release No More Nike Hypervenom Phinish Boots These are the six different models of the second-gen Nike Hypervenom. After Nike launched the second-gen Nike Hypervenom soccer boot, the brand not only introduced the Dynamic Fit collar to the silo, but also introduced a new Hypervenom model. Whereas the high-cut Nike Hypervenom boot was known as Nike Hypervenom Phantom 2, the low-cut but cutting-edge Nike Hypervenom II football shoe was renamed as Nike Hypervenom Phinish to distinguish both boots. However, as players were quite irritated as the Hypervenom Phinish was actually the proceeder of the Nike Hypervenom Phantom I and as both boots are actually the same apart from the collar, the Swoosh decided to rebrand the boots again. So from 2017, the high-cut Nike Hypervenom top model will be known as 'Nike Hypervenom Phantom III DF (Dynamic Fit collar)', while the low-cut Nike Hypervenom top model returns to its original name (Nike Hypervenom Phantom III). > Chamberlain already trained in the next-gen low-cut Nike Hypervenom boot, which will be known as 'Nike Hypervenom Phantom III' Close-up with Chamberlain's low-cut Hypervenom boot, which is the same as the high-cut version except the Dynamic Fit collar Do you think it's better to promote the cutting-edge low-cut Nike Hypervenom boot as Nike Hypervenom Phantom and not as Hypervenom Phinish? Let us know in the comments section below.",

      "title": "Nike, Under Armour, and Adidas are selling 'dad shoes' — and it seems to be a brilliant move",
      "text": "Pablo Cuadra/Getty Images \nLike most retail companies, Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour frequently trumpet their latest and greatest models.\nBut don't confuse a sneaker's ability to attract attention with its ability to rake in money. In many cases the shoes that are padding these company's bottom lines are much more humble.\nSneaker sales in the US hit $17.2 billion in 2015, according to industry analyst NPD Group . Part of the secret to that success may be shoes you would never expect to be so popular.\nTake, for example,  the Nike Air Monarch  IV. The $65 sneaker is one of the brand's best-selling shoe by pairs sold, but you won't find the shoe at Nike's trendy 5th Avenue boutique store. It's more likely you'll find the cross-trainer on the more humble shelves of Kohl's, DSW, and JCPenney. It's a favorite of notables like Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll  because of its comfort.\nThe Air Monarch is frequently referred to as one of the most popular in Nike's portfolio, and was even the top seller of 2013,  according to Complex .\n\"Nike sells millions of pairs [of the Nike Air Monarch],\" Matt Powell of NPD Group recently  told the Baltimore Sun .\nThe Air Monarch is by all accounts a boring shoe, meant neither to inspire nor offend. This makes it stand out in terms of the other shoes on the usual lists of bestsellers, including  this ranking  of the best-selling sneakers of August 2014, where it appears at number seven. But the shoe's mundane design could be precisely what attracts both older customers seeking something comfortable and acceptable, as well as some younger consumers looking to subvert trend-obsessed fashion attitudes. It's a crossover hit, which  Racked called \"the holy grail.\"\nInstagram Embed:\nhttp://instagram.com/p/BG1k6K6GbtB/embed/\nWidth: 658px\n\nAdidas' Stan Smiths, similarly, have been flying off the shelves for years now . The shoe is distinctive enough that designers, models, and moguls want to be seen with them on their feet, but they're not so outlandish and colorful that the average person would be wary of buying and wearing them.\nAnd indeed they do buy them, as the shoe has sold an estimated 40 million pairs  since 1973. \nPablo Cuadra/Getty Images \nThen take NBA MVP Steph Curry's partnership with Under Armour. The \"Chef\" Curry Two Low was torn apart on Twitter after its debut  because of its \"boring\" appearance.\nBut the shoes ended up performing very well , selling out in two days even though the shoes are not on limited offer like many of the collaborations that have star power behind them.\nPablo Cuadra/Getty Images \nYes, it's true that more athletic and fashion-oriented sneakers still sell extremely well. Jordan and Nike dominated the best-selling shoes in 2014,  and at least seven of the top 10 could be considered to fall in the more fashion-forward bucket. But it's important to remember the unsung sales heroes that often go neglected — these companies could not reach the sales numbers they tout without them.\nAfter all, \"boring\" is what many shoppers actually want. \n\"Quite frankly, we want to make stuff people will wear,\" Ryan Kuehl, Under Armour's vice president for sports marketing and sponsorships, told Business Insider earlier this year. He explained that Under Armour has found that consumers will generally choose blue, black, gray, or white clothing over another color like green or purple if they have a choice.\nThe flashier shoes are designed to create a halo effect, enshrining the brands in a holy glow that makes it feel trendy and cool, even if you are buying a sneaker from the discount section of Sears. The halo shoes are the ones that make the headlines and sell out in an hour, but it's the consistent and reliable success of dad-approved shoes like the Air Monarch, Stan Smith, and Chef Curry Two Low that are helping to make these brands real money.\nNOW WATCH: We finally learned the purpose of that extra shoelace hole on your sneakers \n",

      "text": "Adidas' Stan Smith shoes. Pablo Cuadra/Getty Images\nLike most retail companies, Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour frequently trumpet their latest and greatest models.\nBut don't confuse a sneaker's ability to attract attention with its ability to rake in money. In many cases the shoes that are padding these company's bottom lines are much more humble.\nSneaker sales in the US hit $17.2 billion in 2015, according to industry analyst NPD Group . Part of the secret to that success may be shoes you would never expect to be so popular.\nTake, for example, the Nike Air Monarch IV. The $65 sneaker is one of the brand's best-selling shoe by pairs sold, but you won't find the shoe at Nike's trendy 5th Avenue boutique store. It's more likely you'll find the cross-trainer on the more humble shelves of Kohl's, DSW, and JCPenney. It's a favorite of notables like Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll because of its comfort.\nThe Air Monarch is frequently referred to as one of the most popular in Nike's portfolio, and was even the top seller of 2013, according to Complex .\n\"Nike sells millions of pairs [of the Nike Air Monarch],\" Matt Powell of NPD Group recently told the Baltimore Sun .\nThe Air Monarch is by all accounts a boring shoe, meant neither to inspire nor offend. This makes it stand out in terms of the other shoes on the usual lists of bestsellers, including this ranking of the best-selling sneakers of August 2014, where it appears at number seven. But the shoe's mundane design could be precisely what attracts both older customers seeking something comfortable and acceptable, as well as some younger consumers looking to subvert trend-obsessed fashion attitudes. It's a crossover hit, which Racked called \"the holy grail.\"\nA photo posted by Tyler Glickman (@t_glick) on Jun 19, 2016 at 6:06am PDT\nAdidas' Stan Smiths, similarly, have been flying off the shelves for years now . The shoe is distinctive enough that designers, models, and moguls want to be seen with them on their feet, but they're not so outlandish and colorful that the average person would be wary of buying and wearing them.\nAnd indeed they do buy them, as the shoe has sold an estimated 40 million pairs since 1973.\nStan Smith wearing his eponymous shoes. Flickr/adifansnet\nThen take NBA MVP Steph Curry's partnership with Under Armour. The \"Chef\" Curry Two Low was torn apart on Twitter after its debut because of its \"boring\" appearance.\nBut the shoes ended up performing very well , selling out in two days even though the shoes are not on limited offer like many of the collaborations that have star power behind them.\nUnder Armour's Curry Two Low shoes. Renarts\nYes, it's true that more athletic and fashion-oriented sneakers still sell extremely well. Jordan and Nike dominated the best-selling shoes in 2014, and at least seven of the top 10 could be considered to fall in the more fashion-forward bucket. But it's important to remember the unsung sales heroes that often go neglected — these companies could not reach the sales numbers they tout without them.\nAfter all, \"boring\" is what many shoppers actually want.\n\"Quite frankly, we want to make stuff people will wear,\" Ryan Kuehl, Under Armour's vice president for sports marketing and sponsorships, told Business Insider earlier this year. He explained that Under Armour has found that consumers will generally choose blue, black, gray, or white clothing over another color like green or purple if they have a choice.\nThe flashier shoes are designed to create a halo effect, enshrining the brands in a holy glow that makes it feel trendy and cool, even if you are buying a sneaker from the discount section of Sears. The halo shoes are the ones that make the headlines and sell out in an hour, but it's the consistent and reliable success of dad-approved shoes like the Air Monarch, Stan Smith, and Chef Curry Two Low that are helping to make these brands real money.\nSEE ALSO: Nike's new science fiction-inspired, self-lacing sneakers will cost $720 a pair DON'T MISS: Adidas and Under Armour are locked in a bitter battle to be Nike's top US competitor — here's who's like NOW WATCH: We finally learned the purpose of that extra shoelace hole on your sneakers Loading video...

      "text": "Nike to Release All-White Air Max CB 34 Sneakers By Roger Krastz November 15, 2016 12:04 PM Nike \nAround the holiday season, Nike is known to treat its fans to some special releases and this year has proven to be no different. Releasing today, a new and never-before-seen iteration of Charles Barkley ‘s popular CB 34 silhouette, the Swoosh unleashes the all-white version of the basketball sneaker. \nSurprising a lot of sneakerheads with this release, the Swoosh quietly kept this shoe a secret, launching the silhouette earlier today on the brand’s website. Dressed in an all-white premium leather and nubuck upper, this Air Max CB34 is nicknamed the “Triple White” edition. To give the shoe a bit of a pop, the Swoosh adds hits of a metallic silver colorway throughout the canvas and insole of the shoes. Featuring a mid-foot strap on the tongue portion of the kicks, this CB 34 is rounded out by a white midsole and outsole, as well as a transparent Nike Air bubble unit on back heel. \nWith the sneakers now up for grabs on eBay, a general release date for this pair of Nike Air Max CB 34s still remains to be announced. For now, keep it locked with XXL to find out a general release date for the shoes as well as further Nike releases.

      "text": "You knew it was only a matter of time before Nike dropped a Black colorway of the Nike Air Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit . That time is fast approaching and it’s closer than you think. Here’a a first look at the Nike Air Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit Stealth.\nThis version of the recently brought back Nike Air Zoom Talaria comes in mid-top fashion and is done in a sweet Flyknit construction. Done in an all-Black colorway, the Flyknit overlay and Talaria prototypical overlays come together to create a sleek and seamless model. Additional features on the shoe include the D-ring lacing grommets and the revamped midsole that provides better traction. No release date yet but rumors suggest that shoe will be dropping by year’s end.\nvia: @SNEAKERPROPHET_ \nAuthor’s Take The sock-like fit gives the shoe a bit more of a lifestyle look. It’s not something I’d usually wear but I do appreciate the unique look of the shoe.\n\nThe post The Nike Air Zoom Talaria Mid Flyknit Stealth Is On The Way appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Tweet Kobe Bryant held the 13th — and first post-retirement — signature shoe release with Nike at the MAMA gallery in downtown Los Angeles. It had a very morbid feel, so Micah Peters of The Ringer , asked Bryant about death in the literal sense, and the death of his basketball career. via The Ringer : We are sitting on top of a Mesoamerican muralist painting of a clock basically being orbited by specters of past versions of yourself, with past versions of your shoe. I got to ask, because I feel like the setting’s begging for it: What’s your relationship with death? A comfortable one. Yeah? It’s a comfortable one. It’s an understanding. You can’t have life without death. Can’t have light without the dark. So it’s an acceptance of that. When it came time to decide whether or not I should retire, [it was] really an acceptance of that mortality that all athletes face. And if you combat it, you’ll always have that inner struggle within yourself. … So … I’m comfortable with it. In The Wall Street Journal , you said that you’d been planning this phase as early as three years back. What was the moment that made you decide to start planning? Well, the injury. When I injured my Achilles, then it became something where it’s, OK, this is immediate, right? The end of my career could be now. So since I was 21 years old and thinking, OK, I have to figure out what comes next. You kind of brainstorm, you ideate, but you never really execute anything. And when the injury happened, I said, “OK, no, I need to start building now.” And that’s when the turning point was for me. What does a turning point feel like? If you have something that’s been a part of you for two decades, it’s kind of like a part of yourself dies, obviously, with where we’re sitting. It’s exciting. It’s exciting? It is exciting, because it’s the process of starting anew. When I’m sitting there and I have the Achilles injury, it’s one thing to sit there and try to block out the frustrations of being injured, because that’s … You’re constantly tugging with that, right, as opposed to simply replacing that with a new challenge. Something that gets you excited. So now you’re not focused on not being depressed. You’re focused on the excitement of building something new. And so, it was extremely exciting, having to figure something out. It’s like trying to find a new version of yourself. Yes. And build it from the ground up.",

      "text": "Share \nNike just opened a new, 55,000-square-foot location in New York City’s trendiest shopping district, SoHo — and it’s a sight to see. The five-level store sells all of Nike’s multi-sport brands and also features a host of customization options, trial centers and digital additions for a fully immersive purchasing experience. \nThe sportswear retail giant’s new store features multiple product testing centers where consumers can try out products for the best fit with the help of in-store athletics consultants. And they do so with the help of digital screens providing fitness ambiance. \nThere’s a basketball trial zone the size of a half court with 23-foot ceilings and an adjustable hoop––complete with videos of NYC’s courts. There’s also a soccer trial zone where shoppers can try out cleats on a synthetic turf field. As if that weren’t enough, two running centers allow customers to try out shoes on a treadmill surrounded by screens that can show footage of Central Park or the West Side Highway. \nOn the new store, Heidi O’Neill, Nike’s president of global direct-to-consumer, is quoted as saying, “We’re leading the transformation of sports retail — offering the best of Nike products, services and experiences under one roof. With Nike SoHo, we can realize the promise of personalized performance.” \nNike posted disappointing earnings in late September of this year. Although they beat Wall Street’s estimates, they also project weak future sales. \nThe new store is perhaps an indication of future physical retail endeavors for Nike and others to compete with online retail proliferation. Stores can rely more on immersive, in-store digital retail experiences and increased customization as a means to draw foot traffic back into the brick-and-mortar — as shown by recent moves by Ballard Designs , for example.",

      "text": "Previous Next \nWith the noise being made about the HyperAdapt 1.0 approaching a crescendo Nike have weighed in to dispel rumours with official release information. Previous reports that priced the shoe at $720USD were bang on, but the release dates are a touch more complicated. \nYou will be able to get the HyperAdapt on December 1, but it will only be the ‘Black/White/Blue Lagoon’ pair. NIKE+ members will have the opportunity to secure the pair from New York’s NIKE+ ClubHouse and Soho store. There they’ll have the chance to learn about and even try on the product. But they won’t be the first. A smaller group of members will be able to pick the self-lacing sneaker up before anyone else. They’ll be chosen using the ‘Reserved for You’ system, and then offered the opportunity to purchase. Finally, the ‘Black/White/Blue Lagoon’ and ‘Metallic Silver/Black/White’ colourways will be available to those in the NIKE+ clan later in December. \nNotably absent from this information is the white and gum pair. It’s possible that they could be a more esteemed release in the vein of an HTM – though, at that stage, prices could get a little scary. \nMore self-lacing Nikes:",

Reports circulating recently have slated the HyperAdapt 1.0 to retail for a cool $1000USD, which has rightly caused a mix reaction from many people. No doubt a shoe with the research and development process on the scale of the HyperAdapt is going to be pricey – but word is, it will be a little easier on the pocket than once thought. \nNews from sneaker personality Jacques Slade reports that a retail price and a (new) release date have been confirmed by Nike. The self-lacing futuristic silhouette will release on December 1 in three colourways; black, white and grey. The elation of a confirmed drop date may be diluted slightly for some sneakerheads though with Nike indicating that – though still cheaper than a thousand bucks – they’ll wear a price tag of $720 USD and will only release in limited numbers. Naturally, nothing can be sure until you see the bottom line at the check out. But just in case, start stacking your cash if you’re keen to cop – these won’t last long no matter the ticket. \nMore self-lacing Nikes:",

But they're not going to be cheap. Nike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 -- a whopping $720. By Ahiza Garcia \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike's self-lacing sneakers. But they're not going to be cheap. \nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 -- a whopping $720. \nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike's Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse. \nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app. \nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time. \nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month. \nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public. \nIt's different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in \"Back to the Future.\" Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery. \nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling -- the way snow boots or roller blades tighten. \n\"When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it's perfect,\" said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers. \nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe's battery life, which lasts about two weeks. \nTM &© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "(Photo: Nike) Converse's  Counter Climate Boot collection packs plenty of climate-battling capability, but the designs have thus far been reliably muted and simple. However, the brand-new  Chuck Taylor All Star II Thermo Boot  kicks things up a notch with diamond patterning and an army green and black colorway, among other eye-catching details.\nThese rugged, waterproof sneakerboots visually pop thanks to their contrasting materials. For starters, Nike's trademark Lunarlon cushioning has been wrapped in a tinted rubber shell, making for a plush and cushiony interior that will keep your feet comfy as you're slogging through all manner of rain and snow. Basically they're as warm and inviting as your favorite winter boot, but they come equipped with the sleek and active aesthetic of a high-top sneaker.\n(Photo: Nike) (Photo: Nike) For added effect, the heel counter in the back and toe cap in the front have been coated in dark silver 3M reflective material, which maintains its sheen even in dim lighting.\n(Photo: Nike) Want to pick up a pair? You can order the Chuck Taylor All Star II Thermo Boot in army green or deep black for $150 at  Nike's online store .",

      "title": "10 Oregon High Schools Launch Future You: Nike School Innovation Fund ...",
      "text": "Thumbnail November 15, 2016 03:00 PM Eastern Standard Time \nBEAVERTON, Ore.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Today, more than 20 Nike leaders hosted students and educators from ten Portland, Parkrose, Beaverton, Hillsboro and Salem-Keizer high schools at the Nike World Headquarters for a one-day “FUTURE YOU” workshop designed to inspire students and high school educators to envision their futures. \nFUTURE YOU is a two-part program aimed at further fueling innovative, future-thinking in education. The first part is a process that school teams go through to find their authentic voice and vision to serve their specific students. The second part is an implementation strategy to bring staff, students, parents and the community along on the journey to make school more student-centered and better engage kids in their own future. \n“Schools are the key to kids’ futures; that’s why we’re creating resources to help them—so students can find a unique view of who they are and what they can be,” said Ken Black, Nike Vice President, Digital Design Transformation, who has been instrumental in creating FUTURE YOU. “The cool thing is, it’s also relevant to a teacher or families or communities that want to find and own their own vision. The brilliance of every kid has a home somewhere. We want to help prepare them for whatever that will be.” \nThese ten Oregon high schools are piloting FUTURE YOU, with the goal of making the framework and toolkit available to others next year, so schools across the country can apply it: Beaverton, Southridge and Sunset from Beaverton School District; Century and Liberty from Hillsboro School District; Parkrose from the Parkrose School District; Lincoln, Madison and Roosevelt from Portland Public Schools; McNary from Salem-Keizer School District. \nDan Goods, who leads the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory team to develop creative ways of communicating and transform complex concepts into meaningful stories that can be universally understood, helped kick-off the day-long workshop. Representatives from AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) , EPIC (Educational Policy Improvement Center) , and Nike School Innovation Fund partners also attended the session. AVID’s research-based strategies and curriculum provide educators with training to better prepare students for success in high school, college or a career. EPIC is a nonprofit consulting group that strives to help educators better equip students for success. \nFUTURE YOU Inspired by Beaverton High School \nFUTURE YOU was inspired by Innovation Schools work at Beaverton High School supported by the Nike School Innovation Fund that helped the school kick-start the concept that has now evolved into the ten-school pilot. Members of the school administration and faculty, along with Nike leaders, have used FUTURE YOU to create a visioning framework to focus and align student and faculty efforts, so all students graduate prepared for and excited about the futures they choose. \nFUTURE YOU will also help Beaverton High School Principal Anne Erwin and her staff respond to shifting realities—economic and technical: “Every space in our school needs to be a 21st century learning site—the library, choir room, weight room and every classroom,” she said. \nNike talent development experts shared “design thinking” strategies with Beaverton High School to help shape FUTURE YOU, focusing on staff and students needs first and foremost. “FUTURE YOU is not what I or other administrators have decided is the way to solve a particular problem,” says Erwin. “This process helps us think about how we will work collaboratively toward effective change.” \nSaid Nike’s Ken Black, “I hope this goes wherever there’s a kid who needs a glimpse of what their life could be.” \nAbout NIKE, Inc. \nNIKE, Inc., based near Beaverton, Oregon, is the world’s leading designer, marketer and distributor of authentic athletic footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories for a wide variety of sports and fitness activities. Wholly-owned NIKE, Inc. subsidiary brands include Converse, which designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories; and Hurley, which designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories.

The Fund provides resources to support key program innovations in schools with the goal of increasing the number of students who graduate on time and preparing them to succeed after graduation, as well as personal involvement from Nike leaders and partners. \nNike School Innovation Fund has also paired Nike leaders with ten schools for its Innovation Schools program. \nAs a part of this program, each principal and Nike Leader team works independently on innovative programs that address specific and unique needs of their students and school. Nike is working to make sure the results are sustainable, scalable and transformative across the state, so students can walk into any classroom, and expect a rigorous and relevant education. http://about.nike.com/pages/nike-school-innovation-fund Contacts",

The Nike LunarCharge combines and borrows characteristics from a variety of classic Nike Sportswear models, including the Air Presto, Air Max 90, and the Nike Air Current. The Nike LunarCharge features a neoprene upper with, a bootie construction on the inner liner, and a cushioned outsole for comfort. This debut black/grey/speckled colorway is scheduled to arrive at retailers on November 18th for $120. Will you cop?\nimages: Titolo \nAuthor’s Take I like it. The inspiration reminds of how adidas created the NMD, taking retro silhouettes and creating something new and modern.

      "title": "Nike's \"Back to the Future\" Shoe to Hit Shelves Soon (NKE)",
      "text": "Nike’s HyperAdapt 1.0 Is Uber-Expensive (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | November 15, 2016 — 2:53 PM EST \nNIKE, Inc. ( NKE ) is a highly innovative company, and its E.A.R.L technology (Electro Adaptive Reactive Lacing) for its HyperAdapt 1.0 self-lacing shoes is genius. The technology was inspired by similar shoes seen in Back to the Future II . We also can safely assume that the HyperAdapt 1.0 isn’t intended to be mass produced, which is based on the price point. Therefore, you have to wonder at Nike’s real strategy here. (See also, Nike Declares it is a Growth Company ) \nThe original rumor was that the HyperAdapt 1.0 would sell for $1,000, but it has since been confirmed that the HyperAdapt 1.0 will sell for “only” $720. The shoes will go on sale on December 1 at two Nike New York City stores, and they will be available at other select locations later in the month. If you happen to be a Nike+ member that took advantage of the “Reserved for You” app, then you might be getting your pair of HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes on November 28. Either way, the shoes come in black, white, or gray, and they have the following features: Pressure sensor tightens shoes when you put them on Magnetic adapter to charge shoes Fully recharge after three hours Battery life lasts up to two hours Button on tongue of shoe lets user tighten or loosen laces \nIt should be noted that the actual laces on the shoes are just for show. \nAs far as Nike’s strategy here, that remains a mystery. An educated guess would be that Nike is looking to drive excitement for the shoes now at a high price point, knowing that it will lower prices for future versions of the shoe. In other words, Nike might be attempting to drive future demand by making the HyperAdapt a hard-to-get item now. However, this is just speculation. It would be surprising if the HyperAdapt 1.0 had a material impact on Nike’s overall revenue in the near future. \nNKE has depreciated 18.66% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.26%.",

      "text": "Wearables Plus points for the Apple Watch Nike+ The Apple Watch Nike+ has built-in GPS to track distance and speed for walks and runs without the need to take along your iPhone for GPS tracking. PHOTOS: APPLE The Apple Watch Nike+ has built-in GPS to track distance and speed for walks and runs without the need to take along your iPhone for GPS tracking. PHOTOS: APPLE Published Deputy Tech Editor \nThe Apple Watch Nike+ is the latest link to my 10-year running relationship with Nike+. \nIt started in 2006 with the Nike+ iPod Sports Kit. It consists of a receiver for the iPod nano music player and a sensor that you insert into the sole of a Nike+ running shoe. \nThe kit tracks the distance covered, timing and calories burnt during your runs, as you listen to music on the iPod nano. \nOver the years, I have moved on to Nike+ FuelBand fitness tracker and then Nike+ SportWatch GPS running watch. \nI have also accumulated more than 1.3 million NikeFuel points - Nike's own measure for tracking physical activity. \nIn fact, I chose TomTom Spark Cardio as my running watches in recent months, because it can collect NikeFuel points. \nSo, the first thing I wanted to find out about the Apple Watch Nike+ is if it collects NikeFuel points. It does. \nAnd I'm glad, because otherwise, the Apple Watch Nike+ would just be an Apple Watch Series 2 with a Nike-styled perforated rubber watch band and several Nike+ watch faces not found in other Apple Watch Series 2 models. \nYou can swop the perforated watch band of Apple Watch Nike+ with any supported metallic watch band and it will look like a formal watch. And when you need to run, swop back to the perforated watch band. \nTECH SPECS \nVALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5 \nOVERALL: 4/5 \nThe Apple Watch Nike+ has built-in GPS to track distance and speed for walks and runs without the need to take along your iPhone for GPS tracking. \nThe major highlight is the integration of Nike+ Run Club (NRC) app. You will be prompted to sign in with your NRC account or create an account during the initial pairing of the Apple Watch Nike+ with your iPhone. \nYou will then get the NRC app on the smartwatch, which activates the Nike+ watch faces. I like all of the Nike+ watch faces. They range from a big and visible digital watch face to a minimalist analogue watch face. The watch faces really go well with the watch band in terms of colour combination. \nAll the watch faces have the NRC app shortcut, so you can access the app quickly. And some watch faces will show your last run, as if trying to coax you to better that distance. If you have not been running for a few days, you get prompts to do so. \nWhen you go for your run, just tap on the NRC shortcut on the watch face. Tap on Start, wait for the 3-2-1 countdown and run. \nDuring runs, only the elapsed time and distance will be displayed. But you can have the pace and heart rate by turning on \"Advanced\" in the NRC watch app setting. \nWhile you can get the same NRC app on the Series 2 watches, and it will work in the same way, you will be missing out on the Nike+ watch faces and the more ventilated perforated watch band. Since the Nike+ model is priced the same as a Sport Series 2, you might as well get the former. \nLike the Apple Watch Series 2, I found the GPS distance tracking readings to be not much differentfrom my TomTom Spark Cardio, differing by only less than 20m. Battery life is similar to the Series 2, lasting around two days with notifications on. \nSimilar to the Series 2, Apple Watch Nike+ is water-resistant to a depth of 50m, so you can go swimming while wearing it. \nHowever, there is no option in the NRC app for swimming. You have to use the native Workout app to track your swims. In other words, there are no NikeFuel points to earn here. The same goes to other exercises, such as cycling and yoga. Guess I have to stick to running. \n•Verdict: If you are a NikeFuel point addict (like myself) and just run to keep fit, the Apple Watch Nike+ is probably the only smartwatch and running watch combined into one that you will ever need.

Jamie Feldman Fashion & Lifestyle   \nLadies and gentlemen, the future is finally back. \nNike first announced its upcoming self-lacing sneaker in March, and Wired reported on the shoes’ jaw-dropping capabilities in the video above in October. But now we have even more information on the seemingly magical HyperAdapt 1.0 , which will be available for purchase Dec. 1. \nBefore you Marty McFly to your local Nike store for a pair of your own, be forewarned: You won’t be able to get your hands on a pair without a hefty wad of cash ― $720 ― and an appointment. \nThe super cool sneaks contain a sensor that automatically starts the self-lacing mechanism when you insert your feet, plus two buttons to loosen or tighten the laces to the wearer’s desire. The lacing system works off a rechargeable battery and the shoes boast an LED light to display how much battery is left. \nAs Wired explains in the video above, the sneakers are said to be ideal in an athletic event like a marathon or basketball game, when every second spent tying and re-tying shoes is crucial. Or, you know, when you want to impress your friends. Nike It could be yours, for a price. \nIn a statement released last week, Nike revealed that the shoe will initially be available at two locations in New York City’s Soho neighborhood starting Dec. 1: the Nike store and the Nike+ Clubhouse. \n“Consumers can learn about and trial the product at a retail price of $720 ,” the statement reads. \nThose wishing to book an appointment can visit the Nike website or the Nike+ app. A spokeswoman for the brand told The Huffington Post that more information will become available later next week, and all new developments will be posted to the Nike news site . The brand also stated that “a small group of NIKE+ app users” will have early access to the shoes on Nov. 28, before a wider release in two colorways later in December. HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available in the U.S. at select Nike retail locations.

Other details include a black mesh upper, an embroidered “45” on the heel, a Concord Jumpman on the ankle, a white midsole and an icy blue outsole. With the Space Jam movie celebrating its 20th anniversary today the timing to release the shoe’s official images couldn’t have been any better.\nDropping on December 10th, will you be going after a pair? Retail price will be $220. Click and bookmark our official Air Jordan 11 Space Jam 2016 launch page now for more images, videos, the latest info and release details.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take Looking forward to picking up a pair.

      "text": "The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Is One of the Most Expensive Running Shoes Ever By Facebook The HyperAdapt 1.0 will tie itself—but that lazy guy luxury comes at a price. \nNike's big theme in 2016: self-lacing sneakers. After 30+ years, the brand finally released the Back to the Future -inspired Mags last month (which raised millions for The Michael J. Fox Foundation, including $200,000 on a single pair just a couple days ago). But the self-lacing tech wasn't just for fun. Back in April , the brand unveiled the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, a running shoe that self-laces, providing what Nike deems an unprecedented level of comfort. Apparently all this futuristic tech, not to mention that time and effort that went into its development, means the sneaker comes with a hefty price—the shoes will retail for $720, making them one of the most expensive Nike sneakers ever. \nOn one hand, that basically makes the Nike HyperAdapt cost as much as an iPhone. On the other, sneakers that don't offer more than some particularly nice leather get sold every day at higher prices. But here's the kicker: like your phone, the Nike HyperAdapt needs to be charged. Tiffany Beers, a senior innovator at Nike, told Wired in September that a full charge takes three hours and lasts about two weeks. It's tough to say whether people will be willing to pay the price for self-lacing shoes in addition to accepting the added chore of charging your shoes like you do your phone. (If you're like us, you're running out of outlets in your house at this point.) \nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available on December 1 at Nike's 45 Grand space (which normally used for workout classes), and later that month at additional Nike stores.",

      "title": "Nike (NKE) Unveils Price and Release Date For The Futuristic HyperAdapt 1.0",
      "text": "On Monday, Nike ( NKE - Free Report ) unveiled the release date and price for their highly anticipated HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe. After months of speculation, it was reported that the revolutionary shoe will be released on December 1, at the steep price of $720.\nWhat makes this shoe so highly regarded is the new technology Nike has created that allows the shoe to self-lace itself. The idea is that the HyperAdapt 1.0 will be able to create a secure, unique feel for each individual. It will provide stability, support and style all while adjusting to the individual’s foot.\nNike's CEO Mark Parker believes that this technology is going to change the sneaker world for the better. In an interview with CNBC , Parker stated, \"It's great to be able to put a product out there that is a step toward the future of adaptive performance. The performance that adapts to you real-time to suit your needs as an athlete is going to be a part of product more and more as we head into the future.\"\nA major issue for athletes, or anyone who loves sneakers, is the fact that not every shoe can fit each person's foot perfectly. Parker and his team of designers believe they have eliminated this issue. The goal, according to Nike designer Tinker Hatfield, is to develop a shoe that can sense when it needs to adjust itself. \"Wouldn’t it be great if a shoe, in the future, could sense when you needed to have it tighter or looser? Could it take you even tighter than you’d normally go if it senses you really need extra snugness in a quick maneuver? That’s where we’re headed. In the future, product will come alive.\" This may be years down the line, but Nike is definitely heading in the right direction with the HyperAdapt 1.0 .\nThere are no reported sales projections for the HyperAdapt 1.0 , but the steep price for the product may turn some casual customers away. Considering this shoe is a first-of-its-kind product, it makes sense why it is retailing at $720. There will be plenty of sneaker heads ready to pay this steep price in order to get their hands on this remarkable pair of shoes. The shoes will be released in three sharp color ways , Metallic Silver/White-Black, Black/Blue Lagoon-Landscape-White, and White/White-White.\nCurrently, NKE is trading at an even $50.00 as of 12:45pm CT. Zacks Rank has Nike at a #3 (Hold) and a VGM grade of ‘C’. Check back later in the week to see how Nike’s Zack Rank may adjust.\nStocks that Aren't in the News…Yet \nYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge. Many of these companies are almost unheard of by the general public and just starting to get noticed by Wall Street.

      "text": "Share Bella Hadid criticised as too abnormally thin to be new Nike face Yahoo7 Be - Yahoo7 \nShe’s just landed a campaign with one of the world’s biggest brands, but Bella Hadid has been targeted on social media for being too skinny after announcing she’s one of Nike’s new faces. Bella Hadid Poses Nude Just Like Gigi Hadid in Magazine UP NEXT \nThe model, who is also making her Victoria’s Secret show debut next month, posted an Instagram snap announcing the news. Bella excitedly announced her partnership with Nike just days ago. Photo: Instagram/bellahadid \n“I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon,” she wrote. \nBut it wasn’t long before people were commenting on the 20-year-old’s post, claiming her shape wasn’t in line with the athletic ethos of the brand. Bella's announcement has seen the model targeted over her newly slender shape. Photo: Getty images \n“This is why young girls get eating disorders, when being abnormally thin is glorified. Well done @nike,” wrote one user. \n“I love how so many athletic companies are signing models now and not athletes because they know people look up to models more then they lookup to people with real talent,” added another. \n“Nike? She's not an athlete but more importantly it's giving young girls unrealistic expectations yet again,” reads another comment. “Why not use @theashleygraham come on now @NIKE have some sense.” The model's gruelling three hour workouts and strict diet has seen her slim down in preparation for the upcoming Victoria's Secret show. Photo: Instagram/bellahadid \nBella admits she’s been working hard with Victoria's Secret trainer Rob Piela in the leadup to the show in December. \n\"I’ve been eating hard protein every day, and working out for three hours every day,” she told People. “It’s crazy but I think that if you set your mind to something, I think you can succeed.” Bella posed nude for French Vogue three months ago, showing off a much more voluptuous shape. Photo: Instagram/bellahadid \nIt’s seen the model shed kilos from her already small frame. \n“I really didn't mean to [lose weight],” she admits. “Like I want boobs. I want my ass back. But it's not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody's and I think that if people are gonna judge, that's the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.\" ",

      "text": "Nike, Under Armour and New Balance Taglines Appear in the Same Ad -- for Alibaba Agency Fred & Farid Mashes Up 30 Taglines for E-Commerce Giant By Angela Doland.   \nNov. 11, not Black Friday, is the world's biggest shopping day. It's when China's Alibaba Group puts on its annual one-day e-commerce mega-festival, called Singles Day or Double 11. Shoppers just spent $17.8 billion in 24 hours on Alibaba's platforms. There were about 100,000 brands and merchants peddling their wares at the same time. \nSo how do you advertise such a huge, complex event? Fred & Farid Shanghai strung together 30 famous brand taglines in one video for Alibaba's Tmall platform. That meant convincing all the brands to get on board, including competitors like Nike, New Balance, Under Armour and Vans, and join together in the same video. Alibaba has that kind of clout; some brands are said to do a month's worth of sales in a single day during Double 11. \nThe ad, called \"All in One,\" also includes Levi's, L'Oreal Paris, Dove, Evian, Beats and Johnnie Walker. All the footage was shot just for this ad. The original was in Chinese; this is a full-length version with the slogans in English. There were also four TV commercials, one 60-second and three 30-second versions, as well as an outdoor and radio component.  ",

      "text": "Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes: $720. Donning self-lacing sneakers, a puffer vest, and calculator watch like Marty McFly: Priceless.\nThe high-tech footwear— envisioned nearly 30 years ago in the Back to the Future films and unveiled in March —is Nike's first attempt at adaptive lacing. \"The shoe translates deep research in digital, electrical, and mechanical engineering into a product designed for movement,\" Nike says.\nThe technology does sound pretty far out: When you step into the shoe, your heel triggers a sensor, and the system will automatically tighten; two buttons on the side allow you to adjust \"until it's perfect,\" project technical lead Tiffany Beers said earlier this year.\n\nA handful of Nike+ app users will gain early access to the shoes on Nov. 28, but HyperAdapt 1.0 officially goes on sale to the public on Dec. 1. Additional details about booking appointments for the \"experience and purchase\" of the sneakers will be posted online and in the mobile app.\n\"The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 is the first step into the future of adaptive performance,\" the manufacturer said in March, and \"makes feasible the once-fantastic concept of an automated, nearly symbiotic relationship between the foot and shoe.\"\nInitially available in either black or white (with a touch of \"Blue Lagoon\" coloring), the HyperAdapt will launch in metallic silver or black with white accents \"later in December,\" according to Nike.",

Take \"Space Jam\" for example. Would you believe that Wayne Knight -- aka Newman from \"Seinfeld\" -- got second billing behind only Michael Jordan?\nIt's chopping up a detail like this that is all part of the nostalgia as \"Space Jam\" officially turns 20 on November 15.\nNike is celebrating the occasion with a global campaign pegged around two retro Air Jordans as seen in the 1996 classic plus a new cut that serves as a homage.\nThe Air Jordan IX and XI are the editions immortalized in the movie. The XXXI is a nod to the color scheme and sensibility of the XI while integrating more recent technology such as a Flyweave upper.\nJordan Brand's vice president/creative director David Creech broke it all down for us during a special screening on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. Check out the video above for some sights and sounds of the event along with Creech's design insight.\nThe IX and XXXI are scheduled for release on December 3. The XI will be available December 10 at Jordan.com and select Jordan retailers.\n'Space Jam' Turns 20, Nike Celebrates With 2 Retro Air Jordans ThePostGame.com ThePostGame.com On the occasion of the iconic film's birthday, there is also a new shoe -- the XXXI -- that serves as a homage.

But we bet you haven’t seen a Nike SB Paul Rodriguez 9 like this before. The Nike P Rod 9 is back in action for this Holiday 2016 season with a flashy colorway, quite literally. The Reflect Silver tint features unique 3M reflective material on the piping throughout in as head-turning a colorway we’ve seen of the P Rod 9 yet. Nike Skateboarding has been fairly experimental with this model throughout its release slate with Air Jordan inspirations, revamped Elite and R/R renditions, and much more. \nWhat do you think of this fully reflective P Rod 9 release? Check out more detailed shots below and grab your pair on November 22nd for $140 USD from select retailers and on Nike.com .

If you were pipped at checkout trying to secure any of 2016’s Pippens, then you’ll be happy to know that there’s another Uptempo coming. \nThe ‘Reflective’ Air More Uptempo is a twist on the classic ‘Black/White’ number. Black abounds on the upper like the original, but white around the oversized ‘AIR’ branding has been swapped for a reflective outline. The laces have also been threaded with the light-reflecting material to make any of you flashy on-court footwork even flashier. \nThe Reflective Nike Air More Uptempo doesn’t have a release date just yet, stay with us and you’ll know as soon as it does.",

      "text": "AKM-GSI Bella Hadid just landed a major fitness contract with Nike and unveiled a giant billboard in NYC. But if certain Instagram commenters have any say, the ad should just go away completely.\n“I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️👟🏁,” Bella announced alongside a photo of herself looking up at the huge campaign image in amazement.\n🏁so excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️👟🏁\nA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST\nWhile some Instagram users seized the moment to congratulate her and tell her how proud they are of her, others felt compelled to scold her and the activewear retailer. Specifically, these followers took issue with her body, deeming it unsuitable to represent a fitness brand. “Yeh this is why young girls get eating disorders, when being abnormally thin is glorified,” wrote one upset commenter. “Well done @nike.”\nComments on Bella Hadid’s Instagram announcement about her Nike deal. Instagram/ Krystalina Tom More chimed in, declaring, “Nike? She’s not an athlete but more importantly it’s giving young girls unrealistic expectations yet again. Why not use [Ashley Graham] come on now @NIKE have some sense,” and, “Too thin to represent [a] fitness label I’m quite shocked. Your ribs are almost sticking out.”\n Outrage continued with questions from “fans” and mocking statements. “So we’re just gonna sit here and act like dis ok?” another follower asked, while still more chided Bella with, “I love how so many athletic companies are signing models now and not athletes because they know people look up to models more [than] they lookup to people with real talent.”\nInterestingly enough, Bella admitted herself that she had lost a little too much weight training for her upcoming first walk down the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show runway.\nBut she most likely wouldn't agree with the shade she's getting. “I didn’t really mean to [lose weight],” she told People of her workout routine. “Like I want boobs. I want my ass back. But it’s not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.\n“I worked out so hard and everybody is like, ‘Oh, she looks so skinny blah, blah, blah. But I think that if you just stick to something you can really achieve so much. I’ve been eating hard protein every day, and working out for three hours every day. It’s crazy but I think that you know if you set your mind to something I think you can succeed.”\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.

      "title": "Over 14 Million People in North-East Need Help - UNOCHA",
      "text": "Nigeria: Bill to Strengthen Anti-Terrorism Law Scales Second Reading By Nike Adebowale The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), has revealed that over 14 million people living in the north-east region of Nigeria are in serious need of help. It warned that many lives would be lost if the people were not attended to urgently. The United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Nigeria, Peter Lundberg, disclosed this to journalists in Abuja on Tuesday. He attributed the suffering of the people to the dwindling in-flow of funds from donor partners. Mr. Lundberg said over 26 million people were likely affected by the crisis, with 14 milloon people already identified to be in urgent need of assistance to survive. He said out of the 400,000 children said to be suffering severe famine and malnutrition, 75,000 of them may die in a few months if urgent intervention was not given. Mr. Lundberg explained that the declining in-flow of funds may hamper humanitarian intervention in the region, a situation he said can lead to the death of millions of people in the area, particularly children. While noting that the region is at the verge of a humanitarian crisis of global proportion, the World body lamented that the funds so far received for 2016 is a far cry from budgeted expenditure. The envoy, who blamed the shortfall on what he described as a multitude of complexity facing the world, said out of the $485 million budgeted for 2016; only $180 million had so far been received, thereby creating a huge gap in tackling the situation. He therefore called on Nigerians, particularly the rich, to contribute no matter how small, in order to prevent the disaster and also ameliorate the plight of the suffering in the region. \"We need to reach out to the private sector. Most of these children are already experiencing changes in the colour of their hairs and skin and may likely die due to weak immune system\", Mr. Lunberg said. 'Nigeria is a rich country and there are a lot of rich people that have the capacity to give and are also willing to do so\", he said. The coordinator disclosed that his agency, apart from intervening in the area of food and health, was also assisting in water and sanitation, shelter, education and empowerment amongst others. Mr. Lundberg said as part of measures to effectively reach the people, the organization has concluded plans to establish a humanitarian hub that would bring staff of the agency and other partners closer to the people.

      "text": "Nike Designer Shares First Prototype of Self-Lacing Shoes A piece of sneaker history. By Brendan Dunne \nIt's 2016 and self-lacing sneakers are finally a reality. The road to the production of models like Nike's Mag and Hyperadapt was a long one, with Swoosh innovators like Tiffany Beers starting on the former's design 10 years ago. On Tuesday, Beers posted the above photo on her Instagram of the first Nike Mag prototype. \nThe shoe is a far cry from the sleek 2016 release, this early version coming with a battery pack and winding wires sticking out its top. \nReaders can learn more about the painstaking steps Nike took to get these Marty McFly shoes right in this feature from Sole Collector on the 2011 version of the sneaker.

      "text": "The lower three floors of the buildings are a flagship store that is a collaboration between Nike's Jordan Brand and Foot Locker's Footaction store. The space includes an indoor basketball court and a strength and conditioning facility. \nUpper floors of the buildings are mostly vacant, although some space is used for storage. \n“This asset is located in one of Chicago's prime shopping district amongst high profile tenants such as Macy's, Zara, Anthropologie and the 120,000 square foot CityTarget concept which attracts a high volume of foot traffic,” Sam Floor, a TH Real Estate senior director who is the firm's regional leader in Chicago and Boston, said in a statement. “The property is 100 percent leased to a Foot Locker flagship location, providing stable, long term income for our investors.” \nTH Real Estate bought the property on behalf of an account for individual investors, TIAA spokeswoman Daisy Okas said. TH Real Estate, a real estate investment manager, had $97 billion in assets under management as of mid-2016. \nThe TH Real Estate venture is essentially buying the revenue from a 15-year lease that began in 2015. The Nike and Foot Locker venture leases the entire 96,354-square-foot building. Only about 24,000 square feet is used as store space, according to Thor. \nThe State Street flagship is known for attracting long lines of customers during releases of products such as limited-edition Jordan shoes. \nLonger term, upper floors of the building could eventually be redeveloped into offices, said Michael Marks, a Cushman & Wakefield senior director who represented Thor in the sale. \nTH Real Estate's purchase is the latest of several large deals this year on State Street, a main shopping strip in a strong Loop retail market. Overall Loop retail vacancy fell in 2015 to its lowest level since at least 2002, according to Chicago-based Stone Real Estate. \nAlready in 2016, New York-based Madison Capital paid $267 million for the Sullivan Center and then flipped the retail portion of the landmark building to Acadia Realty Trust for almost $147 million. \nIn another deal, Rye, N.Y.-based Acadia paid $150 million for a portfolio of Smithfield Properties buildings that included the Walgreens flagship store at State and Randolph streets. Also included in that deal was retail space at State and Washington streets that includes another Walgreens store, as well as Nordstrom Rack and H&M clothing stores. \nAcross the street from the Jordan flagship store, Chicago-based L3 paid $10.45 million for retail on the bottom two floors of the Mentor Building, 39 S. State St. \nAbout a block farther south, New York-based Tishman Realty has signed leases for a Champs Sports flagship store and offices for co-working firm WeWork in the former Amalgamated Bank headquarters at 100 and 112 S. State St. Tishman Realty bought the building in 2015. \n“There's been no shortage of demand on State Street,” Marks said. “Rents on State Street are less daunting than on Michigan Avenue, and it's a celebrated and historic corridor. You've got more reasonable rents and very robust sales.” \nAfter Thor bought the connected buildings in 2002, it later leased lower floors of the property to Forever 21, which has since moved to nearby 10 S. State St. \nThor hired a Cushman & Wakefield team of brokers led by Marks to seek a sale in March. At the time, Marks said the property was expected to sell for somewhere in the range of $45 million to $50 million. \n“After upgrading 26-34 South State Street and successfully leasing the retail space, we felt the time was right to sell the highly desirable building in the heart of the Chicago Loop,” Thor CEO Joseph Sitt said in a statement. \nThor continues to own retail properties at 36 and 133 S. State St., as well as the Palmer House Hilton hotel and several properties in Chicago's fast-developing Fulton Market district.",

      "text": "Starting December 1, Nike’s HyperAdapt 1.0, the world’s first self-lacing sneaker will finally be available for purchase, but only in two stores, both located in New York City. If you can find your way to Nike’s Soho location or the Nike+ ClubHouse, then you can purchase the brand new shoes at a whopping $720.\nThe HyperAdapt will be the first self-lacing shoe Nike has released for public purchase. They did release the Nike Mag, a replica of the shoes made popular in the Back to the Future film series, however those were only available to 83 fans determined through a lottery.\nThe laces will work like automatic buckling, like a pair of snow boots or roller blades would tighten. Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers went into more detail with CNN saying, “When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.”\nThey also boast being lightweight and fully rechargeable. An LED censor at the bottom of the shoe will let you know how much battery life you have left, and a normal charge sustains about two weeks of life.\nNike has announced its self-lacing shoe will hit stores in New York City – and they're all yours for just $720 https://t.co/KUKN8xg1JW pic.twitter.com/IwBfzxgMX2 \n— CNN (@CNN) November 15, 2016 \n\nVia CNN ",

      "text": "Nike's Self-Lacing Sneakers Are Not Exactly Affordable \nHow much would you pay for a laceless life? Most Popular By Pete Forester Nov 16, 2016 One of the most exciting developments in footwear this year is the appearance of auto-lacing. The technology of a self-lacing shoe was first imagined up by Tinker Hatfield, the legendary sneaker designer who brought us most of the first dozen Air Jordans. He fabricated the idea for Back to the Future: Part II , predicting future footwear that laced itself. The shoe became the Nike Mag, a sneaker so far ahead of its time that none but the dreamers ever thought that it would be possible. It's true that technology develops at exponential rates, but it was still a shock when Nike filed patents for auto-lacing in 2010 . Something that seemed impossible just two decades years earlier was suddenly looking like a realistic possibility. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Then nothing happened. There were a few rumors here and there, but nothing materialized. Filing patents for impractical technology happens all the time; it's standard corporate development defense. But the hope of the masses was that this was more than a shrewd corporate move. The following year Nike released a version of the Mag via auction as a way to raise money for the Michael J. Fox Foundation. It quickly became a hot commodity, but it didn't have auto-lacing. Fans were sure they would get a piece of history. They didn't. Most Popular Is the Self-Lacing Nike Air Mag Finally Here? On May 3 of this year, it happened again. A patent was published by Nike for a \"motorized footwear lacing system,\" everything that auto-lacing would require. Fans were excited but did their best not to get their hopes up; they'd seen this before. Then the announcement came: Auto-lacing was real. The technology was to be introduced on a different, previously unknown pair of shoes: the HyperAdapt 1.0 , which releases on December 1. The shoes feature auto-lacing that employs a sensor under the midfoot that automatically tightens the system when you put your foot in the shoes (it also lights up). Buttons on the side of the sneakers allow you to tighten and loosen for a dialed-in fit. The auto-lacing unit on the HyperAdapt 1.0. Nike Although the HyperAdapt isn't the Mag, in a way it is the Mag. The Mag was a vision of our future—something designed for a movie, but not reality. That's fine. Plenty of artists imagine impossible futures not only because of the limits of technology but because of how cultural forces change over time. The HyperAdapt was designed not as a fantasy but as a sneaker that would be wearable for the average consumer. The Nike Mag is impractical. The HyperAdapt, however, was made to be worn. There's just one problem. It costs $720. Just CONFIRMED with NIKE. Hyperadapt 1.0 is NOT $1000. It is $720 releasing on 12/1. pic.twitter.com/eqcwybbRyN \n— Jacques Slade (@kustoo) November 14, 2016 Initially there was a rumor that the shoes would be $1,000. Not the highest-priced shoe on the market, but not an invitation to the common man either. Over time technology gets smaller, cheaper, faster, and this is the first time we're seeing this kind of auto-lacing on a sneaker. Last Year Puma introduced an auto-lace system that operates a lot like the brand's classic Disc system, but we have yet to hear about a wide, consumer-focused release for those shoes. The Nike Mag released again this year incorporated auto-lace technology, making it much truer to the movie. But once again it was super limited, available only through raffle. Related Story Here's How to Finally Get Your Own Nike Mags The future is expensive, which is one of the reasons it arrives so slowly. We can only afford to buy each new step as it fits into our budgets. This technology was pulled into reality thanks to the ferocious interest of fans all over the world and a staff of dreamers at Nike, but at this price point many won't be able to bring it into their homes, and others will have second thoughts. Price has gotten in the way of the future before. (See: Google Glass, 3D TV, and Tidal.) With a brand like Nike behind it we're betting that auto-lacing will find a better way to infiltrate the industry in a usable way. But for now the HyperAdapt 1.0 is a luxury item and the technology remains out of reach for most consumers—and even more fans. Read Next:",

      "text": "By Ahiza Garcia \nPHILADELPHIA (CNN) –Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike’s self-lacing sneakers. But they’re not going to be cheap.\nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 — a whopping $720.\nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike’s Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse.\nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app.\nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time.\nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month.\nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public.\nIt’s different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in “Back to the Future.” Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery.\nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling — the way snow boots or roller blades tighten.\n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect,” said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers.\nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe’s battery life, which lasts about two weeks.\nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "With the Sauce and Oreo colorways debuting next month, the Nike KD 9 Royal , also known as “On-Court,” is scheduled to make its official debut next week. \nThe defining hue essentially drapes the overall profile, while contrasting black accents are implemented across its flyknit upper, laces, inner lining and outsole to further pronounce its design. Finishing touches include white Swooshes adorning the side panels and a black “KD” logo prominent on the back heel.\nPriced at $150, you can buy this latest pair at select Nike retailers starting Wednesday, November 23.\nAuthor’s Take The colorway looks solid and it’s a versatile option overall. It’s a simple version that should be appealing to many.\n\nThe post The Nike KD 9 Royal Arrives Next Week appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Artist Kaws' Murals Cover Two Courts for Nike's 'New York Made' By: Joey Haar   news.nike & dezeen The cultures of basketball and the street have gone together since the early 70s at least, and Brooklyn-based artist Kaws' new murals for Nike's 'New York Made' project continues the entanglement of those two cultural entities. The two murals cover side-by-side courts off of Stanton Street in Manhattan. Nike's New York Made project is a series of art and culture installations designed to highlight the brand's deep roots in the city. As such, a graffiti mural on basketball courts is an appropriate homage. Street ball in New York is the stuff of legends, with some of the greatest basketball players of all time having played on the courts throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan in their youths.",

      "text": "Courtesy of Bandier Courtesy of Bandier For those looking to step up their shoe game this season, look no further than the fully-coated rose gold sneakers that retail for $115. Describe as “metallic red bronze” on nike.com , the style is simple (read: practical) enough for the gym yet perfect for a glitzy night out on the town. We can totally see Bella Hadid, a.k.a Nike’s new leading lady , rocking these dazzling kicks with her signature crop tops and luxe sweats. The rest of the collection is only available at the Flatiron Bandier store in New York City. And with every purchase made in store, you’ll receive a free Glossier rose-flavored Balm Dotcom (our editors can’t get enough of this salve). If you’re not in Manhattan, rest assured, the brand will ship any piece to you if you make an order over the phone. How to get rose gold hair: #",

      "text": "In Brief The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, the company's first self-tightening shoe, will reportedly cost $720 USD. Apart from athletic use, the self-tightening shoes also show promise for people who have difficulty adjusting their own footwear. \nNike’s self-tightening shoes are finally ready to hit the market, a year after the company’s original intended release date. \nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe is capable of sensing the wearer’s needs. Its makers challenged digital, electrical, and mechanical engineering in order to develop footwear capable of on-the-go adjustment. The shoe can “change as the athlete changes,” says Tiffany Beers the project’s technical lead. \nIt’s important to note that the shoes are not self- tying – they come pre-laced. The shoe has two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen the laces. This generation of the HyperAdapt needs some manual adjustment before it can automatically get accustomed to the user’s feet, but Nike sees a future where a “nearly symbiotic relationship between the foot and shoe” exists. \nWith a self-tightening shoe, athletes could fine-tune the nuances of how shoes fit. Quick, on-the-fly adjustments are made possible, and missteps from untied laces or too-tight shoes could be a thing of the past. Apart from athletic use, the self-tightening shoes also show promise for people who have difficulty adjusting their own shoes, such as those undergoing physical therapy for injuries. \nBringing these high-tech shoes out of Back to the Future II ‘s fictional world and into footwear stores takes a hefty amount of cash—the HyperAdapt 1.0 will set you back $720 USD. The price is high, but it’s a step down from the NIKE Mag, a limited-edition version of Marty McFly’s shoes. \nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 is a testament to technology turning sci-fi into reality. Who knows what experts could bring us next?",

      "title": "Inside College Football: Hot seat update, including a tough situation at Oregon",
      "text": "2h ago • 8 min read \nOregon Ducks is at a crossroads -- as a program and as a flagship for the Nike brand. Not necessarily in that order. \nEven if the school doesn't fire coach Mark Helfrich, we should all agree something is missing from the Ducks. That goes beyond the obvious: Chip Kelly is no longer around. The fast-talking, innovative coach helped put Oregon on the map. \nBut even a Kelly return from the NFL wouldn't necessarily guarantee renewed excellence. The swag is gone. The spread offense that Kelly helped create and refine is common in college football . Defensive coordinators have had years to game plan back against it. \nEven the rules have conspired against Kelly's innovation. Since he left college, they've been changed to allow defensive substitutions negating hurry-up offense's advantages. \nIt's clear something has been lost in Eugene, Oregon, besides a few football games. This downturn may take the program's relevance with it. \nThat's why Oregon is the focus of a silly season that looks light on coaching coaches. Among Power Five schools, only LSU, Purdue Boilermakers and (supposedly) Baylor Bears have openings. \nOregon remains in a quandary whether to even axe Helfrich, who is 36-15 in his fourth season. It was barely 22 months ago he took the Ducks to the first College Football Playoff National Championship with Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota . \nThat sort of accomplishment usually buys a coach a healthy dose of job security. But this season, the Ducks have collapsed on all fronts. \nEngaging in graduate transfer quarterback free agency didn't work after Vernon Adams. Only Cal and Texas Tech Red Raiders are worse defensively. Fans departed in droves Saturday during a 36-point beatdown by Stanford Cardinal . \nThe troubling walk-out may have sealed Helfrich's fate. Even in the glory days, athletic director Rob Mullens wondered about the challenges of filling 54,000-seat Autzen Stadium. \nThe budget of an athletic department supported by one of the world's largest athletic apparel companies is not even in the top 20 nationally. \n\"We're the equivalent of a small-market professional franchise,\" Mullens told me. \nAt the heart of the matter, Oregon isn't experienced at this sort of thing. The school hasn't fired a coach in 40 years. \nThe administration has to understand the problems before it finds the solutions. Oregon football is a fragile thing. It took Mike Belotti years of grinding in remote Eugene before breaking through was a program that competed for BCS bowls. \nKelly took the program to another level. Long-term success remains a concern. \nAs prospects have dimmed, emotions are running high. Former AD Pat Kilkenny went on a Portland radio station Monday to refute a tweet by ESPN's Darren Rovell, who claimed Nike CEO Phil Knight was ready to spend $10 million or more per year on the next coach. \nKilkenny called the tweet \"irresponsible journalism,\" and \"out and out fabrications.\" All of it reflects Oregon's current quandary. Any current coach who is worth $10 million -- not just willing to take it -- probably isn't coming to Oregon. \nNick Saban, Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer are all more than happy where they are. \nAssuming all those names are out, where does Oregon turn? The list is small because a possible replacement for Helfrich almost certainly has to be a sitting Power Five head coach with a winning record and a spread offense background. \nRemember, Oregon isn't marketing only football, it is marketing Nike. It needs a face, a personality. If it can't get Kelly back, it has to attempt to get something resembling his swag back. \nYou can count on one hand the number of schools that don't have multiple uniform combinations these days. Oregon used to be a subversive trendsetter with its unis that shocked the media, fashion and football worlds. \nNow they're just ducks in the crowd. \nIn no particular order, here are some names that may help get back that swag, that recruiting, that winning, that look and feel of what Oregon used to be ... \nTom Herman, Houston Cougars : LSU Tigers has seemingly cooled on Houston's coach perhaps for obvious reasons. (See below.) At age 41, Herman is almost a young Chip. His offense is innovative, he has boundless energy and he recruits like a madman. His offense would be familiar to Oregonians, too. Can he be the face of Nike and the Ducks? Absolutely. \nLarry Fedora, North Carolina Tar Heels : There are only two people walking the Earth who have double-digit win seasons at North Carolina. Fedora is one of them. If the Tar Heels win out, Fedora and Mack Brown would be the only coaches to do it in back-to-back seasons. There's lots of chatter about Fedora going back to his native Texas Longhorns at Baylor, but his offensive background makes him a good fit at Oregon, too. \nDan Mullen, Mississippi State Bulldogs : The Bulldogs' slump to 4-6 after Dak Prescott almost reinforces Mullen's chances. Look what Mississippi State is without Prescott. Look what the Cowboys are with him. Mullen deserves some credit for developing a top candidate for NFL rookie of the year. \nIf Mullen can take freakin' Mississippi State to the No. 1 ranking for five weeks (in 2014), think what he could do at Oregon. Lest we forget, Mullen has ties with both Kelly and Meyer. Kelly recommended Mullen for his first job. Both grew up in New Hampshire. \nBryan Harsin, Boise State Broncos : The former Texas offensive coordinator has picked up in Boise where Chris Petersen left off. That is, making the Broncos a national program in the Group of Five space. You want player development? Three-star tailback Jeremy McNichols has consecutive 1,300-yard seasons for a team that may be headed to the Cotton Bowl. Harsin is 30-7 in three seasons at Boise, including a Fiesta Bowl win. \nJames Franklin, Penn State Nittany Lions : How do you leave Penn State after winning the Big Ten? For more money and an easier path to a championship (Pac-12 North over Big Ten East). Sure, he's is a longshot, but Franklin is positioning himself for Big Ten coach of the year. If Ohio State Buckeyes beats Michigan Wolverines next week, Penn State gets to the conference title game. Plus, there are no NCAA sanctions to dig out of in Eugene. The remaining hot seats \nTexas: Charlie Strong has actually brought some stability. The Longhorns are 5-5 despite a loss to West Virginia Mountaineers and are virtually assured of a bowl. (They finish with Kansas Jayhawks and TCU.) That means 15 more practices and a chance to improve for 2017. The critics have backed off and there seems to be growing support that Strong will return. \nTexas has somewhat of an identity with freshman quarterback Shane Buechele returning and tailback D'Onta Foreman leading the country in rushing. It's going to look awkward if Foreman goes to New York as a Heisman finalist after his coach is fired. \nBoston College Eagles : Steve Addazio's offense is stultifying. (Only two Power Five teams are worse in scoring.) He's won just one ACC game in the last two years. But a bowl is still a possibility with UConn and Wake Forest Demon Deacons still left on the schedule. Addazio has a contract through 2020, so a buyout would be prohibitive. \nKansas: David Beaty has a record of 1-21 in his first two seasons with no wins against FBS and Big 12 opponents. If Kansas wasn't still paying off Charlie Weis (through December), AD Sheahon Zenger might think about getting rid of Beaty. But the former Texas A&M receivers coach remains the lowest-paid Power Five coach. \nKansas has at least learned its lessen from paying guaranteed money to Turner Gill and Weis. Beaty would be owed $1.6 million if he was fired today. KU hasn't won a road game since 2009 (!) but will stay with Beaty for at least one more season. \nNotre Dame Fighting Irish : Sometimes we don't allow guys just to have bad seasons. That's the case for Brian Kelly. If the Irish don't beat Virginia Tech Hokies and/or Southern California Trojans , they will end up with the second-fewest wins since 1960 (4-8). The real pressure comes next season. Kelly will have to win. The openings \nThere are only three in the Power Five at this time. Here's the latest. \nLSU: The Tigers and AD Joe Alleva are right back where they were a year ago: pursuing Florida State Seminoles coach Jimbo Fisher. Will they get their man? The school has contacted Fisher, according to a report , but there were ongoing negotiations with Fisher a year ago at this time, too. If I'm Fisher, my first question for Alleva is, \"How long are you going to be around?\" If Alleva screws this up, he may not last. \nThen there is the evolving political intrigue with Ed Orgeron. If Coach O wins out, there will be a -- probably large -- faction of folks supporting the native son over Fisher. Herman's name hasn't been mentioned as much probably because of two Houston losses (one to SMU) and some defensive lapses. The Cougars are no longer playoff darlings. \nBut that speaks to why Alleva should have known how this process was going to end before he canned Les Miles after Week 4. You don't hope Fisher will come or conduct an audition with your defensive line coach. You have a plan. It's called Athletic Directing 101. \nBaylor: Les Miles remains a possibility, but the two names most prominently mentioned are Fedora and Cal's Sonny Dykes. Yes, Dykes' Chicago Bears are only 4-6, but he developed the NFL's No. 1 overall pick in Jared Goff . He also won at Louisiana Tech Bulldogs (22-15 in three seasons). The feeling is that Dykes would have access to better players in his native Texas and continue the up-tempo offensive philosophy. \nBaylor desperately needs to address recruiting. The 2016 class was gutted after the sexual assault scandal. With two commitments in 2017, Baylor is ranked 137th nationally by 247Sports behind eight FCS programs. With a coaching staff that almost assuredly is going to be canned en masse, there can't be much motivation to recruit. \nThese desperate times mean the new guy is going to be given some time build the program back up. As for Miles, one source said he should be on Baylor's short list. As for Miles, who is trying like heck to get back in the Power Five, Baylor should be on his short list. \nPurdue: Not much has changed since Darrell Hazel was fired Oct. 16. This is P.J. Fleck's job to lose. \nIf anything, though, the Western Michigan Broncos coach has become even a hotter commodity as the Broncos keep winning. If something more enticing opens up, Fleck could be off to a place like Cincinnati Bearcats or NC State Wolfpack . \nNot saying those jobs are going to be open. Just saying, don't be surprised.",

      "text": "Next \nPeople who complain about the increased prices of basketball shoes are in for a shock. \nNike is set to release the HyperAdapt 1.0 — a self-lacing sneaker. But the price tag is more akin to a month of rent for some than a pair of shoes. \nThe new Nike shoes will retail for $720 and be available December 1 in the Nike Soho store and the NIKE+ ClubHouse in New York City. \n\nA small number of NIKE+ APP will get limited early access to the shoes on Nov. 28. \n\"The shoe translates deep research in digital, electrical and mechanical engineering into a product designed for movement,\" the company site says. \nAccording to Business Insider , the first pair of Nike Air Jordans cost $65 in 1985. \nBut how much would you pay for new shoes? Tell us with this poll. \n\nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ",

      "text": "GET IT ALL (PREMIUM ACCESS) Fox Sports hired Terri Hines from Nike to run its communications team. Hired as Fox Sports’ new Exec VP/Communications, Hines will be based in L.A. and will report to Fox Sports President Eric Shanks . The top item on Hines’ to-do list will be to hire a full staff, as Fox has seen many top communications execs leave the company during a year when Fox has the Super Bowl. Since the spring, execs with decades of communications experience have left the company, including Lou D’Ermilio , Dan Bell , Chris Bellitti , Ileana Pena , Elizabeth Conlisk and Emily Parker . Earlier this month, Exec VP/Communications & Integration Chris Hannan left for a job at WME-IMG. In making the hire, Shanks looked outside sports TV. Hines had been VP/Global Communications for Converse and previously worked as communications director for Nike’s Jordan Brand. Hines officially starts Dec. 5.",

The matchup featured Kyrie Irving in his Nike Kyrie 2 squaring off against fellow All-Star guard Kyle Lowry and his adidas Crazylight Boost Low 2016. DeMar DeRozan continued to represent Kobes with the Nike Kobe Mentality 2 and LeBron James balled out in the Nike LeBron 13 Elite. \nOut in Miami, Hassan Whiteside – as he’s done since last season – also wore the LeBron 13 Elites in the Heat’s tilt with the Atlanta Hawks. In that game, Kent Bazemore rocked the most colorful kicks of the night, an eye-popping Under Armour ClutchFit Drive 3 Low. Other highlights of the evening included Adreian Payne bringing out the ‘Powder Blue’ Air Jordan X Retro as he matched up against Frank Kaminsky and his ‘Hornets’ Air Jordan XXXI PEs and Jimmy Butler doing his thing in a ‘Black/Red’ colorway of the Jordan Extra.Fly. \nFor the rest of Tuesday night’s kicks, make sure to peep the rest of our gallery.

      "text": "Bella Hadid was thrilled to post the big news that she landed a deal with Nike on Monday, but not everyone shared her excitement.\nHadid’s Instagram announcement filled up with comments that she’s “way too skinny to represent a sports brand,” and “doesn’t even have an athletic body.”\nAnd one athlete, Olympic skater Meryl Davis , tweeted her disapproval over using yet another model to promote workout gear.\nDavis, who won Dancing with the Stars in 2014 , posted side-by-side photos of Hadid in Nike gear, Kylie Jenner in a Puma outfit, and one of Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman in Reebok.\nI'll take the one promoted by the athlete please pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX \n— Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 \n\n“I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please,” Davis tweeted , along with a muscle emoji.\nHadid recently admitted that she “accidentally” lost more weight than she intended, telling PEOPLE that she “really didn’t mean to.”\nso excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️ \nA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \n“I want boobs. I want my ass back,” she said. “But it’s not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.”\nRELATED VIDEO: Style Tracks: Athleisure Isn’t Going Anywhere in 2016 \n \n“I worked out so hard and everybody is like, ‘Oh, she looks so skinny blah, blah, blah,’ ” Hadid said. “But I think that if you just stick to something you can really achieve so much. I’ve been eating hard protein every day, and working out for three hours every day. It’s crazy but I think that you know if you set your mind to something I think you can succeed.”\nAlthough Reebok celebrated Davis’s response on Twitter , Nike and Puma and have not yet responded.",

      "text": "Thanks for the new Jordans, Space Jam! (Photo: Nike) Just on the heels of yesterday's 20th anniversary of Space Jam , Nike released details about a new collection of related  apparel  and sneakers. And although the latter don't lace themselves (wrong franchise), they're still pretty damn cool.\n\n1. Air Jordan XXXI \nLaunching December 3rd, the Air Jordan XXXI makes over the original Jordans thirty years later (Photo: Nike) Has it already been 31 years since iconic trio of the Jumpman silhouette, Wings logo and Nike Swoosh last appeared together on a sneaker? \nApparently so, since they debuted back in 1985 (the same year that other franchise took off as well). This new version pays homage to the original, while infusing design elements from the epic intergalactic cartoon/live action saga that was Space Jam .\n\n2. Air Jordan IX \nThe reimagined Air Jordan IX launches December 3rd (Photo: Nike) Just as Mr. Jordan (first) left the NBA, the IX arrived on the scene, sporting quite a different look from its predecessors. And just like MJ did, now they're coming back. They'll arrive in stores early next month, in all their two-tone glory.\n\n3. Air Jordan XI \nThe 20th anniversary Air Jordan XI launches December 10th (Photo: Nike) Responsive cushioning, premium leather details and Charlotte Hornet-like light blue accents adorn this popular street shoe reissue. It's got comfort, shininess and breathability. Along with a 45 (not 23) on the back, to let you know what era you honor, these kicks may pack the most style of the bunch.\n\n4. Air Jordan I High \nThe Air Jordan I High is already available (Photo: Nike) These classics take a metallic makeover and make it work. Black and silver and cut high to support those spinning MJ-esque moves in the paint, they're already available at select retailers.\n\n5. Air Jordan I Ultra High \nThe Ultra Highs are also already available (Photo: Nike) Pretty much the same deal for these ones, but they're a little taller, for the biggest of ballers . As in, the guy we all expect to play the lead in Space Jam 2 , with or without the blessing of the original star . \n\nAs we wait for that flick to hit the big screen, at least we've got some great footwear swag to choose from in the meanwhile.\nThe Air Jordan heir apparel?

      "text": "NEW YORK – If President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink. In an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama.\n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.”\nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco.\nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change.\nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions.\nBy Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN\n",

      "title": "U.S. Companies to Trump: Don’t Abandon Global Climate Deal",
      "text": " count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"257\">Hundreds of American companies, including Mars, Nike, Levi Strauss and Starbucks, have urged President-elect Donald J. Trump not to abandon the Paris climate deal, saying a failure by the United States to build a clean economy endangers American prosperity. In a plea addressed to Mr. Trump — as well as President Obama and members of Congress — 365 companies and major investors emphasized their “deep commitment to addressing climate change ,” and demanded that he leave in place low-emissions policies in the United States.\n“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,” the companies said in a joint letter announced on Wednesday in Marrakesh, Morocco, where global leaders are determining the next steps for the Paris deal. “But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness.”\nThe companies also said that they would push ahead with their own targets to reduce their carbon footprints regardless of steps taken by Mr. Trump once he is in office. During his campaign, Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax , pledged to leave the Paris accord, dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency and undo Mr. Obama’s climate change policies.\n“This doesn’t change our commitments,” said Kevin Rabinovitch, global sustainability director at Mars, which has pledged to eliminate 100 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions from its factories and offices by 2040. “We’re doing this because we see a real business risk. We see a real business problem.”\n Businesses large and small have scrambled in the days since Mr. Trump’s victory to chart their next moves in an uncertain regulatory situation. Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges and musings have been driven by the belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from cumbersome federal regulations, especially those that limit carbon emissions.\nThe president-elect has heightened environmentalists’ fears that his administration will take on an anti-climate, anti-environment bent by appointing the climate contrarian Myron Ebell to lead the E.P.A. transition. Climate change activists have denounced Mr. Ebell, whose Competitive Enterprise Institute has received funding from oil and gas interest groups.\nSome corporations, like the country’s largest automakers, have already seized on a potential upside to the president-elect’s leanings, urging a rethinking of stringent federal auto emissions standards. An easing of federal standards for passenger cars, which together with the rest of the transportation sector emit more carbon dioxide than any other part of the American economy, could have immense implications for overall emissions.\nOthers, like solar and wind power companies, have raced to find common ground with Mr. Trump, pressing for reassurances that his administration will not slash investment in renewable energy or alter federal tax credits on renewable energy projects.\n“Mr. Trump talks about infrastructure, he talks about jobs,” said Michael Skelly, founder and president of Clean Line Energy Partners, a company based in Houston that builds transmission lines for renewable energy.\n“What we’re creating are welding jobs, steel manufacturing jobs, in Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa,” he said. “These are projects that create income for landowners, create jobs in the middle of the country.”\nThe stakes are high. Damage from climate change — especially from extreme weather events like hurricanes, flooding and drought — could shave as much as 5 percent off annual global gross domestic product by 2100, according to a study commissioned by the British government that is considered one of the most comprehensive.\nEnvironmental groups have been left with the daunting prospect that, with a climate skeptic in the White House, they will need to look directly to corporations to assume the mantle of leading the country’s response to climate change. But without strict regulatory standards or oversight, companies will be left freer to pick and choose which climate-friendly policies to pursue, and which they will choose to ignore or abandon.\n Still, some American corporations have already made significant efforts to reduce their environmental footprints. So reversing them now would be disruptive not just for the environment, but for their bottom line. And even with a move away from climate-friendly policies back home, American corporations face tightening regulations overseas.\n“Now more than ever, Levi Strauss believes it is important to reaffirm our commitment to address climate change by supporting the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Michael Kobori, the company’s vice president for sustainability.\n“Building an energy-efficient economy in the U.S. will ensure our nation’s competitiveness,” he said, “and position U.S. companies as leaders in the global market — all while doing the right thing for our planet.”\nContinue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

      "text": "  John Griffin Gains 3 Positions in 3rd Quarter Citigroup and Nike among guru’s top buys   C +0% NKE +0% AGN +0% AMZN +0% GS +0% \nJohn Griffin ( Trades , Portfolio ), president of Blue Ridge Capital, previously worked with Julian Robertson ( Trades , Portfolio ) at Tiger Funds before founding Blue Ridge in 1996. The fund seeks absolute returns using a long/short equity approach that invests in companies with strong performance relative to their industry and shorts those with fundamental problems. Griffin usually takes long positions, a trend that continued during the third quarter of 2016. The guru took stakes in three companies and added to two others. \nCitigroup Inc. ( NYSE:C ) \nGriffin purchased 5,202,600 shares of Citigroup, increasing his portfolio by 2.91%. The global bank’s stock price averaged $45.49 during the third quarter. \nAs discussed in a previous article , several gurus, including Seth Klarman ( Trades , Portfolio ), axed their stake in Citigroup as the company shows low growth potential. However, the global bank still exhibits good three-year EBITDA growth and three-year earnings per share growth, both near a 10-year high and outperforming over 87% of competitors. Citigroup reported an 8% increase in book value per share and tangible book value per share from third-quarter 2015 to third-quarter 2016. \nNike Inc. ( NYSE:NKE ) \nThe president of Blue Ridge purchased 2.6 million shares of Nike, a global athletic footwear and apparel company. Nike’s stock price averaged $54.65 during the quarter. \nWith a financial strength rank of 8, Nike has a robust business operation. The company’s interest coverage outperforms 66% of global footwear and accessories companies, and its Altman Z-score of 8.68 suggests that Nike seldom faced distress. Additionally, the company’s return on invested capital significantly outperforms its WACC, implying high value creation. \nThe Oregon-based apparel company reported strong performance results in their fiscal first quarter of 2017, including a 9% increase in diluted earnings per share. Strong revenue growth and operating overhead leverage likely resulted in the high EPS growth. CEO Mark Parker further cherished the company’s strong first-quarter results through sports style innovation and strategic investments in their supply chain and customer connections. The strong earnings likely led to expanding operating margins and consistent per-share revenue growth, the former outperforming 84% of competitors. Nike also maintained a predictability rank of four stars. \nAllergan PLC ( NYSE:AGN ) \nGriffin purchased 558,300 shares of Allergan at an average price of $244.37, increasing his portfolio by 1.53%. The guru owns 1,259,200 shares as of Sept. 30. \nEven though the company had negative operating margins , Allergan’s net margin or 83.91% outperforms 99% of global specialty and generic drug manufacturing companies. The high net margin is likely due to significantly high net income from discontinued operations , which is included in net income and excluded from operating income . \nAllergan reported strong performance in the third quarter of 2016, including a 7.4% increase in adjusted revenue growth from third quarter 2015, accelerated share repurchase programs and the initiation of a cash dividend in 2017. Likely due to the strong revenue outlook, chief financial officer Maria Hilado purchased 1,422 shares in a near $300,000 transaction. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. ( NYSE:GS ) \nThe Blue Ridge Capital president bought 440,000 shares of Goldman Sachs at an average price of $162.57. Griffin increased his portfolio by 0.84% with this transaction. \nThe New York investment management company has strong profitability despite poor financial strength. Goldman’s operating margin outperforms just 66% of global capital markets and its return on invested capital slightly underperforms its WACC. Even though the company has a modest financial outlook, the company produced strong third-quarter earnings per share of $4.88, which outperforms the earnings for the prior year quarter and the quarter before. The company’s book value per share increased 2.6% during the most recent quarter. Most importantly, Goldman had the highest number of completed mergers and acquisitions worldwide for the year-to-date. \nDodge & Cox and Warren Buffett ( Trades , Portfolio ) own 15,287,200 and 10,959,519 shares of Goldman, the largest two stakes in the company. The former increased its Goldman position by 1.77%. Ken Heebner ( Trades , Portfolio ) also invested in the company by purchasing 255,000 new shares. \nAmazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) \nGriffin added 18.92% to his Amazon position, purchasing 64,900 shares at an average price of $765.45. \nAs discussed in a previous article , Amazon presents high value potential to shareholders. The company has a five-star predictability rank, and its three-year revenue growth and three-year EBITDA growth both outperform over 91% of global specialty retail companies. Additionally, Amazon’s return on invested capital significantly outperforms its WACC. \nSee also \nGuruFocus provides two types of guru picks: latest guru picks and real-time picks . Generally, investors must report their quarterly portfolio to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 45 days after the end of the quarter in a Form 13F filing. However, if an investor makes a trade in a company where he owns more than 5% of the total shares outstanding, the SEC requires him to file a Schedule 13D within 10 business days after the transaction takes place. Such guru picks are known as real-time picks, one of several features that we offer to premium members. Additionally, the premium membership gives access to all value screeners, including the All-in-One Guru Screener that offers over 150 filters. \nThe premium plus membership gives further access, including backtesting for up to 10 years, the Manual of Stocks for all U.S. companies, and over 4000 institutional 13F and 13D filings . Please refer to the membership levels page for all member benefits. If you are not a member, we invite you to   . \nDisclosure: I do not own stock in the companies mentioned in this article.

      "text": "This is why it’s unfair to say Bella Hadid is “too thin” to be in a Nike ad We want to live in a society that accepts every single body type — every. single. one. And that’s why it’s not OK for people to say that Bella Hadid is too skinny to model for Nike . While we totally get the frustration surrounding the media not featuring diverse body types , Hadid’s own body is not the problem here. There’s no need to body shame Hadid. And beyond the negativity, we know the model is going to be FIERCE in her new Nike campaign .\nHadid excitedly shared the news that she’ll be representing Nike in a new ad campaign on Instagram. While she has over 529,000 likes on her post, some people took the opportunity to criticize her and the sports apparel company.\nso excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️ \nA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nOne person commented that her thin body type is what leads girls to have eating disorders. Others were more angry at the fact that Nike had chosen a model to represent the company instead of an athlete. Even figure skater Meryl Davis , an Olympic gold medal winner, expressed disappointment in companies like Nike for using models instead of athletes on her Twitter page.\nI'll take the one promoted by the athlete please pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX \n— Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 Of course, we’d love to see more inclusive body types when it comes to depictions of women in advertisements. But it’s a complicated issue and we shouldn’t bring down Hadid in the process. Even though models being brand ambassadors for sports companies is nothing new (Bella’s own model sister, Gigi Hadid, is repping Reebok ), it should be noted that both Nike and Reebok have many athletes who do advertisements for them, too. Even Aly Raisman, who was in Davis’ tweet, works for Reebok. And Nike featured a 86-year-old triathlon athlete who is a nun!\nThe focus of these campaigns is also usually on fitness — like Gigi’s spot for Reebok, which shows her doing an intense boxing workout. As Bella has been preparing for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, she has been dealing with backlash about her body already, telling People that people have claimed she lost too much weight recently . Despite Bella’s love of pizza , she followed a strict diet and worked out three hours a day to achieve her new look. So she’s worked hard to be as toned as she is and we expect that will be on full display for her Nike campaign.\nI can't believe it ❤️ ❤️ There is no better feeling than being confirmed for the @victoriassecret fashion show !!! What a dream come true..I feel so appreciative and excited! Thank you for this opportunity to walk next to some of the most inspiring and incredible women in the world! Thank YOU from the deepest part of my heart @ed_razek @johndavidpfeiffer @10magazine #MonicaMitro thank you @gothamgym for whipping me into shape and @imgmodels @annemarieleonie for supporting me always !! So much love !!!! #VSFashionShow \nA video posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Oct 27, 2016 at 6:48am PDT \nAnyone who exercises — and that should be everyone — can use the things Nike sells, like sneakers and workout apparel, no matter their body type. Of course, Bella has been graced with genes that have made her an international model, but that doesn’t mean she’s “too” much of anything to represent the company.\nAnd we like what Bella said to People about her Victoria’s Secret body:\n“My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.” PREACH.\nThe post This is why it’s unfair to say Bella Hadid is “too thin” to be in a Nike ad appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "TWEET Starbucks , Nike and more than 360 other businesses and investors have called on President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders to remain committed to the Paris agreement on climate change. \"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,\" the group said in a statement released and presented at United Nations climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Wednesday . Other signers include conglomerate Unilever, chemicals giant Dupont, and technology company Hewlett Packard. The Paris treaty was signed by nearly 200 countries to try and restore greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels by the year 2100 . A major goal is to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. A number of the world's largest companies are urging President-elect Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Backers of climate change action are concerned because there's good reason to expect that the United States might try and walk back its efforts to limit emissions in Trump's administration. The president-elect has called climate change a \" hoax ,\" promised to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency , and appointed Myron Ebell — who has argued greenhouse gas emissions could actually be beneficial — to lead his EPA transition effort. Even Exxon Mobile, the oil and gas multinational that has had a fraught relationship with climate change activists in the past, backs the Paris agreement. Suzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, tweeted about the company's ongoing support of the treaty on Nov. 10, the morning after the election. \nThe Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange https://t.co/X7JubyyArv Of course, other countries in the agreement may fight back in the event that the U.S. tries to back out. Former French President Nicholas Sarkozy — who will also likely be his center-right party's nominee for President — has floated the idea of imposing a tariff on U.S. imports to make up for reneging on the Paris agreement's financial commitments. That would need to be approved by other countries in the EU for it to have the desired effect, although it would pack a punch — Europe is still the United States' biggest trading partner. The clock is ticking: September 2016 was the hottest September in 136 years , as long as records have been kept. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "Nike Self-Lacing HyperAdapt 1.0 Sneakers to Become Available December 1 By Chance Kinney · On November 16, 2016 \nLast year, Nike celebrated Back to the Future day by sending Michael J. Fox a genuine working pair of Nike Mags with power laces, making one of Back to the Future II ‘s many predictions true. Not very many of those Mags were made, but Nike didn’t call it a day on self-lacing shoes, either. In March of this year, the footwear company showed off their HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers , a pair of black lo-tops with a glowing blue light and battery-powered laces (complete with a wireless charging pad). To no one’s surprise, those sneakers are ready to hit store shelves in time for the holiday shopping season. But, if someone (read: you) really wants a pair for the holidays, make sure your wallet is ready — the future of shoes isn’t cheap. \nNike plans to start selling the HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers on December 1 for $720. Renowned YouTube sneakerhead Jacques Slade revealed the pricing and availability information shortly before Nike’s official announcement , noting that they’re actually cheaper than the $1,000 they were once expected to fetch. \nSo, how do they work? Instead of looping a single shoelace through holes, the HyperAdapt 1.0 have several shorter laces attached to a battery-powered mechanism within the shoe. A button on the shoe tightens and loosens those laces with a single press. The battery is said to last two weeks on a single charge, but considering they’re also said to charge completely in three hours, battery life shouldn’t be a concern. \nNow comes the tricky part — how do you get them? At the beginning of December, it won’t be easy. Longtime Nike+ app users will have first dibs — Nike will send out invitations to “a small group” of app users on November 28, who will have the option to buy the shoe. If you’re not on that list, you’ll have to be in New York to get them. Starting December 1, Nike will stock the sneakers at their store in SoHo and the Nike+ ClubHouse at 45 Grand, where they can be tried on. Everyone else can buy the HyperAdapt 1.0 later in December from the Nike+ app or from some Nike locations across the nation. When the shoes get their full release, there will also be a new metallic silver/black-white colorway available. ",
