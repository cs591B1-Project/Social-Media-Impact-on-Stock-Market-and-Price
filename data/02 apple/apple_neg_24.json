      "text": "Youtube Apple could integrate Augmented Reality technology into iPhone camera app \nApple is expected to integrate its Augmented Reality technology into the iPhone’s camera app. If the information circulating around the Internet is true, the company is currently working on to create a database of 3D objects, so that the device recognize it when the user points the phone at the real-time object. \nJust like recognizing objects, the Apple’s AR integration into the camera app could recognize and manipulate people’s faces also. However, the company integrated facial recognition technology in the photo apps, in the latest version of iOS software. \nMoreover, this is not at all a sudden move, as the company acquired lots of VR and AR based companies including Metaio, in February 2014 and Flyby Media in January 2016. \nHaving said that, the AR technology will come built-in to the iPhone camera app, where the company will release it as an SDK for app developers. On the other hand, Apple is reportedly working on a smart glasses to display contextual information, when paired with iPhone. \nThe company has also hired an expert in head-mounted displays for the Smart Glass project . Anyhow, there is not much information available about this smart glass.",

      "text": "DA Cyrus Vance says New York has about 40 locked iPhones linked to murder investigations. Image: New York County District Attorney's Office \nNew York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance has renewed a call for federal legislation requiring Apple to make iOS warrant-friendly. \nIn a report released on Thursday at the launch of the Manhattan DA's new cyberlab, Vance revealed there are now over 400 locked iPhones sitting with New York County that could be used to investigate serious crimes if only Apple would or rather could help. \nThe DA argues that law-enforcement agencies do not want a backdoor to Apple and Google products, but rather a return to pre-September 2014, when Apple's encryption didn't prevent them from carrying out a search warrant on an iPhone. \nIn a speech at the launch , Vance said the report showed that requiring smartphone makers to retain the ability to extract data will not increase users' risks of being hacked. \nHe said the report concluded that, \"Doing nothing about this problem will perpetuate an untenable arms race between private industry and law enforcement, and that federal legislation is our only chance to lay these arms aside\". \nApple released iOS 8 in September 2014 with a new encryption method that prevented access to stored data unless the password was known. It triggered a drawn-out skirmish between Apple and US law enforcement that came to a head in February over the FBI's fight to have Apple unlock the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone 5c. \nApple defied a court order demanding it build a special version of iOS to get around limits on brute-forcing iOS pass codes, arguing it would raise security risks for all iPhone users. The FBI eventually unlocked the device without Apple's help , despite earlier FBI claims that accessing the data was impossible without Apple's assistance. \nVance's office says 10 percent of the locked iPhones in the DA's cyberlab related to homicide or attempted-murder cases, and nine percent related to sex crimes. \nWhile Vance has presented similar numbers previously , the call for federal legislation could be given a popular boost by president elect Donald Trump, who previously called for a boycott on Apple products when it refused to help the FBI. \nVance said the Manhattan DA's office now needs its 2,200 square foot cyberlab to deal with the sheer volume of digital evidence. \n\"Nearly every crime against Manhattan residents and institutions involving digital evidence will engage the resources and expertise of this lab,\" he said. \n\"With a dedicated space for our prosecutors, investigators, and analysts to work together on fast-moving investigations, New York City is better equipped than ever to combat the rising tide of cybercrime and identity theft.\" READ MORE ON APPLE AND SECURITY",

      "title": "U.S. iPhone factories: Designed in California, made by machines",
      "text": "Apple is apparently speaking with its Chinese manufacturing partners to assess if it is possible to bring iPhone manufacturing back into the USA . Skilled staff \nIn the past the company has said one of the reasons it does not manufacture products here is because the U.S. lacks people with the right high-tech manufacturing skills. Speaking in 2012, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, also said he “hoped” assembly could take place in the U.S. again – perhaps it can, with the addition of a little artificial intelligence . \nA 2012 New York Times report also revealed: \n“Apple's executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that \"Made in the U.S.A.\" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products.” Not just Apple \nAlmost every consumer electronics company thinks the same way. The only way to change this without making products so expensive that no one will buy them is to impose the same pay and conditions on U.S. manufacturing workers as their peers in China endure. \nOr replace them with machines. \nThat’s got to be the most likely outcome. \nApple’s existing suppliers are already using robots in iPhone manufacturing. Robots replaced 60,000 employees at just one Foxconn factory this year. \n\"We will continue to harness automation and manpower in our manufacturing operations, and we expect to maintain our significant workforce in China,” the company said . Do those robots need to be in the country? Smart machines \nToday’s robots are much smarter than the production line machines we’ve seen in use in the last thirty years. They are capable of learning new skills. They use sophisticated deep learning and pattern matching technologies. They aren’t single-purpose machines that need replacing when the process changes. They are also more flexible and more willing to work a 12-hour day than the humans they replace. \nIt makes no economic sense . What good will it do the U.S. economy to put its biggest technology firms out of business? \nIn order to insource manufacturing to the U.S., big tech firms will inevitably seek out technological solutions to the problem they face, and this means that rather than hiring and training tens of thousands of U.S. workers, they are far more likely to purchase a bunch of robots to do the job, with a much smaller number of highly trained engineers to oversee the process. The human interface sell by date \n(Though even there, Gartner believes that by 2018, more than three million workers globally will be supervised by a robo-boss.) \nAs former McDonald's chief executive Ed Rensi famously said : \"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who is inefficient, making $15 an hour bagging French fries.\" \nThe Mac Pro is already made in a highly mechanized production plant in the U.S . Apple’s Liam robot already takes iPhones apart for recycling and is based in the U.S . There will be many more machines working diligently across production lines worldwide. \nWhen you think about Apple bringing iPhone production back to the U.S., don’t expect the jobs to come back. Instead, consumer electronics companies like Apple will need to raise prices slightly to help pay for new automated manufacturing processes. They will need to invest in robots and the technologies that enable them . Made in the USA \nSo your iPhone will still be Designed by Apple in California, but will be (partially) Assembled By Robots In The USA. They are also likely to be around $30-$40 more expensive to buy. \nThough if we're lucky, perhaps some of the robots will be manufactured here. \nGoogle+? If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not join AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community and join the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple? \nGot a story?

      "text": "Apple is offering to repair at a reduced price iPhone 6 Plus smartphones with display flickering or multitouch issues.\n\nThe problem, described in August as “ touch disease ” by repair guide website iFixit, is characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen. The issue affects both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, according to iFixit.\n\nApple appears to consider it a problem with the way users handled the phone rather than a defect. It said Thursday that the company has determined that the smartphones may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues “after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.”\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nApple rolled out a new commercial for MacBook Pro with Touch Bar called Bulbs . The 1 minute, 37 second spot features flashes of some big (and small) inventions using exploding lightbulbs as a metaphor. In fact, MacBook Pro doesn’t appear until the final 10 seconds, accompanied by the tag line, “Introducing a tool for all the ideas to come.” We’re then shown a finger sliding back and forth on the Touch Bar to scrub through a video of another exploding lightbulb. The imagery is compelling, and seems likely to catch people’s attention, with the Apple message pounding home at the end. It’s one of my favorite spots in recent months.",

      "text": "Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’ By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 14 minutes ago \nApple has launched a new Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus , intended to address complaints about a problem dubbed “Touch Disease” that was brought to light by iFixit back in August. The issue, believed by iFixit to be the result of a design defect in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, resulted in a problem where touch functionality would become glitchy or unresponsive and flickering gray lines would appear at the top of the iPhone screen. With many of the affected iPhones out of warranty, Apple Stores generally refused to recognize the problem as being a real issue, prompting a class action lawsuit to be filed against Apple. \nApple’s new repair program appears to be limited only to the larger iPhone 6 Plus, despite reports that iPhone 6 users were also experiencing the problem. Apple also seems to be avoiding any acknowledgement of a defect, implying that the problem only occurs after an iPhone 6 Plus is “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” Further, the repair program is not free — Apple will charge a service price of $149 to repair iPhone 6 Plus devices that are affected by the problem, although the company has also offered to reimburse the difference to customers who have previously paid a higher amount for repairs related to this issue.",

Apple is reportedly looking into building its products in the U.S. following calls from President-elect Donald Trump to do just that.But it could come at the expense of customers. Would you pay twice as much for an iPhone as you do now so it can be built here?That could be the tough side effect to this plan.This is all coming from a report in the financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review, citing unnamed sources.The article says Apple has asked its manufacturers to look into the possibility of making the iPhone in the U.S. One agreed to consider it and the other said no because it would be too expensive.This would be a major victory for Trump, who said during the campaign he would try to force Apple to make its products in the U.S.He has also talked about a 45 percent tax on all Chinese imports.Apple did not comment on the report.

      "text": "Rumors surrounding Apple's next-generation iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have really started to heat up this week thanks to a string of reports from very reliable sources. First up was KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is regularly a source of accurate intel surrounding Apple's future plans. According to Kuo, Apple plans to release not two but three new iPhones in 2017 , but only one of them will be the hot new model with an OLED display. The other two phones will feature LCD displays just like the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, though additional details aren't yet available. The analyst went on to explain how the curved screen on the OLED iPhone 8 will be designed . Next up was Bloomberg , which rehashed parts of Kuo's report but added that only one model will feature an OLED screen because suppliers still can't produce them quickly enough to keep up with demand. Apple can't even keep up with iPhone 7 Plus demand two months after releasing the phone, so adding another layer of complication would probably be a bad idea.\nDespite all of the leaks and rumors we've seen so far, we still really don't have any idea of what the redesigned iPhone 8 will look like. Of course, that won't stop people from creating gorgeous concept designs based on what we know so far.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nApple acknowledges significant iPhone 6 Plus issue, but repairs won’t be free The exciting iPhone 8 is expected to do what the boring iPhone 7 can’t This is how Apple gets Netflix on its new TV app ",

      "text": "This weekend, Alexa will tell you what’s on sale Posted Apple adds former Wall Street Journal editor to its China PR team \n“Alexa, order a Star Wars robot” is an undeniably awesome thing to say to your helpful home AI assistant. And for this weekend, at least, it’ll actually mean something – and get you $30 off of one of those Sphero BB-8 robots in the process. \nIn Amazon’s tireless quest to take all the pain points out of shopping – and make you buy as much as humanly possible, the mega retailer is utilizing Alexa to push out holiday shopping deals. Asking, “Alexa, what are deals?” will prompt new daily sales. You can also say, “Alexa, I need a holiday helper,” which will prompt something similar, albeit in a decidedly more Seussian fashion. \nThis specific voice promotion runs now through November 21 and includes a variety of different products including Philips Hue lightbulbs, a Samsung TV, chocolate truffles and batteries. Holiday deals, as with politics, make for strange bedfellows. \nThink of it as sort of a dry run for the company’s inevitably massive push into Black Friday and a godsend for people for whom typing products into Amazon’s page has become to burdensome a process. If you do miss the act of clicking things on a computer, however, you can find the full list of deals here . 0",

      "text": "Today, 8:14 AM by Eric M. Zeman @phonescooper \nApple has launched a repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus to fix what has become called touch disease. The issue, according to a class-action lawsuit filed against Apple, leaves the display unresponsive to finger-touch input. \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" said Apple on its web site. \"If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.\" Owners of the iPhone 6 Plus who've already paid for a screen repair to resolve this issue will be refunded the difference between the price they paid for the original service and the new $149 repair amount. Apple's carrier partners are not participating in this program, so any and all repairs need to go through Apple directly.",

And it's similarly tough to repair. It scored a one on iFixit Repairability Score, meaning pretty much no one except professionals should ever open this thing. With the processor, RAM and flash memory soldered onto the logic board, and the battery glued to the case, there's very few things a user can replace on her own.\nSEE ALSO: Despite mixed reactions, new MacBook Pro is selling like crazy\nThat said, the teardown reveals some interesting details about the biggest, thinnest, newest MacBook Pro.\nFor example, just look at this comparison between the Pro's force feedback-equipped trackpad and an iPad mini 4. It's huge!\nBehold, the 15-inch MacBook Pro's trackpad. Almost as big as an iPad mini 4.\nImage: iFixit\nAlso interesting are Apple's brand new fans (photo on top), which come in pairs on the Touch Bar MacBook Pro and keep the device cool. Apple says the fans' asymmetric new blades have better performance than regular ones and produce less noise.\nFor the full teardown, go here .",

Its photos document 20 years of design, from the original iMac through to the Apple Pencil. Ive himself actually appears in a video promoting the project.",

      "text": "iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says GO Apple has finally admitted the issue and offers to fix it Nov 18, 2016 08:20 GMT · By Andrei Vlad · Share: The first reports about issues with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus emerged a few months ago when many owners claimed their smartphones are affected by display flickering or multi-touch problems. At that time, Apple did not comment anything on the matter, probably thinking that this isn't a widespread problem. Furthermore, the display flickering issue has been attributed to the fact that some users have dropped their iPhones more than once, which is why they phones started having problems. Fast forward three months and Apple has decided that these issue aren't that isolated as it believed in the first place. Starting right now, owners of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus affected by the so-called “touch disease” effect can repair them at Apple. Apple now offers to repair all those iPhones that present display flickering or multi-touch issues, but it turns out that these repairs won't come for free. Apple won't even touch your phone without you paying $149, assuming your iPhone's display isn't cracked or broken. iPhone6 flickering issue “ Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.” However, if you have already paid for a service repair related to this issue through Apple or another authorized service provider, you should immediately call the Cupertino-based company for a reimbursement. According to Apple , “ the reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price .” In order to fix your iPhone 6/6 Plus you have three options: head to an Apple authorized service provider, Apple retail store, or via Apple technical support. Keep in mind that you won't be able to fix your iPhone at any of the carriers in your country. CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (2 Images)",

      "text": "– A + Flawed 3rd-party chargers reportedly culprit in Apple's China iPhone 6 investigation By Mike Wuerthele\nFriday, November 18, 2016, 06:48 am PT (09:48 am ET)\nSources close to the investigation on Chinese iPhone 6 models failing with what appears to be a charged battery have told AppleInsider that the main cause of the problems appear to be not related to Apple engineering, but is directly related to the proliferation of low-quality third-party charging peripherals in the country.\nAccording to a preliminary investigation relayed to AppleInsider , poor quality generic charging peripherals, particularly AC to DC converters, are damaging the phone's charge regulating circuitry over time. As a result of the damage, the battery is also not reporting the battery's charge status to the iOS correctly.\nAppleInsider was told that \"exactly 100 percent\" of the phones that have been examined so far manifesting the problem were charged most of the time with non-Apple chargers. AC to DC charging adapters labeled like official Apple adapters can be purchased for as little as $0.50 from disreputable vendors in the country, and cabling is even cheaper.\nAs a result of the damage seemingly induced by the third-party gear, users are seeing erroneously high charge percentages, leading to the faulty conclusion that the phone is shutting off before being fully depleted. In actuality, the phone is shutting off from a lack of power as the battery is, in fact, drained.\nAffected iPhones are powering down with 50 to 60 percent remaining on their battery, the China Consumers Association (CCA) said in a statement on Tuesday. The CCA claims that that \"rather many\" people have submitted reports of the flaw, all with the same manifestation.\nThe phones are failing when the battery is completely drained, which is also preventing the battery from charging. In most cases, the investigators are finding that a battery replacement only fixes the problem temporarily, as the charging circuitry is still damaged.\nThe only long-term fix for an iPhone 6 that has been damaged by low-quality charging peripherals is a motherboard replacement, or a third-party integrated charging circuit replacement.\nThe most recent reports from China are not the only problems that have been reported with poor-quality charging gear. Google Pixel team member Benson Leung has been reviewing USB-C cables on Amazon, and has discovered some problematic offerings that could potentially lead to damage of connected gear .\nAdditionally, engineer Ken Shirriff has examined the Apple iPhone charger in detail, and found a number of features engineered into the adapter not found in sub-par alternatives to protect connected devices from damage.",

      "text": "Apple hires former Wall Street Journal editor to help Chinese PR team By Friday, November 18, 2016, 07:02 am PT (10:02 am ET) Apple has reportedly hired Wei Gu —recently an editor with the Wall Street Journal —as a new director for its Chinese public relations team, operating out of Shanghai. Wei spent four years as the Journal 's wealth and luxury editor in China, TechCrunch noted on Friday. She has 18 years of media experience in all, including over a decade as a Reuters columnist in New York and Hong Kong. Wei actually left the Journal in August, and was taking freelance communications work before getting signed on by Apple. It's not uncommon for journalists to migrate into marketing and PR, and indeed Apple has previously recruited people from websites like The Verge , Anandtech , and TechCrunch . In the latter case, writer Darrell Etherington has since returned to his previous job. After North America, China is Apple's most important market, poised to eventually eclipse others in terms of revenue. The company has had a tougher fight in more recent quarters, though, thanks to the ascendancy of local smartphone makers like Huawei and Oppo. Topics:",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nShares of Salesforce.com ( CRM ) are up $4.07, over 5%, at $79.26, continuing last night’s gains, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q3 revenue and profit that topped analysts’ expectations, and forecast this quarter’s revenue higher as well, and surprised with billings that were up 19%, beating consensus for 13%, while the outlook for 24% billings growth this quarter delights the Street.\nRatings are staying in place but targets are rising. Steven Ashley with R.W. Baird , reiterating an Outperform rating and $90 price target, notes that this “was the first time in eight quarters implied-next-quarter Billings guidance exceeded consensus.”\nShares of Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL ) are up $1.23, over 9%, at $14.59, building on last night’s gains, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q3 revenue and profit that easily topped analysts’ expectations, and forecast this quarter’s profit higher than consensus, despite lower revenue, with markedly higher gross profit margin.\nThe stock has gotten at least one upgrade, from Susquehanna ’s Christopher Rolland , who raises his rating to “Positive” from Neutral, writing that he’s “most encouraged by new profitability details surrounding the restructuring plan,” given that when “management issued a press release regarding the plan just a few weeks ago, they left out the best parts, namely, better gross margins.”\nShares of Applied Materials ( AMAT ) are down 16 cents, or half a percent, at $30.57, recovering from last night’s big sell-off, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q4 and easily beat with its Q1 outlook, but showed weaker-than-expected order rates last quarter and said it will stop disclosing bookings after Q1.\nThere are some conflicting target moves today, with B. Riley ’s Craig Ellis reiterating his buy rating but cutting his target a buck to $38 because “F17/C17 is now more front end loaded.” But Needham & Co .’s Edwin Mok , reiterating a Buy rating, raises his target to $36 from $34, writing that despite “JanQ bookings and the upbeat outlook of sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond should address some of those concerns.”\nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are up 33 cents at $110.28, after Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray this morning wrote in a note to clients that he has taken a look at 134 of the company’s retail stores, all in the U.S., for the iPhone 7, and found 47% of the “ SKUs ” you could choose are available for in-store pickup, versus 40% a month ago. This is trailing last year’s iPhone 6 availability, he notes.\n“At this point, we believe it’s unlikely iPhone reaches supply demand equilibrium by the end of the Dec-16 quarter,” writes Munster, who has an Overweight rating on the shares, and a $155 price target. That should be good for the March quarter outlook, he thinks.\nThe Street is responding to Intel ’s ( INTC ) artificial intelligence event yesterday, during which it said it will be able to best Nvidia ’s ( NVDA ) GPUs for machine learning applications, using the startup Nervana Systems that it bought back in August, as related today by The Inquirer ’s Carly Page .\nSo far, the bears are unconvinced. Raymond James ’s Steven Smigle , who has an Underperform rating on Intel, writes this morning Intel’s data center operation will lose share. “We continue to expect this beachhead position to erode, and nothing in today’s presentations changed our view.”\nIntel stock is down 24 cents, or 0.7%, at $34.78, while Nvidia shares are up $1.64, or 1.8%, at $94.03.",

      "text": "Yinka Agunbiade 20 mins ago \nTech giant Apple has launched a new repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus , addressing complaints about a manufacturing issue that can cause the iPhone 6 Plus to become unresponsive to touch. \nComplaints about the iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen issue started in August, after iFixit published a video highlighting the bug and called it “Touch Disease.” \nTouch Disease presents as a grey flickering bar at the top of the screen and a display that becomes unresponsive or less responsive to touch. \nThe problem is believed to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the logic board of the phone, making repairs difficult. \nThird-party repair outlets speculated that the issue could be linked a structural design flaw. \nMeanwhile Apple’s suggestion is that, some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit Multi-Touch issues after “being dropped multiple times on a hard surface,” causing damage to the device. \nUnder its repair program, Apple will fix affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for a service price of $149. \nCustomers who paid more than $149 to have their devices fixed before the repair program was implemented will be able to get their money reimbursed by Apple.

      "text": "Temecula , California Thursday, November 17, 2016 My phone never did get past the Apple icon all night and by morning, it was VERY warm to the touch...I guess because it stayed illuminated all night. Rich was still sick in spite of taking the meds, so he got in touch with his urologist back home and got a stronger prescription. I did some laundry and then Kit drove me to the Apple Store where I spent the next 3 hours learning that my phone had gone nuts when I tried to reboot it while it was updating, and the only way to fix it was to wipe it clean and take it back to factory settings. This meant I lost all my pictures from our trip. :(( I tested up when the tech was telling me this, and she was very sympathetic, which helped. The good news was that I'd posted some of my pictures to this blog, and also that I hadn't taken that many since the quality of mine aren't as good as what Rich and Pam took. The bad news is that I took lots of pictures of us going through the Canal that neither one of them took and they're gone. Such a bummer!! At least I was able to get my phone restored along with all my apps, contacts, etc. Kit and I were starving at this point, so we ate at a fun place right across the street from the Apple Store, The Lazy Dog. Very good.We went back to her place to check on Rich and he was napping. I finished doing our laundry and she and I left to go to the Thornton Winery for a much deserved glass or 4 of wine. :)) We actually did the white wine tasting, which she gets free as a member, how fun is that?? It was dark by the time we finished, so went home and visited with the guys.We ordered Chinese food for dinner, chatted for a bit and then I was pooped since it had been such a stressful day dealing w my phone.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock In an interview with Bloomberg News earlier this week, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men, said that some of his longest-held and most-prized stocks, once characterized as “forever” holdings, may no longer fall into that category. Alwaleed’s net worth was estimated at $22.5 billion early this year.\nTwo of the major equity assets of Alwaleed’s investment firm Kingdom Holdings are Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), which have been part of the firm’s assets since 1991 and 1997, respectively.\nIn 2001, Prince Alwaleed told Reuters, “The American economy is solid and I am not selling anything. I will not sell any of my shares in any company.” At the time his investments included $9.65 billion in Citigroup, $1.1 billion in News Corp, $932 million in AOL Time Warner, $534 million in Four Seasons hotels, $314 million in Apple and $300 million in Compaq (later acquired by HP).\nOn Tuesday, Alwaleed told Bloomberg, “Everything’s on the table. If our interest requires Kingdom Holding to divest from any company, sure we’ll do it. There’s nothing called forever.”\nThe question, of course, is why now? It’s no secret that low oil prices have hit Saudi Arabia’s foreign exchange reserves hard, forcing withdrawals to meet budget requirements based on price for oil that is no longer realizable. But that hardly seems like a good reason for a private investment fund to consider selling assets, unless the fund’s managers believe something bad is about to happen.\nAnother possible reason is that the Saudi government may be forced to lift the currency’s peg to the U.S. dollar, although Alwaleed sees that as a “last resort” for two or three years down the road. The riyal has been valued at right around 3.75 to the dollar for 30 years, and has helped insulate the country from volatility in energy markets. Without diversifying Saudi Arabia’s economy away from oil, however, the country’s currency is pegged to the dollar whether or not the relationship is official because oil is priced in dollars and that is not going to change.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "A + iPhone 7 supply remains constrained, Apple viewed as unlikely to catch up to demand by end of year   07:23 am PT (10:23 am ET) Retail availability of the iPhone 7— particularly the jumbo-sized iPhone 7 Plus— remains in short supply just a week before Black Friday, a new survey has found, suggesting Apple is still struggling to satisfy consumer demand for its latest-generation handset. Analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray polled 134 U.S. Apple stores and found that just 47 percent of iPhone 7 models were in stock. While the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 91 percent availability, just 3 percent of 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus models were available in stores. Supplies are even more constrained in China, where iPhone availability is just 16 percent— a slight improvement from 12 percent a month ago. There, Piper Jaffray has been tracking online stock from carrier China Unicom. In contrast, by this point a year ago, the iPhone 6s had reached 100 percent availability at Apple's retail stores. To Munster, this suggests demand for the iPhone 7 series is outpacing last year's iPhone 6s. As a result, Munster believes it is now unlikely that Apple will reach supply-demand equilibrium by the end of the December quarter, which includes the lucrative holiday shopping season. AppleInsider reported in late September that initial iPhone 7 availability was restricted by an international freight logjam. Munster's findings correspond with that to some degree —while overall iPhone 7 model availability stayed at 35 percent from late September to mid October, it jumped to 46 percent by the end of October. Munster has forecast iPhone unit growth of 3 percent year over year for the December quarter. He also expects that tight iPhone 7 supply at Apple stores is a slight positive sign for the following March 2017 quarter. Apple has been mum on iPhone 7 sales, opting this year to not reveal opening weekend sales, citing the fact that demand at launch always outstrips available supply. The conclusion of the December quarter will represent the first full quarter of iPhone 7 series sales, giving investors and industry watchers their first indication of how the new models are performing.

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Friday, November 18, 2016 Apple Announces $149 Repair Program For iPhone 6 Plus ‘Touch Disease’ Apple is offering to repair iPhone 6 Plus handsets that exhibit display flickering or are having multi-touch issues, though not for free as consumers had hoped. Instead, the \"Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus,\" as Apple is calling it, is a new service that runs $149, assuming the screen is in working order without any cracks or otherwise broken. Three months ago Apple was hit with a class action lawsuit filed in California. The plaintiffs accused Apple of violating the state's consumer fraud statues, alleging that Apple had been aware of an issue that caused iPhone displays to exhibit a thin gray flickering line on the top and in some instances become unresponsive. This was dubbed \" Touch Disease \" by iFixIt , a teardown website that posts DIY repair guides and sells repair tools for electronics. \"Many other iPhone owners have communicated with Apple’s employees and agents to request that Apple remedy and/or address the Touchscreen Defect and/or resultant damage at no expense. Apple has failed and/or refused to do so,\" the lawsuit stated. While that lawsuit is presumably still pending, Apple is willing to repair iPhone devices suffering from so-called Touch Disease for a fee, though it isn't willing to admit culpability. Apple instead suggest the issue is one of user negligence in handling the device.\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" Apple says.Anyone who has already paid Apple or an authorized service provide for repair related to this issue can contact the Cupertino outfit to be reimbursed for any amount spent above $149 on having it fixed.",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 18th, 2016 \nAs expected, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 caused a huge dive in market share. The company’s shipments dropped 14% compared to the same quarter last year, which was the biggest annual decline for Samsung since 2014. \nDespite that, the company was still able to capture 19.2% of the overall market, which is still more than Apple’s 11.2%. Furthermore, Apple suffered a drop of their own, though not quite as severe as Samsung’s — they moved from 46 million units down to 43 million. \nBoth companies seemingly fell victim to the ongoing siege from Chinese manufacturers who are producing quality devices at aggressive prices. Both Huawei and Oppo increased smartphone shipments on the quarter compared to the same one a year ago, with Oppo nearly doubling their performance. \nIt’ll be interesting to see how all of this plays out going into the holiday season where smartphone deals and advertising will reach fever pitch. Samsung will still have some fresh devices to put out there up against Apple’s latest, and they may even be able to offer their most aggressive deals ever in this time of need. \nNo matter what happens, though, they’ll need to get back on track for 2017 with a successful Galaxy S8 launch, so we’re sure the bulk of their attention is already fixated on that.",

The system currently assumes annual returns of 7.5 percent, which is still far too optimistic. So CalPERS plans to revise its expectations downward, which would force governments to kick in more money to meet liabilities. Local government budgets, of course, are already stretched. It isn’t long before they’ll have to ask the state and, potentially, the federal government for a bailout. And with Republicans in control in Washington, it’s hard to imagine California getting any sympathy. \nCalifornia’s state government has enjoyed finally being back in the black. But with all these pension liabilities coming due, it’s unclear how long the good times will last. \nIf you’re underfunding pension liabilities, you’re not really in the black.",

      "text": "  \nHow many light bulbs were harmed in the making of Apple’s latest TV ad? A lot, by the looks of it. \nIt’s for the latest MacBook Pro, the one with the Touch Bar , a feature the company hopes will be enough to convince consumers that the hefty price tag for the revamped machine is worth every cent. \nAs for the ad, it’s an unusual one for Apple in that for the first 90 seconds of the 97-second sequence, the audience has no idea what it’s for. Or who it’s by. \nUnlike many of its other TV ads , there’s no minimalist setting, no narration, and, importantly, no Apple product. Instead we see an endless line of light bulbs exploding to Rossini’s rollicking William Tell Overture. \nMore: Apple’s new MacBook Pro has an OLED Touch Bar that changes with your apps \nOf course, there’s nothing wrong with unveiling the product at the very last moment when everyone has almost given up wondering what it is, after all, Apple did the very same thing when it kept everyone waiting years before finally revealing the latest Pro to the world in October \nThe new MacBook Pro ad is essentially a roller coaster ride through mankind’s greatest discoveries and inventions – steam power, flight, robotics, you get the idea. They even managed to squeeze a toilet roll in there. Oh, and there are loads of exploding light bulbs throughout, presumably symbolic of all the ideas that have helped shape our world through the ages. \nMore: Apple’s new MacBook Pro doesn’t outrun its competitors, but the Touch Bar is special \nIn the ad’s climactic moments we indeed learn that “ideas push the world forward.” We also discover that the new MacBook Pro – the one with the Touch Bar, not the cheaper one without – is the tool “for all the ideas to come.” \nThe ad ends with a light bulb. Exploding.",

Over time the the controller chips can get loose and, thus, malfunction.\nAs part of the repair program , Apple's offering repairs for affected iPhone 6 Pluses for $149 as long as the screen's not cracked or damaged.\nParticipating service centers include Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Service Providers and Apple Technical Support. Wireless carriers are not participating, so don't bother bringing your busted iPhone over to AT&T, Verizon, etc.\nIt's great to see Apple finally acknowledge the issue, but it's unclear why the repair program is limited to iPhone 6 Plus devices\nApple says it'll contact customers who paid out of pocket to fix their iPhone 6 Plus either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider (if the repair place isn't authorized by Apple, you're out of luck) for a reimbursement.\n\"The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price,\" states Apple's repair website.\nIt's great to see Apple finally acknowledge the issue, but it's unclear why the repair program is limited to iPhone 6 Plus devices and not iPhone 6 as well. According to iFixit , iPhone 6 can also be affected by Touch Disease, although the problem is more prevalent on iPhone 6 Pluses.\nAt the very least, following a lawsuit filed in August, Apple might finally be able to put Touch Disease to bed.\nBONUS: The 3 best things about the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar",

      "title": "Opinion: A Coffee-Table Book About, For and By Apple",
      "text": "  Opinion: A Coffee-Table Book About, For and By Apple An expensive catalog of Apple products, and then some by Aldrin Calimlim November 18, 2016 \nApple’s latest product is a book. Not a MacBook, nor a PowerBook, nor any other type of laptop computer or notebook. Not even an iBooks e-book. It’s a real, tangible, flippable, honest-to-goodness book. \nTitled “ Designed by Apple in California ” (after the fine-print colophon found on the Cupertino-based company’s products), the book presents an overview of industrial design as practiced by Apple through nearly 20 years’ worth of products released in its modern history. This overview, though, is decidedly visual. “This is a book with very few words,” Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, writes in his foreword. Aside from the introduction, which itself displays a deliberate economy of words, the other instances of text in the book are the supplement describing the featured products and the simple dedication to Apple’s late cofounder and former CEO, Steve Jobs. \nThe book starts off with the very first iMac, which was introduced shortly after Jobs’ return to Apple in 1998; the pioneering desktop computer is in fact presented in all its gumdrop-esque glory, with its trademark translucent plastic color enclosure. It then concludes with the Apple Pencil, the modest yet capable digital stylus released for iPad Pro tablets in 2015. But not all Apple products released in the interim are included, with Ive noting that the book features only those “that seem significant, that demonstrate learning, or for which we simply have affection.” \nNotice the we . For better or worse, “Designed by Apple in California” is not just a book that’s about Apple, but also a book that’s for Apple and by Apple.i \nA strong argument can be made that Apple should have entrusted the production of the book to an art book publisher like Taschen. Then the book would have been realized less as a vanity project than a more objective objet d’art, as it were. (For an excellent third-party photographic tribute to Apple design, see Jonathan Zufi’s “ Iconic ,” which covers products from Apple’s founding in 1976 through the book’s publication in 2013.) \nBut in the end, one must concede that the book is something that could and should be made by Apple and Apple alone. It is, to use Ive’s favorite adverb, unapologetically Apple. It is, as stated by its very title, designed by Apple in California. \nThe book is bound in off-white hardback linen covers, with the Apple logo embossed on the front and the title on the spine. In between are 300 pages of bespoke milled German paper with gilded matte silver edges that have been screen-printed on with low-ghost inks. If that sounds vaguely similar to a litany of specifications for a specially anodized iPhone, it’s because the book is itself one impressive piece of Apple hardware, not unlike the products showcased inside it. \nThe book is essentially a glorified catalog of Apple merchandise, but it’s one that goes beyond merely featuring the finished items by also highlighting the materials and techniques that went into their making. It revels in the symbiosis between style and substance, form and function, process and product. So while it has plenty of pictures of iMacs, iPods, iPhones, and iPads that closely resemble marketing images readily available elsewhere, it occasionally turns to a never-before-seen spread of a lineup of special cutting tools or an exploded flat-lay of a certain device’s bare anatomy. \nEight years in the making, the book contains 450 high-resolution full-color images, all shot by the renowned photographer Andrew Zuckerman, whose penchant for stark white backgrounds is a perfect fit for the famously spare “less is more” aesthetic of the Apple design team that the likes of Samsung could only imitate with varying degrees of success. Consigning these images to the realm of pixels — as in a mere blog post, a Facebook album, a Twitter moment, an Instagram feed, a Pinterest board, or even an enhanced e-book — doesn’t do them justice. As suggested by its rather hefty price tag (its small edition costs $199 while its large edition costs $299), it’s meant to be looked at in the so-called real world after being picked off a shelf in an academic library, or a coffee table in what could only be the home of an ardent admirer of Apple design. \nIn “Objectified,” the 2009 documentary film on industrial design directed by Gary Hustwit, Apple is heralded by Dieter Rams (of “ the ten commandments of good design ” fame) as the one company that truly derides the “arbitrariness and thoughtlessness with which things are produced and brought to the market.” It’s no coincidence that the film’s opening narration is by none other than Apple’s Jonathan Ive. “When you see an object, you make so many assumptions about that object in seconds,” he says. “What it does, how well it’s going to do it, how heavy it is, how much you think it should cost … The object testifies to the people that conceived it, thought about it, developed it, manufactured it. Ranging from issues of form, to material, to its architecture. To how it connects to you, how you touch it, how you hold it. Every object, intentional or not, speaks to who put it there.” \nThe object that is “Designed by Apple in California” is no exception. \nIt’s a pity, though, that the book comes out in a year of relatively low innovation from Apple, whose new product releases, including the iPhone 7, the Apple Watch Series 2, and the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, have little to offer beyond incremental improvements. It would seem, then, that in confronting the threat of stagnation looming large on its design team as it goes forward, Apple has seen it fit to look back. \n“Designed by Apple in California” is available exclusively in select Apple Stores and from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the U.K. and the U.S. \nSee also",

      "text": "Reddit The 2017 Jeep Compass unveiled this week will be one of the first new Jeep models to add Apple CarPlay stock via the latest in-dash entertainment platform from Fiat Chrysler dubbed Uconnect 4.0. Available with an option of 5.0-, 7.0- or 8.4-inch touch screens, the CarPlay enabled Uconnect 4.0 platform from Fiat Chrysler was already enabled on the new 300, Charger and Challenger models as of September. But this is appears to be one of the first Jeep models that will get the option stock when it goes on sale in the coming weeks. The 2017 Compass is expected to be available early next year. While Apple first added Jeep alongside sister companies Chrysler, Dodge, and Fiat back in 2014 to its list of companies planning to support CarPlay, it is yet to actually add a Jeep model with CarPlay to its list of supported vehicles . So far Apple hasn’t updated its list of vehicles that come with CarPlay to add the 2017 Jeep Compass. Here’s a look at the new platform from back in September when it debuted on the first Chrysler and Dodge models: Earlier this year after market accessory maker Alpine started selling a CarPlay display that can be installed in some Jeep models.

      "text": "Flip \nApple’s iPhone 6 Plus was a huge success, but customers are facing some issues with the device. iPhone 6 Plus users have been complaining for several months now about touch disease,” and the company has finally come up with a solution, reports Engadget. Image Source: iphonedigital/flickr.com Suspense over what triggers “ touch disease” \nEvery day, large numbers of devices get affected with this problem, and there seems no end to it in the near future, reported several repair techs, including Jessa Jones.The symptoms of the problem are a flickering gray bar across the top of the screen and unresponsiveness of the touch screen. They continue to get worse until the problem is fixed or the phone is unusable. \nAccording to Apple’s “Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus,” the problem takes place when the device is dropped several times on a hard surface, putting stress on it. This suggests that the owners themselves are responsible for the problem. \nHowever, iFixit, citing repair experts, says that the main cause of the problem lies with the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone, which convert touch information into inputs for the phone. Apple does offer a solution to the problem, but it will cost you. \n“If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149,” the iPhone firm says . Apple offering repair, but not free \nApple is offering its repair program for five years after the original sale date, says Engadget. This amount is less than the usual out-of-warranty repair price of $329 that the company charges for such repairs. Apple will reimburse the difference between the cost and $149 to those who have already paid to get their iPhone 6 Plus repaired using Apple’s service or an authorized technician. But the fact is that the issue is not free, and customers who opted to replace their phone instead of getting it fixed have nothing to gain from this program. \nApple will first examine the iPhone 6 Plus devices it gets for repairs to determine the device’s eligibility for the program. The smartphone should be in a working condition. The company is limiting repair to the original country of purchase. Some owners have reportedly filed lawsuits against Apple. We will have to wait to see what impact this will have on Apple’s progress.",

By Tiernan Ray \nHere are some things going on today in your world of tech : \nShares of Salesforce.com ( CRM ) are up $4.07, over 5%, at $79.26, continuing last night’s gains, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q3 revenue and profit that topped analysts’ expectations, and forecast this quarter’s revenue higher as well, and surprised with billings that were up 19%, beating consensus for 13%, while the outlook for 24% billings growth this quarter delights the Street. \nRatings are staying in place but targets are rising. Steven Ashley with R.W. Baird , reiterating an Outperform rating and $90 price target, notes that this “was the first time in eight quarters implied-next-quarter Billings guidance exceeded consensus.” \nShares of Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL ) are up $1.23, over 9%, at $14.59, building on last night’s gains, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q3 revenue and profit that easily topped analysts’ expectations, and forecast this quarter’s profit higher than consensus, despite lower revenue, with markedly higher gross profit margin. \nThe stock has gotten at least one upgrade, from Susquehanna ’s Christopher Rolland , who raises his rating to “Positive” from Neutral, writing that he’s “most encouraged by new profitability details surrounding the restructuring plan,” given that when “management issued a press release regarding the plan just a few weeks ago, they left out the best parts, namely, better gross margins.” \nShares of Applied Materials ( AMAT ) are down 16 cents, or half a percent, at $30.57, recovering from last night’s big sell-off, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q4 and easily beat with its Q1 outlook, but showed weaker-than-expected order rates last quarter and said it will stop disclosing bookings after Q1. \nThere are some conflicting target moves today, with B. Riley ’s Craig Ellis reiterating his buy rating but cutting his target a buck to $38 because “F17/C17 is now more front end loaded.” But Needham & Co .’s Edwin Mok , reiterating a Buy rating, raises his target to $36 from $34, writing that despite “JanQ bookings and the upbeat outlook of sustainable growth in 2017 and beyond should address some of those concerns.” \nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are up 33 cents at $110.28, after Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray this morning wrote in a note to clients that he has taken a look at 134 of the company’s retail stores, all in the U.S., for the iPhone 7, and found 47% of the “ SKUs ” you could choose are available for in-store pickup, versus 40% a month ago. This is trailing last year’s iPhone 6 availability, he notes. \n“At this point, we believe it’s unlikely iPhone reaches supply demand equilibrium by the end of the Dec-16 quarter,” writes Munster, who has an Overweight rating on the shares, and a $155 price target. That should be good for the March quarter outlook, he thinks. \nThe Street is responding to Intel ’s ( INTC ) artificial intelligence event yesterday, during which it said it will be able to best Nvidia ’s ( NVDA ) GPUs for machine learning applications, using the startup Nervana Systems that it bought back in August, as related today by The Inquirer ’s Carly Page . \nSo far, the bears are unconvinced. Raymond James ’s Steven Smigle , who has an Underperform rating on Intel, writes this morning Intel’s data center operation will lose share. “We continue to expect this beachhead position to erode, and nothing in today’s presentations changed our view.” \nIntel stock is down 24 cents, or 0.7%, at $34.78, while Nvidia shares are up $1.64, or 1.8%, at $94.03.

      "title": "Apple's iPhone Touch Disease: Fixed for $149",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s How Much It Will Cost You for Apple to Fix iPhone ‘Touch Disease’ \nThe iPhone’s “Touch Disease” can be cured by Apple—if you’re willing to pay for it. \nApple on Thursday published a Support page on its site that says it’ll offer a “ multitouch repair program for iPhone 6 Plus .” The support document says Apple will repair any iPhone 6 Plus owner’s device if they’re seeing the smartphone “exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues.” \nBut there’s a catch: Apple is charging $149 to make the repair. \nEarlier this year, hardware-repair company iFixit published a report, saying that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus released in 2014 are suffering from what it called, “Touch Disease.” The company found in its testing that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus come with chips that sit inside the device that permit the screen to interact with a user’s touch inputs. Those chips, called Touch IC Chips, connect to the iPhone’s main board with small soldered balls. Over time, iFixit says, those balls can crack and start to lose contact between the display and the board. As it gets worse, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus could lose all touch functionality. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nMany iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users have complained of the problem over the last several months, and criticized Apple for forcing them to buy a new iPhone at full price in order to address their problem. Several lawsuits were also launched , citing Apple’s policy in response to Touch Disease. \nApple has largely remained silent on the Touch Disease and didn’t mention the term in its support document announcing its new program. \nThe support document also appears to differ in notable ways from user accounts, as well as the investigation conducted by iFixit. \nFor one, iFixit and users say that the iPhone 6 is also affected by the flaw, but Apple says it will only replace the iPhone 6 Plus. What’s more, Apple was clear in its support document that the Touch Disease occurs when the iPhone 6 Plus is “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” However, iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a statement in response to Apple’s move on Thursday that his company experience the problem on devices that hadn’t been dropped. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \n“Apple is correct that dropping the device onto a hard surface could cause this issue,” Wiens said. “But that’s not the only cause: we have seen this problem on phones that have never been dropped. And in phones that have lived their entire lives protected in cases.” \nWiens also criticized Apple for not acknowledging that the problem is caused by a “manufacturing defect” and noted that “many iPhone 6 owners have also been affected.” \nNow that Apple AAPL is charging $149 to fix Touch Disease on the iPhone 6 Plus, the company will also issue a reimbursement to anyone who paid full price for a replacement for the same problem. The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the amount affected customers paid for fix and $149. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment on the program. ",

      "text": "Apple blames owners for iPhone 6 Touch Disease, will fix the problem for $149 Apple claims dropping the iPhone 6 Plus multiple times causes the issue on Nov 18, 2016, 11:30 AM TechSpot Back in August, it was reported that a growing number of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users were reporting their devices had been affected by ‘Touch Disease,’ a manufacturing issue that resulted in a flickering gray bar and, ultimately, an unresponsive screen. Now, Apple has finally acknowledged the problem and says it will repair it – for $149. Touch Disease is a result of the devices’ bendability, which causes the controller chip’s soldering to crack and start to lose contact with the board. “As the crack deepens into a full separation of the chip-board bond, the periods of no touch function become more frequent,” said microsoldering repair specialist Jessa Jones. Up until now, the Cupertino company hasn’t even acknowledged the existence of Touch Disease. Some owners claim that Apple told them buying a new device was the only solution if the affected iPhone was out of warranty. Now, Apple has launched a “ Multi-Touch Repair Program ” to address the issue. While Touch Disease has been reported in both variants of the iPhone 6, Apple’s service only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, which, due to its larger size, is more susceptible to the problem. Unsurprisingly, Apple isn’t claiming liability for Touch Disease; instead, it is blaming clumsy owners whose iPhones have been “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” Not only is Apple blaming customers for Touch Disease, but the company is also charging $149 to fix it. While this is half the price of normal out of warranty repairs, it’s still a case of consumers paying for a design flaw. Anyone who had their device repaired or replaced for similar symptoms – which could have cost more than $149 – will have the difference reimbursed by Apple. iFixit, which was one of the first publications to shine a light on the issue , has been critical of Apple’s repair program. CEO Kyle Wiens says he has seen Touch Disease on phones that have never been dropped. He added that an Apple Genius confirmed the company wasn’t repairing the affected iPhones but swapping them for refurbished devices. Moreover, the data from the old phones wasn’t being transferred. Apple is facing a class-action lawsuit from owners of iPhones affected by Touch Disease. How, or if, the new repair program will affect the case is unclear. Related Reads",

      "title": "Where Do All Those Mobile Apps Come From?",
      "text": "Source: Thinkstock In June of 2008, there were a grand total of 800 apps at Apple’s App store from which an iPhone user could choose. Just over five years later, in October 2013, the number of iPhone apps reached a million. Three years later, the number doubled again to reach 2 million.\nAndroid, the other major mobile platform, reached 2.4 million apps at its Google Play store at the end of September 2016. Android, which first shipped on a smartphone in October 2008, reached 1 million apps at about the same time as Apple iOS did.\niOS and Android combine to dominate the smartphone platform market with nearly 98% of the total global market. A Pew Research study published this past February reported that 87% of adults use the internet and 69% own a smartphone. By comparison, a median of 54% of people across 21 developing and emerging countries reported using the internet and 37% reported owning a smartphone.\nWhen it comes to developing those millions of apps for smartphone and internet users, the single city that leads in the technical development of new apps is Bengaluru, India, a big city in a developing nation. Also known as Bangalore, the city’s population is estimated to top 11.5 million, making it the country’s third-largest city, trailing only Mumbai and Delhi.\nBengaluru is also one of the global leaders in non-technical app development, where app development is outsourced from one company to another.\nBased on data collected by Flurry Analytics from its own usage data, Flurry has named the top 10 world cities for technical app development and the top 10 for non-technical development.\nFirst the 10 top cities for technical development:\nBengaluru Taipei London Delhi Tokyo San Francisco Bay area Beijing Moscow New York City Hong Kong The non-technical top 10 where outsourcing is at its highest levels are:\nSan Francisco Bay area London Bengaluru Hong Kong Delhi Mumbai Tel Aviv Paris Seattle Moscow With three cities in one list and two in the other, India could easily lay claim to the app-making hub of the global industry.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "Infineon Technologies ( IFNNY ) , a German chipmaker whose customers include Apple ( AAPL ) and Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) , is expected to report robust revenue growth next week thanks to the release of the iPhone 7 and surging growth in demand for automotive semiconductors.\nThe Neubiberg-based company is scheduled to report fourth quarter and full year earnings results on Wednesday November 23.\nA consensus of 31 analysts compiled by FactSet expects Infineon to report sales of €6.48 billion ($6.9 billion) for the 12 months through September 30, up 11.9% from a year earlier, compared with the company's guidance of between €6.37 billion and €6.6 billion. The analysts also expect Ebitda to jump 27% to €1.68 billion.\nAn analyst attributed the likely growth in the fourth quarter to demand from smartphone makers.\n\"The upside is expected to come mainly from the smartphone segment following strong sales of the iPhone 7 and Chinese smartphones,\" said Janardan Manon, an analyst with Liberum Capital. \"Results are also expected to be supported by strength in auto demand, particularly in the Chinese and European markets.\"\nInvestors will also key on whether the company can continue to stay on its path of robust growth even as more rivals choose to expand through M&As, creating tougher competition to grab orders from customers in the electronics, automotive, and digital security space.\nInfineon has continued to enjoy growth since 2013 and mostly recently booked an impressive 33% sales expansion in 2015. In the automotive semiconductor business, it competes head on with Dutch player NXP Semiconductors ( NXPI ) , which Qualcomm ( QCOM ) last month said would acquire, and Japan's Renesas Electronics RNECY, which announced the acquisition of Intersil ( ISIL ) in September.",

      "text": "The iPhone’s “Touch Disease” can be cured by Apple--if you’re willing to pay for it.\nApple on Thursday published a Support page on its site that says it’ll offer a “ multitouch repair program for iPhone 6 Plus .” The support document says Apple will repair any iPhone 6 Plus owner’s device if they’re seeing the smartphone “exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues.”\nBut there’s a catch: Apple is charging $149 to make the repair.\nEarlier this year, hardware-repair company iFixit published a report, saying that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus released in 2014 are suffering from what it called, “Touch Disease.” The company found in its testing that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus come with chips that sit inside the device that permit the screen to interact with a user’s touch inputs. Those chips, called Touch IC Chips, connect to the iPhone’s main board with small soldered balls. Over time, iFixit says, those balls can crack and start to lose contact between the display and the board. As it gets worse, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus could lose all touch functionality.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nMany iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users have complained of the problem over the last several months, and criticized Apple for forcing them to buy a new iPhone at full price in order to address their problem. Several lawsuits were also launched , citing Apple’s policy in response to Touch Disease.\nApple has largely remained silent on the Touch Disease and didn’t mention the term in its support document announcing its new program.\nThe support document also appears to differ in notable ways from user accounts, as well as the investigation conducted by iFixit.\nFor one, iFixit and users say that the iPhone 6 is also affected by the flaw, but Apple says it will only replace the iPhone 6 Plus. What’s more, Apple was clear in its support document that the Touch Disease occurs when the iPhone 6 Plus is “dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” However, iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a statement in response to Apple’s move on Thursday that his company experience the problem on devices that hadn’t been dropped.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \n“Apple is correct that dropping the device onto a hard surface could cause this issue,” Wiens said. “But that's not the only cause: we have seen this problem on phones that have never been dropped. And in phones that have lived their entire lives protected in cases.”\nWiens also criticized Apple for not acknowledging that the problem is caused by a “manufacturing defect” and noted that “many iPhone 6 owners have also been affected.”\nNow that Apple AAPL is charging $149 to fix Touch Disease on the iPhone 6 Plus, the company will also issue a reimbursement to anyone who paid full price for a replacement for the same problem. The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the amount affected customers paid for fix and $149.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment on the program.",

That data is apparently uploaded without the user knowing or receiving notification. \n“You only need to have iCloud itself enabled” for the data to be sent, Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov told the Intercept.’",

      "title": "Apple admits 'Touch Disease' is real, blames users for damage",
      "text": "By James Walker 15 mins ago in Technology Several months after the iPhone 6's \"touch disease\" problem first hit the headlines, Apple has acknowledged that the touchscreens on some phones may stop working. However, it is blaming users for dropping the handsets and will be charging for repairs. Touch Disease was first reported back in August. An iFixit blog post detailed how repair specialists had been noting an influx of iPhone 6 handsets being sent in with unresponsive touchscreens and a flickering grey bar at the top of the display. The problem appeared to be a widespread hardware defect. Experts warned it could eventually affect every iPhone 6 device. Three months and a class action lawsuit later, Apple has finally accepted that Touch Disease is real. However, rather than offer the free repairs users had hoped for, the company said its devices are not at fault. It blamed users for dropping phones \"multiple times\" onto hard services. \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" said Apple . Apple's explanation of Touch Disease doesn't fit with what the repair shops have been seeing. iPhone handsets that haven't been dropped or placed under excessive stress have experienced the problem. It is thought that the iPhone 6 Plus' famous tendency to bend when under pressure flexes the internal connections that attach the touch controller to the logic board. Over time, the join wears down and then breaks off completely, leaving the touchscreen unusable. Touch Disease can be easily remedied at repair shops for a small expense. Apple is now offering its own discounted service price for affected handsets. The company will repair affected iPhone 6 Plus devices that are \"in working order\" for $149. iPhone 6 handsets are not covered by the lower repair price. Apple said only the larger Plus model is impacted by the touchscreen issues. The $149 service offer isn't the free repair that owners have been asking for. It's still more expensive than some third-party repairs and isn't even available for the smaller iPhone 6 model. While the larger Plus edition is the most at risk of Touch Disease, there have been reports of its 4.7-inch sibling running into similar issues. Micro-soldering experts had previously called on Apple to offer free warranty services to affected handsets. Apple's handling of the situation hasn't impressed customers. The company has known of the problem for months without taking action. Customers who have already had their phone repaired may be able to claim reimbursement from Apple though. Apple said its support staff will be able to help iPhone 6 Plus owners who have already paid for a repair at an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider. The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price paid for the original service and Apple's new $149 repair offer. Currently affected iPhone 6 Plus devices will be covered by the worldwide repair program for five years after the original date of purchase.",

      "text": "Andre Da Costa | November 18, 2016 in How-To \nThe latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 10 puts a lot of focus on widgets and notifications. Widgets and notifications help you keep up with pertinent information from all your apps, without the need to even open an app. You can quickly review and interact with widgets on the Lock Screen, or you can quickly swipe to the left to review all your widgets to get a bird’s eye view of the day’s activities. To get the most out of widgets, customizing the appearance and order is critical to having a great experience and in this article, I’m going to show you how to do it. Edit, Modify and Arrange Widgets in iOS 10 \nTo access your iOS 10 widgets, swipe to the left. Swiping left will display a list of the default out of box configuration for widgets. To start modifying the layout, swipe down to the bottom of the screen, then tap the Edit button. \nThis will open the Add Widgets setting. Here you will see all your activated widgets, along with more widgets for different apps you can add. To remove a widget, tap the Red Button . \nTo organize your widgets in the order you like, tap a widget, then drag up or down then release. Tap Done to confirm your changes. \nYou might be wondering why apps like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram don’t support widgets. Those apps benefit more from notifications, which received major improvements in iOS 10. You can now take action on notifications on the Lock Screen, allowing you to view or clear notifications or even interact with the app that’s sending the notification, all without unlocking your phone. \nFor information, you might want to view at a glance, like your upcoming calendar events, reminders, latest news or weather, widgets are the best way to do it. \nConclusion \nApple launched iOS 10 in early September and widgets are just one of the new and improved features on the mobile OS for iPhone and iPad. Some of my favorite features include Raise to Wake, improved 3D Touch support, and Control Center. Some of these new features require newer Apple devices, so, that’s something to keep in mind. If you haven’t upgraded yet, check out our previous article for more details on iOS 10. Also, review our instructions how to back up your device Apple device before upgrading.

      "text": "share There has been no shortage of jokes about Apple’s decision to release a $300 coffee-table book highlighting its products . But, in perhaps the best takedown, late-night talk-show host Stephen Colbert created a parody mimicking the videos Apple typically uses to introduce new products. “We were able to take an experience that was instantly familiar and charge $300 for it,” the faux Jony Ive states. Other narrators highlight some key features of the Apple book including its “touch page technology” that lets you swipe to move from one page to the next. “The Apple book’s pages are sequential,” one voice-over states. “60 is followed by 61, which is followed by 62, followed by 63 and so on.” The actual book , which went on sale this week, comes in $200 and $300 versions. Colbert’s video ripping said book to shreds, meanwhile, is free. recode_divider",

      "text": "AP Photo/Eric Risberg November 18, 2016 | 09:57AM PT \nApple has a solution for iPhone 6 Plus owners that are experiencing an unresponsive touch screen, a phenomenon that’s been dubbed “touch disease,” but the company’s help comes with a price tag attached: Apple’s new multi-touch repair program offers a fix for affected devices for $149, according to a new support document (hat tip to MacRumors ). \nReports about the issue first surfaced this summer. Some iPhone 6 Plus device owners have been experiencing a flicker on the top of their screen that coincides with a gradual loss in touch screen responsiveness. At worst, affected devices can stop responding to touch input altogether. \nRepair site iFixit highlighted the issue in a video in August, and also pointed to what it called a design defect as a possible culprit: The iPhone 6 Plus uses less rigid shielding for its innards, making them more susceptible to bending and other forms of outside force. \nHowever, Apple seems to out the blame for the problem squarely on iPhone 6 owners. “Some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” the company writes in its support document. \nThat’s also why the company isn’t covering “touch disease” issues under its warranty. However, the $149 repair still is cheaper than the fix would be under Apple’s usual repair rates. The company is offering iPhone 6 Plus owners who have repaired their device before the new offer became effective reimbursements. Filed Under: ",

      "text": "0 \nEarlier this year, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 with its lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. While Apple wasn’t the first to do it, they obviously riled up the most attention and backlash, throwing “courage” back at the company that’s putting a lot of focus on a wireless (accessories) future for its flagship smartphones. \nOne step towards that direction is more wireless headphones. That includes more Beats-branded options, and the top of the list: AirPods. Apple’s first major foray into truly wireless earphones, they share a similar design aesthetic to the standard EarPods, but obviously they lack any wires. \nThere are a lot of bullet points to consider when looking at the AirPods, too. They can sense when they are in your ears, and they’ll pause automatically when you take them out. There’s a simple one-tap setup process, too, which can make it easy to sync up with other Apple products, so quickly switching sources —especially with Control Center— will be easy. \nThere’s the W1 chip inside the tiny frame, which manages better battery life, and Apple says it will also improve wireless connectivity to boot. There is five hours worth of listening, 24 hours of overall battery life, and charging them for 15 minutes will net you three hours of battery life. \nLike I said, there’s a lot of good stuff here. \nYou tap on the AirPod and you call up Siri — that’s how you control things. The important things, like making a call, play a playlist, ask Siri how to get somewhere, and how to adjust the volume of what’s playing. So if you don’t want to touch your phone, and you want to turn up the volume, you have to ask Siri to do that. \nAll of that to get here: How comfortable is that in every day usage? I can’t help but think that Apple stacked the AirPods with so much technology, that they almost got lost in the conception of it, and the technical rollout, that they overlooked a simple feature in physical controls. \nThere are physical controls, of course. You have to tap either AirPod to get access to Siri, after all. But why stop there? We’ve seen other truly wireless headphones on the market that offer on-device controls, like the Beats Solo3 for instance, and others have just as small a profile as the AirPods. \nPhysical controls would be easier to control playback and volume, and it also avoids any kind of awkwardness when you might happen to be around people. Talking to yourself, or to Siri, just to turn up the volume? Seems like a genuinely strange path to go down. \nThe other features in the AirPods still have me interested, especially how easy it will be to connect to devices, but that voice-only controls has me hesitant. So I’m curious: How do you feel about the AirPods? Are they on your radar at all? Or do you plan on picking up other truly wireless headphones instead? Let me know!",

      "text": "Latest News And Scoops On Smartphone Now Playing Apple acknowledged that some iPhone 6 Plus units are affected by the so-called iPhone Touch Disease and it's launching a program to address the issues. The repair is still not free, but at least it costs much less than it used to. ( Chris McGrath | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nThe so-called iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease is finally getting some proper attention from Apple, as the company just announced an official repair program for the issue. \nWhile some might have hoped it would be free, however, that's not the case. Apple announced that for a $149 fee, it will take care of certain issues affecting iPhone 6 Plus smartphones. Nevertheless, this is still substantially more affordable than Apple's previous $329 service charge. \nIn a service document, Apple acknowledges that some iPhone 6 Plus units may experience flickering on their display or some issues with multitouch after several drops on a hard surface, followed by additional \"stress.\" Terms And Conditions \n\"If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149,\" explains the company. \nIn other words, this refers to the iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease , although the company never refers to these issues using this phrase. The part about the iPhone being dropped multiple times on a hard surface, however, indicates that Apple is still not willing to admit that some kind of engineering defect may be in the mix. How The iPhone Touch Disease Manifests \nThe Touch Disease mostly affects iPhone 6 Plus units, although it's not limited to this model — other iPhones may experience such issues as well. If your iPhone has been hit by the Touch Disease, the display may start to flicker, you may see a gray bar at the top of the screen, and you may experience screen unresponsiveness to touch . \nBased on user reports that have flooded the internet so far, the problem is quite widespread and Apple's new repair program goes to prove that it's not exactly a small-scale issue. Apple's solution comes as may iPhone users criticized and even sued the company for continuing to charge $329 to fix out-of-warranty units although it was aware of this Touch Disease. iPhone Touch Disease Reimbursements \nCustomers who have already fixed their iPhone affected by the Touch Disease before this new repair program was announced, paying the full $329, will get the difference so they'd only be charged $149. \nMeanwhile, those who are still dealing with the iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease can now fix their device for $149 at Apple retail stores, as well as authorized service providers . Good To Know \nThis new global repair program covers iPhone 6 Plus devices affected by the Touch Disease for five years after the first retail sale of the device. At the same time, customers should also take into account that Apple may restrict or limit repairs to the country where the iPhone 6 Plus was purchased. Lastly, pricing may vary at Apple authorized service providers.  ",

      "text": "Does the iPhone 6 Plus bend? CNN tests. Apple is recognizing that \"Touch Disease\" is a thing. The tech company is rolling out a repair program to fix iPhone 6 Plus devices with unresponsive touchscreen features. \nThe term \"Touch Disease\" refers to the touchscreen issues that surface after the phone undergoes stress, like being dropped on the floor several times. In many cases, iPhone users have complained the touchscreen will entirely stop working for several months. \nIn August, repair site iFixit discovered that the issue stemmed from faulty chips inside the devices. When the phone is dropped or bent, the chips become loose. At the time, iFixit called the issue \"Touch Disease\" -- and it was quickly adopted by the internet. \nNow, the company is willing to repair affected devices for $149 -- as long as your screen isn't cracked and the phone is in working order. \nApple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) said on its website it \"determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" \nAlthough some iPhone 6 users have also reported the issue, Apple's fix only applies to the larger-sized iPhone 6 Plus. \nRelated: Apple iPhone 'Bendgate' is over \nThe company added it will reimburse people if they already fixed devices through Apple service providers for more than $149. \nFollowing widespread reports of the problem, \"Touch Disease\" -- on both sizes of the iPhone 6 -- has accounted for up to 22% of repairs at Apple Stores, according to tech site Apple Insider . \nApple is facing class action lawsuits in California, Utah, and Canada over \"Touch Disease.\" The complaints allege Apple knew about the faulty touchscreens and didn't do anything about it. \nThese cases are not yet resolved. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco) First published November 18, 2016: 12:49 PM ET",

      "text": "Skyworks Solutions Steering Away From Reliance On Apple Nov.18.16 \nUncertainty surrounding Apple leads to underperfomance. \nThe correlation between Apple's and Skywork's share price will eventually cease to exist. \nIoT market provides serious growth opportunities. The financial performance of Skyworks in the past few years have been nothing short of spectacular. Between fiscal years 2013 and 2015, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS ) saw its revenue grow by over 80% to $3.26 billion. At the same time net income grew 187% to $0.79 billion. During the same period, all margins improved as well. As a result, the share price went from around $20 in 2013 to well over $100 in 2015. But ever since reaching this high, the stock has underperformed significantly and has even seen $60 per share. Does this mean that the growth story has come to an end? I think not. Correlation to Apple Skyworks' share price is strongly correlated to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) because of the significant percentage of total revenue it derives from this company. Skyworks doesn't directly sell its products to Apple, but sells them to Foxconn, which is a major supplier of Apple. In fiscal years 2015 the total percentage of revenue derived from Foxconn was 44%. Therefore it comes as no surprise that a lot of investors focus on Apple when analyzing this stock. When Apple's share price performs well, so does Skyworks' share price. The same is true when Apple's share price underperforms as we have seen happening since the summer of 2015. Now that Apple's revenue growth has disappeared and its future growth seems uncertain, investors think the same way about Skyworks. It almost seems like investors forget that although Skyworks derives a significant part of its revenue indirectly from Apple, the company is so much more than just a supplier for Apple's products. More than a supplier for Apple Together with its subsidiaries, the company produces innovative analog semiconductors and focuses on smartphone, automotive, broadband, medical, tablet and wearable markets among others. Besides Apple, a few of the key customers include: Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ), Samsung, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and General Electric (NYSE: GE ). Apple may not be a source of significant revenue growth going forward, but it will stay a reliable source of more or less steady income. On top of that management has been working hard to make the company's future less dependent on that of Apple's. The percentage of total revenue coming from Foxconn has already been declining. Other areas of growth have emerged for Skyworks as was again made clear in the 10-Q filing for the third quarter: \"The increase in revenue for the nine months ended July 1, 2016, was primarily driven by our success in capturing a higher share of the increasing RF and analog content per device as smartphones continue to displace traditional cellular phones, increased strength in emerging markets due to the adoption of 3G and 4G technologies, the increasing number of applications for the Internet of Things, and our expanding analog product portfolio supporting new vertical markets including automotive, industrial, medical and military, partially offset by the aforementioned decline in end-product demand from a key smartphone customer.\" IoT, the future of Skyworks Skyworks is also expected to profit a lot from 5G when that transition is in full swing. But I believe that the IoT market will grow out into the most profitable for Skyworks in the future. This market has huge growth potential in the near- and long term. It's currently expected that the total number of devices connected to the internet will increase to 34 billion by 2020, up from 10 billion in 2015. Nearly $6 trillion is expected to be spend in the IoT market by that time. Companies that have been working on improving their positions in this strong growth market have the opportunity to see significant financial growth in the coming years. Skyworks is one of these companies since it has been investing heavily multiple areas of this market which can be seen here . Fourth Quarter Results The fourth quarter results were released earlier this month. During this quarter the company generated revenue worth $835.4 million. Although this was a decline of 5.2% yoy, Skyworks still managed to beat expectations by $4.1 million. EPS was realized above expectations as well: $1.47 compared to an expected $1.43, although this was still a 3% decline yoy. Operating income was $318.4 million, while CFO was realized at $455 million. At the end of the quarter the company had 0 debt on its balance sheet. Obviously the yoy decline in both top line and bottom line comes as no surprise to anyone considering Apple's performance. But management seems to have high expectations for the future as was shown in the press release of the fourth quarter results : \"As our results and outlook reflect, Skyworks is capitalizing on the strength of both Mobile and Internet of Things ecosystems,\" said Liam K. Griffin, president and chief executive officer of Skyworks. \"Specifically, we are in the midst of a dramatic sea change in the usage case for wireless technologies and the way they are transforming how we live, work and play. As a virtual hub for e-commerce, enterprise to the cloud, social media, gaming and entertainment, mobile devices are rapidly evolving to address the massive demand for data and speed across an increasingly crowded spectrum. Skyworks is resolving this daunting complexity with customized system-level solutions to ultimately improve the user experience with higher levels of efficiency, enhanced streaming capabilities and expanded network coverage. As a result, we are well positioned to continue delivering above-market growth, profitability and shareholder value.\" Valuation / Conclusion If we look at Skyworks' current share valuation, it looks significantly undervalued compared to its peers. The company generates an operating margin of 33.7% versus its competitors' average of 19%. Net margin is even double that of the 14.5% that its competitors generate. These high margins are achieved without generating any debt. Still, Skyworks' P/E ratio of just 15.4 is notably lower than the industry average of 25.2. Because Skyworks still is expected to generate higher income in the future, the forward P/E ratio is currently valued at 11. This undervaluation is the result the uncertainty that Apple's future seems to bring. But as stated earlier: Skyworks is a lot more than just an Apple supplier. The company is currently positioning itself to capitalize on the growth market of IoT. As a result the performance in share price and financials will start to outperform those of Apple. As progress becomes more and more obvious on this front, the stock's valuation will increase significantly. Even if Skyworks' stock price will be valued at a 20% discount (P/E of 20) to the industry average, with current financial results, this would mean a price target of $100 vs a current share price of $78. Multiple analysts seem to agree that the prospects for this stock's future are improving. Earlier this month Cowen increased its price target to $80 and Craig Hallum to $90.

      "text": "Apple admits iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’ exists, will charge for fixes November 18th, 2016 at 6:14 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nSince earlier this year, some iPhone 6 Plus users have been complaining about something known as ‘touch disease’, an issue that has caused iPhone 6 Plus displays to become unresponsive to touch. Apple has kept silent on this problem for months but this week, the company finally acknowledged it for the first time and has launched a repair program, though it will cost you a chunk of change to take advantage of it. \nBack in August it was discovered that this issue is caused by chips losing eletrical contact inside of the iPhone. Once this happens, iPhone displays will become less and less responsive to touch or begin flickering. \nApple’s multi-touch repair program explains that the issue is caused by dropping the iPhone multiple times on a hard surface. Since this is being listed as an issue caused by users themselves, it will cost money for the repair. Apple will be charging $149 to fix an iPhone with a screen that is not cracked or broken in any way. \nIf you have already paid for a ‘Touch Disease’ repair at an Apple Store and ended up being charged more, you will be able to apply for a partial refund to make up the difference. \nKitGuru Says: This is a problem that Apple probably should have investigated much earlier, especially since a lot of iPhone 6 owners will likely soon be looking to upgrade to a new phone. That said, at least there is now a proper repair program for this specific issue.",

Well that turned out not to be the case. \nAccording to new figures, the biggest disaster in smartphone history did hurt Samsung, but Apple was not an obvious beneficiary, according to new figures. \nSamsung’s shipments dropped 14% compared to the same period of last year, Gartner said, which remained enough to earn 19.2% of the entire mobile industry. \nAccording to the research, Apple’s sales of 43 million iPhones accounted for 11.2% of all smartphone sales. \nSo if Apple didn’t mop-up all of those disenfranchised Samsung fans, who did? \nGartner cites a dramatic rise of Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Oppo; the latter performing twice as well as last year . \nOf course the vast majority of these gains came in China, where sales of smartphones grew by 12.4 per cent. \nSamsung’s comeback from its worst sales slump in two years will commence with the eagerly-anticipated Galaxy S8 handset, which we’re expecting to see in February. \nIs the Galaxy S8 already the most important Samsung phone release ever? \nIf the company ever needed to nail a smartphone it was this one. Are you remaining a Samsung loyalist in spite of the last few months’ shenanigans? \nShare your thoughts below. \nGalaxy S8: Everything We Know So Far Latest Deals From Ebay ",

      "text": "By Janko Roettgers / Variety.com Today at 12:10 p.m. A man inspects the Apple iPhone 6 Plus at an electronics store in Mumbai, India, July 23, 2015. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui \nLOS ANGELES—Apple has a solution for iPhone 6 Plus owners that are experiencing an unresponsive touch screen, a phenomenon that's been dubbed \"touch disease,\" but the company's help comes with a price tag attached: Apple's new multi-touch repair program offers a fix for affected devices for $149, according to a new support document. \nReports about the issue first surfaced this summer. Some iPhone 6 Plus device owners have been experiencing a flicker on the top of their screen that coincides with a gradual loss in touch screen responsiveness. At worst, affected devices can stop responding to touch input altogether. \nRepair site iFixit highlighted the issue in a video in August, and also pointed to what it called a design defect as a possible culprit: The iPhone 6 Plus uses less rigid shielding for its innards, making them more susceptible to bending and other forms of outside force. \nHowever, Apple seems to out the blame for the problem squarely on iPhone 6 owners. \"Some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" the company writes in its support document. \nThat's also why the company isn't covering \"touch disease\" issues under its warranty. However, the $149 repair still is cheaper than the fix would be under Apple's usual repair rates.",

      "text": "Apple's Chip Choices May Leave Some iPhone Users in Slow Lane Ian King November 18, 2016 — 11:27 AM EST IPhone 7 on Verizon performs well below capability, tests show Some iPhones use Intel modems, rather than Qualcomm chips \nIt turns out not all iPhone 7s are created equal. \nThe latest Apple Inc. smartphones that run on Verizon Communications Inc.’s network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T Inc. Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights. \nNeither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn’t using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version. \n“The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” \n“Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\" \nIt would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts. \n\"They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better,\" said Jan Dawson, founder of technology advisory firm Jackdaw Research LLC. \"If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.” \nBut the move could backfire if customers realize their device isn’t performing to its full potential, or that it’s less capable than other handsets, analysts said. \n\"This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product,\" said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. The firm does paid analysis for smartphone suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp. \nThe component at the root of the performance gap is the modem, a tiny chip buried deep inside a phone’s innards that turns wireless signals into data and voice. The iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone for several years to have versions with different modems. Verizon users get an iPhone 7 with Qualcomm’s latest X12 modem -- capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second. AT&T customers get a handset with an Intel modem that tops out at 450 megabits per second. \nApple likely went with multiple suppliers to keep component costs in check. \nIn field tests by Twin Prime, the Verizon version is a little faster than its AT&T stablemate -- but not as fast as it could be. The firm proved this by doing the same tests on the Samsung Galaxy S7, which also runs on Verizon’s network and uses the Qualcomm X12. The S7 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip, Twin Prime found. This was based on data from more than 100,000 phones downloading an image in large U.S. cities. \nQualcomm’s X12 is capable of dealing with more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival, according to a report by Milan Milanovic, an analyst at Cellular Insights, which tests phones and networks. Apple didn’t enable this feature \"to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel,” Milanovic wrote. \nCellular Insights tests phones in labs with equipment that can vary the strength of the signal, basically approximating a phone moving from good coverage to poor coverage. The differences in performance between the handsets Milanovic tested were greatest when the phone signal was weakest, he said.

Four other network testing firms contacted by Bloomberg News said measuring phone data speeds is difficult because performance can be influenced by weather and other factors beyond the control of wireless providers and phone makers. Though none of these other firms disputed the findings of Twin Prime and Cellular Insights. Happy Carriers \nIn addition to creating a unified iPhone 7 user experience, leveling the playing field would also keep wireless carriers happy, according to some industry analysts. \n“Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners,\" said Jeff Kvaal, an analyst with Instinet LLC. \"It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product.\" \nRepresentatives of AT&T, Verizon, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. \nCompanies that \"de-feature or go with a less-advanced modem\" may be left behind as the networks offer faster data speeds, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in a recent conference call, without naming specific firms. Qualcomm vs. Intel \nApple is in this situation because it chose different modems for the latest iPhone. By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price. Qualcomm’s modems have for years been almost ubiquitous in high-end smartphones, including iPhones. Intel has struggled to break into this market and has used subsidies to try to win share in mobile. \nSacrificing performance in return for cheaper components may not go down well with Apple users. \n\"It was probably multiple factors that drove that decision. But in the end, it was a bad decision,\" said McGregor. \"It is really hard to argue for doing this because Qualcomm really does have the best modem technology.\" \nStill, many users may not realize their iPhone is different from their friends’ iPhones. And even if they do, they may decide Apple isn’t responsible. Most consumers blame their wireless service provider when a phone doesn’t work well, Milanovic said.

      "text": "Apple’s ‘touch disease’ repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free Trevor Mogg More Three months after iFixit coined the term “touch disease” for a defect discovered with some iPhone 6 Plus devices, Apple has finally responded with the launch on Thursday of a new repair program. It’s not clear how many units of this older version of Apple’s largest phone are affected by the glitch, which causes some displays to show a gray bar at the top or in some cases becomes totally unresponsive. The issue was deemed so serious by some users that they launched a lawsuit against the tech giant in the summer. In a message posted on its site on Thursday announcing the repair program , Apple puts the issue down to some serious user mishandling rather than a manufacturing error. “Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or multi-touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” the Cupertino-based company said. But the fix doesn’t come free. Apple says it’ll repair affected phones for $149, though anyone who’s already paid more to repair it through Apple or an Apple authorized service provider can make a claim to have the difference refunded. Anyone with an iPhone 6 Plus experiencing touch disease can take it to an Apple Store for repair charged at the new set rate of $149. Alternatively, they can take it to an authorized service provider, where the same fee will be charged. Apple notes that wireless carrier partners are not participating in the new program, and that it’s only eligible for the larger, 6 Plus device. Following a growing number of complaints from iPhone 6 Plus owners earlier in the year, device repair website iFixit decided to take a closer look at the matter. After speaking to experts and examining the phone’s interior, it put the problem down to an issue with the chip-board where a crack could occur and grow gradually over weeks and months, causing increasing trouble for the user over time. “At first, there may be no defect at all,” iFixit said in August. “Later you might notice that the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but it is quick to come back with a hard reset. As the crack deepens into a full separation of the chip-board bond, the periods of no touch become more frequent.” More: 30 useful tricks and tips for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus For many customers experiencing the problem, Apple’s repair program will be considered a step in the right direction. However, it’s unlikely to satisfy any users who can’t recall ever dropping their device “multiple times on a hard surface,” instead believing it’s a manufacturing issue for which no repair fee should be charged. We may not have heard the last of this so-called touch disease. ",

      "text": "So Apple has finally fessed up to the existence of the much-dreaded “Touch Disease” — but users will tell you it’s worse that Apple admits, and they aren’t happy about the company’s plan to deal with it.\nTouch Disease is the annoying phenomenon that plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the Cupertino tech giant have been saying is messing up their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones, leaving a flickering bar at the top of the display and creating all kinds of multi-touch issues.\n(You all remember “multi-touch,” right? All those cool things you can do with your iPhone by touching it in different ways and with different amounts of pressure? And you saw that Apple how-to a while back that said, among other things, “if the Home button doesn’t respond as you expect, make sure that your hands are clean and dry . . .” ?)\nI wrote about the issue back in August, when the lawsuit first became known. “The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touch-screen defect,” said the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose. At that time, Apple declined comment.\nNow Apple has officially recognized the problem and announced a new worldwide program where it will fix any affected iPhone 6 Plus devices – for a $149 service fee.\nSo just how bad is it to have an iPhone beset with problems caused by Touch Disease?\nListen:\nElizabeth Jackson, having lunch with her husband, told WCPO Cincinnati that using her iPhone 6 Plus has become increasingly frustrating. “There’s sometimes when it won’t respond when I go to text or open an app. It takes a while to open up.” .\nWCPO also got an earful from Brianna Booker, whose iPhone 6 Plus would flash a light gray band at the top of the phone – and then simply stop responding to her touch. It was, as it were, unswipable: “I wasn’t able to swipe. I had notifications coming in, but I wasn’t able to answer any text messages or phone calls.”",

      "text": "– A + Jeep joins support for Apple CarPlay with 2017 Compass By Roger Fingas \nFriday, November 18, 2016, 11:08 am PT (02:08 pm ET) \nAt this week's Los Angeles Auto Show, Fiat Chrysler's Jeep division revealed its first vehicle with support for Apple CarPlay built in, the 2017 Compass.\n\n\n\n\nThe SUV will support both CarPlay and Android Auto through a fourth-generation Uconnect dash interface. Notably buyers will have the option of 5-, 7-, or 8.4-inch touchscreens, making it easier to use the phone interfaces at a price.\n\nIn its announcement , Jeep didn't immediately say when the vehicle will become available, or how much different trims and upgrades might cost.\n\nJeep was actually one of the first companies to announce plans for CarPlay in 2014, but slow to deliver for reasons unknown. Indeed while some other Fiat Chrysler brands —namely Dodge and Chrysler —do have CarPlay models, there aren't many, and even Fiat itself doesn't offer the technology on 2016 500 models.",

      "text": "next › \nFor a seasonal vegetable recipe that would produce vegetables with a lightly sweetened glaze, we started by cutting the carrots slightly smaller than the other vegetables for even cooking. Then by caramelizing the vegetables in butter and deglazing with hard cider, we created a glaze that tasted bright and flavorful. A final addition of diced Granny Smith apple and minced tarragon completed the flavor profile. \nCider-Glazed Root Vegetables with Apple and Tarragon Serves 8 \n1 pound carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 12 ounces parsnips, peeled and cut 3/4-inch pieces 12 ounces turnips, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces 3 shallots, peeled and halved 2 1/2 cups hard cider 3 tablespoons sugar 1 Granny Smith apple, cored and cut into 1/2-inch pieces 2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon 2 teaspoons cider vinegar \nINSTRUCTIONS \n1. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrots, parsnips, turnips, and shallots and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add cider, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and remaining 3 tablespoons butter and bring to boil.

Photo by Screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nApple's timing isn't always perfect. \nAs much of the world is in turmoil and Apple's latest computer isn't universally adored , the company released something that surely no one was begging for: a $300 coffee-table book full of pictures of iPhones and other Apple products. \nIt was inevitable that there would be laughter. \nOn Stephen Colbert's \"Late Show,\" several alleged Apple designers explained how wonderful this book is. \nThis book, one says, represents innovation. There was the iBook, the MacBook and then, well, the Apple Book. \nAccording to fictional lead designer Piers Björnborg, Apple has taken the latest and most innovative technology from the year 1440 to bring its fanpersons such a glorious invention.

As PC World reports, Touch Disease manifests as a flickering gray bar and nonfunctional touchscreen. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"live\", \"id\" : 6043, \"name\" : \"NBC News Radio\", \"description\" : \"The news you want, when you want it\" } } \nPhones get Touch Disease \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" according to Apple , which is offering to fix the problem—in iPhone 6 Pluses anyway—for $149. But a source at Apple Genius tells iFixit they aren't actually repairing the broken phones, just replacing them with refurbished ones. And iFixit notes that's \"a lot of money for [a] device swap.\"",

      "text": "on Friday November 18, 2016 @02:40PM from the not-really-twins dept. Not all iPhone 7s are created equal, it turns out. The latest flagship smartphones from Apple that run on Verizon's network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T . Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights. From a Bloomberg report: Neither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn't using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version. \"The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon's network capabilities,\" said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. \"I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.\" \"Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,\" Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. \"In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\" It would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts. ",

      "text": "Sefa Karacan | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images iPhone 6s Apple has launched a new repair program for a widely reported on iPhone 6 Plus hardware malfunction known as \"touch disease,\" which renders the touchscreen useless and manifests as a thin grey line at the top the display. According to Apple, however, this flaw is caused by dropping the phone repeatedly. The company says it will not cover the cost of a repair and will ask those affected by the issue to pay $149 to have it fixed. That might not sit too well with the iPhone owners who filed class action lawsuits against Apple over the touch disease issue. \nMore from the Verge: \nGoogle is bringing Android app support to four more Chromebooks \nThe Dashbot is a $49 gadget that turns your car into Knight Rider's KITT \nSony's voice assistant earbuds will be released in the US on December 13th \n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" the company writes on its website. \"If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.\" \nApple says those who have already paid for a service repair related to the issue are eligible for reimbursement equal to the difference between the original service repair cost and the new $149 price. The company says it has begun contacting those who have already paid for such a repair, but urges customers who think they're affected to reach out and contact Apple Technical Support to expedite the process.",

      "text": "  Andrew Blake   Updated: 2:59 p.m. on   \nSecurity features introduced by Apple in October 2014 have caused investigators in New York City to amass a collection of more than 423 iPhone and iPads that are incapable of being unlocked despite being lawfully seized by authorities, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said this week. \nThe statistic appears in a 34-page released Thursday by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office that serves as both an update to its struggle with digital encryption and a call for Congress to legislate a solution. \nFollowing the release nearly two years ago of its iOS 8 operating system, Apple has allowed mobile device users to encrypt their iPhones and iPods in a manner that makes it effectively impossible for anyone to decipher a secure device’s contents, law enforcement and Apple included. \nThe district attorney for Manhattan, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., was among the most vocal public opponents of Apple when it rolled out iOS 8 in October 2014. He has continued to call out the company during the last couple of years over its marketing of what he describes as “warrant-proof” devices that can’t be accessed irrespective of any court order authorizing a search and seizure. \nIn this week’s update, Mr. Vance’s office said “the threat to public safety is increasing rapidly” as Apple and others continue to market mobile devices and operating systems designed with security features that pose problems for law enforcement. Notwithstanding “vigorous efforts by law enforcement officials to address those risks and dangers, there has been precious little progress,” the report said. \n“In the more than two years since Apple and Google announced that their operating systems would be inaccessible to the companies themselves, law enforcement’s inability to access critical evidence has hindered criminal investigations and prosecutions throughout the world,” the report said. \n“In the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office alone, 423 Apple iPhones and iPads lawfully seized since October 2014 remain inaccessible due to default device encryption,” the report said. “These devices relate to cases involving various types of crimes investigated throughout the office, ranging from cybercrime, to narcotics, to violent offenses.” \nOf those 423 phones, the report said that 10 percent related to homicide of attempt murder cases, while 9 percent pertained to sex crimes. Devices seized with respect to cases involving larceny, forgery, cyber crime or identity theft made up around 39 percent of the cache, the report said. \n“Default device encryption poses a severe threat to our safety,” the report concluded. “To respond to the threat by ignoring it, or hurling bromides (‘Privacy,’‘Security’) as if they resolved matters, would be ill-advised. The genius of our legal system has been its ability to adapt to change, including technological change. With default device encryption, the legal system is faced with a technological change, just as it was with the advents of automobiles and telephones. As it did with respect to those technologies, the legal system must respond.” \nMr. Vance’s office hopes to accomplish as much with federal legislation that would require companies “to retain the ability to extract the information on the smartphones, if and when the manufacturer or designer receives a search warrant for that information.” \n“The proposed legislation would restore the status quo before Apple’s iOS 8, and would be no different conceptually than legislation that requires products to be safe, buildings to be constructed with exits and egresses that satisfy specific requirements, and roads to have maximum speed limits,” the report said. \nWhen reached for a response, Apple referred The Wall Street Journal to a February 2016 letter , written by its chief executive officer, Tim Cook, in which he defended the company’s security features in the midst of a federal court battle brought by the government’s inability to unlock an iPhone used by one of the terrorists in last year’s mass shooting in San Bernardino. \n“The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers — including tens of millions of American citizens — from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals,” Mr. Cook wrote then. \nMr. Vance’s office isn’t convinced. “Device encryption does not defend against these categories of cyberattacks and hacks, nor does it protect users against phishing scams,” this week’s report said. \nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said previously that it had amassed 74 encrypted smartphones that couldn’t be cracked as of July 2015, and that that figure had climbed to 175 by February 2016.",

      "title": "Woman's non-Apple phone cord sparks fire - 10News.com KGTV ABC10 San Diego",
      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money. \n\n\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook \nFollow John on Twitter ( @johnmatarese ) Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

      "title": "Apple is reportedly trying to move iPhone manufacturing to the US",
      "text": "Apple is reportedly asking its manufacturing partners to investigate moving iPhone production to the United States, according to the Japanese newspaper The Nikkei . According to the report, sources claim that Apple has approached Foxconn and Pegatron, the two manufacturing companies that are largely responsible for assembling iPhones. Foxconn is apparently exploring the possibility, while Pegatron has elected to decline due to cost concerns.\nAccording to The Nikkei , Apple made the request to explore moving manufacturing to its partners in June, prior to President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the recent election. But despite that, this report has to be considered in light of Trump’s comments regarding Apple earlier this year. Trump has repeatedly suggested that Apple move its manufacturing back to the US. His most recent comments were made in January at a talk at Liberty University where Trump said, “ We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries .\" \nTrump has repeatedly suggested that Apple move its manufacturing back to the States Moving iPhone production overseas would likely be a pricey endeavor, with The Nikkei sources claiming that it would increase production costs by nearly 50 percent, which makes sense given that the vast majority of Apple’s part suppliers are already located in Asia. Motorola also tried to move smartphone manufacturing to America, but the experiment ended in 2014 when Motorola closed the factory due to costs . Apple has made some efforts in bringing hardware production back to America in the past — most notably, the Mac Pro in 2013 , when the company invested over $100 million dollars to jumpstart production — but relocating iPhone manufacturing to the United States would be a move of a vastly different scale.",

      "text": "Turns out, Samsung's Note 7 disaster wasn't the boon for Apple many predicted it would be, at least not yet.\nAccording to new data from Gartner, Apple didn't benefit from Samsung's exploding smartphone gaffe , but three Chinese handset makers did. The companies — Huawei, Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment — together accounted for 21 percent of the smartphones sold worldwide in the third quarter of 2016. They were the only smartphone vendors in the global top five to increase their sales and market share during the period.\nEven with an exploding smartphone in its lineup, Samsung managed to maintain its No. 1 position in the smartphone market last quarter with 19.2 percent market share, but its sales decreased 14.2 percent year over year, marking the company's worst performance ever.\n\"The decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note 7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung's brand will make it harder for the company to increase its smartphone sales in the short term,\" Gartner Research Director Anshul Gupta said in a statement. \"For Samsung, it's crucial that the Galaxy S8 launches successfully, so that partners and customers regain trust in its brand.\"\nNo. 2 Apple also had a pretty rough quarter, logging a 6.6 percent decline in sales. Apple accounted for 11.5 percent of the global smartphone market, its lowest share since the first quarter of 2009.\n\"The withdrawal of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 may benefit sales of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus only slightly, as Note 7 users are likely to stay with Samsung or at least with Android,\" Gartner Research Director Roberta Cozza said in a statement.",

      "text": "The major stock indexes edged lower in morning trade Friday as earnings reports remained in focus.\nThe S&P 500 lost 0.4%, weighed down by weakness in oil and gas names. The Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average eased about 0.2% each.\nThe Russell 2000 powered 0.8% higher, reflecting unusual strength in small- and mid-cap names.\nThe Nasdaq suffered another distribution day (heavy professional selling) Thursday, mostly due to weakness in high-profile Nasdaq 100 names like Facebook ( FB ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ), among others. The selling continued in these names early Friday but losses were tame.\nDecember WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.5% to $43.54 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was unchanged at 2.15%.\nDisney ( DIS ) outperformed in the Dow, rising nearly 3%, after reporting earnings late Thursday. The stock is starting to find its footing after a lengthy pullback but is still 19% off its recent high.\nApple ( AAPL ), meanwhile, reversed slightly higher. Earlier today, Business Insider reported the company is working on iPhones with bigger screens for launch next year.\nElsewhere, investors responded positively to earnings from e.l.f. Beauty ( ELF ) as shares rose around 3%. JPMorgan brought the company public in September at 17. Its cosmetic products are solid in stores like Target, Wal-Mart and CVS.",
