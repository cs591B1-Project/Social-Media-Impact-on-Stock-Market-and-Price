      "text": "Many Americans took part in Black Friday this year, but some opted out of the annual shopping tradition. If you're one of the many who didn't take part in the big deals this Friday, and you're worried you may have missed out on your chance for some high-end technology items, fear not: There are still plenty of tech deals to take advantage of on Cyber Monday.\nThe first Monday after Black Friday has traditionally been called Cyber Monday since 2005 . It's relevance is based on the modern conveniences of shopping while online — you can do it at home or at work (and many people do shop while on the clock). And this year, many (but not all) retailers are extending Cyber Monday to last all week long, meaning you don't have to confine your online shopping to just one day.\nHere's some Cyber Monday 2016 deals you should take advantage of.\nTarget Target gave customers a 15% savings on all sales across its site last year . They're repeating the deal again this year due to its popularity, with free shipping (and returns) on every order. You can save 15% off of most purchases, either online or in the store, on both Sunday and Monday. This deal includes many electronics , so you'll be set to buy that spy drone you've been eyeing all year long.\nA FedEx employee inspects packages set to be delivered for Cyber Monday. Source: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Amazon The online retail giant Amazon has more than 75,000 deals you can take advantage of for the whole week of Cyber Monday. Amazon is stating that some of its deal items are \"in limited supply,\" but that they'll \"keep adding new ones as often as every five minutes\" all week long. Examples of deals include $139.99 for the Amazon Echo (a $40 savings) and just $49.99 for the Kindle (a $30 savings).\nWalmart Walmart is also having a week-long Cyber Monday event on thousands of items. Their \"cyber week\" event began on Black Friday , and lasts throughout the rest of the week. One of the deals Walmart is highlighting is a $148 savings on a VIZIO 50-inch LED Smart TV , selling this week for $379.99. Walmart is also including free shipping on purchases over $50 during its weeklong sale.\nBest Buy is considered a must-visit destination for many techies, including for online purchases. Source: Alan Diaz/AP Best Buy Best Buy's Cyber Monday deals begin on Sunday , Nov. 27 and extend into the following Monday. Best Buy is a favorite destination for techies, so you can expect that they'll have thousands of deals to take advantage of as well. Deals include the Beats by Dre wireless headphones for just $ 249.99, a whopping savings of $ 130 that will be hard to pass up.\nKohl's The Midwest-based department store isn't known as the most tech-savvy place to shop. But that doesn't mean you should ignore it, either. Kohl's , in fact, has some great deals going on during its \" c yber days \" event. The sale starts on Sunday and last through Wednesday, and includes \"deep savings on amazing product categories including electronics, toys, clothing, home and more, as well as trusted brands including Nike and Fitbit – all just one click away,\" according to the store's press release . Peruse around some of their best tech deals on the site, including $129.99 for a Fitbit Charge 2 .",

      "text": "Amazon distribution center in Kenosha preps for Cyber Monday Posted: Updated: \nKENOSHA (WKOW) -- Holiday shopping enters a new phase this week. After Black Friday comes Cyber Monday. Traditionally, the Monday after Thanksgiving is the biggest day of the year for online holiday sales, but a growing number of people are turning to the Internet on Thanksgiving and Black Friday now, too. Our sister station WISN-TV got a look inside Amazon's distribution center in Kenosha on Sunday, where the usual fast pace ramps up even more this time of year. According to the company, last year Amazon sold more than 54 million items, which is about 629 per second. The National Retail Federation says more than 154 million people shopped in stores and online on Black Friday, which is three million more than last year. Each consumer spent on average $10 less than in 2015, which could be because more discounts are available. Most Popular Stories Most Popular Stories More>> ",

      "text": "\nLooking to score some sweet deals on wearables this Cyber Monday? Amazon has several deals that are definitely worth checking out. Our post on today’s best Cyber Monday deals includes picks for cheap smartwatches, as well as wearables that straddle the line between fitness tracker and smartwatch. Some of these deals were also featured in our Black Friday smartwatch deals post. Amazon launched promotional pricing for some of these items last week, and those prices continue through today. However, many of these deals will end today, so act fast if you don’t want to miss out. \nCan’t get enough Cyber Monday deals? Check out our Cyber Monday deals page to see all our coverage in one place. \n1. 15 Percent Off Orbo Kids Smartwatch (Orbo)\nThis inexpensive smartwatch for kids would be a great holiday gift.

While there’s only 1GB of memory included, the watch’s memory can be expanded to 32GB. With lots of kid-friendly games and activities, this is a solid gift for any kid who covets their parent’s Apple Watch. \nLooking for more discounts on kid’s smartwatches? The VTech Kidizoom Smartwatch DX is also on sale right now for roughly the same price as the Orbo watch. \nPrice: $35.59 (15 percent off MSRP)\nBuy the Orbo Kids Smartwatch here.

Calorie tracking and step tracking make this a nice option for the light-to-moderately active person. It is rated at a depth rating of 3 ATM, so it can withstand splashes or brief immersion in water. However, Fossil recommends removing the watch before swimming or bathing. This smartwatch is compatible with all Fossil brand 22mm straps , if you’d like to change up the look a bit. \nLooking for more discounts on Fossil smartwatches?

      "title": "Listen: 12 All-Star Electronic Musicians Remix Michael Gordon's 'Timber'",
      "text": "'Michael Gordon: Timber Remixed' is Available on Amazon \nMichael Gordon's Timber from 2011 was a breakthrough for the composer, fusing the trademarks of his style – experiments with timbre, and with highly complex relationships between layers of rhythm – to a startlingly elegant concept. The piece could have borrowed its title from Steve Reich, whose Music for Pieces of Wood is the obvious point of comparison here, but Timber 's six percussionists execute their elaborate polyrhythms not on conventional percussion instruments but on ordinary 2x4 planks, mounted and beaten with mallets. The result is surprisingly exquisite, an ear-tickling exercise in rhythm and resonance, as the overtones of the vibrating planks sing out in ghostly harmony. \nNow, Gordon's Cantaloupe Music label, which previously issued a studio recording by Dutch percussionists Slagwerk Den Haag, is revisiting Timber with a new release that pairs a new recording of the hour-long work, performed live by Mantra Percussion at the 2014 Bang on a Can Marathon, with a dozen new remixes of Mantra's own studio performance. \nRemix albums are always a dicy proposition, but especially classical remix albums. But the remixers on Timber Remixed are outstanding, without exception, and they all seem to be working from a deep understanding of what makes the original piece so interesting. Tim Hecker, Fennesz, Oneohtrix Point Never, Squarepusher, Ikue Mori, Mira Calix, Hauschka: these artists are a who's-who of the highbrow electronic vernacular. \nAnd while there is a limit to the variety that twelve different artists can achieve from a single, extremely static piece of music, it is a delight to hear them subtly augment Gordon's score – like Jóhann Jóhannsson, transforming the piece's aura of implied harmonies into audible harmonic motion – or gleefully vandalize it almost beyond recognition, like Greg Saunier of the band Deerhoof. \nThanks to the strange acoustics of Mantra's live recording in the Winter Garden shopping mall of the World Financial Center, it sounds like a remix itself, almost burying the attacks of the individual mallets under great washes of howling overtones. Timber is, as it turns out, as durable as it is lovely, and not only worth revisiting for a second time, but at least thirteen more times, with each track on this issue offering a different perspective on this rich and meditative work. \nMichael Gordon: Timber Remixed Cantaloupe Music | Released Oct. 28 Tags:",

      "text": "\nIf you’re a guy, you know that shopping can be overwhelming and very little fun. If you know a guy, you know that shopping with one isn’t easy. Even for the most fashion forward guys, heading into a department store, trying on clothing, and coming out without draining your bank account can be a feat. Department stores usually have everything you need, but sales are sparse and when all else fails, you wind up paying full price for something you might not even love. \nCyber Monday is where it’s at for men especially. Shop the sales for yourself, or help a guy who hates to shop spruce up his wardrobe. Amazon’s Cyber Monday apparel sales includes the same amazing, well-known brands that you’ll find in department stores so there will be no eye rolls or complaints from the guys on your list. With so many Cyber Monday sales limited to last years leftovers, that’s not the case with the apparel sales on Amazon. Many, if not all of the items available here can be found in store right now. \nEnjoy 30 percent off all of the men’s apparel listed here. The discounts will be applied at checkout where you can watch the savings add up. \nIf you’re in need of men’s accessory gifts, you can also enjoy 30 percent off these top brands. \n1. Save 20 Percent on Select Burton Winter Gear (Burton)\nBurton is one of the most well known winter sporting brands and they’re offering huge savings this Cyber Monday. While they have waterproof and lined pants and jackets included in their sales, they also have quite a few pieces for everyday wear like this flannel, available in several great colors . If you’re not exactly sure what the men on your list need, it’s fair to assume that everyone could use an additional hoodie in their wardrobe.

      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson, the former co-host of the globally popular and long running BBC show, \"Top Gear,\" told CNN's \"Quest Means Business\" that the new series is \"'Top Gear' in witness protection.\" × Jeremy Clarkson: Amazon show is ”Top Gear’ in witness protection’ Jeremy Clarkson, the former co-host of the globally popular and long running BBC show, \"Top Gear,\" told CNN's \"Quest Means Business\" that the new series is \"'Top Gear' in witness protection.\" \nNEW YORK — Jeremy Clarkson is on top once again with his new Amazon show, “The Grand Tour.” \nClarkson, the former co-host of the globally popular and long running BBC show, “Top Gear,” told CNN’s “Quest Means Business” that the new series is “‘Top Gear’ in witness protection.” \n“That’s what a friend of mine said the other day, a reviewer. [This show] is different because it moves around the world, that’s really it,” Clarkson told CNNMoney reporter Maggie Lake. “But it’s still James [May], Richard [Hammond], and I. So it’s like if you have a glass of champagne and you have it in a bucket or in a glass, it’s still champagne, and that’s really what it is. It’s a different vessel, but the show is, with different elements, basically about the same.” \nAccording to Amazon, the premiere episode of “The Grand Tour” was the subscription service’s most-watched premiere since “The Man in The High Castle.” \nClarkson and his co-hosts are on Amazon instead of the BBC because Clarkson was fired by the BBC for punching a producer, Oisin Tymon. It was the last straw for the BBC, which had weathered a number of controversies involving Clarkson, including racist and homophobic comments he made over the years. But it doesn’t sound like Clarkson is planning on reining himself in. \n“The BBC always let us do what we wanted to do and Amazon is exactly the same,” he said. “It says say what you want to say, do what you want to do. We always were self-policed, and sometimes you tread on a landmine and sometimes you don’t, move on.” \nBut, Clarkson said, “I never want to be controversial, it just happens. I say stuff sometimes and think, ‘Oh, no.” \n“I try to present a TV show in the way that I hear people talking,” Clarkson said. “Not in city centers, not at agreeable dinner parties with editors and media people, but actual people talking. There was just two doors down here … there’s some people loading trucks and truck drivers and they’ve all got hoodies, visibility jackets, and hard hats on. I was just staring at them, sitting in traffic, thinking, ‘I want to hear what they talk about when they’re out and about,’ because that’s what I would like to reflect in the show. … [W]e’re not making the show for what we call in the UK ‘the sneering media elite,’ of which I am a part. I’m not making a show for my friends, my colleagues, I’m making a show for everyone else, and it turns out, as we’ve seen in recent events, that there’s millions and millions of them.” \nIt’s clear Clarkson is still not shy when it comes to speaking his mind. Asked his thoughts on President-elect Donald Trump suggesting in a tweet that UK far-right politician Nigel Farage should be named the country’s ambassador to the US, he quipped, “If he is, we’ll go back to England.” \nFor now, though, Clarkson is focused not on the success of this season of “The Grand Tour,” but the next one. \n“You’ve still got to concentrate,” he said. “You can’t rejoice, you concentrate on the next one and next one and next one. They’ve all got to be good, otherwise no point in doing it.” ",

      "text": "Amazon Enjoys Great Loyalty From US Amazon Shoppers Amazon Prime members buy much more often than shoppers who are nonmembers November 28, 2016 | Retail & Ecommerce Share Print \nUS Amazon shoppers ages 18 and older display a great amount of loyalty toward the brand and website, according to a Summer 2016 survey from Feedvisor and Walker Sands Communications. Nearly 100% of respondents said they had bought from Amazon in the past year. \nBut it's not just loyalty toward Amazon: respondents also often refrained from purchasing from other companies, sites and services. While about 60% said they did say they made a purchase from a brand or retailer's site, just one in three made a purchase via eBay, and less than 10% from subscription-based services. \nBeing an Amazon Prime member, it turns out, greatly influences that loyalty. \nFor example, 11% of US Amazon shoppers who are prime members make two or more purchases per week, while for nonmembers, that figure is just 1%. Weekly buyers are nearly one in five for Prime members, while just 3% for nonmembers. A quarter of respondents who are prime members said they made a purchase once every two weeks, while just 8% of nonmembers did. \nOver 60% of nonmembers, meanwhile, make purchases from Amazon less than once per month; among Prime members, that total is just 19%. \nAnd it turns out that shipping, for both members of Prime and nonmembers, causes pause when making purchases. Over 85% of US Amazon shoppers surveyed, both Prime members and not, named shipping charges as a deterrent.\nBut given that Amazon Prime offers lots of shipping deals and savings, perhaps another big deterrent to making purchases is simply not being a member. \nBut many consumers in the US and Western Europe agree: Amazon offers digital buyers an excellent experience. With over 55% telling MetaPack in September 2016 they've experienced excellent service from the company, that, too, may explain some of the loyalty.

      "text": "Flipkart's losses double to Rs 2,306 crore in FY16 Losses mount despite growth in revenue as Amazon matches it in a discount war November 28, 2016 Last Updated at 11:49 IST email this article Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy: \nhttp://mybs.in/2TJJFbM ALSO READ Diwali dhamaka: How Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal are gearing up for festive sales Race on as Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal eye $1.5 bn in festive sales E-commerce firms reinvent beaten paths to reach out to customers Amazon narrows gap with Flipkart, tops Snapdeal In festive sales, investors look for a winner Flipkart Internet, the marketplace unit of India's largest e-commerce player Flipkart, reported a loss of Rs 2,306 crore in the year that ended March 31, 2016, as it battles a cash flush Amazon to retain leadership in the country. The company's losses more than doubled from Rs 1,096 crore in fiscal year 2015, as Amazon too stepped up spending and closed the gap between itself and Flipkart. Earlier this year, Amazon’s aggression was seen when it overtook number two player Snapdeal. While Flipkart's losses grew, so did its revenue. The Indian firm reported a revenue of Rs 1,952 crore during FY16, nearly a 153 per cent increase over the Rs 772.5 crore it reported in the previous 12 month period. While revenue growth was strong, analysts had noted that Flipkart's share in the market during 2015 had remained largely flat. While Flipkart has been spending heavily on discounting, advertising and growing its logistics reach, rival Amazon is matching and even beating it. The US retailer posted a loss of Rs 1,724 crore in FY15 and that figure is only expected to have gone up in FY16. According to a recent Hindu Business Line report, Amazon’s losses in India in the year 2016 could hit $1 billion, a four-fold increase from the previous year. The drain India is putting on the company surfaced for the first time in Amazon’s international earnings when the company said its international losses swelled to $541 million in the quarter that ended in September, largely due to spending in India. Amazon has committed over $5 billion to grow its business in India so far and says it will pump in more capital as and when needed, a big worry for rival Flipkart which has been struggling to raise funds over the past couple of months. The company reportedly caught the eye of Walmart for up to a $1 billion investment, but talks apparently fell through. While Flipkart has made several changes to its organisation structure with a big reshuffle in its top management, the company still requires capital to burn and stay in the game with Amazon. A focus on profitability might keep investors who're looking for exits happy, but if the company isn't able to boost efficiency to continue undercutting the cost of products for customers, it could lose the game. There has been some glimmer of hope in recent months for Flipkart, with the company vastly outperforming Amazon during the diwali sales in October. While Flipkart sold just 0.5 million more units than Amazon, the company's earnings were still estimated to be far higher than its rival, thanks to high-margin fashion units Myntra and Jabong.",

      "text": "$84.47 $100 iTunes Gift Card - Sam's Club \nThe best Cyber Monday TV deals on sale include bargain deals starting at $89.99 and also include the best deals on 4K HDR TVs. \nCyber Monday on Monday, Nov. 28 is day two of the Cyber Monday 2016 sales events at many of the large online stores including Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Dell and of course Amazon. \nThe Cyber Monday sales events have mutated into a 2-Day sales event with attached week long sales called Cyber Week. Deal hunters were advised by our shopping experts to shop early Sunday morning. Our deal monitoring has immediately flagged multiple deals as sold out in the early morning hours of Sunday. Sam's Club had at the launch of its Cyber Monday sale inventory of the rare Sony PlayStation VR Launch Bundle. \nTarget has sold out of the first Apple Watch Series 2 models as customers take advantage of the 15% sitewide Cyber Monday discount.

      "text": "An Amazon shopper named Leah reviewed a pink MoMoCity iPhone 7 case Sept. 30, two weeks after the phone went on sale. The same day, the same user reviewed a gray Ultra Armor case for the iPhone 7 Plus. And earlier that same month, she reviewed a metal case for her iPhone 6, another MoMoCity case for her iPhone 6 Plus and a MixcTech Dry Bag case for her iPhone 5s. All received five stars.\nSuspicious? A year-old site called Fakespot, which has analyzed more than 1 million products on Amazon for reviewer authenticity, thought so. It not only gave those products an F, but called out Leah as an “inauthentic reviewer” because of excessive positive reviews for the same companies.\nFakespot screenshot Fakespot deemed that reviews on the iPhone 7 case by MoMoCity were 100 percent low-quality, nabbing the item an “F” grade. “We started the site about a year ago now because we saw that it was a problem for ourselves. Is this real or is this not,” said Fakespot’s chief strategy officer, Ming Ooi. “As we ranked the products, it became pretty obvious that there are a lot of inauthentic and fake reviews online. This is probably an epidemic that hasn’t been talked about. I would say 40 percent of the reviews on Amazon are fake.”\nClues of fake reviews Wording in review is lifted from product description Non-verified purchase Most of the reviews were published at the same time Excessive 5-star ratings Doesn’t make sense Reviewer has few reviews elsewhere or only leaves 5-star reviews Offers a discount code to buy the product Gets an “F” on Fakespot.com (analyzes Amazon and Yelp reviews) As one of the biggest online stores, Amazon, which wouldn’t comment for this story, is a major target for fake reviews , counterfeit products and fraud. The company has battled back by implementing features such as adding “Verified Purchase” on reviews, suing counterfeiters and banning paid reviews unless they are part of Amazon’s own Vine reviewer program. But Amazon isn’t the only store being targeted with fake reviews and other questionable cyber mayhem to spur sales.\nCybersecurity firm RiskIQ studied the five most popular online stores and took their names and iterations of the words “Black Friday” to search for fraud. It found 1,950 websites pretending to be part of those retailers. RiskIQ also deemed that one in 10 Black Friday apps — out of 5,315 — were malicious because they attempted to trick users into downloading malware or share login and credit card information.\n“There were so many infringing applications that are basically causing consumers a great deal of confusion,” said James Pleger, RiskIQ’s director of security and threat research. “If someone going to the app store was looking for ‘Black Friday,’ they’d have a one-in-10 chance of getting affected.”\nRiskIQ won’t share the blacklist or name specific retailers because it feels that would cause greater confusion and tarnish those brands. But he ticked off a list of advice: Stick with official app stores such as Google Play or Apple’s App store. Be wary of apps that offer rewards in exchange for your address or bank account; double-check that the name of the publisher matches the application you want. And be leery of permissions because Candy Crush isn’t going to ask for your Facebook password or credit card information.\n“Just because an app appears to have a good reputation and good reviews, it doesn’t mean it’s a good application,” Pleger said. “People can purchase reviews online. If I wanted to, I could make an app and pay to get 5,000 reviews on my app in less than a couple of weeks.”\nOf course, some five-star reviews are legitimate. Positive reviews can make or break an item and that’s what all companies are hoping to organically attract. But sometimes organic reviews need a nudge. A company such as TurnTo Networks helps companies verify reviewers are actual customers and then encourage those buyers to leave a comment.\n“The one problem that’s much more widespread is that when it’s hard to write a review, people who end up reviewing are the angry ones. It’s distorted,” TurnTo’s CEO and founder George Eberstadt said. “What ends up happening is reviews on the whole don’t reflect the perfectly happy middle. If incentives gets the perfectly happy people to say, ‘It’s fine,’ we see that as a service.”\nOne client, Sur La Table, saw reviews nearly triple after hiring TurnTo. The store’s average review rating also increased from 4.1 stars to 4.5 stars because “we were able to tap into that perfectly happy middle,” Eberstadt said.\n“The way they were collecting reviews was just awkward. It had a lot of steps. When they switched to us, the volume of reviews went up two to three times. There was no incentive. We just made it simpler,” Eberstadt said. “The shopping public is well served by having a large volume of reviews and giving a little incentive to write a review can make a meaningful difference. The problem is that if the wording in the request is to steer the shopper into writing a more favorable review to get an incentive, then you’re biasing things. That’s the risk.”\nFake reviews have been plaguing the online world for years. The Federal Trade Commission began requiring bloggers and reviewers to disclose payment for writing about a product about six years ago though enforcement was minimal. A 2012 story in The New York Times mentions Todd Rutherford, who began writing positive book reviews for a fee. At one point, he was making $28,000 a month before he was taken down for, ironically, bad reviews by an author who felt she was poorly treated.\nRelated Articles Holiday shopping?

Holiday spending may hinge on how you voted Not all fake reviews are intended to encourage purchases. When Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly’s new book was released this month, the book’s Amazon page was flooded with one-star reviews . Many were linked to a pro-Donald Trump Reddit forum. After media coverage, Amazon removed many of the reviews.\n“She had 400 reviews from unverified users saying, ‘Lies, this book is terrible.’ All of a sudden there are now 177 reviews,” Fakespot’s Ooi said, adding that his company “ captures everything .”\n“But that’s the point,” he said. “If Amazon doesn’t see it and there’s no big public outcry, there are millions of books on Amazon and plenty of reviews that go unnoticed.”\nFakespot isn’t just about sussing out the fake reviews though. The company recently launched Trustwerty to highlight the good stuff .\n“We felt that there should be a way to reward the sellers who play by the rules,” Ooi said, “and this was the best way we knew how.”",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 Photo by I AM NIKOM / Shutterstock.com \nMillions of Americans are in love with shopping on Amazon.com. It’s terrifically convenient, and pricing can often be lower than in brick-and-mortar stores. \nHowever, if you know a few tricks, there are even bigger bargains to be found. Following are 10 secret ways die-hard Amazon shoppers shave even more money off store prices. 1. Amazon Associates \nAmazon Associates is the website’s affiliate program. Every time you send someone to Amazon, you get paid a percentage of whatever they spend. It’s really geared toward bloggers and small businesses, but according to Amazon : \nAll you need to join is a Web site that does not violate intellectual property rights or promote sexually explicit materials, violence, illegal activities, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age. \nThe key to making it work is to find a friend who is a regular Amazon shopper and also willing to sign up. You can’t earn an affiliate commission on your own purchases, but you can on someone else’s. \nSo, the plan is that you and your friend both sign up as affiliates. Then, when you shop on Amazon, you use their affiliate link and when they shop, they use yours. It’s an easy way to make up to 10 percent cash back on each other’s purchases. 2. Subscribe and Save \nIf you want to be sure you never run out of toilet paper or laundry soap, use the Subscribe and Save feature available on many household items . \nBasically, it works like this: You agree to receive regular, automatic shipments of certain products, and in exchange you get free shipping and a discount. The discount starts at 5 percent for a single item and climbs to 15 percent if you subscribe to five eligible items. \nSince you can cancel at any time, some people sign up for Subscribe and Save, receive one shipment at the reduced price, and then cancel. 3. Amazon Prime \nFor heavy-duty Amazon buyers like me, Amazon Prime is the way to go. It costs $99 for an annual membership but you get free two-day shipping, which can more than pay for the price of the membership. \nPlus, you can borrow from an extensive Kindle library for free, and stream video for free. There’s also free streaming music and free unlimited cloud picture storage. \nMaybe you aren’t sure you spend enough at Amazon to justify shelling out $99. You’re in luck: Amazon gives you a free one-month trial before they charge you — a one-month trial that may be perfect for, say, the holidays. 4. Deal tracker sites \nRegular Amazon shoppers know that prices at the online store fluctuate all over the place. \nThat’s where deal tracker sites come in handy. Websites such as CamelCamelCamel.com and TheTracktor.com can show you historical Amazon price data, as well as send alerts when a price on a certain item reaches a preset amount. \nYou can price watch on your own by clicking “Save for Later” on the items that interest you. Creating a wish list is another option. Sometimes, if you put an item in your cart and leave it there for a few days, the price will drop — presumably to entice you to buy. 5. Amazon Mom \nMoms are big business for retailers. The cost of all those diapers adds up quickly, but you can get 20 percent off a diaper subscription with Amazon Mom . \nIn addition, Amazon offers a one-time 10 percent discount — up to 15 percent for Amazon Prime members — on select items from your baby registry 60 days before your child’s arrival date. 6. Amazon Student \nWhy should moms get all the savings? Poor college kids need a break too. \nAmazon Student is essentially a reduced-price version of Amazon Prime. For half the price of Prime, you get the same benefits, plus special student offers and promotions. \nYou can also get a six-month free trial of Amazon Student compared with the 30-day trial offered to Prime members. During those six months, you don’t get access to free video or music streaming, or the Kindle lending library. But with six months of free two-day shipping, it’s hard to complain. \nTo get an Amazon Student membership, you need an .edu email address or must be able to otherwise verify your enrollment status.",

      "text": "Shop Now: Amazon's Best Cyber Monday Deals \nResearchers in the US, led by one of Indian origin, have developed a genetic manipulation technique that results in more efficient use of sunlight in photosynthesis by plants. They say the findings observed in tobacco plants could potentially be used to increase the yield of food crops like wheat and rice. Don't Miss: The Best Cyber Monday Deals on Sale Now \nPhotosynthesis is a process in which green plants use energy from the sun to transform water, carbon dioxide and minerals into biomass that is used for food, fuel, and fibre. \nHowever, when there is too much sunlight, the photosynthetic machinery in chloroplasts inside the plant cells can be damaged. To protect plants from such damage, nature has endowed the chloroplasts with a system called non-photochemical quenching or NPQ. \nScientists at the University of California-Berkeley (UCB) and the University of Illinois targeted the three genes involved in the \"quenching\" process. They figured that boosting the expression of these genes might improve photosynthetic efficiency and hence yield. To test this concept, the team inserted a \"cassette\" of the three genes (taken from the model plant Arabidopsis) into tobacco plants for testing in the field. \nBy boosting the expression of the three genes involved in NPQ, the scientists saw up to 20 per cent increase in the productivity of the modified tobacco plants in field experiments. The researchers have reported their findings in a paper published in the journal \"Science\". \n\"We just used tobacco plant for the proof of concept experiments because it is easy to work with,\" Krishna Niyogi, a UCB professor of plant and microbial biology and co-senior author, told this correspondent in an email. \n\"All plants have the NPQ photo-protection system. So we expect this will work for food crops too,\" Niyogi said, adding: \"In plants like rice and wheat, we hope to see an increased yield of seeds, which are the harvested parts of those crops.\" \nNiyogi teamed up with Stephen Long, a plant biology and crop sciences professor at the University of Illinois, for the study. \n\"It is very important to have these new technologies on the shelf now because it can take 20 years before such inventions can reach the farmer's fields,\" an official release from the university quoted Long as saying. \"If we don't do it now, we won't have this solution when we need it.\" \n ",
