      "text": "General Electric is paying $915 million to buy ServiceMax, a purveyor of software for scheduling field service visits. The move pits the company directly against Microsoft , Salesforce , and Oracle.\nUnder the agreement disclosed Monday and expected to close in Jan. 2017, ServiceMax will become part of GE Digital, the group that owns GE’s investments in software for managing a wide range of machines connected to the Internet. The centerpiece of that strategy is the company’s Predix technology , which collects and analyzes data from jet engines, wind turbines, and other heavy-duty equipment. GE plans to connect the data collected with Predix to the ServiceMax applications. The idea is to help anticipate service needs more proactively.\nThis is the group’s third big acquisition. Two years ago, GE bought cybersecurity firm Wurldtech, and in September, the company paid almost $500 million for Meridium, which specializes in software for monitoring equipment.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nServiceMax , based in Pleasanton, Calif., makes applications that more than 400 companies—including Coca-Cola and Tyco tyc —use to schedule and manage visits by field service technicians. (Prior to the acquisition, GE was also a customer.) As an independent company, ServiceMax has raised more than $202 million in backing.\nThe deal will pit GE more directly against some pretty formidable software companies.\nIn July 2015, Microsoft msft acquired ServiceMax rival FieldOne Services , which supplies software to United Technologies and Mitsubishi-Hitachi Power Systems. Salesforce crm introduced its own field service application in March, and Oracle orcl is also building out cloud services for field services, as a result of its July 2014 buyout of TOA Technologies .",

      "text": "Markets Today GE Digital Buys ServiceMax for $915 Million GE is making another big bet on the Internet of Things movement by snapping up ServiceMax, a cloud-based field service management company. Annie Palmer Nov14,20164:57PMEST \nGeneral Electric's ( GE ) Digital unit today said it agreed to purchase privately held cloud-based field service management company ServiceMax for $915 million. The acquisition will expand GE Digital's capabilities in analytics and productivity, the Boston-based company said in a statement. The deal is slated to close in January. ServiceMax's connected field software helps companies remotely keep track of equipment maintenance and schedule workforce optimization, among other things, via mobile and cloud computing platforms. GE has been making big bets on the Internet of Things movement, largely through its Predix industrial software platform, which combines device sensors with data analytics to improve machine performance and extend equipment life. In this year alone, GE has launched 40 apps for industrial companies via its cloud-based Predix platform. \"This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,\" said GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh in a statement. \"Improved productivity is critical for the Industrial Internet and digitizing field services is a cornerstone of a successful digital industrial strategy.\" GE has been using Internet of Things technology to garner data from MRI machines, wind turbines and airplane engines to provide customers with information needed to maintain their machinery, according to Tech Crunch . GE's acquisition of Pleasanton, Calif.-based ServiceMax extends a recent shopping spree in the Internet of Things space. In September, GE bought Meridium, an asset performance management software and services company, for $495 million. The digital industrial giant in 2014 purchased the Vancouver, Canada-based cyber-security firm Wurldtech for an undisclosed price. Wurldtech provides security solutions for industrial companies who have Internet-equipped, data-driven systems. Ruh predicts that industrial servicing could be a $1 trillion global market over the next 10 years, helped in large part by digitized servicing, according to Bloomberg .

Credit: Stephen Lawson Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 12:59 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGeneral Electric’s US$915 million acquisition of field service management company ServiceMax on Monday should help enterprises combine what GE does for industrial products and assets with more tools for those who work on them. \nGE Digital, the division that’s buying ServiceMax, sells software and services for connecting industrial assets and products in the field, then collecting and analyzing data about them. ServiceMax has a cloud-based platform for tasks like scheduling maintenance calls and making sure the right technician is on each job with the right part. \nThat service management system will get smarter when GE Digital adds its analytics and insights, the companies said. Using its cloud-based industrial internet platform, Predix , GE Digital plans to develop more applications for service delivery. The buyout will also bring ServiceMax into new industries, they said. \n“This acquisition builds upon our ongoing efforts to enhance our overall technology stack around the Predix platform and advance our Industrial Internet vision,” GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh said in a press release. \nPredix began as an internal tool that GE used to glean insights from data coming in from systems the company made, such as jet engines. Now, GE Digital sells it as a kind of operating system for the internet of things for others to take advantage of their own industrial data. \nCombining intelligence about industrial assets in the field with software to manage the servicing of those assets should be a natural fit and a boon to efficiency. ServiceMax is 10 years old and a big player in its field, with customers including companies in manufacturing, retail, energy, aerospace, and other businesses. GE itself says it has been a big user of ServiceMax internally. \nThe latest acquisition dovetails with GE Digital’s recent purchase of Meridium , a provider of asset performance management tools, which also will be integrated into Predix. \nThe ServiceMax acquisition comes just a day before GE’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco, where the company will give an update on Predix and the ecosystem of developers around it. On Monday, GE Digital announced a program to help independent software vendors use Predix as the foundation for new applications. \nThe acquisition is expected to close in January. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": " Google+\nBrian Snyder/REUTERS/File 2016\nGeneral Electric chief executive Jeffrey Immelt has sold off most finance and consumer businesses to focus on industries such as energy and aviation, as the company attempts to position itself as a “digital industrial” concern.\nBy Richard Clough Bloomberg News November 15, 2016\nGeneral Electric Co. has agreed to buy ServiceMax, a cloud-based software company, for $915 million to expand its digital operations and enhance equipment maintenance.\nThe deal will help GE automate and digitize the servicing of heavy-duty machinery, the Boston-based company said Monday in a statement. GE expects the acquisition to close in January.\nAdvertisement\n“It’s no secret our services revenue is the bulk of our earnings and is a key part of what makes us successful,” Bill Ruh, chief executive of GE Digital, said in an interview. “We’re moving away from where it’s all on paper to where it’s all becoming fully automated. Services are becoming a key part of the digital economy.”\nGE is investing in software operations and attempting to position itself as a “digital industrial” company that makes equipment outfitted with sensors to improve productivity. CEO Jeffrey Immelt has sold off most finance and consumer businesses while focusing on industries such as energy and aviation.\nGet Business Headlines GE Digital, established last year and based on the outskirts of Silicon Valley in California, may become a $15 billion business by 2020, the company has said. GE has developed an operating system called Predix to help run industrial equipment more reliably and efficiently.\n“The addition of ServiceMax better positions GE Digital to accelerate the commercialization of Predix applications by combining GE’s industrial portfolio and domain expertise with ServiceMax’s field service expertise,” Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.\nGerman rival Siemens AG also has been expanding its digital presence. The engineering company on Monday agreed to buy US software maker Mentor Graphics Corp. for $4.5 billion.\nAdvertisement\nServiceMax provides field-service management software to remotely track equipment maintenance, create work orders, and manage repair schedules. The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company had raised more than $200 million from investors, including GE’s venture arm.\nGE considered developing its own ability to automate and digitize servicing, but opted to buy ServiceMax after using its products over the last two years, Ruh said. Industrial servicing, including maintenance and upgrades of previously sold equipment, could be a $1 trillion global market over the next 10 years, and digitizing the process could account for a significant percentage of that, Ruh said.\n“This is a large opportunity,” he said.\nThe acquisition of ServiceMax extends a recent shopping spree for GE, including a tie-up between the oil division and Baker Hughes Inc., deals in the 3-D printer market, and the purchase of a maker of wind-turbine blades.\nServiceMax also complements other moves GE has made to fill out its digital business, Ruh said. The company in September paid $495 million for Meridium Inc., a software developer focused on asset performance management, or the monitoring of equipment.\nGE will continue to look for “tuck-in” acquisitions for the digital business, he said. “These things fit together as a string of pearls.”\nMorgan Stanley was the financial adviser for ServiceMax and Gundersen Dettmer LLP served as legal counsel, according to the statement. King & Spalding LLP was legal counsel for GE Digital.",

      "title": "GE says its software for smart factories and the 'Internet of Things' is now a $6 billion business",
      "text": "Business Insider \nGE \nToday, GE announced that its software and services business is on track to do $6 billion in revenue in 2016 — 20% higher than in 2015, and putting GE on track to hit its goal of $15 billion in annual revenue by 2020.\nThe core of the GE software business is Predix, what it calls an \"operating system for the industrial Internet of Things.\" In other words, Predix is a tool to help GE customers build the software that powers Internet-connected industrial machinery like jet turbines, trains, or factory robots. \nIndeed, Predix is the star attraction at GE's \"Mind and Machines\" conference this week in San Francsico.\nGE Digital CEO Bill Ruh says the idea is to refine the technology to handle a wider variety of tasks, and to bring together as many partners as possible to that end. That will help ensure that the Predix platform appeals to as many markets as it can as industries begin to digitize their businesses. \n\"Every CEO is realizing they need to transform themselves,\" Ruh says.\nIn addition to the revenue stats, GE announced new industry-specific Predix solutions for energy management, oil and gas, and other specialized markets, as well as new solutions to help end-users, as in factory machine operators, maintenance workers, and the like, use Predix-powered applications.\nGE also announced that it's bought startups BitStew and Wise.io to help customers add data from their industrial machines to the Predix cloud, and to add a little extra artificial intelligence know-how to Predix. \nGE \nGartner Research VP Benoit Lheureux praises the BitStew acquisition. He says that letting customers integrate machine data is a major difficulty for any industrial cloud vendor, and that the addition of BitStew tech to Predix makes a \"substantive\" dent in the problem.\nGE also announced that there are 19,000 developers building specialized industrial software on top of the Predix platform, along with new initiatives to attract business software vendors like Box and Pitney Bowes.\n\"You have to build an ecosystem. You have to have a set of friends to help you on this journey,\" Ruh says. \nThe endgame, Ruh says, is in using Predix, combined with GE's own industry-specific solutions, plus some software from those 19,000 developers, to make more efficient machines. Give humans the tools to manage machines at peak efficiency, building them into the way they already work, and big things will happen. The same way that startups automate things like taxi dispatch to operate at scale, real automation brings value hereto untold . \n\"It's the equivalent of what Uber did, but for business,\" Ruh says.  \n",

Share story The Associated Press \nCHICAGO — A lawsuit has been filed by 18 passengers who were aboard an American Airlines aircraft that caught fire last month on the tarmac of Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport after an engine failed. \nThe lawsuit filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court targets American, aircraft manufacturer Boeing and engine manufacturer General Electric Aviation. \nThe Chicago Sun-Times reports the lawsuit claims GE sold a faulty engine that Boeing used to assemble an unsafe aircraft. The passengers also claim American Airlines employees should have done a better job inspecting the plane. They contend employees failed to provide “assistance, supervision and instruction” during evacuation. \nPilots on Oct. 28 aborted the takeoff of American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami. All 161 passengers and nine crew safely evacuated, with officials saying 20 people suffered minor injuries. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "Market News   10:00am EST GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups \nSEATTLE Nov 15 General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. \nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.

Sorry IDG News Service | November 15, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Cloud Computing \nIt turns out GE Digital’s acquisition of ServiceMax on Monday and its Meridium buy in September weren't the company's only recent moves to expand its industrial IoT expertise. \nTwo deals for small startups, completed recently and announced on Tuesday, add interesting technologies that should help the company develop new capabilities and help enterprises meet challenges in industrial IoT. Both were announced at GE Digital’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco and didn’t come with publicly announced price tags. \nIn mid-October, the company bought Wise.io , a startup that GE says can refine machine-learning algorithms through a process like natural selection. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nIn the industrial world where GE Digital operates, recommendations based on machine learning carry higher stakes than they do on e-commerce sites. Instead of spitting out advice that says you should spend a few dollars on a book, industrial IoT software may recommend removing an engine from an airliner at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. \n“We have to be very low on the false positives and very low on the false negatives,” said Harel Kodesh, CTO of GE Digital and vice president of Predix, the company’s industrial IoT platform. \nThe way it’s done is to run thousands of possible algorithms to figure out which is best for the job. Wise.io specializes in techniques for carrying out that winnowing process quickly and at a relatively low cost, Kodesh said. \nIt’s also developed ways to do this with relatively sparse data sets. That’s useful because industrial systems are highly reliable and don’t generate many examples of how failures happen, he said. That compares with millions of customer histories that an e-commerce site may have to work with in making a product recommendation. \nLast week, GE Digital also bought Bit Stew Systems , a startup that helps to determine what the bits streaming out of an edge device mean. \nWhen devices like sensors start sending data to IoT systems that are supposed to process it, those systems may not know what the bits represent, Kodesh said. In one packet, one set of bits may represent temperature readings, another pressure readings, and so on. \nGE grapples with this problem when it’s developing new products, and it’s often down to trial and error to parse out the data. This can take months. \nBit Stew’s software can do the same thing in half an hour or less, Kodesh said. It does so by using machine learning to generate hypotheses about what different bits represent and then test them out by looking at other bit streams from the same device. GE also plans to use Bit Stew’s machine-learning technology in other ways and take advantage of a lightweight application generation system from the company, he said. RELATED TOPICS",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nSEATTLE General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. \nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "GE acquires Wise.io to deepen its machine learning stack Posted Super Mario Run hits iPhone and iPad Dec. 15 with full unlock for $9.99 \nGE Digital today announced that it has acquired Wise.io , a machine-learning powered service that helps businesses find patterns and trends in their vast data stores. At first glance, that may seem like an odd acquisition for a company like GE. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that with Predix , GE already offers its customers a service that focuses on helping them monitor their equipment, whether that’s an industrial tool or an aircraft engine, and predict issues based on the monitoring data. \nAs GE CIO Jim Fowler told me, the company’s developers wrote a few hundred different models for lots of different assets in Predix. The service has some rudimentary AI capabilities, but the addition of Wise.io’s technology — which can find patterns on its own — and its team will allow GE to offer a far more flexible model. “As we think about services going forward, you’ll see GE enter verticals we haven’t been in before,” Fowler told me. \nIn many ways, GE itself is undergoing the kind of digital transformation that many of its own customers are dealing with. It’s undergoing what Fowler called a “new industrial revolution,” where it has to reposition itself to play in the field of analytics, data, machine learning, etc. To keep pace, the company has been making a number of acquisitions. These include the purchase of ServiceMax for almost $1 billion yesterday and Wise.io today (as well as the rather quiet acquisition of data integration platform Bit Stew earlier this year). \nGE and Wise.io did not disclose the acquisition price. Wise.io previously raised $3.58 million. The company also participated in the Alchemist Accelerator and Citrix Startup Accelerator programs. \nWise.io will continue to operate as usual and GE will continue to service its existing customers. While the company is mostly buying Wise.io for its technology and talent, this also means it’s getting access to quite a few Wise.io customers who probably never considered GE as a vendor. Wise.io’s users currently include the likes of Pinterest, Twilio, Thumbtack and Republic Wireless. \nGE expects that software will bring in $15 billion in revenue by 2020 (I wonder if it used Predix to set that number…). The vast majority of this ($10 billion) will likely come from existing customers, $1 billion will come from the efficiencies it hopes to gain by driving internal usage of technologies like Wise.io and it expects that $4 billion will come from new customers. \nFeatured Image: YASUYOSHI CHIBA/Getty Images 0",

The platform enhancements, acquisitions and new ISV partner program further complement the Predix technology stack and make it easier for industrial companies to execute a strategic digital transformation to drive internal productivity. In 2016, orders from GE’s portfolio of software solutions are on track to climb 25%+ to more than $7 billion – making GE the fastest growing digital industrial company in the world. Demonstrating the strength of Predix within GE, digital thread productivity will exceed $600 million, accelerating into 2017. \n“The opportunity for industry is now,” said Bill Ruh, Chief Digital Officer of GE and CEO, GE Digital. “The Industrial Internet is profoundly transforming how we operate and our ability to deliver greater productivity for GE and for our customers. Connected machines, coupled with deep machine learning, are more powerful than anything we have seen. These strategic investments in both the Predix platform and our partners continue to attract industrial companies and provide them with tools they need to embark on their own digital industrial transformations.” \nEXTENDING PREDIX FROM THE EDGE TO THE CLOUD \nMore than 19,000 developers are building on Predix today, after GE opened the platform to global customers earlier this year. GE expects 20,000 developers working on the platform by year-end. To service this growing segment of the ecosystem, as well as the hundreds of industrial businesses already using Predix, GE unveiled a new suite of software and applications designed to get Predix in the hands of operators, business analysts and other users in non-technical roles. \nThis new release will focus on expanding the platform and scaling development of Digital Twins – virtual representations of the billions of physical assets that comprise the world’s industrial infrastructure – through Predix apps and toolkits. It also aims to grow the developer community by building better tools for software engineers within GE’s industrial customer base and extend the cloud to the edge – or to the machines. \nThe cloud plays an essential role in enabling industrial companies to cost-effectively store and process massive amounts of data to fulfill their vision for the Industrial Internet. But the cloud often offers low latency. Sending data to the cloud and bringing it back to the edge is inefficient for making real-time decisions, which limits customers’ ability to optimize their assets and operations. They need the capability to put analytics at the edge, on any device or machine. \nToday, GE unveiled the Predix System™ – software architecture and services designed to make any machine an intelligent asset and to bring visibility, control and analytic insights to every part of industrial infrastructure and operations. This new set of components can run on a variety of operating systems, devices and form factors – from sensors and controllers to gateways, server appliances and the cloud – making Predix a distributed system for the Industrial Internet and a complete “edge-to-cloud” offering. \nThis strategy reinforces GE’s approach to the edge and incorporates other GE devices, such as Field Agent, a component of GE’s Industrial Internet Control System (IICS). IICS quickly, reliably and securely connects thousands of machines to the cloud, bringing computing to the edge with 100 times the computing power of a standard control system. \nIn addition to updates to the platform, GE also launched new Predix-based solutions, designed to help customers harness the power of the Industrial Internet: Current, powered by GE introduced a new solution for digital energy management, designed to analyze and optimize energy use and operational efficiency use across lighting, HVAC and other systems.

GE Renewable Energy introduced the Digital Hydro Plant, a suite of apps combining both software and hardware solutions designed to support Hydro customers globally, helping them get the most out of assets over the lifetime of a plant. The Digital Hydro Plant complements GE’s Digital Wind Farm, Digital Power Plant for Gas and Digital Power Plant for Steam, enhancing power generation reliability, efficiency, cybersecurity and profitability – targeted to reduce maintenance costs by up to 10%, increase plant availability by as much as 1% and boost revenues by up to 3%. \nACQUISITIONS OF BIT STEW SYSTEMS, WISE.IO ACCELERATE DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION \nGE Digital announced it has acquired Bit Stew Systems to bring its data intelligence capabilities to Predix and other industrial solutions. Bit Stew applies its machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to automate the process of data modeling, mapping and ingestion, accelerating time to value for customers, such as BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric and Scottish & Southern Energy. This acquisition will help GE Digital provide a solution to organize large amounts of data through efficient data organization at the edge or at the source of the data – the asset. \nIntegration of Bit Stew’s technologies into the Predix platform will provide improved ability to integrate data while it is in motion – from the edge to the cloud – and will allow industrial companies to gain better insight into data coming from the edge. This combined capability provides customers with a solution to efficiently organize large amounts of data at the source, enabling more rapid realization of Industrial Internet value. \nGE Digital also acquired Wise.io , a leading machine learning and intelligent systems company. This acquisition will enable GE Digital to further accelerate development of advanced machine learning and data science offerings in the Predix platform. The Wise.io team deepens GE’s machine learning stack and will spearhead innovative solutions in GE’s vertical markets to develop its machine learning offerings. Current Wise.io customers include Pinterest, Twilio and Thumbtack. \nIndustrial machine learning is critical to GE’s development of scalable Digital Twin solutions and data-intensive industrial computing challenges. Running on Predix, Digital Twins are virtual twins of an industrial asset – a jet engine, a wind turbine or an entire power plant. Twins continuously collect data from physical and virtual sensors and rely on advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the data to gain insights about performance and operation. Wise.io’s deep machine learning expertise – combined with GE Digital’s existing data science talent and massive portfolio of industrial assets – will advance GE’s Digital Twin capabilities and solidify its role as a leader in industrial machine learning. \nThis news follow GE’s recent acquisition of ServiceMax , a leader in cloud-based field service management solutions, which enables GE Digital customers to immediately gain more productivity from their assets and find greater efficiency in their field service processes. Other GE acquisitions in the digital industrial space include Meridium and Wurldtech . \nGROWING THE DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM \nThe expansion of products and services for the Industrial Internet mirrors the increasing number of global businesses contributing to the growth of the digital industrial ecosystem. \nGE also announced a program dedicated to independent software vendors (ISVs), aimed at spurring development of industrial solutions and extending the reach of the Predix platform. Through these partnerships, GE will share its industry expertise and allow partners to use Predix as the building block for new industrial applications to enhance various components of industrial operations – such as maintenance, content development and asset management. Ultimately, customers will have greater access to these new solutions and will more quickly see outcomes, enabled by the cloud. \nNo platform has been successful without involvement from ISVs—they are a force multiplier and provide a new stream of revenue for GE. Inaugural launch partners include: Box, Decisyon App Composer, Entercoms, Ericsson, Mobideo, Nurego, OAG Analytics, Pitney Bowes and Splunk. The addition of ISVs enhances the growing ranks of the GE Digital Alliance Program, which launched in February. The alliance program now boasts more than 270 partners around the world, including major enterprise players such as AT&T, EY, Intel, Microsoft and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). \nTo further expand the digital industrial ecosystem, GE Digital also opened two foundries in 2016 in Paris and Shanghai, in addition to its flagship foundry in San Ramon, Calif. The foundries comprise a global network of sites where GE Digital incubates Industrial Internet startup companies, collaborates with customers on new application development, and works to extend and promote GE’s international developer ecosystem. \nGE Digital’s footprint grew in the U.S. as well, opening new IT sites in Atlanta, Miami and Providence that serve as technology hubs, global IT operations and application development centers. GE Digital will also expand its San Ramon headquarters to 350,000 square feet to accommodate the fast-growing organization.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo A \nSEATTLE: General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. \nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) - Reuters",

The two companies also agreed to co-develop applications built on top of Predix in the future.

      "title": "GE Wants To Be The Next Artificial Intelligence Powerhouse",
      "text": "When you hear the term \"artificial intelligence,\" you may think of tech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, or Facebook. Industrial powerhouse General Electric is now aiming to be included on that short list. It may not have a chipper digital assistant like Cortana or Alexa. It won&apos;t sort through selfies, but it will look through X-rays. It won&apos;t recommend movies, but it will suggest how to care for a diesel locomotive. Today, GE announced a pair of acquisitions and new services that will bring machine learning AI to the kinds of products it&apos;s known for, including planes, trains, X-ray machines, and power plants.\nThe effort started in 2015 when GE announced Predix Cloud —an online platform to network and collect data from sensors on industrial machinery such as gas turbines or windmills. At the time, GE touted the benefits of using machine learning to find patterns in sensor data that could lead to energy savings or preventative maintenance before a breakdown. Predix Cloud opened up to customers in February, but GE is still building up the AI capabilities to fulfill the promise. \"We were using machine learning, but I would call it in a custom way,\" says Bill Ruh, GE&apos;s chief digital officer and CEO of its GE Digital business (GE calls its division heads CEOs). \"And we hadn&apos;t gotten to a general-purpose framework in machine learning.\" \nToday GE revealed the purchase of two AI companies that Ruh says will get them there. Bit Stew Systems , founded in 2005, was already doing much of what Predix Cloud promises—collecting and analyzing sensor data from power utilities, oil and gas companies, aviation, and factories. (GE Ventures has funded the company.) Customers include BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Scottish & Southern Energy.\nThe second purchase, Wise.io is a less obvious purchase. Founded by astrophysics and AI experts using machine learning to study the heavens, the company reapplied the tech to streamlining a company&apos;s customer support systems, picking up clients like Pinterest, Twilio, and TaskRabbit. GE believes the technology will transfer yet again, to managing industrial machines. \"I think by the middle of next year we will have a full machine learning stack,\" says Ruh.\nGE Wants to Give Industrial Machines Their Own Social Network With Predix Cloud GE is selling a new service that promises to predict when a machine will break down...so technicians can preemptively fix it. GE also just bought ServiceMax , maker of software for dispatching field service agents, for a cool $915 million. \"It&apos;s a unicorn, essentially,\" he says.\nThough young, Predix is growing fast, with 270 partner companies using the platform, according to GE, which expects revenue on software and services to grow over 25% this year, to more than $7 billion. Ruh calls Predix a \"significant part\" of that extra money. And he&apos;s ready to brag, taking a jab at IBM Watson for being a \"general-purpose\" machine-learning provider without the deep knowledge of the industries it serves. \"We have domain algorithms, on machine learning, that&apos;ll know what a power plant is and all the depth of that, that a general-purpose machine learning will never really understand,\" he says.\nGE Healthcare lobbed a shot across IBM&apos;s bow in announcing a deal with UCSF to develop AI-driven apps for the care of various diseases. (See my colleague Chrissy Farr&apos;s full coverage [[TK-Link here]] .) Health is the first industry IBM Watson targeted (starting with years of studying cancer data), and UCSF is a nice prize.\nNot synonymous with health is another new GE customer, McDonald’s, which is using a Predix service called Current to lower energy costs on items like heating and lighting. Most of GE&apos;s new offerings are in the energy realm, such as Digital Substation, which promises to use monitoring and AI to reduce downtime for power companies.\nOne especially dull-sounding new Predix service—Predictive Corrosion Management—touches on a very hot political issue: giant oil and gas pipeline projects. Over 400 people have been arrested in months of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The issue is very complicated, but one concern of protestors is that a pipeline rupture would contaminate drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.\n\"I think absolutely this is aimed at that problem. If you look at why pipelines spill, it&apos;s corrosion,\" says Ruh. \"We believe that 10 years from now, we can detect a leak before it occurs and fix it before you see it happen.\" Given how political battles over pipelines drag on, 10 years might not be so long to wait.",

Terms of the deals weren't disclosed.\nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview.\nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming.\nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site.\nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.\n\n\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

      "text": "Deals  34am EST GE signs Exelon in its largest power-plant software deal The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site in Belfort, June 23, 2014. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE \nSEATTLE General Electric Co ( GE.N ) has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp ( EXC.N ) to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday. \nThe Exelon deal, aimed at wringing greater efficiency from the business of generating electricity, marks another advance in GE's effort to lift annual digital technology revenue to $14 billion in 2020 from $5 billion in 2015, across its many industrial products. \nIt also is one of the three largest sales of GE's Predix industrial operating system so far. Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon's five-year contract with GE. \nIn initial uses, GE's technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. \nExelon's deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts. \nChicago-based Exelon will use GE's Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. \nExelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company's business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn't choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications. \nGE's power business accounts for 40 percent of GE's digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power's software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. \nExelon's agreement follows four pilot projects over the past year and is GE's \"first and largest IoT (internet of things) enterprise-wide deployment of Predix full-suite offerings anywhere in the world,\" Bolze said. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Bill Rigby) Next In Deals",

      "title": "GE Expands Predix Platform to Advance Industrial Internet Opportunities for Customers",
      "text": "Blog This \nToday at Minds + Machines, GE (NYSE:GE) announced new products, acquisitions and partner programs to enable further adoption of Predix, the operating system for the Industrial Internet. The platform enhancements, acquisitions and new ISV partner program further complement the Predix technology stack and make it easier for industrial companies to execute a strategic digital transformation to drive internal productivity. In 2016, orders from GE’s portfolio of software solutions are on track to climb 25%+ to more than $7 billion – making GE the fastest growing digital industrial company in the world. Demonstrating the strength of Predix within GE, digital thread productivity will exceed $600 million, accelerating into 2017. \n“The opportunity for industry is now,” said Bill Ruh, Chief Digital Officer of GE and CEO, GE Digital. “The Industrial Internet is profoundly transforming how we operate and our ability to deliver greater productivity for GE and for our customers. Connected machines, coupled with deep machine learning, are more powerful than anything we have seen. These strategic investments in both the Predix platform and our partners continue to attract industrial companies and provide them with tools they need to embark on their own digital industrial transformations.” \nEXTENDING PREDIX FROM THE EDGE TO THE CLOUD \nMore than 19,000 developers are building on Predix today, after GE opened the platform to global customers earlier this year. GE expects 20,000 developers working on the platform by year-end. To service this growing segment of the ecosystem, as well as the hundreds of industrial businesses already using Predix, GE unveiled a new suite of software and applications designed to get Predix in the hands of operators, business analysts and other users in non-technical roles. \nThis new release will focus on expanding the platform and scaling development of Digital Twins – virtual representations of the billions of physical assets that comprise the world’s industrial infrastructure – through Predix apps and toolkits. It also aims to grow the developer community by building better tools for software engineers within GE’s industrial customer base and extend the cloud to the edge – or to the machines. \nThe cloud plays an essential role in enabling industrial companies to cost-effectively store and process massive amounts of data to fulfill their vision for the Industrial Internet. But the cloud often offers low latency. Sending data to the cloud and bringing it back to the edge is inefficient for making real-time decisions, which limits customers’ ability to optimize their assets and operations. They need the capability to put analytics at the edge, on any device or machine. \nToday, GE unveiled the Predix System™ – software architecture and services designed to make any machine an intelligent asset and to bring visibility, control and analytic insights to every part of industrial infrastructure and operations. This new set of components can run on a variety of operating systems, devices and form factors – from sensors and controllers to gateways, server appliances and the cloud – making Predix a distributed system for the Industrial Internet and a complete “edge-to-cloud” offering. \nThis strategy reinforces GE’s approach to the edge and incorporates other GE devices, such as Field Agent, a component of GE’s Industrial Internet Control System (IICS). IICS quickly, reliably and securely connects thousands of machines to the cloud, bringing computing to the edge with 100 times the computing power of a standard control system. \nIn addition to updates to the platform, GE also launched new Predix-based solutions, designed to help customers harness the power of the Industrial Internet: Current, powered by GE introduced a new solution for digital energy management, designed to analyze and optimize energy use and operational efficiency use across lighting, HVAC and other systems. Restaurant, retail and commercial businesses are using the solution to see exactly where and when energy is being used in real time. The powerful software allows them to do not only historic, but also predictive and prescriptive analytics. Customers already using this tool include McDonald’s and Simon Property Group. GE Energy Connections unveiled Digital Substation, which extends the maintenance optimization benefits of GE’s Asset Performance Management software to the electricity grid. Eight percent of all generated electricity never reaches its intended customer due to grid outages. GE’s Digital Substation is designed to enhance the reliability of a critical element of electrical grids and optimize the total use of assets. GE Healthcare expanded partnerships in its Health Cloud, including important partnerships in deep learning, collaboration and analytics. Cloud-enabled patient outcomes are linking clinical feedback to transformative radiology pathways. The GE Health Cloud will improve clinical outcomes and productivity, while opening new revenue streams. GE Oil & Gas launched Predictive Corrosion Management, a new Asset Performance Management (APM) solution that provides continuous inspection data and cloud-based analytics of pipe conditions to help operators manage corrosion-related risk, improve uptime, and minimize the total cost of operations. Predictive Corrosion Management couples GE’s Rightrax PM ultrasonic sensors with the Predix operating system to enable “digital inspection.” GE Power introduced a new release of its Digital Power Plant software for gas, steam and nuclear plants, which features new tools to help customers reduce unplanned downtime by up to 5%, reduce false positive alerts by up to 75%, and reduce operations and maintenance costs by up to 25%. It also includes software that provides power producers with accurate and timely plant operating capacity information, which energy traders can use to generate incremental revenues. GE Renewable Energy introduced the Digital Hydro Plant, a suite of apps combining both software and hardware solutions designed to support Hydro customers globally, helping them get the most out of assets over the lifetime of a plant. The Digital Hydro Plant complements GE’s Digital Wind Farm, Digital Power Plant for Gas and Digital Power Plant for Steam, enhancing power generation reliability, efficiency, cybersecurity and profitability – targeted to reduce maintenance costs by up to 10%, increase plant availability by as much as 1% and boost revenues by up to 3%. \nACQUISITIONS OF BIT STEW SYSTEMS, WISE.IO ACCELERATE DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION \nGE Digital announced it has acquired Bit Stew Systems to bring its data intelligence capabilities to Predix and other industrial solutions. Bit Stew applies its machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to automate the process of data modeling, mapping and ingestion, accelerating time to value for customers, such as BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric and Scottish & Southern Energy. This acquisition will help GE Digital provide a solution to organize large amounts of data through efficient data organization at the edge or at the source of the data – the asset. \nIntegration of Bit Stew’s technologies into the Predix platform will provide improved ability to integrate data while it is in motion – from the edge to the cloud – and will allow industrial companies to gain better insight into data coming from the edge. This combined capability provides customers with a solution to efficiently organize large amounts of data at the source, enabling more rapid realization of Industrial Internet value. \nGE Digital also acquired Wise.io , a leading machine learning and intelligent systems company. This acquisition will enable GE Digital to further accelerate development of advanced machine learning and data science offerings in the Predix platform. The Wise.io team deepens GE’s machine learning stack and will spearhead innovative solutions in GE’s vertical markets to develop its machine learning offerings. Current Wise.io customers include Pinterest, Twilio and Thumbtack. \nIndustrial machine learning is critical to GE’s development of scalable Digital Twin solutions and data-intensive industrial computing challenges. Running on Predix, Digital Twins are virtual twins of an industrial asset – a jet engine, a wind turbine or an entire power plant. Twins continuously collect data from physical and virtual sensors and rely on advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the data to gain insights about performance and operation. Wise.io’s deep machine learning expertise – combined with GE Digital’s existing data science talent and massive portfolio of industrial assets – will advance GE’s Digital Twin capabilities and solidify its role as a leader in industrial machine learning. \nThis news follow GE’s recent acquisition of ServiceMax , a leader in cloud-based field service management solutions, which enables GE Digital customers to immediately gain more productivity from their assets and find greater efficiency in their field service processes. Other GE acquisitions in the digital industrial space include Meridium and Wurldtech . \nGROWING THE DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM \nThe expansion of products and services for the Industrial Internet mirrors the increasing number of global businesses contributing to the growth of the digital industrial ecosystem. \nGE also announced a program dedicated to independent software vendors (ISVs), aimed at spurring development of industrial solutions and extending the reach of the Predix platform. Through these partnerships, GE will share its industry expertise and allow partners to use Predix as the building block for new industrial applications to enhance various components of industrial operations – such as maintenance, content development and asset management. Ultimately, customers will have greater access to these new solutions and will more quickly see outcomes, enabled by the cloud. \nNo platform has been successful without involvement from ISVs—they are a force multiplier and provide a new stream of revenue for GE. Inaugural launch partners include: Box, Decisyon App Composer, Entercoms, Ericsson, Mobideo, Nurego, OAG Analytics, Pitney Bowes and Splunk. The addition of ISVs enhances the growing ranks of the GE Digital Alliance Program, which launched in February. The alliance program now boasts more than 270 partners around the world, including major enterprise players such as AT&T, EY, Intel, Microsoft and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). \nTo further expand the digital industrial ecosystem, GE Digital also opened two foundries in 2016 in Paris and Shanghai, in addition to its flagship foundry in San Ramon, Calif. The foundries comprise a global network of sites where GE Digital incubates Industrial Internet startup companies, collaborates with customers on new application development, and works to extend and promote GE’s international developer ecosystem. \nGE Digital’s footprint grew in the U.S. as well, opening new IT sites in Atlanta, Miami and Providence that serve as technology hubs, global IT operations and application development centers. GE Digital will also expand its San Ramon headquarters to 350,000 square feet to accommodate the fast-growing organization. GE Digital will have a global network of 11 foundries and six additional centers by 2020. \nCUSTOMER ADOPTION OF PREDIX APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES \nPredix is the foundation of the industrial app economy, an ecosystem of software and services that allow businesses to use data and analytics to improve operations, increase productivity and drive new revenue streams. Industrial Internet offerings are already boosting GE’s services margins and organic industrial growth. New partnerships are helping to solidify GE’s position as the most promising in the $225 billion industrial software market. \nGE has seen growing adoption of Industrial Internet technologies and solutions among its customers, spanning energy, healthcare and transportation, including: BP and GE Oil & Gas announced the startup of Plant Operations Advisor (POA), a new digital solution designed to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of BP’s oil and gas production operations.

      "text": "Tweet Share The logo of U.S. conglomerate General Electric is pictured at the company's site in Belfort, April 27, 2014. REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo More SEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. GE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. Berkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. A branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. Bit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognising voices and making decisions.

      "text": "SEATTLE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product.\nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed.\nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview.\nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming.\nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site.\nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.

This transaction, along with our previous acquisitions of Wurldtech and Meridium, is directly aligned with our strategy to drive growth both inorganically and organically by building the capabilities to support the digital industrial transformation through Predix, APM, and the Digital Thread.” \nServiceMax CEO Dave Yarnold stated: “The transaction will help position ServiceMax to reach its next phase of growth by having access to GE’s broad and advanced industrial portfolio, deep domain expertise and substantial customer footprint. We look forward to benefitting from GE’s experience, capabilities, and resources as we expand into new markets while continuing to deliver the best tools to help customers maximize productivity and efficiency.” \nInvestors interested in holding GE indirectly can opt for ETFs like the iShares Global Industrials ETF ( EXI ). GE makes up 7.5% of EXI, whose other major industrial holdings include 3M Company ( MMM ), Boeing ( BA ), and Honeywell International ( HON ). \nContinue to the corresponding part of this series for a look at how ServiceMax could fuel GE’s industrial Internet dream.

      "text": "Image Credit: Justin Gurbisz/Flickr \nGE today announced that its GE Digital division has acquired machine learning startup Wise.io . Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. \nAmong other things, GE wants to have Wise’s team improve its Digital Twin services that are geared toward the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), according to a statement . More generally, the team “will spearhead innovative solutions in GE’s vertical markets to develop its machine learning offerings,” the statement says. \nThat’s different from the startup’s primary focus, which was improving customer support with machine learning. Earlier this year, for example, it introduced automated support replies for Salesforce and Zendesk . This focus on customer service helped Wise.io distinguish itself from general-purpose machine learning startups such as H2O.ai. \nWise.io was founded in 2012 and headquartered in Berkeley, California. Customers include Gusto, Pinterest, Republic Wireless, TaskRabbit, and Twilio. Investors include Voyager Capital. The startup went through the Alchemist Accelerator and Citrix Startup Accelerator. \nYesterday, GE said it was buying field service management company ServiceMax for $915 million.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan GE releases new suite of Predix applications, services The updated platform aims to put Predix tools in the hands of operators, analysts and other people in industrial businesses with non-technical roles. | Topic: Internet of Things \nTuesday at its Minds + Machines conference, GE rolled out a new suite of applications and services for its industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform, Predix. \nThe added capabilities and features should make the relatively new platform a fully competitive product in a still-nascent IIoT marketplace, GE argues. With a full suite of digital tools sitting on top of GE's industrial expertise and market presence, the company is better suited to serve IIoT needs than its competitors -- whether it's other traditional industrial competitors or technology companies moving into the industrial space like Cisco , GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh told ZDNet. \n\"We sit between the old guard, which is still in this proprietary world, and the new guard coming at it with a new architecture but [without] the domain or the data,\" Ruh said. \"We really believe you need that combination of the data, the understanding of the machines... the access to the customers... that's how we're differentiating ourselves from our competitors.\" \nThe updated platform aims to put Predix tools in the hands of operators, analysts and other people in industrial businesses with non-technical roles. Recognizing that the cloud isn't sufficient for helping those people optimize industrial performance, GE is introducing new edge capabilities to Predix. The Predix Edge System enables industrial companies to place apps anywhere from small medical devices to controllers or network gateways. The system incorporates other GE devices, like Field Agent, a component of GE's Industrial Internet Control System that serves as a gateway between industrial assets and the cloud. \nGE is also rolling out a series of new Predix-based offerings designed for different industries and use cases, particularly in the energy sector. For instance, GE Power is expanding its Predix-powered software for customers that include power producers, utilities and grid operators. The updated Digital Power Plant software will use machine learning to give maintenance recommendations and will better connect machine data to energy trading capabilities. \nAdditionally, GE Oil & Gas is launching Predictive Corrosion Management, a new tool for gathering continuous inspection data from pipes and cloud-based analytics of pipe conditions. Its \"digital inspection\" capabilities are powered by combining GE's Rightrax ultrasonic sensors with the Predix operating system. Meanwhile, GE's Current is offering new energy management tools for a range of systems like lighting or HVAC systems. GE Energy Connections also unveiled Digital Substation, extending the maintenance optimization benefits of GE's Asset Performance Management software to the electricity grid. Lastly, GE Renewable Energy is rolling out a suite of apps called the Digital Hydro Plant for Hydro customers. \nThe Predix platform, which launched in 2015, faced some criticism over the summer from research firm Lux Research. The firm concluded the platform had yet to live up to its potential and faced stiff competition from the likes of Cisco's Jasper, C3 IoT and Aeris. \nRuh noted that in less than a year since the platform's release, the Predix developer community, as well as its customers and partners, serve as \"proof points\" of the its success. GE on Tuesday highlighted several new customers and companies with which they've expanded partnerships, including the Port of Los Angeles, Teledyne Controls, BP and Maersk Drilling. Exelon is the first GE Power customer to sign an enterprise software license, deploying the Predix platform and its Digital Power Plant and Digital Wind Farm offerings across its energy facilities. \nGE's software revenues on target to increase 20 percent in 2016, Ruh noted. \n\"We are winning major deals, we're seeing growth... and we're talking about a product less than a year on the market,\" he said.",

The roles of China , the European Union and the Middle East have all evolved, he said, adding that he hopes Trump takes a \"forward-looking view and not a backward-looking view in terms of the way he looks at the world.\" \nThis story is developing.

Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

      "text": "Business GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company General Electric. Photo: Reuters   \nSEATTLE - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. \nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.

Learn more... \nTue, Nov 15, 2016, 16:51 GMT - UK Markets closed GE Agrees to Purchase Controlling Shares of Arcam AB Press Release : GE – 1 hour 6 minutes ago \n-Furthers GE’s presence in the additive manufacturing space \n-Follows recent agreement to acquire 75% of Concept Laser \n-Launches www.geadditive.com website to detail GE’s multi-faceted additive activities \nGE (NYSE: GE) has agreed to purchase controlling shares of Arcam AB of Sweden following the conclusion of the extended public tender offer which ended on November 10. \nArcam shares tendered during the extended acceptance period – combined with Arcam shares acquired by GE – correspond to approximately 73.57% of the total outstanding shares for GE. \nIn addition, GE filed to further extend the acceptance period for the tender offer to November 29 to allow remaining shareholders to accept the offer. \nBased in Mölndal, Sweden, Arcam AB is the inventor of electron beam melting machines for metal-based additive manufacturing, and a producer of advanced metal powders with customers in the aerospace and orthopedic industries. Arcam generated $80 million in revenues in 2015 with about 320 employees. Arcam also operates AP&C, a metal powders operation in Canada, and DiSanto Technology, a medical additive manufacturing firm in Connecticut in the U.S.A., as well as sales and application sites worldwide. \nGE’s controlling ownership of Arcam stock will enable GE to influence the company and its future direction. GE will invest significantly in Arcam’s products and technology and will ultimately influence the makeup of the Arcam board of directors. \n“GE’s strong position as a controlling shareholder of Arcam is a key step in our overall additive strategy,” said David Joyce, GE vice chairman and president and CEO of GE Aviation. “We are delighted with our relationship with Arcam, which follows our recent announcement with Concept Laser. GE is becoming a key player in the additive space.” \nOn October 27, GE had reached an agreement to acquire a 75% stake in Concept Laser GmbH for $599 million (€549 million). The agreement allows for GE to take full ownership over the next several years. Privately-held Concept Laser has more than 200 employees and is headquartered in Lichtenfels, Germany, with significant operations in the United States (Grapevine, Texas), China, and a global network of more than 35 distributors and agents. Concept Laser is a pioneer in the field of metal additive manufacturing. \nConcept Laser designs and manufacturers powder bed-based laser additive manufacturing machines. Its customer base is focused on the aerospace, medical and dental industries, with a meaningful presence in automotive and jewelry. Concept Laser’s machine range incorporates both the largest and smallest build envelopes currently available on the market and are capable of processing various powder materials including titanium, nickel-base, cobalt-chromium and precious metal alloys, as well as hot-work and high-grade steels and aluminum. \nGE is well positioned to advance the additive manufacturing revolution across several industries. As a leading end user and investor in additive technology for several years, GE is experiencing its transformative engineering and manufacturing power across the company’s industrial businesses. \nGE has also invested approximately $1.5 billion in manufacturing and additive technologies at GE’s Global Research Center (GRC) in Niskayuna, New York, in addition to building a global additive network of centers focused on advancing the science. \nNow, the Arcam and Concept Laser transactions allow GE to focus on becoming a leading supplier of additive machines, materials, and software for several industry segments, including aerospace, power generation, automotive, medical, and electronics. \nAbout GE Additive \nGE Additive is part of GE (NYSE: GE), the world’s Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive.

      "text": "$2,603.10 Buy \nIf you want a great oven for baking, convection, and roasting, this GE is our pick. It excelled in all our tests, and helped us make food that was consistently delicious. \nBut the CT9050 has some other tricks up its sleeve, too. An easy-to-see strip of lights under the handle—GE calls it Notification Lighting—will start to glow when the oven is preheated, and slowly disappear as the timer counts down. \nThe CT9050 is also the first oven to be compatible with Amazon’s Alexa voice recognition, so you can tell it to start preheating or to set a timer even if your hands are busy or dirty. Read our full review . Best Gas Cooktop: Thermador SGSX365FS Where to Buy $1,899.00 Buy \nThermador may be best known for its high-end appliances, but the SGSX365FS 36-inch cooktop is a luxury worth spending a little extra for. That’s because it has a wider temperature range than nearly every other gas cooktop on the market. \nThe ExtraLow setting cycles burners on and off for a precise simmer, while powerful star-shaped burners had no problem getting our test pans hot enough to sear a steak. Plus, it feels sturdy and looks great. What else could you ask for in an appliance? Read our full review . Best Electric Cooktop: Whirlpool W5CE3024XB Where to Buy",

      "text": "GE signs Exelon in its largest power-plant software deal Reuters Photo: \nBy Alwyn Scott \nSEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric Co <GE.N> has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp <EXC.N> to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday. \nThe Exelon deal, aimed at wringing greater efficiency from the business of generating electricity, marks another advance in GE's effort to lift annual digital technology revenue to $14 billion in 2020 from $5 billion in 2015, across its many industrial products. \nIt also is one of the three largest sales of GE's Predix industrial operating system so far. Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon's five-year contract with GE. \nIn initial uses, GE's technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. \nExelon's deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts. \nChicago-based Exelon will use GE's Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. \nExelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company's business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn't choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications. \nGE's power business accounts for 40 percent of GE's digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power's software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. \nExelon's agreement follows four pilot projects over the past year and is GE's \"first and largest IoT (internet of things) enterprise-wide deployment of Predix full-suite offerings anywhere in the world,\" Bolze said. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Bill Rigby) Related Links",

REUTERS/Vincent Kessler/File Photo \nSEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. \nGE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. \nBerkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. \nA branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. \nBit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. \nInternational Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognising voices and making decisions. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) US finalizes rule to limit gas 'flaring' at drilling sites Associated Press - 9 minutes ago The Obama administration is moving to complete rules intended to clamp down on oil companies that burn off natural gas on public lands.

      "title": "GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups",
      "text": "Tweet Share SEATTLE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. GE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. Berkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. A branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. Bit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.

      "text": "General Electric Co. already announced one major acquisition earlier this week with its impressive $915 million buy of ServiceMax Inc. , and now the 124-year-old company has announced not one but two other purchase with its acquisition of machine learning startup Wise.io and data intelligence company Bit Stew Systems .\nWise.io specializes in predictive intelligence , which uses machine learning to anticipate upcoming events. The startup’s technology was initially used by astrophysicists to better understand rare stellar phenomena, but today Wise.io’s platform is used primarily for predicting and dealing with customer support issues. Wise.io’s algorithms anticipate high support request volume and smartly distributes tickets to deal with issues proactively.\nAccording to GE, Wise.io’s technology will be folded into Predix , GE’s cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service that is used for industrial analytics and asset performance management. GE Chief Information Officer says that Wise.io’s machine learning technology will provide an enormous boost to GE’s own work in artificial intelligence for Predix.\nMeanwhile, GE’s other acquisition, Bit Stew, provides a data intelligence platform powered by machine learning, which integrates data between industrial connected devices and external systems. Like Wise.io, Bit Stew’s platform will also be funneled into Predix.\n“We are pleased to welcome Bit Stew to the GE Digital family. The integration of our technologies will provide the Predix platform with a greater capability to integrate data while it is in motion from the edge to the cloud,” said Harel Kodesh , CTO at GE Digital. “This combination will help us to accelerate our industrial offerings, providing customers with contextual understanding of their assets and operations.”\nGE did not reveal how much it paid for Wise.io or Bit Stew, but the Vancouver Sun reported that the acquisition price for Bit Stew was over $207 million. Combined with the recent $915 million it paid for ServiceMax, this shows that GE is serious about beefing up Predix and making it the go-to PaaS for industrial applications.\nPhoto by UpstateNYer – Own work , CC BY-SA 3.0 , Link ",

      "text": "GE is on an IoT buying spree In addition to ServiceMax, it recently bought two startups that could make its Predix platform smarter Related Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 7:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nIt turns out GE Digital’s acquisition of ServiceMax on Monday and its Meridium buy in September weren't the company's only recent moves to expand its industrial IoT expertise. \nTwo deals for small startups, completed recently and announced on Tuesday, add interesting technologies that should help the company develop new capabilities and help enterprises meet challenges in industrial IoT. Both were announced at GE Digital’s Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco and didn’t come with publicly announced price tags. \nIn mid-October, the company bought Wise.io , a startup that GE says can refine machine-learning algorithms through a process like natural selection. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 12 most powerful Internet of Things companies \nIn the industrial world where GE Digital operates, recommendations based on machine learning carry higher stakes than they do on e-commerce sites. Instead of spitting out advice that says you should spend a few dollars on a book, industrial IoT software may recommend removing an engine from an airliner at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. \n“We have to be very low on the false positives and very low on the false negatives,” said Harel Kodesh, CTO of GE Digital and vice president of Predix, the company’s industrial IoT platform. \nThe way it’s done is to run thousands of possible algorithms to figure out which is best for the job. Wise.io specializes in techniques for carrying out that winnowing process quickly and at a relatively low cost, Kodesh said. \nIt’s also developed ways to do this with relatively sparse data sets. That’s useful because industrial systems are highly reliable and don’t generate many examples of how failures happen, he said. That compares with millions of customer histories that an e-commerce site may have to work with in making a product recommendation. \nLast week, GE Digital also bought Bit Stew Systems , a startup that helps to determine what the bits streaming out of an edge device mean. \nWhen devices like sensors start sending data to IoT systems that are supposed to process it, those systems may not know what the bits represent, Kodesh said. In one packet, one set of bits may represent temperature readings, another pressure readings, and so on. \nGE grapples with this problem when it’s developing new products, and it’s often down to trial and error to parse out the data. This can take months. \nBit Stew’s software can do the same thing in half an hour or less, Kodesh said. It does so by using machine learning to generate hypotheses about what different bits represent and then test them out by looking at other bit streams from the same device. GE also plans to use Bit Stew’s machine-learning technology in other ways and take advantage of a lightweight application generation system from the company, he said. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "GE Unveils a Ton of new Predix Products for Industrial IoT \nGE said its new Predix System software architecture and services are designed to add business intelligence to enterprise assets all over the company. GE, spending a ton of marketing dollars in repositioning itself as a new-gen industrial IoT infrastructure provider, made a series of announcements Nov. 15 at its Minds + Machines conference in San Francisco. These include the introduction of an enhanced version of its analytics-based cloud platform, Predix. The huge conglomerate also unveiled a phalanx of new tools, applications, services and solution blueprints in a major effort to stir up interest in the Predix platform among the 19,000 developers expected to be in attendance at the conference this week. GE said it expects 20,000 developers worldwide to be using the platform by year's end. GE said its new Predix System software architecture and services are designed to add business intelligence to enterprise assets and to bring \"visibility, control and analytic insights to every part of industrial infrastructure and operations.\" The company said that this new set of components can run on a variety of operating systems, devices and form factors -- from sensors and controllers to gateways, server appliances and the cloud. New Vertical Solutions Revealed Here is a list of new Predix System-based solutions: -- GE Current is a new solution for digital energy management, designed to analyze and optimize energy use and operational efficiency use across lighting, HVAC and other systems. Restaurant, retail and commercial businesses are using the solution to see exactly where and when energy is being used in real time. The software allows them to do not only historic, but also predictive and prescriptive analytics. Customers already using this tool include McDonald's and Simon Property Group. -- GE Energy Connections unveiled Digital Substation , which extends the maintenance optimization benefits of GE's Asset Performance Management software to the electricity grid. Eight percent of all generated electricity never reaches its intended customer due to grid outages. GE's Digital Substation is designed to enhance the reliability of a critical element of electrical grids and optimize the total use of assets. -- GE Healthcare expanded partnerships in its Health Cloud , including important partnerships in deep learning, collaboration and analytics. Cloud-enabled patient outcomes are linking clinical feedback to transformative radiology pathways. The GE Health Cloud will improve clinical outcomes and productivity, while opening new revenue streams. -- GE Oil & Gas launched Predictive Corrosion Management , a new Asset Performance Management (APM) solution that provides continuous inspection data and cloud-based analytics of pipe conditions to help operators manage corrosion-related risk, improve uptime, and minimize the total cost of operations. Predictive Corrosion Management couples GE's Rightrax PM ultrasonic sensors with the Predix operating system to enable so-called \"digital inspection.\" -- GE Power introduced a new release of its Digital Power Plant software for gas, steam and nuclear plants, which features new tools to help customers reduce unplanned downtime by up to 5 percent, reduce false positive alerts by up to 75 percent, and reduce operations and maintenance costs by up to 25 percent. It also includes software that provides power producers with accurate and timely plant operating capacity information, which energy traders can use to generate incremental revenues. -- GE Renewable Energy introduced the Digital Hydro Plant , a suite of apps combining both software and hardware solutions designed to support Hydro customers globally, helping them get the most out of assets over the lifetime of a plant. The Digital Hydro Plant complements GE's Digital Wind Farm , Digital Power Plant for Gas and Digital Power Plant for Steam , enhancing power generation reliability, efficiency, cybersecurity and profitability -- targeted to reduce maintenance costs by up to 10 percent, increase plant availability by as much as 1 percent and boost revenues by up to 3 percent. New Partners Named GE also revealed a list of new internet service provider partners. Inaugural launch partners include Box, Decisyon App Composer, Entercoms, Ericsson, Mobideo, Nurego, OAG Analytics, Pitney Bowes and Splunk. The addition of ISVs enhances the growing ranks of the GE Digital Alliance Program, which launched in February. The alliance program now lists more than 270 partners around the world, including major enterprise players such as AT&T, EY, Intel, Microsoft and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Two New Acquisitions GE Digital also announced a couple of acquisitions: Wise.io, a leading machine learning and intelligent systems company, and Bit Stew, which adds new data intelligence capabilities. Wise.io will enable GE Digital to further accelerate development of advanced machine learning and data science offerings in the Predix platform. The Wise.io team deepens GE's machine learning stack and will spearhead innovative solutions in GE's vertical markets to develop its machine learning offerings. Current Wise.io customers include Pinterest, Twilio and Thumbtack. Bit Stew will provide improved ability to integrate data while it is in motion -- from the edge to the cloud -- and will allow industrial companies to gain better insight into data coming from the edge. This combined capability provides customers with a solution to efficiently organize large amounts of data at the source, enabling more rapid realization of Industrial Internet value. \nChris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK.

      "text": "GE Expands Predix Platform to Advance Industrial Internet Opportunities for Customers [November 15, 2016] Tweet \nToday at Minds + Machines, GE (NYSE:GE) announced new products, acquisitions and partner programs to enable further adoption of Predix, the operating system for the Industrial Internet. The platform enhancements, acquisitions and new ISV partner program further complement the Predix technology stack and make it easier for industrial companies to execute a strategic digital transformation to drive internal productivity. In 2016, orders from GE's portfolio of software solutions are on track to climb 25%+ to more than $7 billion - making GE the fastest growing digital industrial company in the world. Demonstrating the strength of Predix within GE, digital thread productivity will exceed $600 million, accelerating into 2017. \n\"The opportunity for industry is now,\" said Bill Ruh, Chief Digital Officer of GE and CEO, GE Digital. \"The Industrial Internet is profoundly transforming how we operate and our ability to deliver greater productivity for GE and for our customers. Connected machines, coupled with deep machine learning, are more powerful than anything we have seen. These strategic investments in both the Predix platform and our partners continue to attract industrial companies and provide them with tools they need to embark on their own digital industrial transformations.\" \nEXTENDING PREDIX FROM THE EDGE TO THE CLOUD \nMore than 19,000 developers are building on Predix today, after GE opened the platform to global customers earlier this year. GE expects 20,000 developers working on the platform by year-end. To service this growing segment of the ecosystem, as well as the hundreds of industrial businesses already using Predix, GE unveiled a new suite of software and applications designed to get Predix in the hands of operators, business analysts and other users in non-technical roles. \nThis new release will focus on expanding the platform and scaling development of Digital Twins - virtual representations of the billions of physical assets that comprise the world's industrial infrastructure - through Predix apps and toolkits. It also aims to grow the developer community by building better tools for software engineers within GE's industrial customer base and extend the cloud to the edge - or to the machines. \nThe cloud plays an essential role in enabling industrial companies to cost-effectively store and process massive amounts of data to fulfill their vision for the Industrial Internet. But the cloud often offers low latency. Sending data to the cloud and bringing it back to the edge is inefficient for making real-time decisions, which limits customers' ability to optimize their assets and operations. They need the capability to put analytics at the edge, on any device or machine. \nToday, GE unveiled the Predix System™ - software architecture and services designed to make any machine an intelligent asset and to bring visibility, control and analytic insights to every part of industrial infrastructure and operations. This new set of components can run on a variety of operating systems, devices and form factors - from sensors and controllers to gateways, server appliances and the cloud - making Predix a distributed system for the Industrial Internet and a complete \"edge-to-cloud\" offering. \nThis strategy reinforces GE's approach to the edge and incorporates other GE devices, such as Field Agent, a component of GE's Industrial Internet Control System (IICS ( News - Alert )). IICS quickly, reliably and securely connects thousands of machines to the cloud, bringing computing to the edge with 100 times the computing power of a standard control system. \nIn addition to updates to the platform, GE also launched new Predix-based solutions, designed to help customers harness the power of the Industrial Internet: Current, powered by GE introduced a new solution for digital energy management, designed to analyze and optimize energy use and operational efficiency use across lighting, HVAC and other systems. Restaurant, retail and commercial businesses are using the solution to see exactly where and when energy is being used in real time. The powerful software allows them to do not only historic, but also predictive and prescriptive analytics. Customers already using this tool include McDonald's and Simon Property Group. GE Energy Connections unveiled Digital Substation, which extends the maintenance optimization benefits of GE's Asset Performance Management software to the electricity grid. Eight percent of all generated electricity never reaches its intended customer due to grid outages. GE's Digital Substation is designed to enhance the reliability of a critical element of electrical grids and optimize the total use of assets. GE Healthcare expanded partnerships in its Health Cloud, including important partnerships in deep learning, collaboration and analytics. Cloud-enabled patient outcomes are linking clinical feedback to transformative radiology pathways. The GE Health Cloud will improve clinical outcomes and productivity, while opening new revenue streams. GE Oil & Gas launched Predictive Corrosion Management, a new Asset Performance Management (APM) solution that provides continuous inspection data and cloud-based analytics of pipe conditions to help operators manage corrosion-related risk, improve uptime, and minimize the total cost of operations. Predictive Corrosion Management couples GE's Rightrax PM ultrasonic sensors with the Predix operating system to enable \"digital inspection.\" GE Power introduced a new release of its Digital Power Plant software for gas, steam and nuclear plants, which features new tools to help customers reduce unplanned downtime by up to 5%, reduce false positive alerts by up to 75%, and reduce operations and maintenance costs by up to 25%. It also includes software that provides power producers with accurate and timely plant operating capacity information, which energy traders can use to generate incremental revenues. GE Renewable Energy introduced the Digital Hydro Plant, a suite of apps combining both software and hardware solutions designed to support Hydro customers globally, helping them get the most out of assets over the lifetime of a plant. The Digital Hydro Plant complements GE's Digital Wind Farm, Digitl Power Plant for Gas and Digital Power Plant for Steam, enhancing power generation reliability, efficiency, cybersecurity and profitability - targeted to reduce maintenance costs by up to 10%, increase plant availability by as much as 1% and boost revenues by up to 3%. ACQUISITIONS OF BIT STEW SYSTEMS, WISE.IO ACCELERATE DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION \nGE Digital announced it has acquired Bit Stew Systems to bring its data intelligence capabilities to Predix and other industrial solutions. Bit Stew applies its machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to automate the process of data modeling, mapping and ingestion, accelerating time to value for customers, such as BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric and Scottish & Southern Energy. This acquisition will help GE Digital provide a solution to organize large amounts of data through efficient data organization at the edge or at the source of the data - the asset. \nIntegration of Bit Stew's technologies into the Predix platform will provide improved ability to integrate data while it is in motion - from the edge to the cloud - and will allow industrial companies to gain better insight into data coming from the edge. This combined capability provides customers with a solution to efficiently organize large amounts of data at the source, enabling more rapid realization of Industrial Internet value. \nGE Digital also acquired Wise.io , a leading machine learning and intelligent systems company. This acquisition will enable GE Digital to further accelerate development of advanced machine learning and data science offerings in the Predix platform. The Wise.io team deepens GE's machine learning stack and will spearhead innovative solutions in GE's vertical markets to develop its machine learning offerings. Current Wise.io customers include Pinterest, Twilio and Thumbtack. \nIndustrial machine learning is critical to GE's development of scalable Digital Twin solutions and data-intensive industrial computing challenges. Running on Predix, Digital Twins are virtual twins of an industrial asset - a jet engine, a wind turbine or an entire power plant. Twins continuously collect data from physical and virtual sensors and rely on advanced machine learning techniques to analyze the data to gain insights about performance and operation. Wise.io's deep machine learning expertise - combined with GE Digital's existing data science talent and massive portfolio of industrial assets - will advance GE's Digital Twin capabilities and solidify its role as a leader in industrial machine learning. \nThis news follow GE's recent acquisition of ServiceMax , a leader in cloud-based field service management solutions, which enables GE Digital customers to immediately gain more productivity from their assets and find greater efficiency in their field service processes. Other GE acquisitions in the digital industrial space include Meridium and Wurldtech . \nGROWING THE DIGITAL INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEM \nThe expansion of products and services for the Industrial Internet mirrors the increasing number of global businesses contributing to the growth of the digital industrial ecosystem. \nGE also announced a program dedicated to independent software vendors (ISVs), aimed at spurring development of industrial solutions and extending the reach of the Predix platform. Through these partnerships, GE will share its industry expertise and allow partners to use Predix as the building block for new industrial applications to enhance various components of industrial operations - such as maintenance, content development and asset management. Ultimately, customers will have greater access to these new solutions and will more quickly see outcomes, enabled by the cloud. \nNo platform has been successful without involvement from ISVs-they are a force multiplier and provide a new stream of revenue for GE. Inaugural launch partners include: Box, Decisyon App Composer, Entercoms, Ericsson ( News - Alert ), Mobideo, Nurego, OAG Analytics, Pitney Bowes and Splunk. The addition of ISVs enhances the growing ranks of the GE Digital Alliance Program, which launched in February. The alliance program now boasts more than 270 partners around the world, including major enterprise players such as AT&T, EY, Intel, Microsoft ( News - Alert ) and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). \nTo further expand the digital industrial ecosystem, GE Digital also opened two foundries in 2016 in Paris and Shanghai, in addition to its flagship foundry in San Ramon, Calif. The foundries comprise a global network of sites where GE Digital incubates Industrial Internet startup companies, collaborates with customers on new application development, and works to extend and promote GE's international developer ecosystem. \nGE Digital's footprint grew in the U.S. as well, opening new IT sites in Atlanta, Miami and Providence that serve as technology hubs, global IT operations and application development centers. GE Digital will also expand its San Ramon headquarters to 350,000 square feet to accommodate the fast-growing organization. GE Digital will have a global network of 11 foundries and six additional centers by 2020. \nCUSTOMER ADOPTION OF PREDIX APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES \nPredix is the foundation of the industrial app economy, an ecosystem of software and services that allow businesses to use data and analytics to improve operations, increase productivity and drive new revenue streams.

      "text": "There’s no greater indication of industrial behemoth General Electric’s desire to morph into a Silicon Valley software company than its annual technology conference.\nDuring the company’s two-day show in San Francisco on Tuesday morning, GE’s CEO Jeff Immelt took the stage and asked the audience “Why not us. . . Why can’t we make ourselves into a digital company?”\nThe company is “all in,” Immelt says, on crafting itself in the image of a tech and computing disruptor, which includes becoming a “top 10” software company by 2020.\nTo achieve this goal, GE is investing heavily in building software and wireless capability to connect machines like wind turbines, trains, and jet engines. But it’s also buying the latest algorithms and machine learning know-how to better monitor and control those machines.\nFor more on GE’s CEO Jeff Immelt on his biggest mistakes watch our video. \nIn true Silicon Valley-style on Tuesday, GE announced that it had acquired two artificial intelligence startups, Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io. The move will enable GE to compete with IBM’s own artificial intelligent Watson product that can help customers make predictions and answer questions.\nGE has acquired about $2 billion worth of tech startups over the last several years, including more recently cloud company ServiceMax and analytics company Meridium .\nTech conferences are de rigueur for the biggest San Francisco area Internet companies like Facebook, Salesforce , Google , and Apple . GE’s has the same bells and whistles including keynotes meant to inspire and slick visual presentations.\nGE’s Immelt focused a lot on the term productivity in his kick-off speech. Essentially the type of technology used is irrelevant, but rather it’s whether GE’s customers like oil giant BP want to buy and use GE’s software to make their operations more productive.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nSome are starting to. Customers like BP are going through their own disruption, as BP’s Ahmed Hashmi said shortly after Immelt’s talk. “Our industry needs a transformation, and digital is our biggest lever,” said Hashmi.\nGE calls its transformation the “industrial Internet,” and it’s a way that it can keep its machines connected, smart, updated and increasingly productive. A major investment to connect these machines is GE’s Predix software , which extracts and crunches data from machines and uses that data to make them more efficiently, saving GE's customers money, time, and energy.\nOver the last year, GE launched Predix externally to its customers, and before that the company was using it internally. GE also launched an energy efficiency system called Current and is investing in additive manufacturing, commonly called 3D printing.\nGE hopes that its overall annual software sales, which includes sales of Predix, will grow from $5 billion in 2015 to $15 billion by 2020.\nAt the end of the day, using software and wireless connections to make machines more productive is all about combining physics and analytics, said Immelt. “The merger of physics and the digital world will lead the future,” he added.\nFor GE, it’s a huge investment. But it is also somewhat of a risk. This is a “transformation not a task,” and an “all-encompassing change,” said Immelt.",

      "title": "BP, GE launch offshore big-data system starting with Atlantis in gulf",
      "text": "BP, GE launch offshore big-data system starting with Atlantis in gulf HOUSTON, Nov. 15 By Paula Dittrick OGJ Upstream Technology Editor \nBP PLC and GE have announced the startup of Plant Operations Advisor (POA), a big-data digital system designed to improve the efficiency, reliability, and safety of BP’s oil and gas production operations offshore. The pilot started with Atlantis oil and natural gas field in the Gulf of Mexico. \nThe POA system is expected to be deployed next year to other BP offshore platforms around the world, said Matthias Heilman, GE chief digital officer. The tool was created as part of a development partnership that BP and GE announced in January. \nAfter finetuning algorisms, Heilman said BP anticipates deploying POA to one platform each month until all of its platforms adopt the technology. \nDuring a telephone interview with OGJ, Heilman said it’s possible the digital technology concept could be expanded to include onshore drilling and production sites as well as downstream equipment if clients wanted to do that. \nBP operates Atlantis field in the deepwater gulf, in 4,400-7,100 ft of water 130 miles offshore Louisiana ( OGJ Online, Dec. 20, 2007 ). Atlantis was developed using a semisubmersible. The field comprises five blocks: Green Canyon 699, 700, 742, 743, and 744. \nLorenzo Simonelli, GE Oil & Gas president and chief executive officer, said GE and BP have taken “a big step forward together during this time of digital transformation…to drive the kind of productivity improvements that the oil and gas industry needs.” [Native Advertisement] \nPOA will help prevent unplanned downtime and improve platform reliability by helping process engineering teams respond quickly to analytical reports. GE made the announcement during its Minds + Machines event in San Francisco. \nAhmed Hashmi, BP’s head of upstream technology, said, “When fully deployed, these advanced digital technologies will change the way we work and improve the integrity and performance of our assets around the globe.” \nThe system provides simplified access to various real-time data feeds and includes visualization capabilities. It also includes case-management capability to support learning from previous operational issues. \nGE said its technology combines big data, cloud hosting, and analytics on both individual pieces of equipment and entire production systems. Heilman said BP is the only client that is discussing POA so far but that GE is talking with other clients about similar technology in Russia, China, and the Middle East. \nContact Paula Dittrick at . \nSponsored Content is made possible by our sponsor; it does not necessarily reflect the views of our editorial staff.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO - November 15, 2016 – BP (NYSE: BP) and GE (NYSE: GE) today announced the start-up of Plant Operations Advisor (POA), a new digital solution designed to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of BP’s oil and gas production operations. Plant Operations Advisor is already helping BP manage the performance of one of its platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and, subject to a successful pilot, it will be deployed next year to other BP facilities around the world. The tool, built on GE’s Predix operating system, was created as part of a development partnership the two companies announced in January. “ BP gravitates toward new technologies, especially digital, and that makes working with them particularly exciting, ” said Lorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO, GE Oil & Gas. “We are taking a big step forward together during this time of digital transformation, deploying what we’ve co-created over the past year to drive the kind of productivity improvements that the oil and gas industry needs. The global deployment is expected to be the largest-scale deployment of GE’s Predix-powered APM technology to date.” Plant Operations Advisor will help prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability by helping engineering teams respond quickly to issues as they occur in real-time. “By bringing together some of the best minds at GE and BP, we were able to develop this innovative digital product and are confident that it will have a significant impact on our business,” said Ahmed Hashmi, BP’s Head of Upstream Technology. “When fully deployed, these advanced digital technologies will change the way we work and improve the integrity and performance of our assets around the globe.” Using GE’s Predix and Asset Performance Management (APM) capabilities, POA rapidly integrates operational data from producing oil and gas facilities to deliver notifications and analytical reports to engineers so they can identify operational performance issues before they become significant. The system provides simplified access to a variety of live data feeds and includes visualization capabilities including a real-time facility threat display. It also incorporates an extensive case management capability to support learnings from prior operational issues. GE intends to offer this technology, which combines big data, cloud hosting, and analytics on both individual pieces of equipment as well as the entire production system, as an APM solution that will be available to the industry. ### About BP : Over the past 10 years, BP has invested more than $90 billion in the U.S. – more than any other energy company. BP is a leading producer of oil and gas and produces enough energy annually to light nearly the entire country for a year.

      "text": "Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) CEO and chairman of the board, sat down for an interview with CNBC to talk about new trade agreements that could be implemented by President-elect Donald Trump. What A Trump Presidency Could Mean \nImmelt pointed out that Trump is far from the first person to talk about returning to the drawing board and coming up with new trade deals and agreements. He added that it remains to be seen what exactly Trump and his administration will propose, but according to Immelt, General Electric can \"navigate the world on our own.\" \nImmelt continued that General Electric is a global company operating in 190 countries and does so from a local standpoint. \n\"I believe in trade deals but we don't need trade deals in GE,\" Immelt said. \"I think what President Trump will learn is that as he travels the world, trade deals gives [ sic ] him power. The ability to use trade as an economic negotiating technique makes him powerful.\" Trump And Deal-Making \nImmelt noted that during Trump's presidency, unless he has trade deals with many countries, he may lose a large chunk of his negotiating power. If anyone should understand this concept, it's Trump — who championed himself as a superb deal-maker. \nImmelt also had some encouraging words to describe Trump based on prior relationships when General Electric owned NBC and Trump was the star of the reality show \"The Apprentice.\" \n\"This is a guy that's a competitor; he wants to win,\" Immelt said. \"And I always found him in one-on-one sessions to be a listener and a guy that wanted to do good work.\" Some Speculative Specifics \nFinally, Immelt offered his take of what specific policies could be implemented as part of Trump's vision to increase jobs at home. The policies include: 1) tax reform, 2) the ability to invest better, 3) better roads and ports, 4) organizations like import/export banks. \nImage Credit: By WRI Staff [CC BY 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Tweet Share The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company General Electric is shown at their subsidiary company GE Aviation in Santa Ana, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo More SEATTLE (Reuters) - General Electric said on Tuesday it has acquired two tech startups to build its artificial intelligence capability, a move that helps it compete with IBM's Watson product. GE said the acquisitions of Bit Stew Systems and Wise.io will expand its Predix platform for industrial internet applications, which connects big machines such as power plants and aircraft engines to databases and analytical software. Terms of the deals weren't disclosed. Berkley, California-based Wise.io has advanced machine learning technology that GE sees \"as really well-built for the industrial world\", Bill Ruh, chief executive officer of GE Digital, GE's software arm, said in an interview. A branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning allows computers to adapt to new data without new programming. Bit Stew, based in Vancouver, B.C., is partly backed by GE's venture capital arm. It applies machine learning to large data sets associated with utilities, aviation, oil and gas production and manufacturing, according to the company's web site. International Business Machines Corp's (IBM) Watson business is among the better known artificial intelligence systems, which enable computers to perform intelligent actions such as recognizing voices and making decisions.

      "text": "Markets Today General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt Says Trump's 'Biggest Task' Is U.S. Capital Investment Productivity in the U.S. has 'stunk' in the U.S. for the past decade, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt said on CNBC. Natalie Walters Nov15,20161:23PMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- President-elect Donald Trump's \"biggest task\" is investing back in the U.S. economy, General Electric ( GE ) CEO Jeff Immelt said on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" on Tuesday morning. \n\"The real missing gap has been productivity so we've got to get some investment back into the U.S. economy, some capital investment, which has really been lacking since the financial crisis,\" he said. \nTrump seems willing to put investments back into the country's economy in a \"number of different ways,\" which is partly why we've seen favorable reactions in the market, he noted. \"You see bond prices going up and investor enthusiasm, maybe a little bit of relief for the banks which I think is a good thing.\" \n\"What pillar would be most effective to help with investing back in the economy?\" CNBC's Carl Quintanilla asked. \nWhile Trump's plans to spend on new infrastructure would create new jobs and increase productivity, tax reform seems to be the \"missing ingredient that can help drive some of the capital investment back,\" Immelt answered. \"That's the difference between a 3% GDP growth of the U.S. and a 2% GDP growth.\" \nIf the president could \"just solve a few things in the U.S.,\" then we would find there's \"lots of pent-up demand and opportunities for growth,\" Immelt claimed. \nShares of General Electric were lower in early afternoon trading on Tuesday. \n(GE is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS. See all of Cramer's holdings with a free trial .) \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) CEO and chairman of the board, sat down for an interview with CNBC to talk about new trade agreements that could be implemented by President-elect Donald Trump. What A Trump Presidency Could Mean \nImmelt pointed out that Trump is far from the first person to talk about returning to the drawing board and coming up with new trade deals and agreements. He added that it remains to be seen what exactly Trump and his administration will propose, but according to Immelt, General Electric can \"navigate the world on our own.\" \nImmelt continued that General Electric is a global company operating in 190 countries and does so from a local standpoint. \n\"I believe in trade deals but we don't need trade deals in GE,\" Immelt said. \"I think what President Trump will learn is that as he travels the world, trade deals gives [ sic ] him power. The ability to use trade as an economic negotiating technique makes him powerful.\" Trump And Deal-Making \nImmelt noted that during Trump's presidency, unless he has trade deals with many countries, he may lose a large chunk of his negotiating power. If anyone should understand this concept, it's Trump — who championed himself as a superb deal-maker. \nImmelt also had some encouraging words to describe Trump based on prior relationships when General Electric owned NBC and Trump was the star of the reality show \"The Apprentice.\" \n\"This is a guy that's a competitor; he wants to win,\" Immelt said. \"And I always found him in one-on-one sessions to be a listener and a guy that wanted to do good work.\" Some Speculative Specifics \nFinally, Immelt offered his take of what specific policies could be implemented as part of Trump's vision to increase jobs at home. The policies include: 1) tax reform, 2) the ability to invest better, 3) better roads and ports, 4) organizations like import/export banks. \nImage Credit: By WRI Staff [CC BY 2.0],   ©  ",

      "title": "Teledyne Controls and GE Aviation Sign Agreement to Enable More Effective Engine Maintenance Operation",
      "text": "Share SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Teledyne Controls, the world’s leading provider of wireless data acquisition and management technology*, and GE Aviation have signed a strategic Digital Alliance partnership to transform engine health monitoring by using GE’s Predix platform to apply data and analytics on continuous flight data wirelessly collected by Teledyne’s technology. Willie Cecil, director of Business Development, Wireless and Data Automation Solutions at Teledyne Controls says that predictive maintenance for aircraft is being taken to a completely different level for operators: “Until now, health monitoring has been limited because it has been performed using only a few hundred bytes of data sent from the aircraft via ACARS, which is fairly expensive and has limited bandwidth. “Using Teledyne’s GroundLink® patented technology, which leverages higher bandwidth and less expensive cellular wireless networks, several megabytes per flight hour of continuous data can be made available for engine analytics.” John Nelson, data product manager for GE Aviation, notes the flow of richer, continuous data enables insights into asset condition not previously possible: “Applying physics and data science expertise together, on continuous data, is the recipe to create analytics that enable increased detection lead time, reduce maintenance burden and improve asset availability. “The partnership between Teledyne Controls and GE will benefit our customers by simplifying the flow of commercial aircraft flight data to GE’s Predix platform, and enrich the data at speeds and scale enabled by industrial internet technologies.” The new partnership was formally announced at the GE Minds and Machines event in San Francisco on 15/16 November. GE is connecting data, developers and Predix, the world’s first and only cloud-based operating system built exclusively for industry. Predix is powering innovative Industrial Internet apps that turn operational data into insight for better and faster decision making. Headquartered in Southern California, Teledyne Controls LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated ( TDY ). Teledyne Controls is a leading manufacturer and innovator of a wide range of data management solutions designed to help aircraft operators collect, analyze and distribute aircraft data more efficiently. Teledyne Controls maintains worldwide facilities and a global network of field representatives to support its many airline, airframe, and military customers. Additional information about Teledyne Controls can be found at http://www.teledynecontrols.com .

      "text": "Why Investors Should Pay Attention to GE’s ServiceMax Acquisition PART 2 OF 2 How Useful Will ServiceMax Be in GE Digital’s Industrial Internet Vision? By Samuel Prince | Nov 15, 2016 9:51 am EST GE’s Predix platform \nGeneral Electric’s ( GE ) Predix platform is a cloud-based operating system that combines services including storage, computing, and security with the ability to handle objects and analyze them. With Predix, the industrial Internet can apply a range of technology to solve problems in improving asset performance, asset costs, and asset operations across the spectrum of the industrial complex. The ServiceMax deal rationale \nIn a nutshell, ServiceMax’s complementary capabilities would help GE Digital develop and expedite the commercialization of its Predix applications. The purchase would enable GE Digital to service products through a single and solid platform, and GE expects to cater to the service needs of businesses throughout the service delivery process. The acquisition should also offer the quintessential expertise and technologies required to propel GE Digital’s current services solutions roadmaps. ServiceMax: a catalyst for the industrial Internet \nGE has lately been speeding up its productivity improvements through digitizing service processes, and the company expects to boost internal productivity with the ServiceMax’s offerings. With this acquisition, the Boston-headquartered industrial giant aims to add analytics and insights to ServiceMax’s logistics, workforce optimization, and deployment models. According to a GE estimate, improvements in service productivity could amount to $25 billion through the use of analytical tools. \nServiceMax’s platform offers a comprehensive suite of applications, including inventory and parts logistics, scheduling and workforce optimization, and work order management. The ServiceMax transaction would thus enable GE’s customers to utilize these offerings from a state-of-the-art application development cloud and field-ready mobile platform. \nThis application development cloud and mobile platform are expected to integrate GE’s deep domain expertise and superior industrial portfolio with ServiceMax’s field service expertise. The industrial heavyweight meanwhile hopes to leverage its Predix platform to boost the development of its other industrial applications that focus on service delivery. ETF investment \nOn November 14, 2016, GE’s stock slipped 0.7% and closed at $30.5. Year-to-date, the company’s shares have fallen 2%, whereas the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY ) has risen 6.2%. Apart from GE, SPY also has holdings in big industrial companies like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B), 3M Company ( MMM ), Honeywell International ( HON ), and Boeing. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"HON\",\"GE\",\"SPY\",\"MMM\",\"BRK-B\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Honeywell International Inc.\",\"General Electric Company\",\"SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\",\"3M Co\",\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\"]} X",

      "text": "GE Buys Bit Stew for $153M to Beef Up Its Industrial Internet Software \nGE continues its buying spree. by Katherine Tweed \nGE continues its buying spree. by Katherine Tweed 0 \nGeneral Electric continues its unrelenting buying spree as it looks to redefine itself as a software company while also making enormous investments in its core businesses. \nOn Tuesday, GE paid a reported $153 million for Bit Stew, according to Canadian news sources . Bit Stew provides an advanced data integration platform that was first built for the utility industry, but now supports manufacturing, aviation and oil and gas. \nThe British Columbia-based Bit Stew has had GE’s attention for more than a year. GE Ventures led Bit Stew’s $17 million Series B round in May 2015. It has raised a total of about $26 million from investors including GE Ventures, Yaletown Partners, Kensington Capital Partners, Cisco Investments and BDC Venture Capital. \n“The fact that GE is the acquirer here comes as no surprise, given GE's sustained venture support for Bit Stew over the past 18 months,” said Andrew Mulherkar, grid edge analyst with GTM Research. “Over this period, Bit Stew expanded from its roots in the utility industry into oil and gas, aviation and manufacturing -- all key industries where GE has a strong presence and strategic focus.” \nThe acquisition of Bit Stew, however, is not even GE’s largest purchase in the first half of this week. On Monday, GE announced it acquired ServiceMax , a provider of cloud-based field service management software, for $915 million. \nBoth acquisitions fit in with GE’s focus on its industrial internet platform, Predix. They also dovetail with GE’s recent bet on the recovery of the oil and gas industry after its merger with oil services giant Baker Hughes , which will create a $32 billion company. \nFor example, Bit Stew’s platform was able to model, index and map an oil and gas data set in less than one day -- a project that Bit Stew said would traditionally take about six man months. \n“We are disrupting traditional approaches for integrating industrial data leading to time to value benefit never seen before in the Industrial Internet,” Alex Clark, founder and chief software architect for Bit Stew, said in a statement. \nAlthough the oil and gas sector will likely be a focus for Bit Stew, energy companies of all stripes are facing challenges related to complex data integration. Bit Stew started with the utility industry, where it helped utilities such as BC Hydro manage devices at the grid edge, such as smart meters and sensors. \nA report earlier this year from GTM Research forecasted that utilities will spend about $10 billion globally on advanced metering analytics solutions and integration services through 2021, a significant increase over spending in the past five years. \nThe opportunity goes far beyond smart meter integration, however. GE aligned its grid and power business with Alstom in 2014 in a $13 billion deal. Bit Stew’s software will compliment GE and Alstom's grid management offerings for utilities looking to digitize operations. \nThe platform vastly reduces the integration time for new data streams. It can also operate across a utility’s territory and down to the grid edge, a feature that is not necessary for all utilities today but will be in the near future. Mulherkar noted that Bit Stew is serving as the core platform for PG&E's Grid Operations Situational Intelligence project. \nBit Stew already has offices in the U.S., Australia and Europe. Joining GE will allow it to scale faster across the globe, with a focus on utilities that are investing heavily in transforming their grid to meet a changing power mix. \nGreentech Media named Bit Stew to its Grid Edge 20 list last year , in recognition of the work it’s doing to help utilities manage and control the intelligent sensors, rooftop solar systems, behind-the-meter batteries, real-time demand response platforms and other distributed technologies that are becoming an increasingly integral part of the world’s energy supply.",

      "text": "Share By Alwyn Scott SEATTLE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Electric Co has signed up U.S. energy utility Exelon Corp to use its full software set to analyze and manage power plants in 48 states, the largest GE deployment in the power sector so far, the companies said on Tuesday. The Exelon deal, aimed at wringing greater efficiency from the business of generating electricity, marks another advance in GE's effort to lift annual digital technology revenue to $14 billion in 2020 from $5 billion in 2015, across its many industrial products. It also is one of the three largest sales of GE's Predix industrial operating system so far. Exelon has nuclear, wind and fossil fuel-powered plants. The companies did not disclose the value of Exelon's five-year contract with GE. In initial uses, GE's technology has increased power plant efficiency by 3 percent and reliability by 5 percent, while cutting operating and maintenance costs 25 percent, said Steve Bolze, chief executive of GE Power. Exelon's deployment is nearly six times larger than the previous largest GE deal, signed last month with the New York Power Authority and covering 16 power plants in New York state that generate about 5,600 megawatts. Chicago-based Exelon will use GE's Predix software and applications across its 91 power plants, which produce 32,700 megawatts and supply more than 10 million customers, the companies said. Exelon will also use GE software that analyzes the company's business performance and profitability, something NYPA didn't choose, GE said. GE and Exelon also agreed to work together on new Predix-based software applications. GE's power business accounts for 40 percent of GE's digital revenue, said Bolze. About $400 million a year is produced by GE Power's software business, and that revenue is growing by 50 percent a year, he added. Exelon's agreement follows four pilot projects over the past year and is GE's \"first and largest IoT (internet of things) enterprise-wide deployment of Predix full-suite offerings anywhere in the world,\" Bolze said.

      "text": "By: Current, powered by GE via PR Newswire  44 PM EST The Killer App to Slash Inefficiency: Current, powered by GE Unveils Digital Energy Management System to Optimize Customer Operations \nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Current, powered by GE ( NYSE: GE ) today introduced a new digital energy management solution for commercial and industrial facilities. The new tool, which is built on Predix*, GE's operating system for the Industrial Internet, is already being used by national customers including McDonald's and Simon Property Group. From lighting to HVAC systems, restaurants, retailers, warehouses and commercial businesses can use the solution to see exactly where and when energy is being used in real time, while powerful software enables not only historic, but also predictive and prescriptive analytics. \n\"This tool is a perfect example of the optimization enabled through the power of the Industrial Internet,\" said Maryrose Sylvester , President & CEO of Current, powered by GE. \"Energy is one of the largest overhead costs to any business, and customers are looking for a holistic, simple way to manage energy smarter. As we integrate sensors and software across systems, businesses can transform the way they see and optimize not only their energy use, but also their operational productivity.\" \nIncreasingly, entities are seeing the benefits of building automation and are seeking out connectivity. Current, which acquired controls provider Daintree Networks earlier this year , is integrating intelligence via infrastructure like LEDs, and its new app harnesses the power of data beyond energy savings. \nCustomers across a variety of industries are already realizing the energy-saving potential of this intelligent app, with pilot installations for customers already underway. \n\"At McDonald's, we aspire to deliver exceptional service for both our internal and external customers. We are always interested in technologies that can improve our capabilities and operational KPIs while enhancing the customer experience,\" said James Floyd , V.P.- U.S. Operations, McDonald's Corporation. \"Current's EMS tool provides actionable analytics around energy use, but also offers insights into additional dimensions that enhance our customers experience. This intelligence provides infinite possibilities that include optimizing labor, reducing operational tension and improving overall efficiencies and effectiveness at the restaurants, all while creating sustainable, profitable growth. By benchmarking 'Best in Class' companies like GE and Current, we generate thinking that leads to new growth and provides us a competitive advantage in the industry.\" \nThe new energy management software is also being piloted with Simon Property Group, a global leader in retail real estate ownership, management and development for shopping malls retail properties across the U.S. \n\"This connected, real-time view of how, when and where energy is being used enables our site managers to take actions to reduce and shift energy away from the grid during peak periods, saving significant monthly costs,\" said Michael Romstad , Executive Vice President of Property Management for Simon Property Group. \"We've already installed efficient solutions such as LEDs at several Simon properties, which are providing significant energy savings and significantly better lighting levels. We estimate the energy management solution will help us reduce consumption across the board at The Westchester mall by about 20 percent.\" \nThe intelligent energy application was introduced during Minds + Machines, GE's premier event for the digital industrial sector.
