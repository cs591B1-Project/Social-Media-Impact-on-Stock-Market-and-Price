      "text": "November 21, 2016 | 09:27AM PT \nDave Chappelle has cut a deal with Netflix for three new comedy specials. \nThe projects will mark his first standup TV specials in 12 years. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s VP of original documentary and comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nThe deal calls for Chappelle and director Stan Lathan to produce an original special for Netflix. Two other unreleased projects will come from Chappelle’s vault — one produced out of the Austin City Limits venue, the other from a performance at the Hollywood Palladium. \nThe projects from the vault are set for release simultaneously next year. There’s no premiere date yet for the new special. Filed Under:",

      "text": "All Stories \nStart stockpiling Pop-Tarts and get that bottomless pot of coffee brewing: We're just days away from the premiere of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix's revival of the beloved early-2000's dramedy. (The streaming service is dropping all four episodes on November 25th.) The original series introduced us to the fast-talking, java-addicted Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her 16-year-old brainiac daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), and a colorful cast of characters in the fictional Connecticut hamlet of Stars Hollow. Related PHOTOS: 25 Most Anticipated TV Shows of 2016 From true-crime recreations to the return of 'Game of Thrones,' here's what we can't wait to watch this year \nAll things considered, the CW show could have been a forgettable mess, considering it premiered during a period when teen dramas like The O.C., 7th Heaven and Everwood, to name a few, were all the rage. But thanks to creator Amy Sherman-Palladino (who'd previously written for Roseanne, among other sitcoms), we got something far richer, deeper and dialogue-wise, a lot faster. The characters were funny and relatable, the banter was zinger-heavy, the familial drama was poignant and the romantic chemistry, notably between Lorelai and the local diner owner/her caffeine addiction enabler Luke (Scott Patterson), was off the charts. \nThe show ended in 2007 after an underwhelming final season, by which time Sherman-Palladino had left. But thanks to its very dedicated fans, the cast and creators never gave up on bringing it back. A Year in the Life will be made up of four episodes, one for each season of the year, and will follow Lorelai and Rory as they navigate their loves, losses, and everything in between. If you don't know your Patty from your Paris – or you just need a refresher on all things Gilmore – here is everything you need to know about the reboot. \nWhy This Is Such a Big Deal Gilmore Girls came from an idea that Sherman-Palladino pitched to executives from the WB on a whim: a TV show about a mother and a daughter who are best friends. But that off-the-cuff pitch led to a show that was witty, big-hearted, and full of quirky characters – a rarity in early-aughts dramedies geared toward teens. (Seriously, could you see Kirk existing on Dawson's Creek ?) She had exited the show before its final season, so for fans who've wanted to see the show head into the sunset the way that it should, this is indeed huge. \nA Chance to Get the Ending Right So about that last season: Sherman-Palladino was in charge of nearly every aspect of the show – writing, producing, even directing episodes – for the first six years it was on the air. She famously knew the story arc down to the last four words (more on the later). And the series reflected her own passions: Musicians like Carole King (who sang the theme song) and Yo La Tengo made cameos, and the fast-paced dialogue was riddled with obscure pop culture references. But after contract negotiations for the final season fell apart, the showrunner left, and Season Seven was completed by other writers. It's generally regarded as the show's worst go-round, mainly because it lacked its creator's voice and vision. (She admits to having never watched it.) Now, fans will see an ending envisioned by the mastermind herself – though she did tell TVLine that \"We had to pick [the characters] up where they left off,\" so elements from that season will be included. \nThank the Fandom for the Reboot Netflix may be airing the new series, but the show's extremely dedicated fans are really to thank for getting the idea of a revival on the table. A cast reunion at the 2015 ATX Festival in Austin, Texas proved just how many people were still dedicated to the series, which got everyone – the creators, cast, and Netflix – on board. \"We realized that there was a new audience for the show,\" Sherman-Palladino said earlier this year. \"And we thought, 'Well, now that Netflix exists, maybe [it's] time to talk about how we would do [a new series].'\" But the fandom doesn't stop with Instagram accounts and podcasts : In October, GG obsessives took over the Connecticut town of Washington Depot for a fan festival , complete with cast interviews, a knit-a-thon, and other Gilmore -approved activities. \nLorelai and Emily – But No Richard One of the show's central conflicts was between Lorelai and her parents, Richard (the late Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop). The straight-laced, upper-upper-upper–class Gilmores wanted big things for their daughter: a coming-out party, Ivy League education, a marriage to the eligible Yale man of her choice. Instead, she got pregnant at 16 and ran away from home. These familial conflicts (her mother and father's disapproval of pretty much every part of their offspring's life; Lorelai's refusal to acknowledge how running away may have hurt them) created plenty of drama over the years; by the end, they'd reached a truce. But A Year in the Life brings on a whole new level of drama: Herrmann's death in 2014 will drive much of the show's storyline. \"Dealing with the death of Richard is going to impact all of them, because when somebody close to you dies your whole life comes into a weird focus for a minute,\" Sherman-Palladino told Entertainment Weekly . Stockpile some tissues, is what we're saying. \nRory and Dean and Jess and Logan … Bookish, introverted Rory still managed to do her fair share of dating over the course of Gilmore Girls ' seven seasons, with three major boyfriends: high-school sweetheart Dean ( Supernatural 's Jared Padalecki); brooding punk acolyte Jess ( This Is Us' Milo Ventimiglia); and poor little rich boy Logan ( The Good Wife 's Matt Czuchry), whose proposal she rejected at the show's end. All three of her former loves will appear in the revival, though some will have bigger roles than others; Padalecki is apparently due to appear for only one scene, while Ventimiglia shows up in the trailer, as hunky and sarcastic as ever. Though it's unlikely that she ends up with one of them, it'll give fans more reason to argue over whether or not they're Team Jess or Team Logan. (Team Jess forever, of course.) \nLorelai and Luke Are Together – But For How Long? Another crucial relationship in the original series was that between Lorelai and gruff, scruffy diner owner and No. 1 coffee supplier Luke Danes. The will-they-or-won't-they dramatics lasted for a while, before they got together, broke up, and got back together again. And in the trailer for the new series, the unlikely pair is still together, though there are signs that not all is happy in Stars Hollow. \"I thought I knew exactly what I wanted and where I was going,\" Lorelai says in the trailer – does this mean things with our favorite cantankerous slinger of cheesburgers are on the rocks? Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson, together again, in 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nSo Where Are the Gilmore Girls Now? Here's what we do know, based on trailers, teasers, and Internet sleuthing: Lorelai still lives in Stars Hollow, is still with Luke, and is still running the Dragonfly Inn. Rory may or may not still be a journalist – she's been living a \"vagabond\" life, which is easy when you have a trust fund – and is searching for direction. And Emily is still reeling from Richard's death, with coping mechanisms that include Marie Kondo-ing the Gilmore's enormous Hartford home, commissioning a larger-than-life portrait of the patriarch and wearing – gasp – a T-shirt and jeans. \"It's later in their lives and we're ... finding out what they've been doing but, more than that, that all three of their lives are going to change,\" Sherman-Palladino was quoted as saying. We'll have to wait and see how these big changes play out. \nWho Else Is Coming Back? Basically everyone. A short list includes all of the members of Hep Alien, featuring Rory's music-obsessed BFF Lane (Keiko Agena), her husband Zack ( True Blood 's Todd Lowe), Brian (John Cabrera), and yes, even Sebastian Bach as Gil; clumsy chef Sookie St. James, who was played by a pre-superstardom Melissa McCarthy; Rory's ultra-competitive friend/schoolmate Paris Geller (Liza Weil), who unsurprisingly has some kind of academic position; the members of the Life and Death Brigade, the GG stand-in for Yale's secretive Skull and Bones club; and most of the folks from the town of Stars Hollow, including gossips Miss Patty and Babette, the troubadour (played by indie rocker Grant Lee Phillips), surly mechanic Gypsy, and town weirdo Kirk. And yes, Paul Anka the dog is back too. \nStars Hollow Is As Quirky As Ever Don't believe us? One of the plot points in the revival is the staging of Stars Hollow: The Musical, which is exactly what it sounds like. And the production has some serious star power: Fun Home composer Jeanine Tesori wrote the songs, plus Broadway stars Sutton Foster (who starred in Sherman-Palladino's short-lived ballet dramedy Bunheads ) and Christian Borle are part of the cast. If town prig Taylor Doose's vaguely creepy, historically inaccurate Stars Hollow Museum from Season Five was any indication, this musical is sure to be weird, goofy, and over the top, i.e. everything we love about this eccentric East Coast hamlet. \nThe Final Four Words Will Finally Be Revealed Sherman-Palladino has said that she knew the trajectory of the story from the very beginning, down to the final words spoken in the series finale ... had she been there for the final season, that is. So good news for completists: Those four little words will indeed close out the reboot. Spoiler alert: They're spoken between two characters (Lorelai, maybe Rory?) and they may not bring the closure that fans are looking for. But hey, after all these years, just hearing them will be comforting on its own – like taking that first sip of a cup of Luke's extra-strong coffee. More News",

      "title": "Watch: Netflix’s Young Barack Obama Biopic ‘Barry’ Full Trailer Released",
      "text": "Pin it Share As President Obama prepares to leave office after eight years, Netflix is presenting Barry , a movie dramatizing the 44th president of United States as a 20-year-old college student in New York City. The movie, set to debut on Netflix on Friday, Dec. 16, stars Australian actor Devon Terrell as the young Obama arriving at Columbia University in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year — a pivotal moment in his life that laid the foundation for his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. Barry depicts Obama struggling to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. In the trailer, a fellow student tells Obama that because he’s of mixed race, he can fit in anywhere. “I fit in nowhere,” Obama responds. Netflix acquired rights to Barry after its premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film’s director, Vikram Gandhi (Kumaré, HBO’s Vice ), who is a Columbia University grad, approached fellow alum Adam Mansbach (author of Go the F— to Sleep ) on the project and Mansbach penned the script. Variety ‘s Owen Glieberman called the movie “at once moving and revealing” in his review . “The film is rooted in the murky, drifting, sleep-late-and-get-stoned-and-do-whatever nature of college life that the movies almost never get right,” Glieberman wrote. “This one does, and that’s one reason it feels bracingly authentic.” “Barry” is a joint production between Black Bear Pictures and Cinetic Media, produced by Cinetic’s Dana O’Keefe and Black Bear’s Teddy Schwarzman and Ben Stillman. The movie is the first production for Jon Sloss’ Cinetic. The cast of Barry includes Ashley Judd ( Divergent , Double Jeopardy ) and Jenna Elfman ( Friends With Benefits , Big Stone Gap ), along with Anya Taylor-Joy ( The Witch ), Jason Mitchell ( Straight Outta Compton ), Ellar Coltrane ( Boyhood ), and Avi Nash ( Learning to Drive , Silicon Valley ).

While details are scarce, Chappelle will drop a trio of new projects on Netflix in the near future. The streaming service shared the above image, along with the promise that the three specials are coming soon. Dave Chappelle's last standup special For What It's Worth was released way back in 2004.

The other two are never-before-seen specials from Chappelle’s collection, which were directed by Lathan and filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium. \nThese concert specials are Chappelle’s first in 12 years. All three are set to release simultaneously in 2017. \nNetflix grabbed Chappelle just after he made his hosting debut November 12 on \"Saturday Night Live\" and delivered the season's highest overnight ratings and the best 18-to-49 ratings for the show since 2013. \nChappelle made a huge name for himself while starring on \"Chappelle's Show,\" a racially charged sketch show that ran on Comedy Central from 2003 to 2006. Most recently, he's been trying out new material in an intimate venue tour . \nThe comedian will join friend ( and \"SNL\" surprise guest ) Chris Rock at the streaming company, which just made a reported $40 million deal with Rock for two specials.",

      "text": "(Photo: Bounce TV) \nBrown Sugar , a new streaming service, is touting itself as “Netflix, but blacker.” \nLaunched by Bounce TV, Brown Sugar features such movies as Shaft, The Mack, Foxy Brown, Super Fly and I’m Gonna Git You Sucka, the Blaxploitation classics. \n“These movies are entertaining and fun, but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African-Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time,” said Blaxploitation star Pam Grier. \nEven Rick Ross is getting in on the excitement, and his promo features him in a jheri curl wig that is well worth the $3.99 monthly fee. \n“You can see the influence of these movies in every aspect of rap and hip-hop; in the music , the lyrics, the fashion and overall style,” says Ross. “The blaxploitation genre is where it all began.” \nCheck out the promo below.

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) Saeed Adyani \nThis image released by Netflix shows, from left, Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream. \nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\" \nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai. \nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns. \nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored. \nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview. \n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\" \nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe. \nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots). \nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original. \n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\" \nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general. \n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said. \nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series. \n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\" \nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it. \nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman. \n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said. \nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon. \nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene. \n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said. \nAnd does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\" \nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\" \n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\" \nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening? \n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\" \n___ \nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

      "text": "Brian Josephs   CREDIT: Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images \nNetflix’s comedy lineup is going to get even stronger with new Dave Chappelle material on the way. The streaming service announced on Twitter today that it’s going to release three new specials from the legendary comedian. There’s not much information other than the fact that they’re “coming soon.” The new specials will be Chappelle’s first since 2004’s Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \nChappelle has made a comeback this year, following a number of stand-up appearances with his recent stint hosting Saturday Night Live . That telecast was the sketch show’s first episode after the contentious 2016 election, and featured the newly revitalized A Tribe Called Quest as the musical guest. His opening monologue was met with wide appraisal, and he notably brought back several of his most famous characters from Chappelle ’ s Show for a Walking Dead spoof. \nNetflix’s announcement is another reminder of how it’s been overtaking HBO as the premier spot for stand-up comedy. Back in October, the service announced that they signed Chris Rock for two specials . Plenty to look forward to.",

      "text": "Netflix Lester Cohen/Netflix \nDave Chappelle ’s return to television continues with a deal at Netflix for three standup specials. Chappelle and director Stan Lathan will produce one original all-new stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix. Additionally, Netflix has picked up two unreleased two-year-old specials from Chappelle’s personal archive. Directed by Lathan and filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium, these represent Chappelle’s first concert specials in 12 years and are slated to be released simultaneously in 2017. 'Barry' Trailer: Netflix's Barack Obama Movie Profiles The Future President In College \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP of Original Documentary and Comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nChappelle made a strong return to TV with his highly-rated hosting stint on Saturday Night Live 10 days ago. The Netflix deal comes on the heals of the Internet network landing two new Chris Rock standup specials for a record $40 million, also in the comedian’s return to TV. While the Chappelle team likely sought a similar payday, the Chappelle standup package is different as only one of the three specials will be topical, reflecting post-elections Trump America. I hear there was healthy interest though the specials didn’t reach the bidding frenzy that the Rock specials did. \nChappelle has performed over 500 concerts in the past three years, selling out shows within minutes of the announcements. In 2014, Chappelle sold out an unprecedented 10 consecutive comedy performances at Radio City Music Hall. \nChappelle was the mastermind behind Comedy Central’s runaway 2003 sketch comedy hit, The Chappelle Show . The show, which earned three Emmy nominations and went on to become one of the best-selling TV shows in DVD history, ended abruptly when Chappelle walked away. ",

      "text": "3 Netflix \nNetflix has dropped the official trailer for Barr y, its original film about Barack Obama , ahead of its December 16 premiere. Netflix Picks Up Dave Chappelle Standup Specials \nBarry looks at a pivotal year for Obama as he arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. His experiences over that critical school year lay the foundation for his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American, all leading to his eventual election as the 44th President of the United States. \nThe film, which premiered to critical praise at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival, stars Australian newcomer Devon Terrell in a breakout performance as Barry. Supporting cast includes Ashley Judd, Jenna Elfman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jason Mitchell, Ellar Coltrane and Avi Nash. \nDirector Vikram Gandhi ( Kumaré , HBO’s Vice ), a Columbia University alumni, approached fellow alum Adam Mansbach (author of Go the F**k to Sleep ) to help tell the origin story, and from that collaboration Mansbach penned the script. \nCheck out the trailer above and let us know what you think.

They’ll drop simultaneously next year. \nTechnically, only one is original, however. The other two have never been seen before and come from the comedian’s personal vault. Those were filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium, respectively, and mark Chappelle’s first concert specials in 12 years. \nThe recent first-time “SNL” host and “Chappelle’s Show” alum will produce the specials alongside director Stan Lathan. \nDave Chappelle used the final minutes of his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live to tell a moving story about visiting the White House last month – and send a message to Donald Trump in the process. Media: Entertainment Weekly “ Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice president of Original Documentary and Comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” The previously reclusive Chappelle has performed more than 500 stand-up shows over the past three years.   \nRead original story Dave Chappelle’s Stand-up Headed to Netflix in 3 New Specials  ",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nNetflix’s plan for world domination is taking another major step forward. On the heels of landing two new stand-up comedy specials from Chris Rock , the streaming giant has now sealed a deal for three brand new stand-up comedy specials from one of the best stand-ups of all time: Dave Chappelle . Indeed, Netflix paid a whopping $40 million for Rock’s two stand-up specials, so one can only imagine how much the streaming service agreed to pony up for Chappelle, who bowed out of the limelight following his smashing success and abrupt departure from The Chappelle Show . Chappelle made something of a comeback recently as he hosted a spectacular episode of Saturday Night Live , and now it appears he’s making the comeback official with these Netflix specials. \nThe deal includes one brand new original stand-up comedy special to be produced by Chappelle and director Stan Lathan for Netflix, as well as two previously recorded but never-seen specials that were filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium. Those two specials will be released simultaneously in 2017, marking Chappelle’s first stand-up specials in 12 years. \nI still contend that Chappelle’s previous stand-up special Killing Them Softly is one of the best sets of all time, so this comes as joyous news to fans of stand-up comedy. Chappelle is one of the sharpest and most talented comedians who ever lived, so to see the performer making a comeback of sorts is good news indeed. \nNetflix continues to spend insane amounts of money to expand its reach, and delving into the stand-up realm is simply the next step for the streaming giant’s international plans. They’ve already ramped up original content with a slew of TV series and a burgeoning slate of high-profile original features, including the David Ayer -directed sci-fi drama Bright starring Will Smith and War Machine starring Brad Pitt . Of course, this all comes at a price—Netflix has been scaling back its library of licensed films, making it harder to find older or classic films on the ubiquitous streaming service. \nWhat the future holds remains to be seen, but nabbing Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle is one hell of a one-two punch that announces strongly that Netflix is not messing around.

Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,””Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "9:18am PT by Kate Stanhope Dave Chappelle Headed to Netflix With 3 Stand-Up Specials Erin Schaff/For The Washington Post via Getty Images The news comes fresh off his 'SNL' hosting debut. \nDave Chappelle is headed to Netflix. \nThe stand-up comic has set three new stand-up comedy specials at the streaming giant, it was announced Monday. Chappelle and director Stan Lathan will produce an original stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix, with its premiere date to be announced. The two other never-before-seen specials hail directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault. Directed by Lathan and filmed at Austin City Limits in April 2015 and the Hollywood Palladium in March 2016, the specials mark the comedian's first concert specials in 12 years and are slated to be released simultaneously in 2017. “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura , Netflix VP, original documentary and comedy, said. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” The news comes fresh off Chappelle's SNL hosting debut, which nabbed the show its best rating in three years. The specials will also mark Chappelle's first major TV project since he surprisingly and suddenly stepped away from his Comedy Central sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005, arguably at the height of the show's popularity. The comedian subsequently spent several years out of the public eye, but has slowly returned to the mainstream. He performed 10 sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in 2014, and also appeared in a small role in Spike Lee's film Chi-Raq last year. He has continued to perform stand-up across the country, performing over 500 shows in the past three years. For Netflix, the deal comes not long after the streaming giant landed two new stand-up specials from Chris Rock as part of a stunning $40 million deal. As it ramps up originals, the streamer has become a major player in the stand-up space, competing against Comedy Central and HBO, among other platforms. Earlier this year, the streamer was able to land Dana Carvey's first stand-up special in 20 years. In September, Patton Oswalt won an Emmy for his Netflix stand-up special, Talking for Clapping. \n\"For us, it's about having enough of a global audience and anticipated engagement that we can get behind all of these projects,\" Nishimura told THR earlier this month when discussing Rock's highly anticipated specials.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017.\nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said.\nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.",

      "text": "Netflix Announces That 3 Dave Chappelle Specials Are On The Way Trent \n\n\nLove it. The world needs more Dave Chappelle. His SNL hosting was great but it wasn’t near enough. The world has needed more Dave Chappelle ever since he freaked out and hopped on that plane to South Africa all those years ago. The world needs Dave Chappelle more now than its ever needed him. Whatever your feelings are towards the pending Donald Trump presidency, you can bet your ass that it’s gonna inspire some of the best stand up comedy we’ve seen in years. Nobody answers the call in crazy times better than stand up comedians. And who better to lead that revolution than the one and only Chappelle? If you haven’t watched his “Killin’ Them Softly” and “For What It’s Worth” specials, first of all, fuck you for being such an idiot. And second, that’s homework for you now. Watch those two specials and realize why he’s one of the best to ever do it. I’m sure people would like to see another iteration of Chappelle’s Show to come back and who knows. Maybe that’ll happen down the line. But I’ll take Dave Chappelle where I can get him and I’m beyond pumped for him to bring the heat in these specials. Trent",

The two already-recorded specials will be released simultaneously in 2017. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \nThe news comes just over a month after Netflix announced that it had ordered two specials from Chris Rock, and the company will reportedly pay Rock a total of $40 million . The dollar amount shocked the comedy world when it was first announced, but it is indicative of a mission that regards original programming as vital to future success. The company announced in October that it would spend $6 billion in 2017 on content, more than NBC and CBS. \nNetflix has also released comedy specials by comedians including Aziz Ansari and Patton Oswalt, the latter of which earned an Emmy this year.

      "text": "Netflix 4K streaming is finally heading to Windows PCs this week. While a number of TVs and set-top-boxes already support 4K Netflix streams, the PC has largely been left out of the high-quality streams due to piracy fears. Netflix is now supporting 4K streaming through Microsoft's Edge browser, but you'll need a new PC to actually make use of it. Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren't many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors.\nAs a result, Microsoft is using the 4K Netflix support as a marketing effort for its Edge browser and to encourage people to upgrade their hardware to watch new episodes of the Gilmore Girls . It all might seem like a bit of a con, but it's largely the fault of DRM requirements from Hollywood studios and TV networks. Content providers have strict controls for 4K playback, so that streams can't be captured and redistributed illegally.\nThe latest hardware decryption features simply aren't available on older Intel processors, and the new Kaby Lake chips now support 10-bit HEVC, a popular 4K video codec. So if you don't have a new PC, you'll have to wait until you need a hardware upgrade before you'll be watching Netflix in 4K. Or, just buy a streaming stick like the Chromecast Ultra or the latest Roku to take advantage of Netflix in 4K.",

      "text": "WBRC Spot Specs Sheet Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 \nNEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream. \nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\" \nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai. \nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns. \nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored. \nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview. \n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\" \nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe. \nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots). \nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original. \n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\" \nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general. \n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said. \nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series. \n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\" \nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it. \nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman. \n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said. Looking for fun? Get recommendations sent to   \nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon. \nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene. \n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said. \nAnd does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\" \nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\" \n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\" \nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening? \n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\" \n___ \nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier in November, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "in Sex & Dating \nRelationships are never easy and breakups are even harder. When you’re going through something as devastating as parting ways with a significant other, the best thing you can do for yourself is take some time to heal. \nSo, buy a gallon of ice cream, order greasy takeout food, grab your closest girl friends, and turn on Netflix. These are some of the best films you can stream for your post-breakup feels and they might even give you the confidence to realize that you’re better off on your own anyway…or you can open a bottle of wine. 1. An Unmarried Woman (1978) \nIf you have yet to see this 70s classic, post-breakup is probably the most ideal time to do so. An Unmarried Woman follows the adventures of a young New Yorker, Erica Benton (Jill Clayburgh) whose chauvinistic husband leaves her for a younger woman. We’ve all heard this tale before, but Benton’s journey to recovery and self-reinvention is truly empowering. So, if you or your best girl are going through a breakup, this movie will help you embrace your newfound freedom and path to self-discovery. \nPairs well with a nice Chardonnay 2. Heathers (1989) \nWinona Ryder stars as Veronica, a member of her highschool’s most popular clique. She disapproves of the other girls in the group and their catty behavior so she and her new boyfriend J.D. decide to confront the leader, Heather Chandler. One thing leads to another and they “accidentally” poison Heather. Needless to say, everything begins to spiral out of control. While this may seem like an odd choice for a breakup film, it’s the perfect distraction for anyone dealing with unbearable heartbreak. \nPairs well with a bubbly Rosé 3. Amélie (2001) \nAmélie is ideal for the recently single woman looking to reinvent herself and discover the world around her. The protagonist is a young woman living in Paris who enjoys secretly poking around in the lives of others. The film is shot in more than 80 locations throughout Paris and is a beautiful lesson in realizing that being alone doesn’t have to mean being lonely. Who knows, it may even inspire you to book a trip to Europe. \nPairs well with a fruity Pinot Grigio 4. Mona Lisa Smile (2003) \nIf you’ve never seen Mona Lisa Smile , shame on you, but now is the time. Our all-time favorite Pretty Woman , Julia Roberts stars as a recent UCLA graduate hired to teach art history at an all-female academy in 1953. Roberts’ character Katherine Watson is determined to show her students that there’s so much more to being a woman than what society has laid out for them. This film is an inspirational tale of feminism in trying times that I think we could honestly all use right now. \nPairs well with a smooth Merlot 5. Under The Tuscan Sun (2003) \nWe know how unbelievably shitty it is to find out that your SO has been cheating on you, it’s probably one of the worst experiences anyone can ever go through. This film follows Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) who has just learned that her husband has been unfaithful to her. She takes some time to escape the shambles of her home life and adventures out on a spontaneous tour of Italy. What better way to start over than with a trip to a foreign land? \nPairs well with a nice Cabernet 6. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) \nYes, this film also made its way onto our list of Netflix movies that will mind fuck you, but what’s more mentally tumultous than a twisted love story? Kate Winslet plays a broken-hearted ex girlfriend of Jim Carrey’s character who is determined to erase any memory of him from her mind. Sounds like the typical post-breakup feels, right? When Carrey learns of this, he decides to do the same and the pair begin to forget each other altogether. \nPairs well with a vodka tonic 7. Little Black Book (2004) \nLittle Black Book is one of the most underrated Brittany Murphy films I’ve ever seen (RIP). When Stacey (Murphy) is upset that her boyfriend Derek (Ron Livingston) won’t discuss his past relationships with her, she and her co-worker Barb (Holly Hunter) decide to steal Derek’s phone and contact his ex-girlfriends. It goes as well as you might think, but this movie is actually a hilariously sweet lesson in loving someone enough to let them go and putting your happiness first. You’ll laugh and most likely cry, but that’s what your gallon of ice cream is for right? \nPairs well with a dirty martini. 8. The Other Woman (2009) \nYes, The Other Woman is referring to an extramarrital affair (well actually 3 of them). When multiple women discover they’ve been having a secret relationship with the same married man, things get a little dicey and they team up to get their revenge. \nPairs well with a sex on the beach 9. Begin Again (2014) \nI cannot emphasize enough how underrated this movie is. I saw it for the first time on a plane after I had gone through a fairly nasty breakup myself and it seriously made me feel so much better. Kiera Knightley stars alongside Adam Levine (yes that Adam Levine) and Mark Ruffalo in a story about starting over and how sometimes the only person you really need is yourself. \nPairs well with Champagne and a toast to freedom!",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to release three Netflix comedy specials By Reuters Advertise here \nDave Chappelle has cut a deal with Netflix for three new comedy specials. \nThe projects will mark Chappelle's first standup TV specials in 12 years, and it marks another aggressive push by Netflix in the standup comedy arena. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of original documentary and comedy. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.\" \nThe deal calls for Chappelle and director Stan Lathan to produce an original special for Netflix. Two other unreleased projects will come from Chappelle's vault -- one produced out of the Austin City Limits venue, the other from a performance at the Hollywood Palladium. \nThe projects from the vault are set for release simultaneously next year. There's no premiere date yet for the new special. \nChappelle is coming off a strong performance earlier this month as host of \"Saturday Night Live,\" which generated the show's highest ratings in three years. He is among the most prolific and successful touring comics in country, staging some 500 shows during the past three years. \nNetflix made headlines last month by setting a $40 million deal with Chris Rock for two new comedy specials.

      "text": "\nWith U.S. President Barack Obama set to leave The White House in a couple of months, a film based on an earlier period in his life is scheduled to arrive in the very near future. On Friday, December 16, the Black Bear Pictures and Cinetic Media motion picture Barry will be available for viewing via Netflix. Featuring Australian Devon Terrell as a 20-year-old Obama, Barry presents a look at Barack Obama's days at a college student in New York City and documents his struggles with his parents and peers. The Vikram Gandhi-directed movie was originally debuted at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, and garnered mostly positive reviews from critics.\nYou can view the new trailer for Netflix's debut of Barry above, and check out last month's promotional clip for the film here .\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP, File) The Associated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press .

No exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. Chappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. Earlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. Today's Deals",

I was looking for something to watch the other day, and the first thing it showed me was True Memoirs of an International Assassin, a Netflix original starring Kevin James.

Netflix is only supporting 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors, and there aren't many laptops that actually support both the 4K display required and the new Intel processors.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft is using the 4K Netflix support as a marketing effort for its Edge browser and to encourage people to upgrade their hardware to watch new episodes of the Gilmore Girls .

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

(Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) Saeed Adyani \nThis image released by Netflix shows, from left, Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream. \nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\" \nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai. \nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns. \nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored. \nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview. \n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\" \nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe. \nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots). \nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original. \n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\" \nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general. \n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said. \nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series. \n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\" \nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it. \nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman. \n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said. \nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon. \nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene. \n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said. \nAnd does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\" \nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\" \n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\" \nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening? \n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\" \n___ \nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "by Lisa Respers France @CNNMoney November 21, 2016: 1:55 PM ET Welcome back to the masses Dave Chappelle. \nFresh off a successful gig hosting \"Saturday Night Live,\" the beloved comic is getting three specials on Netflix. \nOn Monday, the streaming giant announced that Chappelle and director Stan Lathan have teamed up to produce a new stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix. \nThey'll also partner to release two unseen concert specials from Chappelle's personal comedy vault. Those shows -- filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium -- will debut simultaneously in 2017. \nChappelle, who in 2005 famously walked away from a lucrative contract and the third season of his popular Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" spent several years making impromptu appearances at comedy venues before returning to stand-up more regularly in 2013. \nAccording to Netflix, Chappelle has performed in more the 500 shows in the past three years -- with tickets typically selling out in minutes. \nThe Chappelle news comes on the heels of Netflix mega deal with Chris Rock to produce two new stand-up streaming specials.

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Welcome back to the masses Dave Chappelle.\nFresh off a successful gig hosting “Saturday Night Live,” the beloved comic is getting three specials on Netflix.\nOn Monday, the streaming giant announced that Chappelle and director Stan Lathan have teamed up to produce a new stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix.\nThey’ll also partner to release two unseen concert specials from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault. Those shows — filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium — will debut simultaneously in 2017.\nChappelle, who in 2005 famously walked away from a lucrative contract and the third season of his popular Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” spent several years making impromptu appearances at comedy venues before returning to stand-up more regularly in 2013.\nAccording to Netflix, Chappelle has performed in more the 500 shows in the past three years — with tickets typically selling out in minutes.\nThe Chappelle news comes on the heels of Netflix mega deal with Chris Rock to produce two new stand-up streaming specials.\nGraphic warning for video below: \n",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017   Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Three New Dave Chappelle Comedy Specials are Coming to Netflix The news comes a week after Chappelle's hosting stint on SNL. Comedy November 21, 2016 \nD ave Chappelle and director Stan Lathan have signed on to create an original comedy special for Netflix, marking a much-needed comeback for the brilliant, often-controversial, and always-poignant Chappelle. Alongside the original special will be two previously taped comedy specials from Chappelle’s private collection — shows filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium — to be released simultaneously on Netflix in 2017. \nChappelle recently played host of Saturday Night Live on November 12 nabbed the show its best rating in the past three years, helped along by the episode’s musical guest A Tribe Called Quest. The pairing felt especially significant after the Presidential Election on November 8, and Chappelle urged America to give President-Elect Donald Trump a chance. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix VP of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement Monday. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016 \nWhile Chappelle held prominence in the early and mid-2000s, contributing to some well-known and popular phrases at the time — which would have, undoubtedly, become memes had they come into prominence 10 years later — he’s been laying low in recent years. But his brief time on SNL proved how relevant Chappelle still remains in popular culture. \nBe on the lookout for Chappelle’s “searing, vital,” and “important” specials on Netflix in 2017.
