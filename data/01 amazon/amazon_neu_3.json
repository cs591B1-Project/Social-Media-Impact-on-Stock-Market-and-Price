      "text": "If you haven't signed up for Amazon Prime yet, tomorrow's a good day to do so. On Nov. 18, Amazon is offering a year of Prime for $79 (a $20 savings) to celebrate the launch of The Grand Tour, Amazon's Prime-exclusive motoring show. \n\nThe deal, which you can snag from Amazon's Prime page , officially kicks off on Nov. 18 at 12 a.m. ET and wraps up at 11:59 p.m. ET. Conveniently, that's the same day you can start watching The Grand Tour, a globe-trotting, car-focused TV show hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — a trio best known for BBC's hit Top Gear series. \nMORE: The Best Pre-Black Friday Tech Deals \nInstead of being released all at once, episodes of The Grand Tour will roll out every week for the next 12 weeks. To help pass the time between episodes, Amazon has released a special Alexa skill for the TV show, in which hosts Clarkson, Hammond and May will deliver audio clues about the next installment via your Amazon Echo , Echo Dot or Tap . \nGet Amazon Prime for $79 Nov. 18 $79 Amazon \nAmazon Prime is already brimming with value for $99, and it's a no-brainer at $79. The service's major perks include unlimited streaming via Prime Video and Prime music, free two-day shipping on most products and unlimited online photo storage. Amazon is constantly adding new benefits to Prime; some recent examples include Prime Reading, a book-binging program, and Twitch Prime, which allows you view Twitch streams ad-free and subscribe to your favorite broadcasters without paying.\nThe Grand Tour \nIt's also good to have Prime during the busy holiday shopping season. A Prime account gives you early access to lightning deals, and allows you to have select Black Friday deals delivered to your door in an hour via Prime Now. The service will even let you take advantage of certain Alexa-exclusive deals this holiday via voice ordering, so long as you have a device such as the Amazon Echo or Echo Dot. \nSee Also : Is Amazon Prime Worth It?

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon \nIf you're looking for a good deal on Amazon hardware before, during, and after Black Friday, you're in luck. \nThe online retail giant is having a week-and-a-half-long sale, and they've slashed the prices on certified refurbished versions of their hottest hardware. \nIf you're worried about buying refurbished products, don't be. I've purchased many items through Amazon's \"warehouse deals\" and haven't had any problems. \nThese products all come with the same two-year warranty that all new Amazon hardware products do. So, if run into a problem, you're still covered. \nNow, onto the deals: \nOn the Echo side, Amazon is selling the full-sized Echo for $120, $70 off the regular list price. I bought an Echo early this year, and it's one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's my smart-home hub, quick-calculations machine, and my favorite timer. I rely on it to control my lights and also rattle off the day's top news stories. I've even used it to play audiobooks or read Kindle books. At $120, the Echo is a relative bargain. \nIf you're looking to get into the video-streaming space, two of Amazon's Fire TV products are also on sale. The current generation Fire TV with Alexa Voice Remote is $65 ($25 off), while last year's standard Fire TV is $50. There are two big differences between the two: their maximum resolution, and their remote. \nThe standard Fire TV comes with a regular remote and can only output video at 1080P. The Fire TV with Voice Remote lets you navigate its interface with your voice to save time, and can output video at 4K. If you don't have a 4K TV and don't plan on upgrading anytime soon, the standard Fire TV should be enough. If you want to future-proof yourself a little bit and save time using your voice to pick what show to watch next, go for the upgrade. \nFinally, Amazon is putting two of their Kindles on sale: The Kindle Paperwhite for $80 ($40 off) and the Kindle Voyage for $120 ($80 off). We have a whole guide to the Kindle line, but here are the highlights. The Kindle Paperwhite has a higher-resolution screen than the standard Kindle, and more importantly, it has a backlit screen. Both will make reading the Kindle easier on the eyes, especially in the dark. \nAmazon \nThe Kindle Voyage has an even better backlit screen, with an adaptive light sensor that automatically adjusts how bright it should be. Although all Kindles have a touchscreen, the Voyage also has \"Page Press\" technology. This lets you put pressure on the left or right of the screen to turn pages. \nAll of these are solid discounts. If you've been waiting for the right time to buy a streaming stick, Kindle, or Echo, this is a great time. These discounts will be available until November 28, but there's a good chance they'll sell out before that.",

      "text": "Buy at Amazon HiFiMan HE-400i The bang for your buck money is no object category is kind of an oxymoron, but if there were ever a pair of headphones that live up to the name it’d be the HiFiMan HE-400i. These aren’t cheap by any means, but pound for pound these have excellent build quality and sound amazing. HiFiMan is one of those companies (like Sennheiser) with plenty of people who swear by their headphones. These are also planar magnetic headphones meant for really sitting back and listening to your music. On top of that they’re also super lightweight, weighing in at only 0.8 pounds. Since the HE-400Is are open-back, you’ll be able to hear your surroundings (not to mention people around you can hear what you’re listening to). The drivers are protected by a thin grill, but still exposed to the world. On the bottom of both ear cups are the signature HiFiMan inputs which have their pros and cons. On one hand it’s pretty annoying to have to screw in the connectors, but on the other at least there is no chance of them getting pulled out. That cable is also nicely constructed and ends in a 90-degree 3.5mm jack. It also comes with a 1/4” adapter so if you’re looking to plug these into something a little more powerful than your phone you can. It has a sensitivity of 93dB and impedance of 35 oHms so it can draw enough power from the average smartphone to work. Though they work with smartphones, these aren’t exactly portable. The HE-400Is don’t fold at the hinges, but they do rotate to lie flat so you can let them hang around your neck while not in use. These have a 4.7 out of 5 star review on Amazon and you can usually find them for around $450. Pros",

      "text": "Monday morning brought good news for a number of new television series on various networks.\nCBS announced that it was giving full-season orders to the new sitcoms “Man With a Plan” and “The Great Indoors,” which means five of the network’s newcomers will endure through the fall.\n“The Great Indoors” stars Joel McHale in a workplace comedy that mines the generational divide between Generation X and millennials, and “Man With a Plan” marked the much-publicized return of Matt LeBlanc from “Friends” to a network sitcom. Both shows debuted in late October and have earned respectable ratings. “The Great Indoors” was touted by CBS as the No. 2 new comedy of the season, averaging more than 8 million viewers.\nThe new CBS shows “Bull,” “MacGyver” and “Kevin Can Wait,” which stars Kevin James in the season’s top-rated new sitcom, were also given full orders by the network early in the fall.\nThe network also ordered three additional episodes of the medical drama “Code Black,” which is in its second season.\nHBO announced Monday that it was renewing its three fall series for second seasons.\n“Westworld,” a futuristic drama that explores sin and the complexities of consciousness, has proved a ratings hit for HBO, averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers through its first seven episodes.\nThe renewal also includes critically acclaimed comedy series “Insecure.” Created by and starring Issa Rae, “Insecure” examines the difficulties of navigating the modern world as a young black woman.\nAlso scoring a second season is “Divorce,” the series that brought “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker back to the network and digs into a marriage as it falls apart.\nCompleting the renewal trifecta was Amazon, which announced Monday a second season renewal for Tig Notaro’s semi-autobiographical series “One Mississippi,” a dark comedy about the intricacies of family and making peace with the past.\nThe second season of “One Mississippi” will air exclusively on Amazon in 2017.\nSee the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »\nCaption Vidiots: A video store's last hope A long time ago in an era of VCRs and DVD players...

The catch is that the discount fee -- $79 instead of $99 for the first year -- only lasts a single day, Friday.\nAccording to Amazon, the one-day sale is for new members only and is timed with the premiere of the new original series The Grand Tour, starring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, formerly of Top Gear.\nIncentives for Prime membership include free shipping along with access to Amazon's Netflix-like Prime Video service and its limited music streamer Prime Music. Prime members also get a head start on Black Friday deals on the e-commerce giant.\nThe sale begins at 12:00am ET on Nov. 18 and wraps up at 11:59pm PT.",

      "text": "“Our focus is on customer obsession rather than competitor obsession.” — Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO\nWhen Jeff Bezos spoke in Salt Lake City a few years ago, Amazon’s profit margin was about 1 percent, while Google’s and Apple’s were around 25 percent. I asked one of his lieutenants why Amazon had such a tiny profit. He said Bezos wants customers to get most of the benefit from shopping with Amazon; thus it keeps its costs — and profits — as low as possible. Bezos’ obsession with customer satisfaction is working: Amazon has achieved $100 billion in annual sales faster than any company in history.\nIn his recent stockholder letter , Bezos wrote, “We’ve grown Prime two-day delivery selection from 1 million items to over 30 million, added Sunday delivery, and introduced free same-day delivery on hundreds of thousands of products for customers in more than 35 cities around the world.”\n“Prime Now offers members one-hour delivery on many items ... and was launched (in) only 111 days. ... In that time, a small team built a customer-facing app, secured a location for an urban warehouse, determined which 25,000 items to sell, got those items stocked, recruited and on-boarded new staff ... and launched in time for the holidays.”\nAny business wanting to create a superb customer experience should pause and seriously consider what Amazon has done and is doing: one-hour delivery? This puts every goods retailer in the bull's-eye.\nWhile great companies like Nordstrom, American Express and Costco rank up there with Amazon, too many businesses only talk the talk. They may advertise their service in clever commercials, but it’s empty rhetoric. I don’t have to tell you that, my gentle readers, because you’re their customers, too. Far too many companies concentrate on their product but have a poor grasp of the quality of their service. Their CEOs can’t possibly be experiencing their own companies’ treatment of customers or they wouldn’t be bragging about it.\nWal-Mart doesn’t care if I find what I’m looking for. I know that because it doesn’t provide anyone to help me find humidifiers or belts. The Swiss Army knife I like to buy is almost always out of stock. My experience leads me to conclude Wal-Mart’s customer service philosophy is something like this: We’re really big and have lots of inexpensive stuff; customers want our products and prices enough to put up with minimal customer assistance. Wal-Mart may continue to prosper, but odds are Amazon will bury it by helping shoppers buy exactly what they want (after choosing from a gazillion options, all with informative reviews by previous buyers) from their homes and having it delivered in about the same time it would take to go to Wal-Mart.\nIn general, the inability to talk to a person — in store or remotely — is a huge disadvantage for a company. Call XMission, ClearPlay or Ring. A knowledgeable, engaged person will answer the phone and immediately help you with your problem. Contact Moen to tell it your faucet broke or tell Hunter-Douglas about your broken blind. In a day or so either company will ship — without cost — a replacement part, no questions asked. Even though I rarely talk to a person at Amazon, I still get everything worked out amazingly well. I love the chat feature on a lot of help pages. I’ve resolved many problems this way. There is no perfect way. Great companies find out how to give great customer service.\nOh, that my cable carrier would adopt Amazon’s service ethic. In my new cable package, I specifically kept my landline (I had my reasons), but the company turned it off anyway. After a long time on hold, I talked to a helpful service rep, but she couldn’t help because the salesperson hadn’t included the landline in the ticket. I couldn’t contact the salesperson, but luckily, he had written the whole deal down on some scratch paper, which I kept. Over the next several weeks I spent hours upon hours on the phone. With stern resolution and some legal knowledge, I finally got the deal I had negotiated. This company may have a customer service department, but it has no real customer service.\nProduct quality and selection bring business, but customer service keeps — or loses — customers.\nGreg Bell is the current president and CEO of the Utah Hospital Association. He is the former Republican lieutenant governor of Utah.",

      "text": "How Amazon hopes Alexa can introduce ‘systemic change’ and improve lives By Natalie Mortimer  00am How Amazon hopes Alexa can introduce ‘systemic change’ and improve lives \nIt’s able to play your favourite Spotify playlist and turn on the heating in your home, just by asking it, but Amazon has grander hopes for its voice-powered virtual assistant Alexa, hoping that it can help introduce “systemic change” and help improve people’s lives. \nAnticipating usage cases for Alexa, Dean Bryen, evangelist, new technologies at Amazon said that he could see potential for the virtual assistant, which is open source, to aid sectors such as healthcare and address issues such as when people are unable to remember to take medication. \n“There is a big problem for healthcare called non intentional noncompliance. There is lots of research in to the amount of costs to the NHS, and I think there is a bigger picture there around systemic change,” he told an audience at Mindshare Huddle for Good. \nDrawing on an example of a stroke patient with short term memory loss, Bryen said the patient had been bought an Amazon Echo, which is powered by Alexa, and now uses it to remind him to take his daily medication, helping to reduce the amount of care needed and reinstating some independence. \nAmazon also sees opportunities in the medical field, for example in an operating theatre when a surgeon’s hands are in use. \nA plethora of brands are already working with the Alexa app including Domino’s, Uber, Just Eat and Capital One.",

      "text": "Is Amazon going after Trump with its new ad? by @DavidGoldmanCNN November 18, 2016: 7:59 AM ET Amazon's newest ad serves up a healthy dose of anti-Trump messaging. A priest and an imam are sitting down for tea. \nIt's not the beginning of a joke. It's Amazon's newest ad , and it serves up a healthy dose of anti-Trump messaging. \nIn the ad, the priest and the imam are friends -- and they're not getting any younger. They share a hug, the imam leaves, and both take out their smartphones and tap on the Amazon app. Two days later, they receive the same package from each other: knee braces. The priest genuflects without pain. The imam kneels for prayer, and he feels just fine. \nIf the commercial had come out last year, it would have been the usual heart-warming stuff, quickly forgotten. \nBut the ad has already erupted on social media, even tweeted by Amazon's Twitter-shy CEO, Jeff Bezos. Love this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team. https://t.co/E8ceXs4nte — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nAmazon's ad offers a not-so-subtle counterargument to some of the angry anti-Muslim rhetoric espoused by President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters. \nAs talk bubbles of Muslim registries and even a potential ban on Muslim immigrants, Amazon's message offers a different approach: We are people first. We embrace the things that make us different, but we're all very much the same. Muslims have arthritis, too. \nTrump has been one of Amazon's most vocal critics. \nLast December, he went on a Twitter tirade against Bezos. Trump argued that Bezos had bought The Washington Post in 2013 to persuade Washington politicians to keep Amazon's taxes low and help the company avoid antitrust scrutiny. And Trump said that because he will be tough on Amazon as president, Bezos used the Post to publish nasty articles about Trump in an attempt to keep him out of the White House. \n\"This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon,\" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in May . \"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\" \nShares of Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) have fallen nearly 5% since Election Day , wiping out about $20 billion in market value.

Post to Facebook How to keep your secrets safe on Amazon, Facebook, other sites These tricks will keep things like preferences and search history safe.  //usat.ly/2g4YDhu   Join the Nation's Conversation   How to keep your secrets safe on Amazon, Facebook, other sites Kim Komando , Special for USA TODAY 8:20   x Share Want to keep your purchase history and viewing preferences secret? Tech columnist Kim Komando shows you how to do it. Simple steps in your settings can keep your secrets safe, from viewing preferences to search history. (Photo: Getty Images/Ingram Publishing) \nWhen a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords. \nBut your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? \nHere are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) \nAmazon \nAmazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. \nThe good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history, so you never have this issue again. \nLet’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. \nYou can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? \nWith the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! \nGoogle \nGoogle often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube. \nTo delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. \nMost browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual. \nFacebook \nFor many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. \nYour significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. \nThe easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. \nYour Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you . \nNetflix \nWe all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. \nIf you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. \nNetflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories . \nGo incognito \nEvery major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you weren't online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret . \nMaintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes. To learn other ways to protect your information, be sure to listen or download my podcasts, or click here to find it on your local radio station . You can listen to the Kim Komando Show on your phone, tablet or computer. From buying advice to digital life issues, click here for my free podcasts . \nOn the Kim Komando Show , the nation's largest weekend radio talk show, Kim takes calls and dispenses advice on today's digital lifestyle, from smartphones and tablets to online privacy and data hacks.

My musical tastes run to... New Posts All Forums: Forum Nav: Amazon Echo Dot/ as a source/quality? Select All Posts By This User Searched to see if anybody has tried using the Dot as any decent audio source. I can only imagine it is quite low quality but a man can dream... The voice commands are nice on the original Echo and the speaker is better than say... The one on my cellphone... But that isn't saying much for hi-fi. At least the Dot had stereo analog out whereas the original Echo had no output and was mono only. I just had high hopes this round of releases for some sort of digital output. Anyways, if anyone has made use of the 3.5mm jack I'd be interested to know your thoughts. Or other opinions about the Echo/voice controlled audio players.",

      "text": "This should get interesting quick. Published reports say that Amazon soon will be pushing its video service into 200 countries, creating a deep-pocketed competitor for Netflix which has a head start forging its global footprint. \nRight now, in addition to the U.S., Amazon is only in the U.K., Japan, Germany, Austria and revving up for India, The Wall Street Journal says . (It’s also available, in a limited and unpublicized way, in Australia, as of this week.)\nIn those countries, it likes to lock up regional hits and stars, while Netflix goes for a bigger global-appeal approach. That may be because Netflix is already all over the world. Its global expansion really pushed up a year ago to include everyplace unless you’re in China. It’s now in about 190 countries, the Journal says. Putting those two heavyweights against each other would seem to increase the value of international content rights and likelihood of international casting. Netflix has 87 million subscribers; its growth is slowing in the U.S. where it may have tapped out the market, or nearly so. Amazon Prime Video is harder to pin down. Investors.com, citing Consumer Intelligence Research Partners  tabulations, said at the beginning of 2016,  Amazon had more U.S. subscribers (54 million) than Netflix (44.7 million). The trick is that Amazon Prime Video is just a part of a subscription to the Amazon Prime shopping service, and there were reports in the spring that something like 20% of the Amazon Prime customers never-- ever-- availed themselves to the video content, or possibly even knew it existed,  That's because Amazon never promotes it equal to its value, it seems to me. Maybe Amazon just has a hard time recognizing it's in the business?  Amazon this year introduced a monthly Amazon Prime subscription, apparently so consumers could test out the shopping service, and possibly so the video-curious consumer could see what “Transparent” is all about.\nIt’s always struck me strange that a renowned merchandise marketer at one end of the business could be as confusing and lame on the other. Amazon Prime Video is misunderstood here, and now possibly, it will extend the puzzlement worldwide. Actually, “announcing” Amazon’s global initiative was equally strange. Jeremy Clarkson, the star of the upcoming Amazon series, “The Grand Tour” automotive joke vehicle,  tweeted out that the program would debut in in 200 nations in December. “Amazon has gone global,” he tweeted, though like a lot of Amazon’s video adventures, you could have missed it. \npj@mediapost.com",

      "text": "Get 20% off Amazon Prime Membership for Today Only! And get more Early Black Friday Deals on Samsung TVs, Kindles & more. Image credit: Shutterstock   \nEntrepreneur has affiliate partnership with TechBargains so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. This is the last weekend before Black Friday and the deals are beginning to heat up . Samsung has begun its annual Black Friday markdowns on their TVs, Amazon has discounted Prime (something has only happened a few times), and we are starting to see retailers pull the trigger on discounts early on everything from TVs, PCs, electronics and more. \n20% off Amazon Prime 2-Day Shipping Membership for $79 (Orig $99) For one day only, users new to Amazon Prime can get a discounted price on their membership. This is a rare deal they have only offered a few times and is perfect timing for Black Friday and Holiday Shopping. Prime not only gets you 2-day shipping and access to Prime Now same day delivery, you can also share it with a family member, get free premium movies & shows on Prime Video, free music streaming on Prime Music, free unlimited photo storage and Prime exclusive discounts and early access to limited time Amazon Lightning Deals. Prime offers a ton of perks and we think it's well worth the cost. We've saved money compared to buying from big box stores and gotten high quality items thanks to Amazon's massive selection of hard to find items from office supplies, electronics and more. \n$10 Bonus Credit on a $50 Amazon Gift Card For you new users out there who have never bought an Amazon gift card, you are eligible to get a bonus $10 Amazon credit when you buy a $50 Amazon gift card. This is basically free money to spend at Amazon just for buying a gift card. Typically Amazon only offers this deal on Black Friday (and it always sells out early). If you are a new Amazon gift card buyer or new Prime member this is an easy win. \n49\" Samsung 4K Curved LED HDTV for $549.99 (Orig $1,099.99) Don't get fooled by buying a Black Friday TV. They are cheap for a reason and clearly no sane retailer would try to lose money on a single item. For only $550 you can get this very nice 2016 Samsung TV with all the newest bells and whistles: 4K, curved display and HDR support. \nBose Soundtrue II Around the Ear headphones for $99 (Orig $179.95) Bose deals are a perennial Black Friday favorite and this year it looks to have gotten discounted early. These are designed to be comfortable and portable without sacrificing sound quality. We suggest you act fast as these Bose deals always sell out. \n55\" Samsung SUHD 4K 120Hz LED HDTV (UN55KS8000) with Quantum Dot Technology for $999.99 (Orig $2,199.99) Going high end on Black Friday is a great choice as in previous years we've seen the best deals on premium TVs happen only on Black Friday. This 55\" TV is one of Samsung's upper tier SUHD TVs that is currently the lowest price all year. It has a 4K resolution and native 120Hz panel with an actual 120Hz refresh rate (not the fake number manufacturers love to make up). It gets solid reviews, has a sleek design and great picture quality that will outshine most of the junk TVs you find on Black Friday. \nAmazon Fire HD6 6\" 8GB WiFi Tablet for $49.99 (Orig $99.99) Use coupon code: FIREHD6 . This is the Black Friday tablet deal to beat. At $50 you won't get a better tablet than this well reviewed HD Fire 6. It has a powerful quad-core processor, a sharp 252ppi screen and if you have Prime it's an excellent option to watch videos offline when you travel. In fact at $50 it's a no brainer travel tablet because of its price point and its durable design. A $50 tablet is great for many things: a digital photo frame, a tablet for the kids, or even as a eBook reader. It has specialized filters for comfortable night time reading and specialized blue color filters on the screen to help you sleep at night. \nDropBox Pro 1-Year Subscription + $25 Dell Gift Card for $59.99 (Orig $99) This is the best deal we've seen on DropBox and one of the only ways we know how to get a discount on the Pro version. You get a 40% discount on one year of service as well as a bonus $25 Dell gift card to spend on electronics, games, and of course computers. \n24\" Dell 1920x1080 LED Monitor for $89.99 (Orig $189.99) Use code: SAVE52 . Typically speaking we expect to see a 24\" monitor on sale for around $120. Getting it $30 below a sale price is a fantastic deal and it's a Dell. They are one of the bigger names in monitors and make some of the best around. \nDoorbuster Deal - Dell Optiplex 3040 Micro Intel Core i3-6100T Dual-Core Desktop w/ 3yr Warranty for $399 (Orig $727) Use code: DT399 . If you wanted a desktop but hate the space they take up this is the deal for you. This micro desktop has the same sized footprint as an iPad and has the power of a desktop. It takes up very little room on a desk and can be mounted behind a monitor, underneath a desk or anywhere else. It is a business class desktop and made for security, ease of maintenance and best of all has almost no junk software that PC manufacturers love to include. McAfee Total Protection (Unlimited PC & Mobile Devices) for $9.99 (Orig $49.99) This is the lowest price we've seen and at $10 it's far cheaper than any anti-virus program we've seen. This protects your computer, tablets and smartphones from viruses. It will also manage your passwords, encrypt your files, and can be installed on every device you own. For $10 this gives you a ton of features beyond any anti-virus. \n55\" Sony XBR-55X700D 4K LED HDTV + Bonus PlayStation 4 Pro TV for $999.99 (Orig $1,297.99) The PlayStation 4 Pro costs about $400 and the TV sells for $900 on most stores online so you are really getting an excellent bundle here. This TV supports HDR and 4K, both technologies the PS4 Pro was designed to handle for gaming. You effectively future proof both your TV and your gaming system for a few years to come. Amazon Paperwhite eReader w/ Backlight (Amazon Certified Refurbished 1-Year Warranty) $79.99 (Orig $109) This is the Kindle of choice for readers and is the lowest price we've seen (usually $100 on sale new). It has a high resolution 300ppi display for sharp text and has a built-in light so that you can read in the dark. There is no screen glare so you can enjoy it while reading outside in the sunlight. If you read a book a month and take your Kindle around a few times a year this is a good choice for you \nAmazon Kindle Voyager 6\" eReader w/ Adaptive Light (Amazon Certified Refurbished w/ 1-Year Warranty) $119.99 (Orig $199.99) The Kindle voyager is thinner, lighter and has a more premium feel than the Paperwhite. It has a magnesium backing and has a sleeker design. It's definitely the Kindle of choice if you read and travel a lot as its micro-etched display has better contrast, its better material is more durable and has a better adaptive light, as well as PagePress buttons that will make this a pleasure for avid readers. \nDisclosure: This is brought to you by the Entrepreneur Partner Studio.

      "text": "This should get interesting quick. Published reports say that Amazon soon will be pushing its video service into 200 countries, creating a deep-pocketed competitor for Netflix which has a head start forging its global footprint. \nRight now, in addition to the U.S., Amazon is only in the U.K., Japan, Germany, Austria and revving up for India, The Wall Street Journal says . (It’s also available, in a limited and unpublicized way, in Australia, as of this week.)\nIn those countries, it likes to lock up regional hits and stars, while Netflix goes for a bigger global-appeal approach. That may be because Netflix is already all over the world. Its global expansion really pushed up a year ago to include everyplace unless you’re in China. It’s now in about 190 countries, the Journal says. Putting those two heavyweights against each other would seem to increase the value of international content rights and likelihood of international casting. Netflix has 87 million subscribers; its growth is slowing in the U.S. where it may have tapped out the market, or nearly so. Amazon Prime Video is harder to pin down. Investors.com, citing Consumer Intelligence Research Partners  tabulations, said at the beginning of 2016,  Amazon had more U.S. subscribers (54 million) than Netflix (44.7 million). The trick is that Amazon Prime Video is just a part of a subscription to the Amazon Prime shopping service, and there were reports in the spring that something like 20% of the Amazon Prime customers never-- ever-- availed themselves to the video content, or possibly even knew it existed,  That's because Amazon never promotes it equal to its value, it seems to me. Maybe Amazon just has a hard time recognizing it's in the business?  Amazon this year introduced a monthly Amazon Prime subscription, apparently so consumers could test out the shopping service, and possibly so the video-curious consumer could see what “Transparent” is all about.\nIt’s always struck me strange that a renowned merchandise marketer at one end of the business could be as confusing and lame on the other. Amazon Prime Video is misunderstood here, and now possibly, it will extend the puzzlement worldwide. Actually, “announcing” Amazon’s global initiative was equally strange. Jeremy Clarkson, the star of the upcoming Amazon series, “The Grand Tour” automotive joke vehicle,  tweeted out that the program would debut in in 200 nations in December. “Amazon has gone global,” he tweeted, though like a lot of Amazon’s video adventures, you could have missed it. \npj@mediapost.com",

      "text": "Twitter When can I watch the next episode of The Grand Tour on Amazon? The new Amazon series is being streamed weekly; find out where and when the next episode will be available to watch on Amazon   \nBy Radio Times staff   12:10PM \nAmazon's new series The Grand Tour launches at midnight UK time from Friday 18 November. But there's one problem: for viewers used to binge watching a new on demand series as soon as it comes out, we've got bad news for you... \nThe series will air weekly on Amazon rather than landing all at once. The first episode will be released at 00:01 GMT on Friday 18th November, coming from Dry Rabbit Lake in California, USA. \nSubsequent episodes will be released weekly every week for the next three months. When can I watch The Grand Tour episode two – and where is it set? \nEpisode 2 is available on Amazon from Friday 25th November. The studio location is The Cradle of Humankind near Johannesburg in South Africa. \nCheck out the official synopsis for The Grand Tour episode 2. \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May bring the travelling Grand Tour tent to The Cradle of Humankind near Johannesburg in South Africa. In this show, the three hosts are forced to become special forces soldiers with an all action challenge at a top secret training base, deep within Jordan. Also in this episode, Jeremy introduces the 800 horsepower Aston Martin Vulcan to the Grand Tour test track, and James is sent to investigate an unusual form of motorsport called spinning. \nSubsequent episodes will come from locations including Whitby, Rotterdam, Lapland, Stuttgart, Nashville, Loch Ness in Scotland, and Dubai.",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nFri, Nov 18, 2016, 15:02 GMT - UK Markets close in 1 hr 28 mins Amazon video going global with rival to 'Top Gear' By Sophie ESTIENNE | AFP – 4 hours ago View Photo \n\nAmazon is set to challenge Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) worldwide with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service featuring its remake of the BBC's global hit \"Top Gear.\" \nAmazon Prime Video is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. \nAmazon's take on \"Top Gear,\" called \"The Grand Tour,\" made its Prime debut Thursday in the existing markets including Britain and the United States -- to rapturous reviews from the UK press. \nAmazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos tweeted that the global rollout of \"The Grand Tour\" would come in December. \nIts colorful main host, Jeremy Clarkson, was dropped from the madcap BBC show after he punched a producer in March. \nThe BBC came back with a rebooted version featuring new presenters including British broadcaster Chris Evans, but he quit after only one series following downbeat reviews of the program, which has 350 million viewers per week in 170 countries. \nAmazon seized on the opportunity of hiring Clarkson (LSE: CKN.L - news ) and his two co-presenters to use the motoring show as a flagship product for its global ambitions. \n\"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere,\" Clarkson tweeted. \"Amazon has gone global.\" \nHow the show will be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service. \n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" beyond Bezos' announcement, an Amazon spokeswoman told AFP. \n- Eyes on Netflix (Swiss: NFLX-USD.SW - news ) - \nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over its own growth. \nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers. \nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company is gaining momentum as a global TV feed. \nFor the current quarter Netflix forecast a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. \nThe service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers. \nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street. \nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange (LSE: 0OQV.L - news ) is the New Black.\" \nhgfdsaNetflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion (7 billion euros) -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit (Stuttgart: A1139A - news ) . \n- Offering originals - \nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. \nOriginal Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won prestigious Emmy Awards in the US. \nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store, which has moved dramatically beyond its early days as a bookseller. \nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier.

      "title": "How Many Counterfeit CDs Is Amazon Selling?",
      "text": "While it's difficult to get an exact number on such things, it seems as though Amazon has been doing a tidy trade in counterfeit CDs of late, with third party merchants now ripping albums off platforms like YouTube and reselling them in a physical format. \n\nGuest post from Chris Castle of Artist Rights Watch \nA provocative question–of course knowing the answer precisely would mean that Amazon actually knew which CDs were counterfeit to begin with. That means we need to guess, but sometimes guesses are more accurate than we may give them credit for. \nExample? For years we heard that about 20% of songs on streaming services were unlicensed. Turns out that’s pretty close to true. When it’s expressed as a percentage rather than a raw number, it may not sound so bad. 20% sounds a lot better than 4 million, right? This is an old Google trick–telling us that the amount of bad behavior is a low percentage. They leave out the “of what” step, which in Google’s case is always an astronomical number due to scale. \nThat same basic theory works with Amazon, too. While Amazon is busy stiffing songwriters with filing mass NOIs that absolve them from paying songwriter royalties, it turns out that Amazon is also making a tidy profit selling counterfeit CDs. \nIt’s also hard to extract the exact number of CDs that Amazon sells, but Soundscan reports about 34 million in sales in the “Internet” category. Let’s be conservative at say that Amazon is about 1/3 of that number. That would mean that based on recent estimates, Amazon sold about 2 million counterfeit records in 2015 alone. \nTwo million counterfeits sold by the smartest guys in the room. A public reporting company that supposed to be at the leading edge of all things great and good. More like the bleeding edge. \nBut this raises another question. At one time, counterfeits were mostly major label releases of hit records that could hide in the cracks. Based on the mass NOI filings, it now looks like some counterfeits may be stream ripped from YouTube and then sold as CDs. \nIt’s absurd that Amazon is a counterfeit swap meet, but it’s even more absurd that they didn’t see it coming. \nOr maybe they did. \nRelated articles This Week In Music Commentary Indie Label Association Issues \"Serious\" Alert For Counterfeit CDs For Sale Via Amazon - hypebot 23% Of CDs Sold On Amazon Are Counterfeit, Say Investigators - hypebot Introducing: Vinyl Tuesday, A Physical Music Initiative ",

      "text": "Getty Images When a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other's cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other's technology and even our passwords. \nBut your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? \nMore from USA Today: \nCybersecurity experts offer advice for incoming Trump administration \nSpaceX looks to the skies to bring faster Internet \nAirbnb hosts can now also make money as tour guides \nHere are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn't located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) \nAmazon \nAmazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. \nThe good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history, so you never have this issue again. \nLet's say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. \nYou can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you've archived the order, and now you're waiting for the package to arrive. But you're receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? \nWith the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what's inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! \nGoogle \nGoogle often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube. \nTo delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. \nBetter yet, take control of the data Google saves about you. Click here for step-by-step instructions on how to stop Google from collecting data about you. \nMost browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser's preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you're researching something a little unusual. \nFacebook \nFor many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. \nYour significant other may wonder why you've become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. \nThe easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. \nYour Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. \nNetflix \nWe all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier's \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. \nIf you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren't always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. \nNetflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don't bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. \nGo incognito \nEvery major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you weren't online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. \nMaintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes. To learn other ways to protect your information, be sure to listen or download my podcasts, or click here to find it on your local radio station. You can listen to the Kim Komando Show on your phone, tablet or computer. From buying advice to digital life issues, click here for my free podcasts.",

      "text": "Glass November 17, 2016 \nAmazon’s biggest new show, The Grand Tour, premieres today, with the team formerly of the BBC’s Top Gear traveling in expensive cars around the world. It is rumored to cost a whopping £4.5 million ($5.6 million) a show—and Jeremy Clarkson is reportedly making $12.4 million a year to host. \nHe’s not the only streaming-video star taking home a hefty paycheck. The Hollywood Reporter notes that Amazon is paying Robert De Niro $750,000 for each of the 20 episodes of an upcoming series. Jonah Hill and Emma Stone will get $350,000 per episode to star in an upcoming Netflix show called Maniac. Back on premium cable, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson makes $450,000 per episode on the HBO comedy Ballers. (HBO, it should be noted, is trying to be more like Netflix .) \nThese figures are insane, sure. Netflix, Amazon, and HBO are digging deep into their pockets to secure the best talent. HBO is expected to spend about $1.8 billion this year, 20% more than in 2015, while Netflix plans to spend a staggering $6 billion on content next year and Amazon has boosted its content budget too. \nBut these platforms also pay more for talent upfront, because actors and creators miss out on the ancillary income they would typically get from syndication—when a show is sold on to other networks. That has all changed with streaming. Netflix, in particular, has kept an iron grip on the global rights to most of its programming, rarely releasing it outside of the platform , which means actors don’t get their usual cut of other revenue streams that would have come down the road. \nAn example: the US sitcom Friends still makes about $1 billion a year in syndication revenue for Warner Bros. Each of the show’s core cast members—Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer—takes home about 2% of that, which translates to roughly $20 million per year in syndication income. Each. And that’s for a show that ended 12 years ago. \nDe Niro’s flat fee of $15 million for 20 episodes at Amazon seems like a bargain in comparison. \nStreaming services like Netflix and Amazon account for that when they negotiate deals. Most of Netflix’s deals now have a flat “buy out,” according the Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why the checks are so big,” Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos reportedly said. “We are negotiating for what the backend would be.” \nThe same is true with films, an earlier Hollywood Reporter story showed. Few Netflix movies go to theaters and those that do are released online the same day, which limits the audience who will pay to see them in theaters. When Netflix is negotiating for the rights to films, it often buys out the cut that actors and creators would get from box-office profits, which is known as profit participation. Amazon offers a small, exclusive window for its theatrical releases, so it likely doesn’t have to buy out the profit participants. \nThis means that Netflix and Amazon’s deep pockets are driving up costs for everyone. Why would someone like De Niro wait for his $15 million when he can get it upfront and work with other A-list talent? Read full story ",

      "text": "0 IT DOESN’T TAKE A GENIUS TO FIGURE OUT WHY “WASHINGTON POST” IS AGAINST TRUMP. Washington Post is owned by JEFF BEZOS the owner of Amazon. Amazon profits from cheap, “free trade” goods from China and low wage, low cost employees. Bezos doesn’t want Trump to change any of that. November 18, 2016 \nby Tim \nA rearranging of free trade agreements with China would cost Amazon $100’s of million$. An increase in wages as the cheap immigrant labor supply is cut off would erode profit margins. These policies represent SERIOUS harm for Amazon. Perhaps he thought that by buying the Washington Post he could influence policy and elections in his favor. \nIt should be pointed out that “The Washington Post” makes a loss so he didn’t buy it for the money. He’s a shrewd man and bought it for influence. \nAccording to sources, the Post’s digital revenue is around $60 million, far below what the newsroom needs to function . The last time total operating revenue for the paper was published, in 2012, it was $580 million; one former executive estimates today it’s probably closer to $350 million. Another Post veteran told me that Bezos said in a meeting that the company’s annual budget, currently around $500 million, will have to be cut by 50 percent over the next three years. The newspaper denies this, and so does Prakash, who does, however, confirm that Bezos told him, “We can’t be an organization that loses gobs and gobs of money.” \nhttp://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/washington-post-jeff-bezos-donald-trump.html \nAnother unelected billionaire trying to influence the process gets BTFO. \nNo one works in Amazon Warehouses because they want to. They are their because America lost all the good jobs. \nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/amazon-devastating-expose-accuses-internet-retailer-of-oppressive-and-callous-attitude-to-staff-10458159.html \nWorking four days in a row without sleep; a woman with breast cancer being put on “performance-improvement plans” together with another who had just had a stillborn child; staff routinely bursting into tears; continual monitoring; workers encouraged to turn on each other to keep their jobs. \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/18/amazon-regime-making-british-staff-physically-and-mentally-ill-says-union \nAmazon ‘regime’ making British staff physically and mentally ill, says union \nBaker said some employees were suffering from musculoskeletal problems, work-related stress and anxiety. “We’re seeing this specifically because of the regimes they work under.” \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/01/week-amazon-insider-feature-treatment-employees-work \nIn reference to Amazon is like Santa: \nIf Santa had a track record in paying his temporary elves the minimum wage while pushing them to the limits of the EU working time directive, and sacking them if they take three sick breaks in any three-month period, this would be an apt comparison. It is probably reasonable to assume that tax avoidance is not “constitutionally” a part of the Santa business model as Brad Stone, the author of a new book on Amazon, The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon, tells me it is in Amazon’s case. Neither does Santa attempt to bully his competitors, as Mark Constantine, the founder of Lush cosmetics, who last week took Amazon to the high court, accuses it of doing. Santa was not called before the Commons public accounts committee and called “immoral” by MPs. \nhttp://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/worse_than_wal_mart_amazons_sick_brutality_and_secret_history_of_ruthlessly_intimidating_workers/ \nAmazon’s system of employee monitoring is the most oppressive I have ever come across. \nTargets for the unpacking, movement, and repackaging of goods are relentlessly increased to levels where employees have to struggle to meet their targets and where older and less dextrous employees will begin to fail. \nproviding UK employees with cheap, ill-fitting boots that gave them blisters; relying on employment agencies to hire temporary workers whom Amazon can pay less, avoid paying them benefits, \nintimidated temporary workers lodged in a company dormitory near Amazon’s depot at Bad Hersfeld, Germany, with guards entering their rooms without permission at all times of the day and night. \nPerhaps the biggest scandal in Amazon’s recent history took place at its Allentown, Pennsylvania, \nThe series revealed the lengths Amazon was prepared to go to keep costs down and output high and yielded a singular image of Amazon’s ruthlessness—ambulances stationed on hot days at the Amazon center to take employees suffering from heat stroke to the hospital. Despite the summer weather, there was no air-conditioning in the depot, and Amazon refused to let fresh air circulate by opening loading doors at either end of the depot—for fear of theft. Inside the plant there was no slackening of the pace, even as temperatures rose to more than 100 degrees. \nOn July 25, with temperatures in the depot reaching 110 degrees, a security guard reported to OSHA that Amazon was refusing to open garage doors to help air circulate and that he had seen two pregnant women taken to a nursing station \nCalls to the local ambulance service became so frequent that for five hot days in June and July, ambulances and paramedics were stationed all day at the depot. \n^ Why Trump won Pennsylvania?",

She wrote: 'That Christmas advert is so heart warming and the fact they used my favourite song by Ludovico Einaudi.' \nTwitter user Han enthused: 'THE NEW AMAZON PRIME ADVERT WINS THE AWARD FOR THE BEST CHRISTMAS ADVERT HOW AMAZING IS THAT.' \nDonna added: 'Got to be honest I love the #amazon Christmas advert. So lovely,' while Nimra said it was 'so cute'. \nInzy Rashid wrote: '@amazon smashed their UK Christmas advert! Best one I've seen yet by far!' \nHowever it wasn't all positive; Badar Salem blasted their festive offering as 'pathetic' while Amerikanida tweeted: 'Just saw the new Amazon Christmas advert on tv. Yikes.' \nThe vicar goes online to order his friend a pair of knee pads. Secfrancis tweeted the retailer directly to say she was 'extremely impressed' with the advert and its 'beautiful message' \nThe imam receives his surprise delivery. One viewer, clearly impressed, wrote: 'That Christmas advert is so heart warming and the fact they used my favourite song by Ludovico Einaudi' \nThe imam pulls on his knee pads to help him when kneeling to pray. Inzy Rashid wrote: '@amazon smashed their UK Christmas advert! Best one I've seen yet by far!' \nViewers were clearly touched by the clip, taking to social media to gush about it, with Twitter user Milhouse writing: 'Amazon Christmas advert hands down won it this year, proper love it' \nAmazon Prime released the advert online and on TV in the UK, US and Germany on Wednesday, and it has already racked up 65,000 views on YouTube. \nThey explained: 'The Amazon Prime advertisement tells a story of a Christian Vicar and a Muslim Imam who are lifelong friends but aren’t as sprightly as they were in their youth. \n'One day the Vicar has a moment of inspiration and decides to do something to make the Imam’s life and work a little easier. What the Vicar doesn’t know, is the Imam also has the same idea for the Vicar.' \nWhile many viewers gushed over the 'beautiful' and 'heartwarming' advert, it wasn't all positive; Amerikanida tweeted: 'Just saw the new Amazon Christmas advert on tv. Yikes' \nSimon Morris, director of advertising at Amazon, told the Guardian: 'We think it is a legitimate story. We are conscious that some people may be sensitive to it. It is about selflessness and thinking of other people.' \nHe added that Amazon had 'sought counsel' from the Church of England, the Muslim Council of Great Britain and the Christian Muslim Forum before making the ad. \nAmazon Prime, who released the clip ahead of next week's Black Friday shopping bonanza, come day after Sainsbury's M&S and John Lewis released their festive adverts. \nJohn Lewis' £7million Christmas campaign made Buster the trampolining Boxer dog into an overnight celebrity, while M&S focused on a Bond-style Mrs Claus delivering a present to six-year-old Jake.

      "text": "If you want to get a head start on Amazon's Black Friday deals, you don't even have to lift a finger.\nThe mega-retailer is hosting its first-ever \"voice shopping weekend\" from now through Nov. 21, allowing folks with devices such as Amazon Echo and Echo Dot to take advantage of exclusive sales simply by ordering via voice. \nGeorge W. Bailey / Shutterstock.com \nYou can see all of this weekend's Alexa deals by visiting Amazon's Voice Shopping page. Ordering is as simple as saying things like \"Alexa, order a Samsung TV,\" or \"Alexa, order a Star Wars robot.\" Here are some highlights of this weekend's specials:\nAmazon Tap for $79 ($50 off) Amazon Tap Sling Cover for $15 ($5 off) Samsung 32-inch 1080p TV for $119 ($80 off) Sphero BB-8 Robot for $90 ($30 off) Alexa-enabled Philips Hue LED Starter Kit for $55 ($70 off) MORE: The Best Pre-Black Friday Tech Deals \nTo sweeten the deal, Amazon is throwing in a free $5 gift card for anyone who orders something over $10 via Alexa. That could come in handy while browsing the retailer's bevy of Black Friday deals , which have already kicked off and will last until Dec. 22.\nAlexa is currently available on Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap speakers, as well as on Fire TV and select Fire Tablets. She's a pretty nifty assistant that can control your music and tell you the news and weather — it certainly doesn't hurt that she can also save you some cash. \nSee Also : 20 Best Amazon Alexa Skills \nWhat Is Amazon Prime? How to Get the Best Laptop Deals on Black Friday The Best Tech Gifts For Everyone On Your List\nAbout the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide. When he's not writing about mobile tech and gaming, you can usually catch him playing Street Fighter, devouring Twitch streams and trying to convince people that Hawkeye is the best Avenger.\nRead more Amazon Black Friday Add a comment Comment Firstname Submit Ask a Category Expert Create a new thread in the Digital Cameras forum about this subject Title Title Subject Publish No comments yet Your comment Comment Firstname Submit",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Amazon Prime)\nWarning: This piece contains minor spoilers for early episodes of The Grand Tour . \nLadies and gentlemen, our long wait is over. The first episode of The Grand Tour —the new motoring show from Messrs. Clarkson, Hammond, and May—arrived on Amazon Prime today (November 18). I'm here to tell you the truth: it. is. AMAZING.\nAs you will no doubt remember, the Top Gear trio left the BBC following Clarkson's late night loss-of-temper with one of the show's producers. The BBC drafted in a new cast for the long-running programme, led by Chris Evans and Matt Le Blanc, but the re-helmed Top Gear went down like a lead balloon with audiences and Chris Evans fell on his sword as a result. Meanwhile, buoyed with a budget that's believed to top $5.5 million an episode, Clarkson et al. went to work on what may be seen as their magnum opus.\nRead 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

The new Amazon series is being streamed weekly; find out where and when the next episode will be available to watch on Amazon   Radio Times staff  17AM \nAmazon's new series The Grand Tour launches at midnight UK time from Friday 18 November. But there's one problem: for viewers used to binge watching a new on demand series as soon as it comes out, we've got bad news for you... \nThe series will air weekly on Amazon rather than landing all at once. The first episode will be released at 00:01 GMT on Friday 18th November, coming from Dry Rabbit Lake in California, USA. \nSubsequent episodes will be released weekly every week for the next three months. When can I watch The Grand Tour episode two – and where is it set? \nEpisode 2 is available on Amazon from Friday 25th November. The studio location is The Cradle of Humankind near Johannesburg in South Africa. \nCheck out the official synopsis for The Grand Tour episode 2. \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May bring the travelling Grand Tour tent to The Cradle of Humankind near Johannesburg in South Africa. In this show, the three hosts are forced to become special forces soldiers with an all action challenge at a top secret training base, deep within Jordan. Also in this episode, Jeremy introduces the 800 horsepower Aston Martin Vulcan to the Grand Tour test track, and James is sent to investigate an unusual form of motorsport called spinning. \nSubsequent episodes will come from locations including Whitby, Rotterdam, Lapland, Stuttgart, Nashville, Loch Ness in Scotland, and Dubai.",

      "text": "“Alexa, call me an Uber. No wait, scratch that—buy me a car.”\nIf you’ve succumbed to a life made simpler by Amazon—whether it’s a Prime membership that you use to ship everything you buy as fast as possible, or to watch all your TV shows, or you’ve bought a wall of buttons to order whatever you need—Amazon’s latest offering might be for you. Assuming you still go outside, that is.\nAmazon will start selling cars on its Italian website, Reuters reported Nov. 18. The company has secured a partnership with Fiat Chrysler to sell some of its models online. Initially, Italian Amazon customers will be able to purchase three of Fiat Chrysler’s smaller vehicles, the Fiat 500, 500L, and the Panda. Customers can click on the model they want, with the packages they’d like included, and after the purchase is complete, an Amazon representative will be in touch about picking the car up when it’s ready. Reuters said it should take about two weeks to fulfill an order, so quite a bit slower than Amazon Prime.\n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, Fiat Chrysler’s Italian representative, said during an online press conference, according to Reuters.\nAmazon wasn’t immediately available to confirm whether the service would eventually be extended beyond Italy, or the three models available. Amazon has had a portal on its website for years where users can research all sorts of makes and models of cars, but this is the first time that a customer would be able to buy a car from a manufacturer the same way that they could buy detergent, books, or a box of live ladybugs .\nPerhaps in the near future, you’ll be able to fire up Alexa and ask it to reserve you a new Chrysler Pacifica , or get an Amazon Dash button you can press every time you need a new car. It’s a brave new world.",

By: FE Online | Published: November 19, 2016 11:05 AM In their Christmas advertisement, Amazon shows the friendship between a Christian and a Muslim man. (Reuters) \nOnline shopping company Amazon highlighted a moment of friendship that represents the interfaith solidarity and harmony the world needs. In their Christmas advertisement, Amazon shows the friendship between a Christian and a Muslim man. While reports of Islamophobia have been running rampant in the United States and the United Kingdom among other countries, Amazon was seen promoting interfaith friendship and sent a message that one doesn’t need to follow the same religion to be a good friend. \nIn the ad, the imam visits his friend, a priest. Then they catch up on the old memories and the pain and troubles of old age. And at the end of the advertisement, both of them order the same gift for each other; kneepads to ease each other’s knees while they kneel to pray. While the ad is scripted, actors are religious leaders in real life. The role of the priest is played by Rev. Gary Bradley, a vicar of a London Church, whereas Zubeir Hassam, principal of the Muslim School Oadby, in Leicester plays the imam. \nHassam told the Telegraph that despite the ad being scripted, it was a reflection of his real life. He said that this was what he actually did in the society. He confesses hat he did not have to act but just be himself. Speaking about Islamophobia, Hassam said that with all the bad publicity they have had, this commercial was a very positive way of showing that different people of different faiths could get together. According to reports by the Guardian, Amazon had consulted with the Church of England, the Muslim council of Great Britain and the Christian Muslim Forum to make sure that the commercial did not disrespect any tradition. Simon Morris, Director of advertising at Amazon told the Huffington Post that they thought that the ad shows a very authentic and charming story. He said that this was a legitimate story. He further stated that the understood that some people might be sensitive to it but it was about selflessness. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "E-mail \nAmazon’s Alexa voice assistant can now be found in an interesting new form factor: inside the adorable Omate Yumi home robot. Omate, who is known for their smart watch offers the Yumi at a starting price of just $369 via an early bird special at Indie Gogo, $230 less than the ASUS Zenbo, a similarly compact home robot unveiled at Computex 2016. In comparison, the Omate Yumi is slightly smaller at only 11.7 inches compared to the Zenbo and lacks the same flexible mobility. It does have wheeled rotor engines however and can be used as a remote inspection device ordered to roll around the house from a smartphone. \nJust like the Amazon Echo, the Yumi is fully interactive and receives voice commands and it can also interact with other artificial intelligence assistants in the same network. Inside is a full Android ecosystem which gives it a leg up when it comes to developer friendliness. Users can even run their own customized Android apps, develop Amazon Alexa skills or port any artificial intelligence on top of Yumi. \nThe Omate Yumi’s adorable face can even be customized as it is essentially a 5-inch 720p capacitive touch panel display. A 1.3GHz Quad Core ARM Cortex A53 64-bit processor is at its heart with an ARM Mali T720 GPU for handling graphics. It uses 1GB of LPDDR3 RAM for memory and has 8GB of eMMC for storage. Wireless connectivity capabilities 802.11AC WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. \nOmate’s Indiegogo campaign has a month left to go and is approaching the half-way point of their goal of $30,000. With $369 USD, users will receive a Yumi unit with free shipping, a limited edition beta unit which includes a certificate acknowledging its initial limited run of 100 units.",

      "text": "Spasho LQ889 So as someone who has recently gotten a Wii U and hasn't gotten used to their pricing system, is this something i should jump at? I understand that select games are cheaper in general, but should i immediately buy all the games i want. Worried that more deals will come black Fridays or that these prices come regularly now and then. Feel it might be best to buy Mario for now and wait out the rest? There's a slim chance it could happen and 'slim' because the WiiU is unpopular so in the event of a Black Friday sale, they'd just be getting rid of stock they can't sell. ​Thanks think I'll go with Mario for now see how it plays out, worse case scenario theres no sale and these go up in price. Luckily it looks like preowned versions of these games go for cheaper in their original packaging, so thats a big plus.",
