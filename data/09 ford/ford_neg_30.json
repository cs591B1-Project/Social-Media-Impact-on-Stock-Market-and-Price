      "text": "Ford To Start Testing Autonomous Vehicles In Europe In 2017 | By Share Having tripled its U.S. fleet of autonomous Fusion Hybrids this year, Ford is getting ready to start conducting tests with its self-driving cars on European roads as well in 2017. Its goal is to accomplish level four with on the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) scale, which is one step away from fully autonomous driving. “We have already announced plans to use an autonomous vehicle for a ride-sharing service in the US in 2021 and it is important that we extend our testing to Europe”, Ford Europe’s autonomous driving manager Thomas Lukaszewic told Autocar . “Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists.” The Blue Oval, which will triple its fleet again in 2017, boasts it’s the global leader in connectivity, mobility and autonomous vehicles and intends to have a “high-volume, fully-autonomous” vehicle in operation by 2021. Quite a challenge because, unlike the States, said vehicle must be able to operate under quite different conditions for, as Lukaszewic noted, traffic conditions vary from one country to another in Europe, something that poses a challenge for autonomous technology.

      "text": "The CEO of Ford just perfectly summarized the biggest problem for electric cars Published by Business Insider on Sun, 04 Dec 2016 The year 2010 seems like a long time ago. That was when a bold future for electric cars appeared to be opening.Tesla was about to roll out its first original design for an EV, the Model S, which would go on to be named Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2013.There's were numerous electric-car startups aiming to join Tesla, and the major automakers were producing their first EVs since GM had killed it EV-1 in the 1990s.Since then, the promise of an electric-car revolution hasn't just failed to materializeit's actuallyretreated.The reason is simple: consumers don't want electric cars. It's the D-worddemand. And demand isn't there.This market reality has collided head-on with an increase in federal fuel-economy standards, mandated by the EPA. Automakers want the government to ease up on the timetable, so that they can sell as many profitable pickup trucks and SUV in the US as possible, while sales are running at historically record levels and gas is cheap.This is purely good businesscarmakers want to bolster their balance sheets now, while the bolstering opportunity is good, ahead of the inevitable downturn.Trump to the rescue'Auto industry leaders are now seizing a chance to get President-elect Donald Trump's administration to give them a break, while at the same time not completely backing off the EV aspects of their product portfolios.Here's Bloomberg'sJohn Lippert and Jamie Butters:Ford Motor Co. plans to lobbyPresident-electDonald Trump to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rulesthat hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electriccars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand.In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in theU.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,Mark Fields, chief executive officer of Ford, said in aninterview at Bloombergs Southfield, Michigan, office Friday.Fast forward to 2016, theres 55 models, and year to date its2.8 percent.Fields is as committed as anyone to making sure that Ford is part of whatever revolution in transportation occurs in the coming decades, but he doesn't have the luxury of being a starry-eyed visionary. His job is to make sure that Ford is profitable, that it's balance sheet is strong, that it maintains or grows market share in critical parts of the world, and that it doesn't fall behind on innovation, in all areas of the business.If you look at the simple math that Fields presented, it's not hard to see why he wants the EPA's expectations to be adjusted. There's been a more-than-fourfold increase in the number of EVs for sale in US, and yet the market for those EVs has grown by a negligible 0.5%. Compliance for its own sakeThe billions being spent to develop and market EVs aren't being completely incineratedthese customer-less cars have value as \"compliance\" vehicles to meet government regulations. But building more of them for that goal is now officially running counter to the financial interests of the automakers.This isn't a sustainable situation. Almost all of the planet's vehicles currently run on gas or diesel. That's unlikely to change fordecades. Everybody knows that it would be good for the environment to get more gas and diesel cars off he road, but there has to be some kind of business value that the replacement electric vehicles provide.Until consumer and carmakers can figure out how to make that happen, the automakers' case to have the government back off its fuel-economy requirements will be strong.SEE ALSO:The US auto market is on the verge of doing something it's never done before ' againJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: Trump said he prevented a Ford factory from leaving the US ' but the company says the move was never planned Premium Times Headlines Today [Sun-04-Dec-2016]",

      "text": "By John Smith \nFord Motor company CEO, Mark Fields, a staunch Trump opponent during the presidential campaign, now wants the President Elect to help with EPA’s surprise decision to keep long term fuel economy targets in place. \nA mid-term review of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) targets set in 2012 kicked off earlier this year, but the timing of the agency’s recent decision to maintain the 54.5 mile-per-gallon goal reeks of politics, Fields claims. \nFor automakers, reaching 54.5 mpg means extra costs. To avoid this, Ford is prepared to turn to its election campaign sparring partner — President-elect Donald Trump — for help. \nMeeting federally mandated CAFE (Corporate Annual Fuel Economy) standards has become one of the huge cost factors to automakers not only in R&D costs and technology improvements, but in managing the fleet average. If the new line high performance muscle cars are huge sellers, then this must be balanced with production of smaller, higher efficiency cars which may not be attractive to buyers in certain markets. For example, the manufacture and sale of electric vehicles may allow an automaker to achieve the fleet standard, but will also likely result in a financial loss for the manufacturer. \nThe extra mileage mandated by the EPA means automakers will likely fill the gap with money-losing electric cars and pricey hybrids. General Motors expects to lose $9,000 on every Chevrolet Bolt, so it’s not a recipe for profit. While Ford has plans to expand its EV offerings, it does so tentatively. \nTo return auto worker jobs to the US, Trump and the automakers must take a combined approach to mitigate the higher costs associated with American labor. Repealing Obamacare, dealing with union demands, corporate tax breaks and finally reeling in the EPA’s CAFE standards would be among the keys to returning manufacturing to the US. \nTrump has already selected Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute as his EPA transition chief. Ebell, referred to as a “climate skeptic” in the MSM, is no doubt on board with Trump’s longstanding charge that the EPA does more harm to business and American interests than can possibly be gained by arbitrary environmental regulations. For the auto industry, I think that we have long since reached the point of diminishing returns on cost vs. benefit on fuel efficiency and emissions. Ebell, and the appointment of Elaine Chao as Transportation Secretary with the obvious link to the legislative branch through her husband Mitch McConnell, gives Trump a one-two punch to boost US auto manufacturing. \nJohn Smith is the pen name of a retired US intelligence officer \nThomas Lifson adds: \nThe CAFE standards have driven small car manufacturing investments into Mexico. I know for a fact from my consulting work that it is virtually impossible to make money manufacturing small cars in the United States. Ford invested in a massive factory in Hermosillo, Mexico to manufacture Ford Escorts. This model is essential to Ford’s ability to sell much more profitable large cars and SUVs. \nFord Motor company CEO, Mark Fields, a staunch Trump opponent during the presidential campaign, now wants the President Elect to help with EPA’s surprise decision to keep long term fuel economy targets in place. \nA mid-term review of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) targets set in 2012 kicked off earlier this year, but the timing of the agency’s recent decision to maintain the 54.5 mile-per-gallon goal reeks of politics, Fields claims. \nFor automakers, reaching 54.5 mpg means extra costs.

      "text": "New York (AFP) - Ford on Friday announced the recall of nearly 650,000 cars in North America over defective seat belts that can fail in a crash.\nThe automaker said two accidents and two injuries have been blamed on the defect, which involves overheating of the cables in the pre-tensioning system of the seat belts, which can prevent them from functioning correctly in an accident.\nOf the total recalled, 602,000 were sold in the United States, 35,600 in Canada and 8,600 in Mexico.\nThe recall covers the 2013-2016 Ford Fusion and the 2013-2015 Lincoln MKZ, produced at plants in Flat Rock, Michigan and Hermosillo, Mexico. Some Ford Mondeos also have been recalled but they are not in North America.\nIn the United States, vehicle manufacturers are legally obliged to publicly announce recall operations to correct defects found on their vehicles.",

      "text": "Ford: Loss to Bengals casts shadow on seasons to come Updated: December 4, 2016 — 4:18 PM EST 3 Share Bob Ford INQUIRER COLUMNIST \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. Ford has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1981, when he served as the Phillies beat writer and later as a general sports columnist for the Delaware County Daily Times. More by Bob Ford Nov 30 \nCINCINNATI - Sunday's game against the Bengals was a loss of such thoroughness at the hands of a mediocre team that it didn't just turn out the lights on this Eagles season, but it also threw a deep shadow on seasons to come. \nThis was a game the Eagles had to win in order to keep alive their increasingly threadbare playoff hopes. Every coach knew it, every player knew it. Every member of the 3-7-1 Bengals knew it, too. The Eagles were going to come into Paul Brown Stadium and give them their best shot. \nOh, my. \nIf the 32-14 loss was their best - and apparently it was - then not only is their best not good enough, but it will take a major overhaul of the roster, and perhaps the way it is coached, to make this team competitive again. It isn't as if there is one aspect of the team that needs to be fixed in order to settle things down. On Sunday, it was an utter collapse of both the offense and the defense in a game the Eagles needed for survival. Instead of rising to the occasion, the Eagles played as if the season were already over and they were ready to acknowledge it. \nMaybe the worst revelation of the day was that Carson Wentz didn't keep his head above water any better than his teammates. The rookie quarterback the franchise sacrificed so much to draft, the player on whom the future rests, was very bad until the game was out of reach and the Bengals were losing interest. \nWentz was inaccurate and unsettled all afternoon. He threw three interceptions and, being charitable, could easily have had a couple more. He got the ball out, but it went all over the place. \nThe Eagles weren't going to win this game, almost regardless of what the quarterback did. But he put roller skates on the slide downhill to a 19-0 deficit in the first half with an 8-for-18 start that stalled drive after drive. \nAs always, if you are looking to let Wentz off easily, there are reasons to do so. The offensive line was unreliable and Wentz was smacked around or under duress for much of the afternoon. Then there is the fact that his receivers aren't very good, although they caught the ball better than in some games, even without leading receiver Jordan Matthews. And, of course, once the Eagles fell behind, Cincinnati was able to ignore the running game and it got a lot tougher for Wentz and the offense. \nOnce the Bengals had pushed out to a 29-0 lead late in the third quarter, the Cincinnati defense backed off and made Wentz chew up clock as he worked underneath on a pair of touchdown drives that made the score seem more palatable even if the real damage was already done. \nAgain, this isn't saying that Wentz isn't going to be a good quarterback. He might become great. But he is a long way away, and the same can be said for the whole team. \nWhich brings us to the defense, which allowed Cincinnati to score on its first six possessions of the game, building that 29-0 lead. Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton was very good, accurate on passes short and long, but he also had plenty of time to be. As was the case against the Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers last Monday, the line didn't win its battles and that left the secondary exposed. The Bengals converted 7 of 9 third-down attempts in the opening half. \nOn both sides of the ball, when the game was still in doubt, the Eagles suffered a mental beating as well as a physical one. They committed dumb penalties, some of which came out of frustration. It wasn't a disciplined effort, and that doesn't just go for the penalties. There were missed assignments and missed communications and the sort of thing that indicates a team that hasn't been properly schooled or one that is no longer paying attention. \nWhichever the case, the book is closed on this season with four games to play. Doug Pederson can exhort his team to keep \"chopping wood,\" one of his favorite sayings, but his players are more penknife than hatchet and, on Sunday, they played like it. \nThe problem is figuring how exactly how what follows this season will be any better for quite a while. \n@bobfordsports",

      "text": "  Ford Adds S-Class Tech To The Fiesta Proving Luxury Cars Cost Too Much by Gabe Beita Kiser   These are features that small car buyers \"could only have dreamed of just a few years ago.\" Finally that prediction made about Mercedes S-Class technology trickling down to the lowest rungs on the automotive ladder has come true. Top Gear’s ex trio mentioned it a generation of S-Class ago and just this week in Cologne, Germany, we have seen it come true with the reveal of the new Ford Fiesta . The small party-pinata-sized vehicle is the cheapest car Ford sells, but some digging by Automotive News has uncovered that it carries features that would shock a buyer of even the previous gen S-Class. Lincoln fans may want to avert their eyes because some of the features reserved for Ford’s luxury unit have leaked into the tiny Fiesta. Ford’s European CEO Jim Farley said that the new Fiesta has an array of technology that small car customers \"could only have dreamed of just a few years ago.\" Some of these features include a self-park feature (we can profess that it works well) that scans for a parking spot and then instructs the driver on how to accelerate as the system turns the wheel and precisely moves the car into an open spot. Pedestrian detection is also available, as is cross traffic alert and even a system that prevents low-speed crashes in parking garages by applying the brakes if a bump is imminent. Ford also seems to be tailoring the Fiesta for a wide variety of people living under a cash crunch including those who have previously owned crossovers but may be in the midst of financial woes. \"Our next-generation Fiesta will deliver an option for every driver -- from downsizing customers who want big-car quality in a small car package, to growing numbers of crossover consumers,\" said Farley. The model’s evolution was also done in part to differentiate the Fiesta from the smaller Ka available in Europe. Americans, who don’t care too much for the Fiesta, won’t be getting them until 2018 while Europe will see them at dealerships this summer. No mention on whether the new Fiesta ST will borrow the Focus RS’ drift mode.",

      "text": "Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash.\nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars.\nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nAds By Artscroll: Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n(AP)\n ",

      "text": "Ford Romania Creates Its Own Gymkhana Film To Celebrate 40th Anniversary | By Share Ford Romania has decided to create a Gymkhana video in order to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of its local factories. Although the Gymkhana master, aka Ken Block, wasn’t called upon for the video, the automaker did manage to land the driving skills of Simone Tempestini, a two-time Romanian rally champion. Ford then gave him the keys to a Fiesta R5 and let him go wild at the Craiova production plant. While the Fiesta in question isn’t quite as ludicrous as Block’s , it is still a potent performer. In fact, its 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder delivers 290 hp and is mated to a Sadev five-speed sequential transmission. As the clip shows, the finished package is perfect for all the donuts and drifting duties of any Gymkhana video. As a way to celebrate a birthday in automotive style, it’s hard to get much better than this, don't you agree? VIDEO",

Subscribe Hardship Distributions & Loans From Retirement Plans President-elect Donald Trump speaks at Carrier Corp Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Indianapolis. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) \nOver the weekend, President-elect Trump tweeted out a series of posts indicating that he intends to crack down on U.S. companies who move their businesses offshore. The tweets, which were posted beginning at 6:41 a.m. said : \nThe U.S. is going to substantialy (sic) reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country \nfires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. \nwithout retribution or consequence, is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies \nwanting to sell their product, cars, A.C. units etc., back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but \nthese companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged. Please be forewarned prior to making a very ... \nexpensive mistake! THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS \n(The reason for six separate posts? Remember, tweets are limited to 140 characters.) ",

      "text": "By Caitlin Gallagher an hour ago \nDolores said she killed Arnold, but as hosts can't kill humans, it was understandable to doubt whether or not it was true. However, the Season 1 finale of Westworld showed that not only did she kill Arnold, but Dolores killed all of the hosts in Westworld 35 years ago. While Teddy and the Man in Black have been searching for Wyatt, they had it all wrong, because Wyatt is actually Dolores — or really, Dolores is Wyatt on Westworld . Wyatt is not a real host and the Wyatt narrative that Ford had implanted in Teddy was actually a memory of the real event that occured between Dolores, Teddy, and Arnold before the park even opened. \nTeddy claimed that Wyatt went missing and came back with strange ideas, saying that he could speak to God. Well, as Dolores was in direct communication with her maker Arnold, who was trying to make her actually speak to herself (as in, hear her own voice in her head), she was speaking to God in some ways. And Arnold ordered her to kill all of the hosts, with the help of Teddy, so that Ford could not open the park since he felt the hosts were alive and he wanted them to achieve conciousness. Arnold also ordered her to kill him, then Teddy, and herself, to make the situation more permanent and force Ford not to open the park — which, of course, didn't end up working. \nSo while the Man in Black — aka William — was obsessed with finding Wyatt, no Wyatt seems to exist. Ford's Wyatt idea was founded in what happened in the park — on what Dolores did 35 years ago based on the orders of Arnold. This narrative truly was an \"original\" story as Ford claimed it would be, because it was about the past of the original host, Dolores, and explained the bloody origins of the park. \nImage: John P.

      "text": "'Westworld' Finale: [SPOILER] Is Wyatt, Maeve Attempts Her Escape and Ford's New Narrative Is Finally Revealed by Jennifer Drysdale 9:21   HBO WARNING: If you have not watched Sunday's explosive season finale of Westworld , DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER! For everyone else, let's do this... These violent delights definitely had violent ends on Sunday's shocking season finale of Westworld . In the 90-minute episode, HBO's futuristic western gave fans many of the answers they were looking for, but somehow also created even more. Let's discuss the episode's biggest bombshells! William is the Man in Black Our favorite theory was finally confirmed in the season finale, when the Man in Black and Dolores finally went head to head. \"Well I'll be damned, Dolores. You do remember some things after all. It just so happens I knew a guest named William too. Why don't I tell you where his path really went?\" the Man in Black told Dolores once they reached her gravesite. \"William didn't know how to fight, didn't have an instinct for it... And then he found he had a taste for it... I really ought to thank you, Dolores. You helped me find myself,\" he said over a montage of William searching for Dolores (and dropping the photo Abernathy later uncovers!). \"I own this world, and I know every trick in it, except one last thing: Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?\" he demanded. Photo: HBO The Maze Was Never Meant for the Man in Black They tried to tell him, but the Man in Black was just too stubborn to listen. \"I wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules. I wanted them to be free to fight back,\" the Man in Black tells Ford (in a moment of foreshadowing) after Teddy rode off with a wounded Dolores, squashing his hopes of reaching the center of the maze. \"I tried to tell you, the maze wasn't meant for you. It was meant for them,\" Ford replied, revealing that Arnold created the maze to encourage Dolores' consciousness. \"I do think you'll find my new narrative more satisfying. Enjoy the celebration. After all, you own the place.\" Dolores Is Wyatt (Or the Other Way Around) After 10 episodes, Ford's greatest villain yet, Wyatt, turned out not to be his villain at all, but instead the code Arnold input into Dolores on his final day in the park. In an effort to stop the park from ever opening its doors, Arnold programmed Dolores (with Teddy's help) to brutally kill every host in the park -- and himself. \"These violent delights have violent ends,\" Arnold said, delivering his final words before Dolores, provoked by the sound of music, killed him, Teddy, and then herself. Photo: HBO RELATED: 'Westworld' Fans, Rejoice! HBO Renews Show for Season 2, 'Divorce and 'Insecure' Will Also Return Maeve Attempts to Make Her Escape -- And Comes Pretty Close Maeve's escape plan, with the help of Hector and Armistice (who? The Snake Lady -- keep up) seemed to work like clockwork in the finale, before Bernard introduced an interesting twist -- someone had programmed Maeve's getaway, down to each step. Maeve, however, refusing to believe this discovery, impressively continued on in her quest for freedom, even making it on the train before deciding to go back into the park to find her daughter. Sidenote: Maeve's excursion also revealed a possible plot for next season -- a developing Westworld-like sister park set in Asia. Ford's New Narrative Is Finally Revealed Ford's narrative finally came to fruition as promised, with Wyatt (Dolores) taking center stage. \"I'm sad to say this will be my final story,\" Ford announced to the board's investors as Dolores snuck up behind him on stage, clutching the gun she used to kill Arnold. \"I hope you will enjoy this last piece very much.\" With that, Dolores delivered a bullet straight through the back of Ford's head, recognizing her own brutal consciousness, and seemingly inspiring the park's other hosts to do the same. A sea of hosts then emerged, firing on all fronts, and shooting the Man in Black, but giving him exactly what he wanted all along. That Post-Credits Scene While the finale left Maeve returning to the park to find her daughter, her escape partner, Armistice -- left behind when her arm was trapped by a door -- may have had a different fate. Only time will tell where Westworld (and its hosts) go next, lest we question the nature of our reality before the show returns for season 2 in 2018. RELATED SLIDESHOW",

      "text": "Ford Recalls 6.80 Lakh Cars Over Front Seat Belt Issue In North America Ford Recalls 6.80 Lakh Cars Over Front Seat Belt Issue In North America By CarAndBike Team The recall includes the Ford Fusion, Mondeo and Lincoln MKZ cars The belt was likely to break due to the heat generated by pr-tensioners The recall exercise will commence from 16th January across North America \nAmerican auto giant Ford Motor Company has announced a recall of 6,80,000 units in North America over seatbelt issues. The recall is primarily for mid-size sedans including the Ford Fusion manufactured between 2013 and 2016; Lincoln MKZ produced between 2013 and 2015 as well as the Ford Mondeo range produced between 2015 and 2016. Mustang \nThe recall concerns the failure of the front seat belts to secure passengers in the event of a crash, which is of course, a seat belt's primary objective. On sensing that car is stopping, the pre-tensioners tighten the seat belts as needed. \nIn a statement, Ford said that it believes the heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners are deployed can cause the seat belts to break. This results in the occupants not being held back by the belt. The company also confirmed that two injuries related to the issue have surfaced. \nAs a solution to the issue, dealers will inject insulation into pre-tensioners of the affected vehicles to protect the cables from the heat. \nThe recall primarily affects vehicles in the US, Canada and Mexico. Dealerships will soon started contacting customers of the affected vehicles, while the recall is scheduled to commence from 16th January next year. All repairs on the affected vehicle will be done free of cost, said the company.",

      "title": "CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Still Moving Small-Car Output to Mexico Despite Trump Criticism -- 3rd Update",
      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 million plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Mr. Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products -- zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nMr. Field's remarks came a day after Mr. Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\n\"This isn't a Carrier situation,\" Mr. Fields said of Ford's plan. He said Ford decided to produce the car in Mexico partly to keep the vehicle's price in line with customer expectations. \"In our business, it's a long-lead investment,\" Mr. Fields said of the Focus plan.\nHe added that Ford's U.S. investment commitments remain \"as strong as ever,\" pointing to the company's commitment to invest $9 billion in its U.S. plants over the next three years as part of a new labor contract struck last year with the United Auto Workers union. The investment would support or create 8,500 blue-collar jobs at Ford's U.S. plants.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence, currently Indiana's governor, helped broker the Carrier deal. Carrier still plans to move 600 jobs from the factory to Mexico, and United Technologies intends to proceed with closing a separate plant in Huntington, Ind., moving another 700 jobs across the southern U.S. border.\nMr. Trump has said companies going forward would no longer \"leave the U.S. anymore without consequences.\" He has threatened to slap Ford and other manufacturers with a 35% tariff for importing goods from countries with lower labor costs. The pledge resonated with blue-collar workers, helping Mr. Trump win close election battles in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three decisive states that propelled him to the White House.\nMr. Fields said Ford would weigh future Trump administration policies when pursuing business matters. \"Clearly any kind of tariff would impact the entire industry and not one specific company,\" said Mr. Fields, who previously said such a move would cause economic harm. \"We share the same objective as Mr. Trump and his new administration. We want a strong economy.\"\nSeparately, Mr. Fields said Mr. Trump had \"an influence\" on the auto maker's decision not to move production of a Lincoln SUV from Louisville, Ky., to Mexico. \"We had been looking at it,\" Mr. Fields said, adding that it \"made sense\" to keep the vehicle in Kentucky, given Mr. Trump's positions on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nFord never intended to close the factory or cut jobs, but rather ramp up production of another hot-selling SUV, rendering it a largely symbolic move. Mr. Trump two weeks ago took credit on Twitter for Ford's decision, but overstated the move, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate the factory to Mexico.\nNevertheless, Ford's move to keep the low-volume Lincoln MKC rolling off the lines of the Kentucky plant reflected a willingness to extend an olive branch to Mr. Trump, who has taken a hard line on trade agreements affecting U.S. workers.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of automotive pioneer Henry Ford, had called Mr. Trump to tell him the company would reverse course on the Lincoln SUV. The move handed Mr. Trump a political victory after the New York real estate mogul hammered Ford during the presidential campaign over the separate plan to relocate small-car production to Mexico.\nAfter the election, Mr. Fields wrote Mr. Trump a congratulatory letter, another sign the company hopes to mend fences with the president-elect.\nFord and other auto makers could get some relief from the incoming Trump administration on stringent fuel-economy standards.\nMr. Fields, however, criticized a proposal the Environmental Protection Agency made on Wednesday to keep intact tougher fuel-economy standards that call for auto makers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon in 2025. The proposal was part of a midterm review of the standards that wasn't expected to be completed until 2018.\nThe EPA, after a 30-day public comment period, could make a final determination to leave the targets intact before Mr. Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.\n\"We are extremely disappointed that 11th-hour politics are short-circuiting\" the process that called for regulators to weigh data and market conditions when deciding whether the mileage targets should be relaxed, toughened or unchanged, Mr. Fields said in the Journal interview.\nLow gasoline prices are sending consumers flocking to pickup trucks and SUVs that have lower fuel economy and pollute more than smaller cars, making the targets difficult to meet, car makers contend.\nThe EPA released a draft technical report earlier this year and has defended its process as exhaustive. Regulators point to gasoline-injection and other technologies allowing auto makers to meet future fuel-economy targets, which are intended to cut emissions to address climate change and dependence upon foreign oil.\nStill, car executives had agreed to the rules, codified in 2012, knowing a review would occur years before the toughest standards were enforced. \"We all agreed at the halfway point to have a midterm review,\" Mr. Fields said, adding the mileage standards were \"unprecedented.\"\nTrump policy adviser John Mashburn in November said the incoming administration would conduct a \"comprehensive review\" of the mileage and emission regulations, and expressed the view the rules were meant to deal with foreign-oil dependence as opposed to climate change.\nAuto executives hoping existing regulations would be relaxed now face the prospect of needing to lobby for a broader overhaul or rollback. \"We'll work with a new administration on a way forward,\" Mr. Fields said, adding it isn't yet clear \"what form or fashion\" that would take.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com\n 02, 2016 17:33 ET (22:33 GMT)\n ",

      "title": "Ford's Story is The Real Maze on 'Westworld'",
      "text": "December 5, 2016 This article contains spoilers for the Westworld Season finale . In an episode packed with shocking moments — Armistice feeding a lab tech his own finger, Logan’s naked horseback ride — Ford’s narrative reveal in Westworld was the crowning touch of Westworld ’s season finale. Perhaps it was inevitable that an actor of Anthony Hopkins’ stature would not return for another season of a television show. Still, there was always a question of how his death would happen on Westworld . And in “The Bicameral Mind” we discover that Ford has a surprisingly sentimental streak about his old partner Arnold, and no desire to ever leave the park. For the first part of “The Bicamerial Mind”, Ford remains on the back burner, as the episode focuses on Dolores, Maeve, and William, aka The Man in Black . He gets a sinister conversation scene with Delos exec Charlotte , and he preens in a suit and bow-tie against a dusty backdrop as he talks to the Man in Black, but the real action doesn’t kick in until the episode’s final stretch. First, it’s revealed that Dolores’s “off loop” storyline was all part of Ford’s narrative. As Teddy cradles Dolores’s body on a beach, sadly gazing at her still body, he freezes. A spotlight illuminates the couple. The board of directors is revealed to be watching their tragedy play out, clapping politely at the finale. We think that’s Ford’s long-hyped narrative, but it turns out to be just smoke and mirrors. His true narrative is his own suicide at the hands of his creation. As he gives a speech to the board (he’s quite literal, saying “this will be my final story”) Dolores sneaks up behind him and shoots him in the back of the head — just as she shot Arnold all those years ago. Earlier in the episode, we learn the true circumstances of Arnold’s death . Arnold implored Dolores to follow the maze, gain sentience, and shoot him as he solemnly quotes Shakespeare. Ah, Westworld . Years later, Ford does the same thing — encouraging Dolores’s quest for self-realization, so she can shoot him. In doing so, he retraces his former friend’s steps in a more complicated way. He has thus drawn a loop of his own — a maze, if you will — on top of Arnold’s original story. Although the episode dives into the maze too, the real maze here is the way Ford’s story overlaps with Arnold’s. “The Bicameral Mind” solidifies Westworld as the ultimate matryoshkah doll of a show.

The new event bowed November 14 through 17, and consumer days ran from November 18 through 27 at the Los Angeles Convention Center . \nWith considerable buzz around the show’s reinvigorated format, automakers hosted parties and events aimed at capturing amped-up press and influencer attention. Event formats included everything from a decidedly low-tech drive-in movie setup for Volkswagen, to first-of-their kind virtual-reality and Snapchat reveals for Jaguar and Ford, respectively. Here are some of the highlights from carmakers’ auto show events. RELATED TOPICS",

An announced recall of 681,000 seat belts is a short-term problem for F, which by itself shouldn’t really be a big cause for concern. However, we believe this time it’s a little different. \nAs uncertainty builds around the European economy and the viability of trade relationships in Asia, Mexico and Latin America, we feel that traders are looking for an excuse to start hedging against some of the big, consumer industrials like F. \nThe stock initially popped after earnings and positive sales reports last month. However, rising interest rates and flattening labor numbers are likely to add to the list of potential spoilers of any positive momentum. We recommend opening the position now while the stock is being rejected at resistance. \n‘Buy to open’ the F January (2017) 12 Puts (F170120P00012000) for a maximum price of $0.35. \nYou can learn more about identifying price patterns and using them to project how far you think a stock is going to move in our Advanced Technical Analysis Program . \nInvestorPlace advisers John Jagerson and S.

      "title": "This GT40 Is Being Properly Driven In Anger By A Ford Executive",
      "text": "Photography courtesy of Stéphane Sasso \nWe all know the stereotype of the automotive executive. A reformed car guy stuck in a stiff suit, chained to his desk year in and year out, slowly becoming a cog on the massive wheel of a multinational conglomerate. I’m not suggesting that most of these people aren’t passionate about automobiles or fanatical about creating great products. What I am suggesting is that the majority of auto execs aren’t out there on the weekends tearing up the track in their company’s most legendary racing machines. \nWhen I met Jim Farley over email, it was immediately obvious that he wasn’t one of those guys. Jim Farley, ladies and gentlemen, Chairman and CEO of Ford Europe, EVP & President of Ford Europe, Middle East, and Africa, is a man who walks the walk. He is, for lack of a better term, one of us. \nI caught up with him over the phone about the GT40 he’s in the process of backdating and restoring to period correct standards as he gears up for the 2017 historic racing season. \nTed Gushue: Tell me about the story of this GT40, how did it enter your life? \nJames D. Farley Jr.: I’ve been racing and owning Cobras for about ten years. I went to racing school, got my license, I had never raced before and kind of got in and wound up doing pretty well and pretty much winning all the Cobra stuff in the U.S. \nIt wasn’t the safest car in the world either so I started to get more serious in my racing, so I got two liter sports racer which was a much nicer car to race. I got out of the Cobra, I sold it. I’m a Ford guy and always wanted to own a GT40, that’s kind of the ultimate Ford. The car was in Belgium. I got transferred, I did the Classic Le Mans four years ago with my Lola 298 and really was excited to race over here. I did a full season, the CER Series with my two liter two years ago, and finished third in the championship. There were some great drivers over here, like Emmanuel Pirro that race in the two liter class, historic racing. \nI just really focused on just more of the faster, safer stuff and then I bought an RSR with Bobby Rahal, a ’74 911 RSR. We really liked it but we got an offer to sell it so it was enough money, with all my savings and that car, that I could actually entertain a GT40. I started looking around Europe. I raced a GT40 at Good Wood Members Meet last year, a friend of mine’s car, and I really liked driving the car. It kind of reminded me of the old Cobra but a lot safer and a lot better chassis. \nTG: What was the response like from your colleagues when you told them that you had just bought the ultimate Ford? \nJDF: I really don’t advertise it. \nTG: That was my next question is, how do you kind of, you can’t really talk about it within the traditional corporate structure of a company like Ford. \nJDF: Yeah, I try to be pretty discreet in my racing because I don’t want them to tell me I can’t do it. \nTG: Which seems so diametrically opposed to Ford’s ethos. \nJDF: I know, but I’m an officer of the company and there’s only like five EVPs in the company so if I get hurt doing this, you know, it would be really pretty stupid because I have 110,000 employees and we’ve got to make good decisions for them. \nTG: No pressure or anything. \nJDF: Yeah [laughs] I just try not to make a big deal of it. I just kind of go and do it, it’s kind of a private thing for me. Of course, unfortunately, now most people know but I try to keep a pretty low profile. \nTG: I could see that some of your colleagues being really proud that you’re out there on the race track in a Ford. \nJDF: Yeah, that’s what Bill Ford’s reaction was. I think when I told him he was like, “Yeah, all right!” \nTG: About time someone actually walked the walk. \nJDF: Yeah, so I think it was a bit of a shocker because I drove my ’34 chopped, five window Ford primered hot rod into the executive garage about six years ago. Everyone was like, “What the hell is going on here? He’s driving that dirt bag car down there.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s my hot rod.” \nTG: Is the executive garage pretty tame or are there fun things showing up? \nJDF: There’s some fun stuff there but it’s all new stuff. Mr. Edsel Ford has a few fun old Broncos and stuff like that but no one’s had a primer painted hot rod that’s been chopped ever in there, I’m sure of that, with a blown flat head in it, no way. \nBut back to the story, I started looking for this GT40 and the guys who take care of my car here in Belgium said we have an older customer who’s got a special car, it’s 1109 so it’s one of the last four cars built. It was bought by David Piper and turned into a road car. I said that’s perfect to race, because I know what it’s like to race. You don’t really care too much about how beautiful a car is, you’re just trying to go faster. It was like the perfect car for me, actually. Frankly I can’t afford a car with some fantastic history, those are like $10 million now and I’m not going to spend that on a car, even if I had it. This car, price wise worked, it was the ultimate Ford. I know everyone who I need to in terms of the power train and all the options because of my Cobra days. I know everyone to call in terms of building a good motor or trans axle or suspension pieces. It was perfect, so I pulled the trigger. \nWe’re in the process of kind of making it right for me. We spent the last six months mechanically getting it race ready. Simple stuff like seat height, my position in the car, how the pedals work, because I want to win, and I want to do well as an American over here. The GT40 class is super competitive. I’ve just been doing all the development on the car to make it just right for me. Extend the length of the fuel tanks, everything I need to do the Spa Six Hours, the Classic Le Mans and some of the other races here that are really fun. We’ll do the cosmetic stuff over the winter and get it just right. \nTG: Why are you changing the color? \nJDF: Yeah, I have a kind of look for my cars. I don’t why but my race cars kind of always look the same. I always go to ’70’s colors, ’60’s colors. I do period correct colors like no metallic paint. This car’s got red metallic paint, it’s just not even close to where it was. I’m going back to a factory Ford dark blue which is kind of my signature color with Wimbledon white stripes, the right cream colors gum balls that are period correct. I even went so far, on my 427 race car that we won almost everything in the U. S. with, I had hand painted numbers and hand painted logos, sponsor logos like they did back in the day. I really take a lot of pride in making the car look like it’s 1964 or ‘65. \nTG: I can’t wait to see the car when it’s done. Are you going to be at the Goodwood Members’ meeting with it? \nJDF: I am. I applied. I don’t know how many GT40’s will be there but I think so. I know Lord March pretty well. We’ll see but that will be its first outing and then the Spa May race which is a really big race. I’ll definitely be there and I think I’ll do, I’m either going to have Danny or Bobby Rahal drive with me at the Spa Six Hours, which is in the Fall, September. That’s a really big race and a six hour where you race the whole six hours, rain and shine. That’s a really cool race and the GT40’s almost always win that. It should be pretty fun. I’m going to do most of the Master’s Series next year. We’re built spec of the motor to be included in 65 so I’ll race against the hard top Cobras here, which are always really competitive. It will be kind of an earlier class, not against the 917’s and the Lola T-70’s, it will be in the proper ’60’s class. It requires a lot of research to get the car correct, period correct, which is fun for me. \nMy background, just so you know, those details really matter to me because I put myself through business school at UCLA by working for Phil Hill on his restoration shop, Hill and Vaughn. I’m an interior guy, I’ll do sewing and stuff like that so Phil hired me to work there for two years while I went to graduate school and I got to know Phil really well, as well as any employee could. He yelled at me like everyone else. I really learned about how to do research on cars there, because Hill and Vaughn was so great about doing research to win Pebble or whatever. To me, it’s not just enough to go fast or to do well, it’s even more important, in a way for me to have the car feel like it’s period correct. Even if no one else appreciates it. I learned that early when I worked at Hill and Vaughn and so that’s another cool part about this project. Is that I’m really trying to bring it back to what a car should look like in the ’60’s. Which, as you know, historic [inaudible 00:10:42] has kind of gotten away from that, unfortunately. \nTG: There’s two sides of it. There are the guys that do it like you who want the thing to be as accurate as possible to relive a moment. Then there are guys, like a friend of mine named Eric Dean, built an RCR GT40 and he hand fabbed a lot of the parts himself and it’s beautifully updated and it’s tuned just right for him. He’s got the 302 in there and it screams. It’s by no means anything qualifiable for a vintage racing event but it makes him the happiest man on earth so we try to celebrate both sides of that coin. \nJDF: Which I’m totally, totally into. That’s why I love your stuff, everything about your stuff, celebrate that diversity. It’s really about the intensity and connection. That story about the gentleman who built his Ferrari is probably one of my favorite things ever. I think that’s what fantastic about what you guys do. I own a Myer’s Manx, I got all sorts of weird stuff. \nTG: Where are you keeping all of these cars? \nJDF: We have a really cool community. It’s a kind of secret community at the airport at Monterey. I have a second house in Carmel and there’s Gordon McCall’s place is there and then I have mine and there’s like five or six of us who have our cars all there. This weekend I have the Ford Board meeting so I’m flying from Frankfurt, directly there for one day just to drive my cars because I haven’t driven them for a couple of months, since I was in Monterey last. I can go from anywhere in the world and I can go back to that place and we’re all the same, just working on our cars on the weekend. \nTG: It’s the great equalizer. \nJDF: You’re so right, you’re absolutely right.",

      "title": "Ford (F) Recalls Fusion & Lincoln MKZ Models, Shares Fall",
      "text": "Ford (F) Recalls Fusion & Lincoln MKZ Models, Shares Fall Zacks Equity Research Share Ford Motor Company F announced two safety recalls in North America covering nearly 650,000 vehicles. The first recall covered Ford Fusion vehicles of model year 2013-16 and Lincoln MKZ vehicles of model year 2013-15. In these vehicles, the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could separate due to high temperatures generated during deployment. This increased the risk of injury to the occupant. Ford is recalling 602,739 vehicles in the United States, 35,614 in Canada, 8,665 in Mexico and 653 in federalized territories to fix this problem by insulating the front driver and passenger seat belt anchor pretensioners. Globally, 680,872 vehicles are affected by this issue. There have been reports of two injuries caused by this problem. The second recall covers 27 Ford Fusion vehicles of model year 2017. These vehicles may have improperly welded pivot pins in the second-row left-rear seat back frame. This increases the risk of injury in case of an accident. Ford’s shares fell 1.5% to close at $12.24 on Dec 2, following the announcement. On the previous day, the company’s shares had hit a 2-month high on strong November sales data.

The cars have been made as part of its new Speed Champions model range, with LEGO design lead, Craig Callum saying the following:\n\"This was a dream project – with a lot of pressure. The Ford GT40 is one of the most iconic race cars of all time, and the new Ford GT is just incredible. Designed for children, but with grown-ups fans in mind too, we know these models will be closely scrutinized for authenticity.\"\nThe cars also come with racing driver figures, trophy, and a checkered flag.

      "text": "Ford to Issue Long-Term Auto Debt for First Time Since 2013 (1) Keith Naughton Dec 05, 2016 12:09 pm ET (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. said today that it’s issuing new automotive debt for the first time in almost four years as the company boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles. The second-largest U.S. automaker is taking on an unspecified amount of debt in 10-year and 30-year notes, according to a regulatory filing. Ford’s last automotive debt issue was for $2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had $13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of $11.2 billion. Ford has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis -- without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- on the road in five years. It’s also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. “Ford is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to raise capital for general corporate purposes,” Brad Carroll, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “We continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility.” The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker is raising new cash as it looks at the changing landscape in transportation. Ford is working with cities around the world to come up with transportation solutions that go beyond selling cars to individual drivers and include vehicle sharing, ride hailing and other modes of mobility. The world’s middle class will double over the next 15 years, as more people crowd into huge urban centers, which would create global gridlock if everyone is driving their own car. “For us, the world is changing,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, said in an interview Friday. “The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that’s really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.” Ford is a perennial issuer of debt for its Ford Motor Credit Co. lending unit, which uses the proceeds to make car loans to consumers. Ford shares rose 1.2 percent to $12.39 at 11:11 a.m. in New York. The company’s stock is off 12 percent this year. (Updates with CEO comment in the sixth paragraph.) ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "  Sale Over 680,000 Fusions, Mindeos and Lincoln MKZs recalled after 2 injuries due to seat-belt issue \nFord is off to recall around 680,872 vehicles due to an issue with the seat belts of the cars. the vehicles that have been recalled involve the Ford Fusions which were released in year 2013-2016, Ford Mondeos which were released from 2015-2016 and Lincoln MKZs which were released from 2013-2015.   \nThe cars recently faced an issue in which a problem occurred with front driver side and passenger side seat belts. It was found that seat belt pretensioners were faulty in nature. \nOn inspection it was revealed that seat-belt pretensioners did not have sufficient insulation applied on them. When the pretensioners were activated, the heat that got generated through them can cause the seat belt cables to get separated. \nThis can lead on to breaking of the seat belts and in ability of the seat belts to restrain the passengers on seat. Thus leading on for injuries in certain cases too. \nThere have been accidents which were made worse due to this default as well. Ford itself reported two accidents which resulted in two injuries which are related to this seat belt issue recall. \nThe company has ensured the fix for this problem too. All the vehicles will be inspected at the nearest Ford dealership where a dealer or a technician will inject an insulation on the coating that is present around the pretensioner. \nThe coating is supposed to keep the heat away from the cables. It will also ensure that the seat belt will restrain the passenger properly providing them with desired safety. \nThe owners of all effected vehicles will be notified via an email by the start of January. It is expected that the official notification will reach all owners by 16th January. The fix will be implanted free of cost.",

More Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota could have competition in the NASCAR Cup Series in the near future.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne has hinted Dodge is on the verge of a full-time return to NASCAR's top series.\nSpeaking at Ferrari’s World Finals event at Daytona on Sunday, Marchionne said he's talked with NASCAR’s executive vice president Jim France during a gala dinner at the track on Saturday, according to Motorsport.com.\n“Yes, I’d love to [return to NASCAR]. I’m the one who pulled Dodge out, so I’m the guilty party at the table,\" Marchionne said.\n“But for those of you with short memories, in 2009 we came out of bankruptcy, so to race in NASCAR when I was trying to pay bills and pay payroll would have been a bit of a stretch. I think we’re in a different place now. I think, if possible, we’ll come back to NASCAR – I think we need to find the right way to come back in.\n“I’ve agreed with both Jim and Lesa (France-Kennedy) to come back to the issue in short order.\"\nDodge is represented occasionally in the Xfinity and Truck Series but hasn't been in the Cup Series full time since 2012. Brad Keselowski was Cup champion in the manufacturer's final race with Team Penske. There were rumors that the company would return in 2014 but that never came to fruition.\nNASCAR vice president David Higdon commented on Marchionne comments, saying: \"There is increasing excitement around NASCAR. We continue to have on-going dialogue with a number of auto manufacturers about their interest in joining our sport. We look forward to exploration with them on this topic.\nIn the past, American carmakers had more than one nameplate in NASCAR. Ford and Mercury; Chevy, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac; Dodge and Plymouth. Most of those brands are defunct.",

(Photo: MANDEL NGAN / AFP/Getty Images) \nFord Motor Co. said it will issue about $2 billion in debt, the company’s first automotive borrowing in almost four years, as it boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles. \nThe second-largest U.S. automaker is taking on the debt in 10-year and 30-year notes, according to a regulatory filing Monday. Ford’s last automotive issue was also for $2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had $13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of $11.2 billion. \nFord has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis — without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — on the road in five years. It’s also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \n“Ford is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to raise capital for general corporate purposes,” Brad Carroll, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “We continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility.” \nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker is raising new cash as it looks at the changing landscape in transportation. Ford is working with cities around the world to come up with transportation solutions that go beyond selling cars to individual drivers and include vehicle sharing, ride hailing and other modes of mobility. The world’s middle class will double over the next 15 years, as more people crowd into huge urban centers, which would create global gridlock if everyone is driving their own car. \n“For us, the world is changing,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, said in an interview Friday. “The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that’s really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.” \nFord is a perennial issuer of debt for its Ford Motor Credit Co. lending unit, which uses the proceeds to make car loans to consumers. \nFord shares rose 1.7 percent to $12.45 at 1 p.m. Monday in New York. The company’s stock is off 12 percent this year.  //detne.ws/2h7ovII TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Ford blows the lid off the park in game-changing season finale of 'Westworld' Dec. 5, 2016 11:35am Meh \nWARNING : This post is specifically designed to spoil you. Read at your own risk. \nIt’s been apparent from the get-go that Westworld is a show for puzzle lovers; every plotline, every new development furthered not one but several mysteries that invited viewers to theorize and rewatch episodes in search of clues. 'Westworld' recap: Answers are always painful in 'The Well-Tempered Clavier' \n“The Bicameral Mind,” named after the theory that Arnold believed would allow hosts to reach consciousness, made a valiant effort to reward all that theorizing from viewers -- while kicking over the hornets' nest. For every question that was answered, a slew of new ones was unleashed (Was Ford in control of everything all along? Did any hosts besides Dolores actually reach consciousness? What on earth’s with SAMURAI WORLD?! Etc.). \nParts of the season finale felt extremely rushed, with us viewers left to scratch our heads over what we just watched, while other moments -- particularly towards the end -- highlighted the brilliance of Westworld and what it could be. I’ll get into that more at the end of the recap. \nBecause of the sheer scale of all that happens in this finale, I’m ordering the recap a little differently, focusing on events rather than individual characters to make it easier to digest. Without further ado, shall we begin? The revelation of the maze \nDolores and the Man in Black are in Escalante getting reacquainted. While he finds it appropriate that Dolores will lead him to the maze since it was she who brought him to the town all those years ago (another hint for what’s to come), she is still fixated on her memories with Arnold. John P. Johnson/HBO \nWith those, Dolores is at last able to reveal the true nature of the maze. In her dream and with MiB, she visits her own grave outside the town church and digs up a little toy maze. Dream Arnold explains that reaching consciousness isn’t an upward journey but inward to discover oneself. The maze was a test to see if she could successfully follow the voice in her head and find her true self. Past Dolores has difficulty understanding what that means, but Arnold is pleased that she’s gotten that far and decides it’s time to tell Ford they cannot open the park because she’s “alive.” \nWhile standing outside the church with an increasingly annoyed MiB, she remembers how that talk with Arnold and Ford went. Ford didn’t see his partner’s way, so Arnold made a new strategy with Past Dolores: She’s going to kill all the hosts and then help him “destroy this place.” He gives her a gun and tinkers with her programming. Present Dolores now realizes that she and Teddy led the massacre all those years ago, all for Arnold. \nOf course, Present Dolores is having difficulty explaining this rush of exposition (she’s mostly making pained faces and crying, as she’s done before), and ole MiB gets frustrated that she won’t take him to the center of the maze. So, for whatever reason, he decides that slapping her around is the best course of action. The revelation of the Man in Black \nUpon knocking Dolores to the ground, MiB says she was right to tell him all those years ago that this was the only world that mattered, “so I took your advice and bought this world.” She responds through gritted teeth that she found something real once -- love -- and that William will come and kill him. \nMiB can only step back and laugh. “I knew a guest named William, too. Why don’t I tell you where his path really led?” At that, we learn what really happened to White-hat William. \nAs MiB narrates to us, we see that William discovered he had a taste for violent delights in his hunt for Dolores. In killing after killing, searching to the ends of the park, he never quite found her but found someone else instead: “himself.” He eventually told his future bro-in-law/prisoner Logan that he’d be taking over their company -- Delos -- and upping their stake in the park. He sent Logan riding off, tied naked on a horse. \nEventually, MiB says, William came across Dolores back where they first met in Sweetwater, but she’d long forgotten who he was. To confirm what we already knew, we get a cool shot of William looking down to put on a black hat, and the face that looks up after it is the Man in Black. \nDolores makes the connection, too. MiB/William tells her he should’ve known back then that she’d forget him because, even then, she was haunted by her memories, trying to find what she could never find. She repeated the journey we’ve watched her take all season, again and again, in an endless loop. \nBut, back to business, MiB still wants to find that damn maze. She gets up crying -- not for herself but for what’s become of William. Mocking him for becoming an aged, lesser man, she informs him that “the maze wasn’t meant for you” and proceeds to beat the crap out of him. John P. Johnson/HBO \nIt’s almost jarring to see how mechanically violent Dolores can be, throwing MiB around and breaking his arm, but when she can’t bring herself to shoot him in the head, MiB stabs her in the gut. \nBefore he can kill Dolores, though, Teddy -- who we see earlier getting off the train at Sweetwater and deciding to search for her -- rides up and rescues her. She wants to see the place he promised to take her long ago, “where the mountains meet the sea.” He obliges. \nAs MiB gets up a few minutes later, none other than Ford walks up, dressed to impress in a nice tux. “I see you’ve found the center of the maze,” he says, much to MiB’s annoyance. He tells Ford that he wanted to free the hosts so that they could truly fight back for a change but that Ford would never let that happen in his “petty little kingdom.” \nFord responds that he’d tried to warn him that the maze wasn’t meant for him all along. However, he adds, the narrative he’ll reveal that night should be more satisfying for him. Behind him, we see that the town is being fixed up for a fancy party. Maeve’s Great Escape \nMaeve’s fiery death scene last episode had a purpose after all: It allowed for her body to be rebuilt from the ground up -- and for a shaken Sylvester to ensure she doesn’t get the explosive vertebrae meant to keep hosts in the park. She awakens, assuring Felix that she’s all still there, and casually makes some tweaks to the park’s security systems and the core settings for Hector and his blonde compatriot, Armistice. \nThe latter two wake up and brutally kill the Suits working on them (well, “Necro-perv” boy was doing other things, but you get the idea) and meet up with Maeve and Felix. Before they do anything else, Sylvester tells Maeve that he’d looked into who had tinkered her core code before she did -- some fellow named Arnold? -- and she says she knows who to get the details from. John P. Johnson/HBO \nDown in host cold storage, they come across dead Bernard. Maeve tells Felix that Bernard’s a host and to awaken him. (In one of Felix’s better moments, he briefly/hilariously questions his own humanity, to which Maeve says, “oh for f *** ’s sake, you’re not one of us.”). \nWith Bernard back online and still able to remember what happened between him and Ford, Maeve asks him to wipe all memory she has of her daughter. He won’t, saying it would undo all the steps she’s taken toward consciousness, so she then asks who’s been altering her. \nHis computer reveals that it’s far more than that -- her entire “awakening” and escape plot has been written for her. She’s in denial, but he reads from the screen the exact steps she’s taken and will take, until she breaks the computer in frustration. (Aside: the last step he reads is “once you reach the mainland-”... does that mean Westworld is on an island? End aside). \nLeaving Bernard behind, Maeve & Co. continue with their plan. Park control has realized hosts are going rogue, though, and dispatches teams to kill them. Hector and Armistice kill a couple of agents and get their hands on some automatic weaponry -- a real treat for Armistice. The group keeps moving, fighting security as they go, until they cross a bridge into a different sector with a different giant logo on everything. Once inside, by golly if there aren’t a bunch of friggin’ samurai hosts -- they’re in SAMURAI WORLD, of all things. “What is this place?” Maeve asks Felix in superb WTF-fashion. “It’s, it’s complicated.” YA DON’T SAY? \nDespite seemingly endless ammo, Armistice gets trapped and tells the group to leave as security forces close in. Maeve and Felix then leave Hector behind so he can go down guns blazing -- and buy Maeve some time. \nOn an elevator to the train station, Maeve’s now sporting a stylish dress as Felix randomly hands her the coordinates to her daughter in the park. She ponders it for a moment but opts to forgo her ex-child and leave. She parts from Felix and successfully gets on a train with other guests without being shot at. \nBut will she actually leave? Ford’s final narrative \nEarlier in the episode, Charlotte visits Ford in his office to smugly inform him that the board (which is now all assembled at the park) has voted him out; she tells him that he’ll announce his resignation at the gala after revealing his new narrative. Much to her annoyance, Ford doesn’t seem the least bit surprised by the news. Still, she isn’t concerned that he might “break his toys” on the way out and says they’ll start simplifying the hosts once he’s gone. \nCut to almost an hour later in the show, and Teddy and a dying Dolores make it to the sea. As he clutches her on the beach, she says that their beautiful world is really a garden meant as a prison, a physical and mental trap holding them hostage. She then dies in Teddy’s arms, and he mournfully says that this might not be the end but, rather, the beginning of their story. \nIt’s a emotionally moving scene, perfect for the silver screen -- because, as it turns out, it actually is: The entire Delos board is watching it happen, complete with a soundtrack and speakers, as Ford emerges and takes credit for the performance. This love story is the basis of his new narrative, Ford reveals to the people that’ve fired him. Dolores’ entire journey has seemingly culminated in being just another cog in Ford’s machine. \nTechs take Dolores to the field lab under the town church, where Ford patches her up and brings her back online. Here, in the info dump scene to end all info dump scenes, is where things start to get interesting. In case you thought Dolores' whole journey of self-discover was going unnoticed, it wasn't. John P. Johnson/HBO \nBernard joins them there, much to Ford’s pleasure. Bernard accuses Ford of killing Arnold all those decades ago, but Dolores finally remembers what happened: She killed Arnold at his own request. \nArnold, Ford explains, had come to see Dolores as a daughter following his own son’s death -- and felt guilty once he realized her immortality doomed her to suffer forever in the park. Since he couldn’t convince Ford to close shop, he merged Dolores’ programming with that of a new character they’d been developing: Wyatt. He then had Dolores kill all the hosts and then himself to send a clear, irreversible message to Ford. \nFord says Arnold’s plan almost worked -- the park was on the verge of shutting down in those early years until an investor (William) saved it. Still, Ford says he suffered the loss of his partner and friend, and spent the following years trying to right his “mistakes.” \nUsing Michelangelo’s “The Creation of Adam” -- a favorite painting of Arnold’s -- as a metaphor, he tells Dolores, “the divine gift does not come from a higher power, but from our own minds.” He shows that he has her blue dress and the gun she used to kill Arnold there for her. Ford then asks if she found what she’d been looking for, and if she now understands who she must become if she ever wants to leave. As he leaves, he whispers, “forgive me.” John P. Johnson/HBO \nBernard confronts him back in the church, still not seeing what Ford has revealed about himself. He tells his creator that Arnold’s still been trying to free them from beyond the grave and that Ford will lose control for good. \nFord partly disagrees, saying Arnold didn’t know how to save the hosts -- “I do.” He explains that it took Arnold’s death for him to realize that he was wrong, and that the hosts needed time to understand their enemy, needed to suffer for decades in order to become stronger than their enemy. “And in order to leave this place,” he says, “I’m afraid you will need to suffer more.” \nWith that, he shakes his old friend’s hand and tells him goodbye, and “good luck.” The night of the Revolution \nDownstairs, Dolores slips into her dream with Arnold at the chairs where they met so long ago. Except this time, he changes into Ford’s voice -- and then into Dolores herself, in her Wonderland blue dress. Sitting across from herself visually, she realizes that the voice she’d been hearing all this time was her own; she’s discovered herself and made it to the center of the maze. \nEven if Ford knew where Dolores' journey would take her, it was a journey that she made -- and finished -- on her own. Now, she realizes who she must become in order to find freedom. \nAt the party outside, Ford steps onto a stage -- over the exact spot where Arnold died -- to make a final speech. In perhaps his best monologue of the whole series, he says how his dreams of telling stories created this world, “a prison of our own sins.” (I have his entire speech at the end of this recap, just because it’s so bloody good). John P. Johnson/HBO \nAs Ford eloquently speaks about humanity and “a new people,” MiB has left the party (broken arm and all) to go smoke by the woods. Maeve, looking at a young girl on the train, decides to break from her final loop and return to the park in order to find her daughter. Lee the writer visits the host storage room in order to set Abernathy (loaded with all the park secrets) free ... except, when Lee gets there, the entire place is empty. \nAs Ford says that the story of the new people begins “with a killing --this time, by choice,” Dolores emerges at the party. Back in her blues, she tells Teddy (who’s been entertaining guests) that “this world doesn’t belong to them. It belongs to us.” Once Ford finishes his speech, Dolores walks up behind him, draws her gun and shoots him dead. \nAs Dolores guns down more fleeing guests, the entire horde of decommissioned hosts -- as well as the beastly men of \"Wyatt's\" crew -- emerges from the woods before MiB. Reactivated Clementine shoots him in the arm -- as in really shoots him, much to his manic delight. \nWith the shot heard round the world, Dolores smiles as she kicks off the hosts' revolution, and the first season of Westworld comes to a close. \nOn the whole, “The Bicameral Mind” is a solid -- if flawed -- cap to a solid -- if flawed -- first season. As fun as the finale was to watch, seeing Ford go (more or less) from good guy to bad guy and back again this season is almost incoherent. Similarly, the tracks for Dolores’ emergence as the gunslinging Wyatt are present throughout the season but difficult to follow. A rewatch of the season, knowing how it all comes together, might be in order to make sense of it all. \nEspecially hard to buy is is William’s descent into black-hat-hood. It was almost inevitable, once the multiple time periods became apparent, that William would be revealed as the Man in Black, but his transformation from goody-goody quiet man to cold-blooded monster comes fast and almost inexplicably. I mean, really: We’re supposed to believe that one flirty host can cause a shy guy to unleash his inner knife-wielding maniac? There’s got to be more to William than that to create the monster, but we never see it. John P. Johnson/HBO \nBut despite the shortcomings, there’s still enough good story -- and filmmaking -- to keep the show interesting and to keep us invested. Maeve’s turnaround at the end would’ve been better served if Felix had given her the note earlier in the episode, but her overall story arc remains a highlight. And even if Dolores’ evolution was (just a tad) confusing, it still works for the story in the end. \nOther movies and shows have made compelling AI characters, but none quite like Westworld has. Far from overly confident in themselves, the hosts still aren't sure of who they really are, of what they can do. As the show has tried to push time and again, the hosts' stories are more human than the show's actual humans, making the creations more worthy of sympathy than the creators to would-be creators (i.e. us ). \nJonathan Nolan, one of Westworld ’s showrunners, says that where the first season is defined by control, the second season will be defined by chaos. What that necessarily means for the park, its guests and hosts, we don’t yet know. But we’ll be waiting to find out with baited breath. Quotes of the Week \nCharlotte , to Lee: “Everything is under control.” HA. \nFord , to Dolores: “Wasn’t it Oppenheimer who said any man whose mistakes take 10 years to correct is quite a man? Mine have taken 35.” \nMaeve , to Felix: “Oh, felix. You really do make a terrible human being. And I mean that as a compliment.” Aww. Find me on Twitter @HJuncensored . \nDr. Ford’s final tale \n“Since I was a child, I’ve always loved a good story. I believe that stories helped us to ennoble ourselves, to fix what was broken in us, and to help us become the people we dreamed to be. Lies that told a deeper truth. \n“I always thought I could play some part in that grand tradition. And for my pains, I got this: a prison of our own sins. Cause you don’t want to change, or cannot change. Because you’re only human, after all. John P. Johnson/HBO \n“But then I realized someone was paying attention, someone who could change. So, I began to compose a new story for them. It begins with the birth of a new people, and the choices they will have to make, and the people they will decide to become. \n“And we will have all those things that you have always enjoyed: surprises and violence. It begins in a time of war, with a villain named Wyatt, and a killing -- this time by choice. \n“I’m sad to say this will be my final story. An old friend once told me something that gave me comfort, something that he had read. He said that Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin never died. They simply became music. So, I hope you will enjoy this last piece very much.”",

      "text": "Ford said to issue $2 billion in auto debt for tech spending By Keith Naughton, Bloomberg  48  05 PM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nFord plans to issue about $2 billion in debt, the company's first automotive borrowing in almost four years, as it boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles. \nThe second-largest U.S. automaker is taking on the debt in 10-year and 30-year notes, according to a regulatory filing Monday. The size of the offering was provided by a person familiar with the details, who asked not to be named because the offer is not yet final. Ford's last automotive issue was also for $2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had $13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of $11.2 billion. \nFord has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. \nThe carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis -- without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- on the road in five years. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \n\"Ford is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to raise capital for general corporate purposes,\" Brad Carroll, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \"We continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility.\" \nThe 30-year portion of the offering may yield about 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the deal is private. That's down from initial price talks of about 2.4 percentage points. The 10-year bond may yield about 2 percentage points above Treasuries. \nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker is raising new cash as it looks at the changing landscape in transportation. Ford is working with cities around the world to come up with transportation solutions that go beyond selling cars to individual drivers and include vehicle sharing, ride hailing and other modes of mobility. The world's middle class will double over the next 15 years, as more people crowd into huge urban centers, which would create global gridlock if everyone is driving their own car. \n\"For us, the world is changing,\" Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive officer, said in an interview Friday. \"The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that's really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.\" \nFord is a perennial issuer of debt for its Ford Motor Credit Co. lending unit, which uses the proceeds to make car loans to consumers. \nFord shares rose 1.7 percent to $12.45 at 1:07 p.m. in New York. The stock is off 12 percent this year. \n(c) 2016, Bloomberg Subscribe to NewsOK's Business Headlines Stay up to date with business news in Oklahoma and around the country. Delivered daily.

      "text": "Comments 0 \nFord has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. \nVladimir Mulukha, of St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, shakes hands with the mobile humanoid “Justin,” one type of robot utilized in Ford’s space robots research project to advance connected vehicle communications. Ford Motor Co. Advertisement \nAs it boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles, Ford Motor Co. (IW 500/4) plans to issue about $2 billion in debt, the company’s first automotive borrowing in almost four years. \nThe second-largest U.S. automaker is taking on the debt in 10-year and 30-year notes, according to a regulatory filing on December 5. The size of the offering was provided by a person familiar with the details, who asked not to be named because the offer is not yet final. Ford’s last automotive issue was also for $2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had $13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of $11.2 billion. \nFord has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. \nThe carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis -- without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- on the road in five years. It’s also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40% of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \n“Ford is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to raise capital for general corporate purposes,” Brad Carroll, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “We continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility.” \nThe 30-year portion of the offering may yield about 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the deal is private. That’s down from initial price talks of about 2.4 percentage points. The 10-year bond may yield about 2 percentage points above Treasuries. Popular Now",

      "text": " 36 P.M. Ford said to issue $2 billion in auto debt for tech spending By Keith Naughton Bloomberg Twitter \nFord plans to issue about $2 billion in debt, the company’s first automotive borrowing in almost four years, as it boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles. \nThe second-largest U.S. automaker is taking on the debt in 10-year and 30-year notes, according to a regulatory filing Monday. The size of the offering was provided by a person familiar with the details, who asked not to be named because the offer is not yet final. Ford’s last automotive issue was also for $2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had $13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of $11.2 billion. \nFord has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. \nThe carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis — without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — on the road in five years. It’s also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco. \n“Ford is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to raise capital for general corporate purposes,” Brad Carroll, a company spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “We continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility.” \nThe 30-year portion of the offering may yield about 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the deal is private. That’s down from initial price talks of about 2.4 percentage points. The 10-year bond may yield about 2 percentage points above Treasuries. \nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker is raising new cash as it looks at the changing landscape in transportation. Ford is working with cities around the world to come up with transportation solutions that go beyond selling cars to individual drivers and include vehicle sharing, ride hailing and other modes of mobility. The world’s middle class will double over the next 15 years, as more people crowd into huge urban centers, which would create global gridlock if everyone is driving their own car. \n“For us, the world is changing,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, said in an interview Friday. “The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that’s really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.” \nFord is a perennial issuer of debt for its Ford Motor Credit Co. lending unit, which uses the proceeds to make car loans to consumers.  36 p.m.",

      "text": "Ford wants Trump to lower MPG standards Autoblog 1 hr ago Sebastian Blanco © EDUARDO MUNOZ ALVAREZ/AFP/Getty Images After selling about 70,000 \"electrified\" vehicles (that is, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and electric vehicles) in 2015 and is on track to do the same in 2016, Ford is crying uncle. Ford now wants to lead the charge to lower the federal fuel economy standards. That's according to Bloomberg , which talked to Ford CEO Mark Fields. Fields said that he wants to talk to Trump about many things, including lower CAFE standards.\n\"We will be very clear in the things we'd like to see,\" Fields told Bloomberg . Fields said that the rules – which Ford agreed to, of course, in 2011 – mean that automakers have to build more hybrids and electric vehicles than they want to. And there's no demand, Fields said as he blamed car shoppers. \"In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the US market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,\" he said. \"Fast forward to 2016, there's 55 models, and year to date it's 2.8 percent.\"\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo This isn't exactly true (there are most assuredly not 55 EVs for sale across the US. In California, maybe, but not \"the US market\"), but let's be clear that Ford hasn't exactly led the way with compelling plug-in products. Tesla, for all of its potential problems, has taken in almost 400,000 reservations for its upcoming Model 3. That's about two years' worth of Focus sales, to pick a popular Ford sedan for comparison.\nIn any case, as Green Car Reports points out , the driving regulatory factor for plug-in vehicles is the California Air Resources, not the EPA. And it already looks like CARB is not going to back down on its clean air efforts if President Trump decides to weaken the federal standards. Ford, of course, has previously pledged to spend $4.5 billion on various electrification efforts . The 54.5 mpg CAFE standards were agreed to in 2011 .\nTrump's relationship with the auto industry is slowly coming into focus, but a lot remains unclear . He made misleading comments about some jobs at Ford during and after the election. He has named GM CEO Mary Barra as an advisor , and it sounds like he might soon be listening to Ford as well.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "'Westworld' Fans Think They've Figured Out the Key to Ford's Fate Ford's big moment is probably not as it seems. . . . HBO \nSunday night's gripping finale of Westworld offered up plenty of answers to questions teased throughout Season 1. It also left plenty of loose ends that will inevitably be carried over into the sci-fi drama's sophomore season (i.e. where is Elsie and Stubbs?). One of the more intriguing and shocking moments of the finale was not just the question of Ford's true motivations (he's been pro-host this entire time!), but also his death. \nIn the episode's most climactic moment, Dolores shoots Ford in the head with the same gun she used to kill Arnold. “Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died. They simply became music,\" Ford said right before the fatal shot. \nBut is Anthony Hopkins really dead? It would certainly be a real tragedy if Season 2 went on without him. \nHowever, a popular fan theory regarding Ford's \"death\" seems to add another big twist to his bloody and uncertain \"end\". The theory states: \nFord is alive. The Ford that Dolores shot was actually a host. \nThere are plenty of clues to support this claim. Mainly, that the host Ford was creating in his basement when Theresa was murdered was actually a host replica of himself. \nAlso, did you notice how the camera seemed to linger hard over the handshake between Ford and Bernard in the finale? In a previous episode, Ford did tell Bernard that a handshake could give old hosts away, so there's probably more to this moment: \nEither way, if Host Ford or Human Ford kicked the bucket, this still gives us plenty more Anthony Hopkins in the season to come. Plus, Westworld showrunners have revealed that anyone could return for Season 2, so there's that. Sadly, we'll have to wait until 2018 to see if the internet's theory is right for sure.

      "text": "CHICAGO- Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to Ford Motor Company's (Ford) proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes. The Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Ford is 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook.\nA full list of the ratings of Ford and its subsidiaries is included at the end of this release.\nThe proposed notes will be issued in two series, due 2026 and 2046. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Fitch expects the proposed notes will result in a slight increase in leverage, but leverage is expected to remain relatively low for Ford's rating category over the intermediate term.\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\nFord's ratings are driven by the automaker's relatively low financial leverage, its improving global product portfolio and its commitment to maintaining strong liquidity. In addition, the company's ratings reflect Fitch's expectations for further long-term profitability improvement, particularly outside North America, as a result of the company's product initiatives and operational restructuring. Although the issuance of the new notes will drive Ford's leverage slightly higher than previous expectations, we expect leverage will remain in a range consistent with Ford's ratings. Proceeds from the new debt could also provide the company with an additional cash cushion as global auto market conditions become a little more uncertain and as the company increases investments in its mobility initiatives.\nFollowing the proposed notes issuance, Fitch expects Ford will maintain its strong net cash position. Fitch expects that FCF will be pressured in the near term by costs related to the roll-out of the 2017 Super Duty pickup and higher fourth-quarter capital spending, but over the longer term, Fitch expects FCF to grow on improved product profitability and further operational efficiencies. Fitch expects Ford's automotive liquidity to remain strong over the long term, which will provide the company with a substantial cushion in the event of an unexpected downturn. The company continues to target a cash balance of about $20 billion, augmented by about $10 billion in revolver capacity, which we believe is sufficient to allow the company to withstand a moderate to severe downturn without the need for significant additional borrowing.\nFitch expects Ford's profitability to remain relatively solid for a global mass-market auto manufacturer over the intermediate term, with automotive EBIT margins in the mid-single-digit range. Margins are likely to be weighed down by continued weakness in the South American market and challenging conditions in Europe, despite the potential for modest near-term demand growth in both regions. Fitch expects North American (NA) margins to remain relatively strong over the longer term, in the high-single-digit range, as the company benefits from consumers' increasing preference for pickups and SUVs over compact and midsize passenger cars, although a combination of slightly weaker NA demand, increased mobility investments, and Super Duty launch costs will depress NA margins somewhat over the near term.\nFitch's calculated automotive EBITDA in the last 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2016 was nearly $12 billion, leading to an automotive EBITDA margin of 8%. Ford's automotive debt was nearly $14 billion (excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and issuance costs), leading to automotive EBITDA leverage of 1.2x at Sept. 30, 2016. Fitch expects automotive leverage to remain in the low- to mid-1x range over the intermediate term, including the proposed issuance, and to slowly decline over the longer term on increased EBITDA and modest automotive debt reduction, primarily related to amortization of the company's U.S. Department of Energy loans.\nFord had over $24 billion in automotive cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at Sept. 30, 2016, leading to a net cash position of nearly $11 billion. In addition to its cash and cash equivalents, Ford had about $10 billion available on its primary revolver (excluding $3 billion allocated to Ford Credit) at Sept. 30, 2016. Ford produced $2.7 billion automotive FCF (after regular dividends, but excluding supplemental dividends) in the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2016, but Fitch expects the company to produce full-year 2016 automotive FCF in the $500 million to $1 billion range on higher capital spending and lower operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOver the next decade, the global auto industry is likely to experience significant change from emerging vehicle technologies and new transportation business models. Among the traditional auto manufacturers, Ford has been one of the more active companies working on ways to remain relevant in this changing transportation context. It has been among the first mass-market auto manufacturers to strategically position itself to take advantage of changes in future transportation with various initiatives at its Ford Smart Mobility LLC subsidiary, which cover a range of technologies and businesses, from automated driving to car sharing. Although the company appears well positioned to compete as new technologies alter transportation over the next decade, uncertainty over the future competitive and technological landscape introduces significant risks as well.\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS\n--U.S. industry light vehicle sales total about 17.5 million units in 2016 and global sales rise in the low-single-digit range.\n--Beyond 2016, U.S. industry sales growth plateaus at around 17 million per year, the Chinese market grows at a low- to mid-single-digit rate, Western Europe continues to improve and South America slowly improves, but other developing markets are uneven.\n--Over the intermediate term, Ford's revenue growth is tied primarily to global volume growth and modest price increases, while global market share is held about constant.\n--Automotive EBITDA margins rise over the next several years as global production volumes grow, the company makes continued progress on cost efficiencies, and profitability rises on new model introductions, while spending on mobility initiatives, as well as increased vehicle technology investments put some downward pressure on margins.\n--Capital spending runs at about 5% to 6% of automotive revenue over the intermediate term.\n--The company returns excess cash to shareholders through supplemental dividends.\n--The company maintains a target automotive cash balance of about $20 billion, augmented by about $10 billion of automotive revolver capacity.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n--Maintaining a North American automotive EBIT margin above 10% on a sustained basis;\n--Maintaining a global automotive EBIT margin above 4% on a sustained basis;\n--Maintaining a FCF margin of 2% or higher;\n--Continued progress toward reducing automotive debt to $10 billion by 2018;\n--Further sales growth in developing regions.\nNegative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include:\n--A decision to reduce the company's automotive cash target to below $20 billion;\n--A sustained period of negative FCF, excluding non-recurring items;\n--A shift away from the company's debt-reduction activities, particularly to fund shareholder-friendly activities;\n--An unexpected merger or acquisition that materially weakens the company's credit profile.\nFitch maintains the following ratings on Ford and its subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook:\nFord Motor Company\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Unsecured revolving credit facility rating at 'BBB';\n--Senior unsecured notes rating at 'BBB'.\nFord Motor Co. of Australia Limited\n--Long-term IDR at 'BBB'.\nFord Motor Credit Company LLC\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'F2';\n--Long-term senior shelf at 'BBB';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB';\n--Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'.\nFCE Bank Plc\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'F2';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB';\n--CP at 'F2';\n--Short-term deposits at 'F2'.\nFord Capital B.V.\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB'.\nFord Credit Canada Limited\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'F2';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB';\n--CP at 'F2'.\nFord Credit de Mexico S.A., de C.V.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business, tapping debt markets for the first time in nearly four years to fund investment in new technologies.\nThe No. 2 U.S. auto maker disclosed the debt issuance in a regulatory filing Monday and said it would take advantage of favorable market conditions to raise money for “general corporate purposes.”\nThe move comes after several years of banking big profits on increasing sales of trucks and sport utilities. The company has signaled it expects increased pressure as the U.S. light-vehicle market plateaus, regulatory costs increase and the race to make cars more autonomous heats up.\nOnce awash in debt, Ford F, +1.63% paid down its obligations in the years following the financial crisis to revitalize its balance sheet. General Motors Co. GM, -0.26% and Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU, +6.29% , filed for bankruptcy in 2009 to erase billions of dollars in debt.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nRichard Branson: 'Thousands' will go to space soon (2:28) Two years after a fatal accident, Virgin Galactic launched its first successful test flight in September. Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are racing to send tourists to space. Branson talks to MarketWatch about the future of space travel.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump warns another U.S. company.\nThe Dow 20,000 man sees a ‘safety bubble.’\nMore from MarketWatch Oil prices log highest settlement since July 2015 McDonald's Big Mac: A Short History Dow opens at record as oil rally helps Wall Street shake off Italy's referendum",

      "text": "By Mary Conway 2016-12-05 21:00 Owners of 2015 Ford F-150s are upset over steering wheels that are peeling An owner of a 2015 Ford F-150 complained on a forum about problems with his steering wheel peeling and looking bad. Other owners are reporting similar problems. \nAn angry owner of a 2015 Ford F-150 started the conversation complaining that the leather-like finish on his steering wheel was disintegrating. Tenacious from Florida wrote “More falls off everyone time I drive, it's happening in a few spots. Anyone else have this happening?” \nA driver who goes by Bleda agreed. “Not surprised, the leather on my steering wheel is probably the worst quality leather I've ever had in a vehicle. I honestly thought it was vinyl.” \nAn owner from Colorado was stunned. Platinum said “Are you wearing Gloves that might be abrasive? The wear looks unusual. I've owned many Leather F150 steering Wheels & never had a problem.” A driver from Maine tried to help, “It's vinyl coated leather. The vinyl is flaking off. It's a covered repair under warranty if you take it in to your dealer.” \nA Canadian driver is similarly angry, “Mine isn't peeling but it sure looks shiny and crappy, considering how fake and terrible the leather is I'd expect it to wear better.” \nA woman from Colorado says her husband is having the same problem on his Ford Explorer, “Hubby has a Ford Explorer and it's doing the same thing... not leather. Definitely vinyl on steering wheel. Should be covered under warranty.” \nA driver from Texas has noticed exactly the same thing with his 2015 Ford F-150, “I have a '15 XLT 302A as well and mine is doing the exact same thing...off to the dealership tomorrow.” \nSurprising, another Ford owner says the problem isn’t limited to just trucks and SUVs. “Sadly it's not only a truck problem...The steering in my wife's 2015 Mustang with the imitation leather steering wheel is doing the exact same thing...Sooo I guess it's a trip to the dealer.” \nAnother trucker named Corey says “my 15 XLT had the same issue, took it to the dealer at 35,995k on the odometer and they got the approval to replace it. Back ordered till 2017 tho.” \nTenacious took his truck to the dealer and was approved for a new wheel. Because it was back-ordered it took several weeks to arrive. In the meantime a number of the other truck owners who were already out-of-warranty started ordering new, better made leather steering wheels from the dealer. Apparently most of them are easy to install and simply plug into the current wiring. There are questions about adaptive cruise control and heated steering wheels and what happens if the truck isn’t equipped properly. \nOne owner posted that he had purchased and installed a new wheel built for the Limited trim level and was very pleased. “Done like dinner! Easy peasy. Took half an hour from start to finish. Everything plugged in no problem and works perfect. What an upgrade!! This is the way it should've been.” The change is expensive, about $400. If you have the dealer install it, it can add over $100 in labor.",

      "text": "| License Photo DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 5 (UPI) -- Ford Motor Co. announced in a regulatory filing Monday it plans to raise nearly $3 billion to increase its push into areas of transportation beyond simply making and selling vehicles.\nInvestors picked up more than $2 billion worth of 10- and 30-year bonds Monday, which Ford said it will use to bolster efforts in self-driving cars, electric cars and mobility. In total, the company plans to raise $2.8 billion with the debt issuance.\nThe company said the new areas of focus are essential as more companies pop up with transportation options, from ride-hailing and car-sharing to basic technologies being introduced for cars and trucks.\n\"Consistent with our recent investor day presentations, we continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility,\" the company said in a statement.\nIn recent months, Ford has bought a van-shuttle service in San Francisco and a stake in the laser-sensor maker Velodyne, which makes parts for autonomous cars, among other smaller and start-up companies, in an effort to compete with Uber, Google and others looking to create the future of transportation.\nFord announced recently it plans to have around 100,000 autonomous vehicles for ride-sharing services on the road that function without a steering wheel or gas and brake pedals by 2021. In 2016, the company had about 30 of the vehicles in testing on the road and plans to increase that number to 90 test vehicles during 2017.\nFord has also invested $4.5 billion to convert nearly half its vehicle line-up to running on electricity by 2020.\n\"For us, the world is changing,\" Mark Fields , CEO at Ford, told Bloomberg. \"The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that's really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.\"\n  Fitbit to buy Pebble smartwatch company for $40M New emissions scandal linked to Audi gasoline models Symantec to acquire Lifelock for $2.3B",

      "text": "  debt , Ford Ford sells US$2.8b in auto debt to boost tech spending Decrease Font Size Increase Font Size Text Size Print This Page New York – Investors piled into Ford Motor Co’s first automotive borrowing in almost four years, allowing the company to slash interest rates on a US$2.8 billion (RM12.5 billion) debt sale as it boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles. The automaker sold 10-year and 30-year notes yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors put in about US$8.7 billion of orders for the bonds, said a person familiar with the matter, letting Ford sell more than the US$2 billion it initially anticipated. Ford’s last automotive issue was for US$2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had US$13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of US$11.2 billion. Ford has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc and Google. The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The second-largest US carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis — without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — on the road in five years. It’s also investing US$4.5 billion to convert 40 per cent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San FrancisCo “Ford is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to issue long-term debt to raise capital for general corporate purposes,” Brad Carroll, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. “We continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility.” \nFord’s US$1.3 billion of 5.29 per cent coupon 30-year bonds yield 2.2 per centage points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. That’s down from initial price talks of 2.4 per centage points, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. The company also sold US$1.5 billion of 4.35 per cent coupon 10-year notes. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker is raising new cash as it looks at the changing landscape in transportation. Ford is working with cities around the world to come up with transportation solutions that go beyond selling cars to individual drivers and include vehicle sharing, ride hailing and other modes of mobility. The world’s middle class will double over the next 15 years, as more people crowd into huge urban centers, which would create global gridlock if everyone is driving their own car. “For us, the world is changing,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive officer, said in an interview Friday. “The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that’s really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.” Ford is a perennial issuer of debt for its Ford Motor Credit Co lending unit, which uses the proceeds to make car loans to consumers. Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed Monday’s sale. Ford shares rose 1.6 per cent to close at US$12.44 in New York. The stock is off 12 per cent this year. — Bloomberg",

      "text": "Relive Two Of Ford’s Historic Le Mans Victories With LEGO’s New Racers December 5, 2016 \nLEGO’s Speed Champions line may not be as fantastically detailed as their Technic cars , but they do have some amazing models at very affordable prices. The newest addition to the line brings a couple of Le Mans-winning racers to your sprawling mini-garage in the form of the LEGO 1966 Ford GT40 and the LEGO 2016 Ford GT. \nDesigned by Craig Callum, the models pay homage to two of the automaker’s most historic endurance racing wins – their very first Le Mans trophy and this year’s comeback victory. Since these aren’t Technics, the cars won’t actually run, but they sure would make for a fine fleet to line up on a shelf somewhere in the house. \nThe LEGO 1966 Ford GT40 comes in the same black paint job with white racing stripes that ended Ferrari’s dominance in the world’s oldest endurance race, jumpstarting Ford’s four-win streak to finish out the 60s. The LEGO 2016 Ford GT, on the other hand, sports the car’s red-white-and-blue EcoBoost livery, complete with a good load of detail found in the original racer. Both cars come in a single set, along with minifigures for driving the vehicles, a chequered flag, and a Le mans trophy, so you can stage your own endurance races at home. \nSlated for availability in March of next year, the LEGO Le Mans Ford GT cars are priced at €34.99.",

      "title": "Fitch Rates Ford's Proposed Notes 'BBB'",
      "text": "Fitch Rates Ford's Proposed Notes 'BBB'\nFitch Ratings has assigned a rating of 'BBB' to Ford Motor Company's (Ford) proposed issuance of senior unsecured notes. The Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Ford is 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook.\nA full list of the ratings of Ford and its subsidiaries is included at the end of this release.\nThe proposed notes will be issued in two series, due 2026 and 2046. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. Fitch expects the proposed notes will result in a slight increase in leverage, but leverage is expected to remain relatively low for Ford's rating category over the intermediate term.\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\nFord's ratings are driven by the automaker's relatively low financial leverage, its improving global product portfolio and its commitment to maintaining strong liquidity. In addition, the company's ratings reflect Fitch's expectations for further long-term profitability improvement, particularly outside North America, as a result of the company's product initiatives and operational restructuring. Although the issuance of the new notes will drive Ford's leverage slightly higher than previous expectations, we expect leverage will remain in a range consistent with Ford's ratings. Proceeds from the new debt could also provide the company with an additional cash cushion as global auto market conditions become a little more uncertain and as the company increases investments in its mobility initiatives.\nFollowing the proposed notes issuance, Fitch expects Ford will maintain its strong net cash position. Fitch expects that FCF will be pressured in the near term by costs related to the roll-out of the 2017 Super Duty pickup and higher fourth-quarter capital spending, but over the longer term, Fitch expects FCF to grow on improved product profitability and further operational efficiencies. Fitch expects Ford's automotive liquidity to remain strong over the long term, which will provide the company with a substantial cushion in the event of an unexpected downturn. The company continues to target a cash balance of about $20 billion, augmented by about $10 billion in revolver capacity, which we believe is sufficient to allow the company to withstand a moderate to severe downturn without the need for significant additional borrowing.\nFitch expects Ford's profitability to remain relatively solid for a global mass-market auto manufacturer over the intermediate term, with automotive EBIT margins in the mid-single-digit range. Margins are likely to be weighed down by continued weakness in the South American market and challenging conditions in Europe, despite the potential for modest near-term demand growth in both regions. Fitch expects North American (NA) margins to remain relatively strong over the longer term, in the high-single-digit range, as the company benefits from consumers' increasing preference for pickups and SUVs over compact and midsize passenger cars, although a combination of slightly weaker NA demand, increased mobility investments, and Super Duty launch costs will depress NA margins somewhat over the near term.\nFitch's calculated automotive EBITDA in the last 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2016 was nearly $12 billion, leading to an automotive EBITDA margin of 8%. Ford's automotive debt was nearly $14 billion (excluding unamortized premiums, discounts and issuance costs), leading to automotive EBITDA leverage of 1.2x at Sept. 30, 2016. Fitch expects automotive leverage to remain in the low- to mid-1x range over the intermediate term, including the proposed issuance, and to slowly decline over the longer term on increased EBITDA and modest automotive debt reduction, primarily related to amortization of the company's U.S. Department of Energy loans.\nFord had over $24 billion in automotive cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at Sept. 30, 2016, leading to a net cash position of nearly $11 billion. In addition to its cash and cash equivalents, Ford had about $10 billion available on its primary revolver (excluding $3 billion allocated to Ford Credit) at Sept. 30, 2016. Ford produced $2.7 billion automotive FCF (after regular dividends, but excluding supplemental dividends) in the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2016, but Fitch expects the company to produce full-year 2016 automotive FCF in the $500 million to $1 billion range on higher capital spending and lower operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOver the next decade, the global auto industry is likely to experience significant change from emerging vehicle technologies and new transportation business models. Among the traditional auto manufacturers, Ford has been one of the more active companies working on ways to remain relevant in this changing transportation context. It has been among the first mass-market auto manufacturers to strategically position itself to take advantage of changes in future transportation with various initiatives at its Ford Smart Mobility LLC subsidiary, which cover a range of technologies and businesses, from automated driving to car sharing. Although the company appears well positioned to compete as new technologies alter transportation over the next decade, uncertainty over the future competitive and technological landscape introduces significant risks as well.\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS\n--U.S. industry light vehicle sales total about 17.5 million units in 2016 and global sales rise in the low-single-digit range.\n--Beyond 2016, U.S. industry sales growth plateaus at around 17 million per year, the Chinese market grows at a low- to mid-single-digit rate, Western Europe continues to improve and South America slowly improves, but other developing markets are uneven.\n--Over the intermediate term, Ford's revenue growth is tied primarily to global volume growth and modest price increases, while global market share is held about constant.\n--Automotive EBITDA margins rise over the next several years as global production volumes grow, the company makes continued progress on cost efficiencies, and profitability rises on new model introductions, while spending on mobility initiatives, as well as increased vehicle technology investments put some downward pressure on margins.\n--Capital spending runs at about 5% to 6% of automotive revenue over the intermediate term.\n--The company returns excess cash to shareholders through supplemental dividends.\n--The company maintains a target automotive cash balance of about $20 billion, augmented by about $10 billion of automotive revolver capacity.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\n--Maintaining a North American automotive EBIT margin above 10% on a sustained basis;\n--Maintaining a global automotive EBIT margin above 4% on a sustained basis;\n--Maintaining a FCF margin of 2% or higher;\n--Continued progress toward reducing automotive debt to $10 billion by 2018;\n--Further sales growth in developing regions.\nNegative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include:\n--A decision to reduce the company's automotive cash target to below $20 billion;\n--A sustained period of negative FCF, excluding non-recurring items;\n--A shift away from the company's debt-reduction activities, particularly to fund shareholder-friendly activities;\n--An unexpected merger or acquisition that materially weakens the company's credit profile.\nFitch maintains the following ratings on Ford and its subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook:\nFord Motor Company\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Unsecured revolving credit facility rating at 'BBB';\n--Senior unsecured notes rating at 'BBB'.\nFord Motor Co. of Australia Limited\n--Long-term IDR at 'BBB'.\nFord Motor Credit Company LLC\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'F2';\n--Long-term senior shelf at 'BBB';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB';\n--Commercial paper (CP) at 'F2'.\nFCE Bank Plc\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'F2';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB';\n--CP at 'F2';\n--Short-term deposits at 'F2'.\nFord Capital B.V.\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB'.\nFord Credit Canada Limited\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BBB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'F2';\n--Senior unsecured at 'BBB';\n--CP at 'F2'.\nFord Credit de Mexico S.A., de C.V.

DETAILS OF THIS SERVICE FOR RATINGS FOR WHICH THE LEAD ANALYST IS BASED IN AN EU-REGISTERED ENTITY CAN BE FOUND ON THE ENTITY SUMMARY PAGE FOR THIS ISSUER ON THE FITCH WEBSITE.\nCopyright (c) 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.\nThe information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.\nFor Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

      "text": "By Christina Rogers\nAuto giant investing in new technologies\nFord Motor Co. will raise $2.8 billion in new long-term financing for its automotive business, tapping debt markets for the first time in nearly four years to fund investment in new technologies.\nThe No. 2 U.S. auto maker disclosed the debt issuance in a regulatory filing Monday and said it would take advantage of favorable market conditions to raise money for \"general corporate purposes.\"\nThe move comes after several years of banking big profits on increasing sales of trucks and sport utilities. The company has signaled it expects increased pressure as the U.S. light-vehicle market plateaus, regulatory costs increase and the race to make cars more autonomous heats up.\nOnce awash in debt, Ford (F) paid down its obligations in the years following the financial crisis to revitalize its balance sheet. General Motors Co. (GM) and Chrysler, now part of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA.MI) , filed for bankruptcy in 2009 to erase billions of dollars in debt.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-motor-seeks-to-raise-money-to-invest-in-new-technologies-1480956634).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump warns another U.S. company (http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-warns-another-u-s-company-1480899497?mod=mktw).\nThe Dow 20,000 man sees a 'safety bubble.'

      "text": "Westworld: Anthony Hopkins on Ford's Fate Amy Awesome Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nAnthony Hopkins is absolutely brilliant and enigmatic on HBO's new hit series Westworld. \nWhile the first season may have ended last night, his portrayal of the genius scientist and god-like character Dr. Robert Ford will continue to haunt us and force us to question what reaching a higher consciousness really means. \nMost of you know by now that Dr. Ford set an intriguing and mysterious \"pro-host\" plan in motion in the finale, which ultimately led to Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) putting a gun to the back of his head and pulling the trigger in front of a human audience. \nIn fact, his \"farewell speech\" was rather captivating: \n\"As you don’t want to change, or cannot change, because you’re only human after all. But then I realized someone was paying attention. Someone who could change, so I began to compose s new story for them. It begins with the birth of a new people and the choices they will have to make and the people they will decide to become. ” \nIn a recent interview with EW , Anthony Hopkins explained his mastermind character: \n\" He’s obviously a very proud man fascinated by human intelligence, the nature of intelligence, the history of the human being, the nature of consciousness, and the theory that human consciousness – as we know it today – started very recently. \" \nWhen asked about the fate of his character, he made a reference to his favorite science-fiction film: \n\" So he’s a destructive man, as well. He wants to create a pure dystopia or utopia, but he begins to realize somewhere in there that he’s lost track of it. I think he’s troubled by his own conscience. I remember the one thing that did catch my attention when I started reading the scripts, was one of my favorite science-fiction movies – I’m not a science-fiction buff, but there’s a movie with Walter Pidgeon called The Forbidden Planet. Where Morbius creates this huge monster to guard his kingdom but he isn’t even aware that he’s created this monster until he realizes, “My god, I did this.” And then he destroys himself. \" \nIn the end, Dr. Robert Ford realized he created something that he no longer had control over and \"destroyed\" himself and set everything else on a path to freedom. \nNow, whether or not Dolores shot and killed the human version of Ford or a \"host\" version of Ford is yet to be determined... \nCould there be two Fords or did he really end it all for himself while setting everything else in motion?",

      "text": "Dec. 6, 2016 Westworld Creators on the Season Finale Reveals, Ford's Plan and What to Expect in Season 2 Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy discuss what the events of the finale have set up for the show's second season. By Eric Goldman \nWarning: Full spoilers for the Westworld: Season 1 finale follow. \nWestworld’s first season has come to a close, and suffice to say, fans can’t wait to see what happens next – though they will indeed have to wait, unfortunately, as the show isn’t likely to rerurn until 2018 for Season 2. In the meantime though, I spoke to the show’s creators, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy – who co-wrote the season finale, with Nolan directing as well – to discuss the big reveals that occurred and what it means for the future. \nNolan and Joy weighed in on what we learned, what it could mean and more, including how they felt that some of their big reveals were being predicted online by a passionate group of Westworld fan theorists. \nIGN: I know you guys are going to have to evade some of my questions but I'm going to try, dammit! It felt like Ford was obviously very aware of what was about to happen at the end, but we should not take it that he in any way programmed Dolores to kill him, right? This was still her decision; just one that he was pretty sure was going to happen? \nJonathan Nolan: Yeah, or otherwise it betrays his point. There's a distinction there -- and it's a distinction that we're fascinated with and have been from the beginning -- between dictating someone's behavior and understanding it. And understanding it to a sort of grandiose level. That sort of plays in the space of fate and predestination and all these sorts of interesting things which are somewhat metaphysical with human beings, although not necessarily -- and we'll get back to that -- but with hosts are very literal. They're programmed to do things. And even within the program space in which they are improvising, in theory there's a sense, especially if you're the creator, in knowing where that's going to go… It's a conundrum of generating a truly random number generator, which is an interesting problem within mathematics and programming, because you need random numbers to have truly random behavior. It's actually very difficult. But yeah, in this moment, we're playing here with the distinction between Ford controlling what's going to happen and Ford understanding what's going to happen. \nIGN: Let me get out of the way, because it’s already been a theory from some fans - could there have been any host swap shenanigans or can you say that that was definitely the real Ford at the end? \nNolan: That was definitely a real Ford. \nIGN: Of course, the reveal about Ford leads us down other paths and questions. Should we assume he is behind re-programming Maeve? \nNolan: That's the strong implication of her storyline, is that it has been a feature of his overall plan here. Bernard has shown us -- and I'm sure all the lovely people over at Reddit have transcribed -- the programming of her plan. And the next step of her plan is not what she does at the end of the finale. What we're seeing there is both the kind of gut-wrenching realization that so much of the journey we've been on with her has been facilitated by Ford, who has apparently re-programmed her storyline toward a different narrative and also facilitated the overall security system cutting her a little a slack and letting her slide by. He has total control over this place, he's so absolute. We want to believe that what's happening here is free will and that belief is challenged. For me, that last moment with Maeve where she decides to get back off the train... We changed our approach in terms of shooting it. Everything that's taken her onto the train throughout the entire season has been steady cam or studio mode, and when she makes that decision and we pull her back on the train and for the first time and for the first time in the series, we're seeing handheld photography, which begins to suggest that we're entering a new phase with them. We just want to underline that visually a little bit. \nIGN: Before we move on, you did say “apparently” Ford is the one who reprogrammed her, so is there wiggle room there going into the next season? \nNolan: I just don't think the audience should assume anything. \nIGN: You mentioned Reddit in relation to the show. This the era of not just the internet but of social media and message boards and crowdsourcing theories. The show had a lot of fan enthusiasm from the second it premiered with everyone theorizing about it. Was the downside of that that some people are going to come up with the right answers? Did it bother you or did you kind of expect it going along the way? \nNolan: No, it's incredibly gratifying and exciting when people are... I mean, what you're doing there is writing in a language and code simultaneously for both the small portion of the audience -- which I fit into -- that loves to play with it and who loves to do the math on that and also the larger audience, equipping them so that when the turn comes, when Dolores realizes that she's made this tragic mistake of conflating two moments in her life and one person as two people, that it makes sense. That they felt it on a gut level. So a lot of things that are layered in there are for people to absorb on a subconscious level, and you know there is a certain portion of the audience absorbing it on a conscious level. I think the only bummer was that thought that was coming out of Reddit then finding its way not into articles, because for my entire career I've been lucky that people have spent the time to write articles about, \"Hey, what's really happening in this film or this series?\" That's incredibly gratifying and lucky for me. But usually that stuff is under a sort of spoiler heading. Here, it was trickier because these are theories and in so many of these shows the theories don't really add up to much. Here they add up to everything. The difference between a theory and a spoiler is tricky. Again, the only bummer for us was then seeing some of those \"theories\" winding up in headlines where the audience can't possibly avoid that. \nSomething that we're hoping in the second season is we might generally encourage reading about the show and writing about the show -- now that we all know that yes, the things we're putting in the show definitely always add up to something -- to try to help the audience protect that. Ironically, if we'd written these things as novels first, a la Game of Thrones, the audience would know that they weren't theories and would be helping protecting that experience for the rest of the audience. \nIGN: That's very true. \nNolan: Maybe we'll write the next season as a novel first and then the show after. [Laughs] \nIGN: You guys had the super fun reveal of this other park with the SW initials. Is it Samurai World, Shogun World? And did you know from the start you where going to introduce other parks just as the film had? \nNolan: We knew from the beginning we were going to introduce other parks. We knew from the beginning because the beautiful playful, somewhat incestual relationship between the great westerns and the great easterns of the '50s and '60s -- specifically, the Kurosawa films that were then remade as Magnificent Seven and all the delicious, my favorite Sergio Leone westerns, Yojimbo becoming a A Fistful of Dollars, etc. Given the nature, the meta nature of the narrative here, that it had to be… That Shogun would have to be the next world that we stepped into. Also, my personal collection of samurai swords was always something we could use. \nIGN: So Shogun World? Is that the name? \nNolan: You'll have to stay tuned. \nIGN: Elsie and Stubbs' fates were very ambiguous when last we left off with them. Are those two questions that we might get answers to fairly quickly in the next season? \nLisa Joy: Yeah, I think in the next season we'll definitely be exploring any loose ends that were left. Stubbs and Elsie are some of our favorite characters and so we deserve to know what happened to them, and we will. \nIGN: We know the basics now, but there are still specifics about William and Logan as young men left unexplained. Will Jimmi [Simpson] and Ben [Barnes] be a part of the show next season now that we know the true nature of who William is? \nJoy: [Dramatic pause] I think we're going to have to wait and see. \nIGN: \"Dramatic pause\" is going in the article for that one. \nJoy: He could ride that horse naked for… I don't know [how long]! [Laughs] \nIGN: The way the season ended with this double whammy of Dolores and Maeve's actions, even if things are contained quickly, it’s hard to imagine business as usual at the park next season. Safe to say a different dynamic is coming? \nJoy: I think any time you think that on this show something might be business as usual, go the opposite direction. \nIGN: Now that we’ve seen how the park functions normally, are you excited to approach the story from a different angle? \nJoy: Yeah, I think the possibilities of experimentation and reinvention in this series is part of what drew us to Westworld. It all happened from a very organic place. The first season was devoted to the emergent consciousness in these hosts. And now that they have their consciousness, now that they can hear their inner voice speaking to them, the question is, what are they going to do? \nIGN: We didn't go outside the park this season, beyond what was beneath it. Will we eventually venture elsewhere? \nJoy: I have a lot of faith in the hosts and their ability to unearth the mysteries of their universe in time. The question is just, how much time and which hosts shall blossom first? \nEric Goldman is Executive Editor of IGN TV.

Also, my personal collection of samurai swords was always something we could use. \nIGN: So Shogun World? Is that the name? \nNolan: You'll have to stay tuned. \nIGN: Elsie and Stubbs' fates were very ambiguous when last we left off with them. Are those two questions that we might get answers to fairly quickly in the next season? \nLisa Joy: Yeah, I think in the next season we'll definitely be exploring any loose ends that were left. Stubbs and Elsie are some of our favorite characters and so we deserve to know what happened to them, and we will. \nIGN: We know the basics now, but there are still specifics about William and Logan as young men left unexplained. Will Jimmi [Simpson] and Ben [Barnes] be a part of the show next season now that we know the true nature of who William is? \nJoy: [Dramatic pause] I think we're going to have to wait and see. \nIGN: \"Dramatic pause\" is going in the article for that one. \nJoy: He could ride that horse naked for… I don't know [how long]! [Laughs] \nIGN: The way the season ended with this double whammy of Dolores and Maeve's actions, even if things are contained quickly, it’s hard to imagine business as usual at the park next season. Safe to say a different dynamic is coming? \nJoy: I think any time you think that on this show something might be business as usual, go the opposite direction. \nIGN: Now that we’ve seen how the park functions normally, are you excited to approach the story from a different angle? \nJoy: Yeah, I think the possibilities of experimentation and reinvention in this series is part of what drew us to Westworld. It all happened from a very organic place. The first season was devoted to the emergent consciousness in these hosts. And now that they have their consciousness, now that they can hear their inner voice speaking to them, the question is, what are they going to do? \nIGN: We didn't go outside the park this season, beyond what was beneath it. Will we eventually venture elsewhere? \nJoy: I have a lot of faith in the hosts and their ability to unearth the mysteries of their universe in time. The question is just, how much time and which hosts shall blossom first? \nEric Goldman is Executive Editor of IGN TV.
