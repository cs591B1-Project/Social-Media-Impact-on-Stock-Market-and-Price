      "text": "Verizon, Chevron Dominate DJIA Tuesday Paul Ausick Tweet Share November 15, 2016: Markets opened mixed Tuesday as the blue chips got off to a slow start. Both the financials and real estate gave back some recent gains and the industrial sector lagged until finally breaking into the green about 90 minutes before the closing bell. The energy sector skyrocketed on a sharp increase in crude oil prices. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $45.81 a barrel, up 5.8% for the day. December gold added 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,224.50. Equities were headed for a higher close before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.24% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.71%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 1.25%. ALSO READ: The Worst Companies to Work For The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Tuesday was Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ ) which traded up 2.43% at $47.30. The stock's 52-week range is $43.79 to $56.95. Trading volume was 10% above the daily average of around 13.6 million. The company had no specific news Tuesday. Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) traded up 2.40% at $59.11. The stock's 52-week range is $48.04 to $61.37. Volume of roughly equal to the daily average of around 26.4 million shares. The software giant had no specific news. Chevron Corp. ( CVX ) traded up 2.22% at $108.96. The stock's 52-week range is $75.33 to $109.66, a new high set earlier this morning. Volume was about 25% above the daily average of around 6.8 million shares. The crude price surge led both DJIA energy giants to solid gains in Tuesday's trading session. ALSO READ: The Net Worth of American Presidents: Washington to Trump Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM ) traded up 1.74% at $86.76. The stock's 52-week range is $71.55 to $95.55. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 10.6 million shares. The company had no specific news Tuesday, but, like Chevron, higher crude prices are always good news.

Verizon covers about 143 million people, while AT&T is close behind with a count of 133 million. It's also worth nothing that AT&T was number one for average revenue per customer, though it's unclear if that revenue includes the cost of average monthly device payments.\nT-Mobile has also jumped into third place with 69 million subscribers, while Sprint is trailing behind with a tally of 59 million. The Magenta carrier has seen a huge number of net additions over the past few years since beginning its Uncarrier campaign.\nU.S. Cellular is still holding strong in fifth place with five million subscribers.\n  Popular Tech Deals Dell XPS 13 non-touch with Kaby Lake $882 using coupon code TENOFF Dell PlayStation Pro Now shipping! $399 Amazon Amazon Fire TV Media Player (Refurb): 2nd Gen 4K for $65 Amazon Panlong Bluetooth OBD2 OBDII Car Diagnostic Scanner Check Engine Light for Android $13 Amazon",

      "text": "Scarface leads the charge for Legends of Southern Hip-Hop on Friday at Verizon Nov. 15, 2016 2:48pm \nThere's one name on the bill for the Southern Legends of Hip-Hop that everyone can agree on as emblematic of the concert's name: Scarface. \nHe can check all the boxes, even without the qualifier that is \"Southern.\" \nRap was dominated by the coasts. Then regions bubbled up. And Scarface was right there to assert Southern hospitality. But, first, the boxes: \nGame-changing affiliations? Check. Brad \"Scarface\" Jordan, who just had a birthday Nov. 6, helped put Southern rap on the hip-hop map with the seminal group Geto Boys. \nTriumphant solo effort? Check. Scarface managed to be integral to the group and an integral part of the landscape as a solo rapper. At the same time. \nLabel supremacy? Check. His resume includes being president of Def Jam South, signing Ludacris as a national artist. \nInescapable song? Check. There are few songs that get heads bobbing like \"My Block.\" \nNo one should sleep on Bun B or 8 Ball & MJG , either. Bun B, half of UGK with the late Pimp C, got a rare \"Classic\" rating from The Souce for 2010's Trill OG . The never-give-up 8 Ball & MJG inspired a generation of Southern rappers that followed, recording together and individually, but always recording. \nThe rest of the rappers on the bill can make a similar case for the title of \"legend.\" The show will be Friday, Nov. 18, at 8 p.m. at Verizon Theatre at Grand Prairie , 1001 Performance Place. Doors open at 7. $56.75-$129.75 Juvenile \nBig hit : Terius Gray hit the scene hard with \"Back that Thang Up.\" \nLately : His last output, Beast Mode , was in 2010. It was his ninth studio album. \nLegendary status : He is Juve the Great, the title of the CD that produced No. 1 \"Slow Motion\" and on which he was in full swagger. He will forever be entwined with the fortunes of chartbuster Lil Wayne because of their beginnings in the group Hot Boys, and he helped make bounce music go farther afield than Louisiana. Mystikal \nBig hit : Michael Lawrence Tyler finally did it in 2000, hitting No. 1 with the single \"Danger (Been So Long)\" off No. 1 album Let's Get Ready . \nLately : Touring. \nLegendary status : Mystikal may have lost his best chance at icon status when he served six years in prison. He's well-received in concert, though, with everyone dancing to the swing of \"Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against the Wall).\" His live show is still kinetic and crowds greet him like a long-lost uncle. Trick Daddy \nBig hit : Single \"Nann Nigga\" in 1999 quickly followed by CD Book of Thugs: Chapter AK Verse 47 in 2000. Further solidifying his reputation for taking chances past the famous Miami bass, Maurice Young joined up with Big Boi and Cee-Lo for \"In Da Wind,\" bringing Georgia funk and Florida bass together in chart-climbing fashion. \nLately : He went on an Instagram rant about how black women need to \"tighten up.\" And if that wasn't enough, decided to continue the tirade on Facebook. \nLegendary status : He made the rest of hip-hop sit up and take notice of Miami again as a hotbed of beats, so he's definitely a Miami legend. But Uncle Luke's still the man, having gone all the way to the Supreme Court over 2 Live Crew , so he's got a lot to live up to. For more news, views and reviews, follow @DawnBurkes on Twitter.

      "text": "WiFi calling is great from the major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint) as it makes the phone in the background create a IPSec VPN tunnel to their internet facing Voice over LTE/VoIP gateway. I know for AT&T this is distributed at the major peering points to minimize latency. Has ANYONE here tried WiFi calling from AT&T or any other carrier over satellite internet like Cruises or Planes. I know for planes there is a FCC law...\n\nI plan to try it on a cruise. It uses 1MB a minute apparently according to AT&T. According to Carnival:\nhttps://help.carnival.com/app/answer...ce-and-hub-app \n\nVPN connections are BLOCKED so AT&T WiFi calling may not work but Skype video calling works...\n\nAnyone with experience?

      "text": "Representatives from AT&T and Verizon continued to see fixed wireless broadband services as initial 5G deployment models. DALLAS – The mobile telecom’s space push into “5G” technology was on center stage at this week’s 5G North America event, which officially kicked off with a keynote address and panel discussion looking at the current state of 5G.\nDuring an early panel discussion on the topic, it was noted initial 5G deployments are expected to center on fixed broadband uses, where a carrier can use early technical specifications to power enhanced equipment able to support both higher data speeds and greater capacity. \nBrian Daly, director of core and government and regulatory standards at AT&T, said AT&T was looking at such a move in order to get a handle on growing demand for video streaming services, noting video support was “probably one of the big use cases that we see,” with the carrier looking to take advantage of its diverse fixed, mobile and satellite assets in order to meet consumer demand.\nAlexander Khalin, director of corporate strategy and development at Verizon Wireless, agreed on the initial deployment plans tied to fixed wireless broadband services.\nOne of the more controversial recent developments in the move towards 5G standards has been a perceived difference of opinion between Verizon Communications and AT&T in terms of timing for those standards. \nAT&T is reported to have led a group at a recent standards meeting looking to get some form of 5G standards on the books by the end of 2017, which is well ahead of the Third Generation Partnership Project’s initial timeline of mid-2018. The move was explained by the carrier as it needing more time for testing some of the standards in order to be ready for further testing and commercial deployments by mid-2018.\nVerizon Communications, which itself is seen by some as aggressively pushing its own 5G agenda tied to plans for network trials beginning in 2017, produced a counter-proposal stating it would like to keep the schedule as is. Khalin did not add any additional comments at this week’s event.\nDaly explained AT&T was looking to get some form of standard committed between December 2017 and March 2018, which would be for a nonstandalone radio specification that could help inform silicon vendors as they prepare to develop early chipsets in support of network trials. \nThe effort was mentioned under the guise of the carrier looking to ensure “learnings” from current and planned 5G network trials could be driven into the standards process.\nJavan Erfanian, DMTS at Bell Canada, came to a similar conclusion, explaining there was so much to do in terms of 5G standards that it makes sense to push on certain aspects if possible.\n“There is still so much to be done that we can’t let everything be done over time,” Erfanian said. “What can be done meaningfully and can be justified in the bounds of standards is a good thing.”\nThe nonstandalone model is expected to drive the first phase of 5G deployments, which would allow carriers that already have robust LTE networks to tap into those investments, including re-use of current evolved packet core as a control and user plane for 5G advances. \nA reliance on current LTE deployments was also cited as important in terms of network coverage issues. Daly explained that with 5G networks looking at a heavy reliance on millimeter wave spectrum bands, services and use cases requiring broader coverage already supported by LTE deployments.\nDaly also noted the reliance on higher frequency bands will require carriers to look at different technologies like advanced multiple-input/multiple-output and beamforming to track a device as it moves around and between cells due to challenging propagation characteristics. \nErfanian added while densification efforts are set to be a fundamental aspect of 5G network deployments, the industry will need to look at the process differently than in a 4G world. He explained densification is not just a linear progression of deploying small cells in order to match demand, but instead will become more complex in terms of matching small cell capabilities, spectrum resources and network integration.\n“One thing alone will not help,” Erfanian said. “We need to look at all options.”\nChris Pearson, president of 5G Americas, added the industry would also need greater support from the government in terms of support for site deployments. Pearson cited a recent move by the European Union to look at so-called “permissionless” deployments,” though noted the U.S. was still far from such an idea.\n“It’s not that we can’t get there, but we need to look as these different methods,” Pearson said. \nBored?

It comes with the Tumi Power Pack Mod, The Hasselblad True Zoom Camera mod, and the Moto 70\" Instashare Projector Mod. All together that's a 1,200 retail value before tax. I'm looking at selling this bundle for about $950. It would make a great holiday gift or even if you just want to spoil yourself. Shoot me an offer but please just know (not to sound rude or anything) that I'm not desperate to sell it so please don't throw me any ridiculously low offers or tell me you can get it way cheaper somewhere else because if you can get it cheaper somewhere else then you wouldn't be wasting time with me. I sell phones for a living so I know what it's worth. BRAND NEW NEVER USED. Again shoot me an offer the worse I can say is no. You can text me at the number provided in the contact info tab.

      "text": "Verizon Offering Fee Waivers From 11/17 To 11/23   Daniel Fuller \nThe holiday season is plenty close enough for those celebrating to begin their shopping, and retailers are well aware of that. Around this time of year, many a smartphone is gifted, often with special deals from the companies that sell them. In the US, carriers traditionally run specials at different times throughout the Holiday season, including the infamous Black Friday shopping day and the days leading up to it. The deals for the period leading up to this year’s Black Friday for Verizon customers weren’t supposed to be made public yet, but an official-looking email was sent to our source over at PhoneArena by an anonymous party, with the format of the email suggesting that the person who leaked it is a Verizon employee. \nThe email provided is a short and sweet one, seemingly an internal memo. It points out that Big Red will be waiving activation and upgrade fees for all customers, whether hopping on board for the first time, adding a new line or two, or even simply treating themselves to a new device. The deal runs between November 17th and November 23rd, and the email advises the recipient to “keep this in mind.” Aside from the limited time frame, the caveats here are decidedly limited; all the email says is that people wanting to take advantage of the deal will need to get a new 4G LTE device on a payment plan, which could mean that those wanting to add a line and bring their own device may still have to pay an activation fee. \nThe email looks official enough, but as with any leak, should be taken with a grain of salt. The fees in question are relatively cheap, running only $20 apiece, but the deal is still a nice gesture and could be make or break for those who don’t have a lot of cash to throw around and want the reliability of Verizon’s network. Still, those who may be eyeing a new device or thinking about hopping onto Verizon could save themselves enough to buy an extra holiday gift or two if they’re willing to hold off for a couple of days and see if this leak is true.

      "text": "Rumor: Verizon’s Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge Available Nov. 17   Jay Decenella \nSamsung appears to have been quite busy of late as they gear up for the arrival of the Blue Coral version of its Galaxy S7 Edge. Just yesterday, a screenshot of what looks like a T-Mobile ad was leaked online , suggesting the Blue Coral Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge will be coming to the Uncarrier on November 18. That is a week after AT&T announced that the Blue Coral color option of the Galaxy S7 Edge was available to pre-order via its online store, with shipments slated to kick off on Friday. But it now seems like Verizon will be ahead of its rivals. At least if a report from SamMobile is any indication. According to the report, a representative from Big Red confirmed that the Blue Coral Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is heading to the carrier this Thursday, November 17. \nAdding to the rolling out of the much-awaited color option of the Galaxy S7 Edge via Verizon, the carrier is also running a promotion where you can bag a second Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge for half the price of the handset, providing you buy the first at full price. That means, you can pick the Blue Coral version for just $16.50 a month on contract, down from $33 a month through the promotion. \nInterestingly, the first pictures of the Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral came through via Verizon back in October of this year, when photos of a Blue Coral back plate for the smartphone were leaked and bearing Big Red’s logo. So it is nice to finally see the real life version hitting the market, especially for those who had longed to get their hands on the Blue Coral version of the Galaxy Note 7 but failed to, after Samsung pulled the plug on the phablet’s production due to a major battery issue. Of course, the release of the Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge is seen as part of Samsung’s effort to fill the gap left by the Galaxy Note 7 and according to reports, the South Korean phone maker has even been ramping up production of the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge to help fuel sales and fill that hole left by the Galaxy Note 7.

      "text": "0 Verizon or AT&T for best rural western US coverage I'm on prepaid Tracfone Verizon. There is also AT&T coverage with Tracfone. No roaming with either of these. I'm a light user. A few brief phone calls, a couple texts, a bit of data for checking email, google maps, and weather reports. I've been happy with the Verizon covarage as I travel around the western US. I get some bars in most places I'd expect to along interstates and highways. Off the beaten path I will get some service if I'm up high enough. I'm considering moving to the AT&T side of Tracfone, mainly because there seems to be a better selection of budget GSM phones available for BYOP, mainly the Go Phones. I like to get one or two new phones a year if I see them on sale cheap (<$50) I've looked at coverage maps but it's hard to tell which is better.",

      "title": "How to Delete Your Yahoo Mail Account",
      "text": "With Yahoo suffering massive data breaches and selling itself to Verizon , you may want to delete that old Yahoo account. If you still have important data in your account, you can download much of it before you delete it, too. First: Download Your Yahoo Emails and Other Data \nDelete your Yahoo account and Yahoo will delete all the data associated with it, including your Yahoo emails, contacts, and calendar events. If you have any important data stored in your Yahoo account, you’ll want to back it up first. \nEach service—Mail, Contacts, and Calendar—has different methods for exporting their information. If you want to keep any of it, you can follow Yahoo’s instructions here . \nBe sure to use POP3 to download all your email—if you set up the account with IMAP, your email client won’t necessarily download everything. Ensure You Don’t Need the Email Address \nSince you’re closing an email account and losing access to an email address as part of this process, you should be completely sure you don’t actually need that email address before continuing. \nMany online services—from bank, credit card, and investment accounts to social media services like Facebook and stores like Amazon.com—rely on your email address. Ensure you have a new email address that’s associated with all your important online accounts before continuing. If you delete your old email address while important services are still associated with it, you may miss important email notifications and you won’t be able to use your email address to recover your password. Sign into your important online accounts and ensure they’re pointed at your new email address, and not the old Yahoo account you’ll be deleting. \nIf you do need to create another email address because you haven’t already, both Google’s Gmail and Microsoft’s Outlook.com are solid alternatives. How to Delete Your Yahoo Account \nYou can delete your account from Yahoo’s website. Yahoo warns that your account may not be recoverable if you change your mind, but you’re welcome to create a new account in the future. \nTo delete your account, head to the Terminating Your Yahoo Account page . Sign in with your Yahoo account details if you haven’t already. \nYou’ll be warned that you’ll lose access to all the data associated with your Yahoo account, including any paid services associated with it. Your account will be deleted within approximately 90 days, and other people will likely be able to sign up for the same email account address afterwards. \nIf you want tro reserve your old email address so someone else can’t take it in the future, you’ll need to leave your Yahoo account open, and not delete it. \nOnce you’re sure you want to delete your account, you’ll need to enter your account password, provide the CAPTCHA code displayed on the page, and click the “Terminate This Account” button. \nYou’ll be informed that your Yahoo account is terminated and the data will be deleted from Yahoo’s user database in approximately 90 days. How to Recover a Deleted Yahoo Account \nIf you want to recover your Yahoo account within the next 90 days before it’s deleted, you can visit the Yahoo Sign-in Helper page and provide the account details to verify your identity. Depending on how long you take to reactivate your account, some of your emails, contacts, and other account data may already be deleted when you regain access to the account.",

AT&T and T-Mobile have already announced they will start selling the smartphone beginning November 16 and 18, respectively.A new report claims the Verizon will introduce the Blue Coral version of the Galaxy S7 edge on November 17. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge is now available for purchase at Verizon for $792 outright, or $33 per month for 24 months.The Blue Coral model shouldn't cost more, but if you plan on picking up this particular color you might want to wait a bit. The Big Red will soon activate its Black Friday deals and the Galaxy S7 edge is likely to be among the discounted smartphones.Right now, we know that from November 17th to November 23rd, Verizon is expected to waive the Activation Fee and Upgrade Fee, which are normally $20. However, in order to take advantage of this deal, customers must have a 4G enabled smartphone in the Device Payment program. We're expecting more Black Friday-related announcements from Verizon in the next couple of days, hopefully, some of them will include the Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge, too. The Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge will be rolled out globally in the coming months, but Samsung has decided to make it available in South Korean and the United States first.

      "text": "Verizon May Start Selling Galaxy S7 Edge In Blue Coral Later This Week  57 PST \nSamsung is trying to reignite sales of the Galaxy S7 Edge by offering it in a color that proved to be very popular with the unfortunate Galaxy Note 7 . It has already confirmed that the Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral will be released in the United States. Only one carrier has officially confirmed pricing and availability. Verizon is expected to follow suit soon as a new report claims it’s going to release the handset later this week. \nAT&T is the only carrier in the United States right now that’s taking pre-orders for the Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral . The country’s second largest carrier expects to start shipping this handset by the third week of this month. \nRecent reports have also suggested that T-Mobile is going to release this handset by November 18th . Magenta is yet to confirm this officially, though. Expect pricing to be the same since there’s nothing really different about this Galaxy S7 Edge except for the color. \nAccording to a new report , Verizon is gearing up to launch the Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral later this week, November 17th to be precise. This was apparently revealed by a representative of the carrier over the online customer support portal when asked whether Big Red will be offering this handset. \nVerizon is yet to make an official announcement but from the looks of it, one might be made in the very near future. \nFiled in Cellphones .

      "text": "Comment Laptops, smartphones and tablets on the cheap this Black Friday 2016 from Best Buy. Best Buy \nPeople camp out overnight and wait for hours outside their favorite shops on Black Friday for good reason: amazingly hard-to-beat deals that come only once a year. With new iPhone 7 released just this year, Black Friday is definitely a time to go with deals announced by AT&T, Best Buy, Target, Verizon, and Walmart. \nPhone upgrades to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are currently available for postpaid users for an additional $200. But on Black Friday, the average saving is $250 for an upgrade. A total turnaround of cards just by timing a purchase. \nBlack Friday occurs annually on the first Friday after Thanksgiving. It is the biggest shopping bonanza in the U.S. that it's also marked as a public holiday in some states. \nAs one Black Friday fan says, gift cards are key to getting the best deal. Some carriers and retailers encourage users to switch, offering them discounts of up to $250 plus monthly payment incentives. Then, in addition to this already big saving, a gift card can also be used upon checkout. \nIt is also not necessary to line up or to camp overnight to get the best Black Friday iPhone deal, as most of the biggest retailers offer transparent deals on their sites up to two weeks before Black Friday. On Target, Best Buy, and Walmart's sites, a $250 gift card is currently offered plus more deals that will be revealed on the day itself. \nHowever, some see the best deals on the day itself and advice consumers not to bother buying pre-Black Friday deals online. Amazon is an exception though, as the retail giant starts its own Black Friday 13 days before the day itself and publishes its deals online. \nTelco retail giants AT&T, Best Buy, Target, Verizon and Walmart have already published their Black Friday deals on their sites, and here is a rundown on their offers : \nAT&T: savings of up to $649.99, with the biggest saving deal on switching to this carrier, combined with trading in an old iPhone. \nBest Buy and Target: savings of up to $250, with an additional gift card provided that can be used for monthly payments. Deal is available starting on Thanksgiving Day. \nVerizon: savings of up to $300, given that a customer trades in an old iPhone. \nWalmart: savings of up to $250, with an additional gift card for monthly payments. Deal is available starting on Thanksgiving Day, and appointment in-store is necessary on Thursday from 6:00 pm. \nTrading an old iPhone is a good option for down payment instead of cash. Many carriers, especially on Black Friday, accept an old iPhone and price them accordingly depending on the phone's condition. ",

      "title": "Getting to Know: Walmart Family Mobile",
      "text": "By AndroidGuys \nMost wireless customers are familiar with the big-name brands in Verizon, AT&T , T-Mobile, and Sprint. Relatively few buyers, though, are as well-versed when it comes to the topic of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO). \nIt might surprise you to know that companies like MetroPCS, Boost Mobile, and Cricket Wireless operate on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T networks, respectively. These network operators license the towers and coverage from the tier-one providers and offer their own phones, rate plans, and customer service. Walmart Family Mobile is one such MVNO worth closer inspection. Yes, that Walmart. About \nUsing T-Mobile ‘s network for its service, Walmart Family Mobile is a service provider that exists almost virtually. While you cannot go into a dedicated Walmart Family Mobile store, customers can pay for their service at Walmart locations. Moreover, if you go to Walmart’s website, you can shop for phones and SIM cards. \nGiven that it does employ T-Mobile ‘s network, it does allow for customers to use their own devices. If you’ve already purchased an unlocked GSM phone, chances are good it will work just fine with Walmart Family Mobile. Those which might be locked to other carriers, however, may need to be unlocked before making the switch. Rate Plans \nKeeping things nice and simple is the name of the game here. There are currently four rate plans to choose from, all of which stay under $50 per month. As one might expect, each comes with its own amount of data. Well, three of them do; the lowest option doesn’t include data. $24.88 per month – unlimited talk and text $29.88 per month – unlimited talk and text, 1GB of 4G LTE $39.88 per month – unlimited talk and text, 5GB of 4G LTE $49.88 per month – unlimited talk and text, 10GB of 4G LTE \nA limited time offer sees Walmart Family Mobile giving customers on its $49.88 rate plan a free movie every rental month. The movie is available through VUDU in the form of a credit. \nCustomers interested in family plans or multiple lines can add any of the different options to an account. Doing do results in a savings of $5 per month for each additional line. There is a limit of five lines per account through Walmart Family Mobile. Handset Selection \nTaking a look at the current lineup of phones offered through Walmart Family Mobile we find familiar names from brands like LG, Samsung, and HTC. Dig deeper and there are also devices from the likes of Alcatel and ZTE, too. \nThe selection itself is a mixed bag, but it does tend to skew more toward affordability versus power. With that said, there’s nothing wrong with what’s available and some of the phones were once top-tier flagships not that long ago. \nDon’t forget, you can also bring your own GSM phone so be sure to look around at places like Amazon, B&H, or Best Buy . You may find something better or more in line with your needs. \nSIM Card kits are available in both standard/mico and nano packages. Typical retail pricing is $25 for those; however, they are often discounted. TAGS",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nData is a commodity with ever decreasing margins. Google Fi is accelerating this process as competitors scramble to keep up. \nDifference in European carrier costs show that there is significant room for margin declines. \nVerizon's subscriber numbers already are showing signs of erosion. \nGoogle (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) launched project Fi about a year ago. Project Fi is a wireless service from Google that aims to reduce the cost of cellular data usage. The service provides customers with internet from either Sprint (NYSE: S ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ), U.S. Cellular or other wireless connections. Customers pay $20 per month for an unlimited amount of text and call and an extra $10 per gigabyte (GB) data per month. When Google launched project Fi the estimated average GB usage was 1.7 GB per month. This number now stands at 2.8 GB per month according to Verizon (NYSE: VZ ). \nAs a side note, I remain skeptical of Verizon's number, because in the Netherlands (A fully developed western nation where I currently reside) the average monthly usage is 0.8 gb/month . I acknowledge that there might be several reasons for this discrepancy between nations, but such a huge difference seems unlikely. Since I cannot provide any evidence to support my skepticism regarding the number provided by Verizon, I will take Verizon's number at face value. \nIt is no secret that carriers were engaged in a pricing war. Google has accelerated this since their 2 GB plan cost is $40. Verizon already has reduced its prices from $55 in April 2016 to $35 in recent months for 2 GB data and unlimited text and talking. This is a steep reduction and understates my point that Google is accelerating the erosion of margins. \nData is a commodity and a very cheap one at that. Traditional commodities have at least some sort of barrier to entry such as exploration risk, highly cyclical environments, large amounts of capex and geopolitical risks. Data however does not. The Internet is quickly becoming a basic need. If you ask the millennial generation and younger, they'd tell you that the Internet is already a basic need. This reduces the cyclical nature of the carrier business and makes it more similar to a utility business like electricity or water. \nAdded benefits of Google Fi \nGoogle has several added benefits as opposed to traditional carries. First off, international plans are a lot cheaper. They're essentially no different than the domestic service provided by Google Fi. This means that using project Fi outside of the US will cost the customer $10 per gigabyte with the same $20 flat fee. \nIn contrast, Verizon charges $2 a day for Talk, Text and Data in Mexico and Canada. If that is not your destination, you will need to subscribe to the Over 100 Other Countries plan, which will cost you $10 per day. \nAlternatively, you can purchase one of the preferred pricing plans, which comes in at a whopping $25 per 100mb (roughly 10% of a GB) and 25 cents per minute and text. \nFor anyone traveling outside of the US, Google Fi should be a no brainer. \nCredits for domestic customers Second, Google Fi only charges customers for the amount of data they use. This means that a customer that purchased 1 GB and only ended up using 0.6 GB, Google Fi refunds the 0.4 GB, which comes down to $4. \nVerizon's counter to this is to transfer over the data the customer hasn't used to the next month. This data transfer is only valid for one month and doesn't stack. \nNo contract \nThird, Google Fi doesn't come with a contract. Customers can cancel anytime they want. This is allows people greater flexibility in managing their personal cash flows. \nA negative to Google Fi is that it is only limited to three phones: Nexus 6, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. \nVerizon provides better connections Verizon is widely known as the one with the best connection. However, this is because Verizon also offers good networks in rural areas. Those who do not live in rural areas will not notice any significant difference in quality. \nVerizon map coverage \nWhen we look at the maps we see that Google Fi will be a competitor in most areas of the US. \nUp until now I have only discussed Google Fi's superiority as opposed to Verizon. However, the point I'm trying to make is much bigger. To me, this seems like Google has sounded in a new era of data providers. Google Fi is the first of a new trend and the more Google succeeds the more competitors will follow suit. There have been numerous rumors regarding Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) becoming a mobile virtual network operator (MNVO). Apple has denied this frequently. However, it would make sense since this would allow AAPL to control the entire value chain. \nIf this trend continues, margins should erode significantly. Like the cost of texts and phone calls back in the day, this will continue to decline as data storage becomes cheaper and cheaper. Verizon investors are privy to very fat gross margins (59.5% ttm), especially when compared to their European equivalent. \nThere is a lot of room for margin erosion. For example, here in the Netherlands 4 GB can be acquired for 16 euros ($17). If you'd like to supplement that with unlimited talk and text, it would cost you an additional 6($6.40) euros. One can acquire the equivalent of Google Fi for 8 euros ($8.5) plus 6 euros ($6.40), which means that such a plan would cost $14.90. \nThis difference is not due to significant differences in economies. The US median income was around $50k and the Dutch median income about $38k (35.5 euros). Still, Dutch prices are 57.4% cheaper and the difference in income per citizen is 20%. In other words, Americans spend 0.85% of their median income on a carrier plan, while Dutch people spend 0.47% of their median income on a carrier plan. \nThe above theory is validated when we compare the margins of Verizon with one of the European players. Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) sports a gross margin of 25.7% (ttm). \nLastly, Verizon subscribers have already started to decline. The 3Q16 postpaid subscribers came in 324k lower than expected, which represented a 42% decline. This was the first time in Q3 that postpaid subscribers declined. Adding insult to injury, Verizon saw its postpaid churn increase to 1.04% instead of the expected 0.99%. Some might consider this fact to indeed signal that further margin erosion is inevitable. So what does this mean for Verizon's share price? \nValuationIf we factor in the margin erosion at Verizon the price target is reduced significantly. Let's say Verizon's margins become more or less equal to AT&T (NYSE: T ) from here over the long term. \nIf Verizon had AT&T's gross margin (54%) the ttm gross profit would've come in at and the eventual adjusted net income would come in at $9.2 billion instead of the adjusted $16,3 billion or a diluted earnings per share of $1.94. \nIf the market decides to value VZ at the same multiples as it does today, for example a PE of 13.8, this would mean that VZ would be trading at around $27 per share instead of its current $47.50. \nInvestors should note that this is based on a margin erosion of 550 basis points or 5.5%. I believe that the margin erosion is dependent on Google's success. Google's success will determine how many competitors follow and accelerate this race to the bottom. \nConclusion \nReaders shouldn't panic just yet. This process will develop slowly and Verizon still has ample room to shift the tide. However, investors should closely watch the decisions management is making and thoroughly scrutinize their outlook on data and their margins. Investors also should notice that this analysis centers around a long-term view of the data business and that it does not reflect any immediate changes that may or may not currently be taking place.

It’s called Thanksgiving , it follows the members of a dysfunctional family across a single Turkey Day, and it’s now available through Verizon’s Go90 platform.\nThanksgiving is the creation of Bethany Hall (who was a regular on the cult-favorite public-access TV series The Chris Gethard Show ) and Daniel Powell (the co-creator of Inside Amy Schumer ). To inject some star power into their show, Hall and Powell assembled a top-notch cast. The members of the Morgan and Tuniclif families include Bridey Elliott (who we’ve seen in several web series over the past few years ), her real-life father Chris Elliott (who is an actor in his own right), and the always-exciting Amy Sedaris .\nAs with the other comedy shows produced under the Seriously.TV banner, Thanksgiving ’s eight episodes are available on Verizon’s Go90 app, which can be downloaded for both iOS or Android . Go90 also posted a clip from the first episode on its YouTube channel.\n\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.\n",

      "title": "Verizon acquires SocialRadar to buff up MapQuest’s location data",
      "text": "Verizon acquires SocialRadar to buff up MapQuest’s location data Posted Intel and Disney paint the sky \nWe got word earlier today that Verizon had acquired SocialRadar , a mapping startup founded by Blackboard co-founder Michael Chasen that promises to provide its users with far more accurate location data for businesses — down to where exactly a door is. Reached by phone, Chasen confirmed the acquisition. \nVerizon, the corporate parent of TechCrunch and AOL, will use SocialRadar’s technology in MapQuest . While you may not spend a lot of time thinking about MapQuest these days (or print out its directions to take on road trips), it’s still one of the biggest online and mobile mapping services on the market. Beside its consumer tools, it has a thriving B2B business and a very large number of developers who use its data in their apps. \nAs Chasen, who sadly declined to divulge the purchase price, told me, the company talked to a number of potential acquirers after it launched its mapping SDK earlier this year. One of those companies was Verizon/MapQuest, but early on, the conversations mostly focused around licensing. \nWashington, DC-based SocialRadar will keep its existing offices, but the team is already working closely together with the MapQuest team in Denver and other AOL offices to integrate its data and services with MapQuest’s existing tools. Chasen told me he is especially excited about getting his service into the hands of millions of consumers and developers. He also noted that MapQuest’s reach into the developer community will mean that many mobile apps will soon be able to offer far more accurate and responsive location-based features. “We always wanted our tech to be used by as many people as possible,” Chasen said. \nSocialRadar previously raised $12.5 million in a Series A round led by New Enterprise Associates and Growth Tech Ventures. At the time it raised this money, though, SocialRadar was still focused on building a location-based app. As the team built that service, though, it realized how bad the existing location data was. Using street-level imagery, some human interaction and proprietary algorithms, SocialRadar can pinpoint exactly where a business is located (so your Uber driver doesn’t try to drop you off in the alleyway behind TechCrunch’s offices, for example). \nAt the time of the acquisition, SocialRadar had six employees. They are all moving to Verizon now. Featured Image: Bloomberg/Getty Images",

      "text": "November 16, 2016 7:08 PM Friends University, Verizon planning new stadium tower These images show what the proposed cell/light tower at Friends University would look like compared to how it looks today. Metropolitan Area Planning Department Courtesy photos i   \nFriends University and Verizon Wireless are teaming up on a new cellphone tower that will double as a light pole for the Falcons’ football stadium. \nThe proposal would replace an existing 76-foot-tall wooden stadium light pole with a 105-foot metal pole that would hold the football field’s lights and speakers and Verizon’s antennas. \nThe Metropolitan Area Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the plan on Thursday. Planning staff is recommending approval. \nThe proposed facility is needed to increase capacity for more devices and larger amounts of data. \nPlanning Department report \n“The applicant has stated that the proposed facility is needed to increase capacity for more devices and larger amounts of data,” the staff report said. “The facility will also increase the chances that the applicant can maintain reliable services to the area.” \nThe tower also will include space for at least two other providers to install antennas in the future, the report said. \nDeb Stockman, associate vice president at Friends, said it’s a win-win situation. \nVerizon and its customers get better cell coverage, and the university will get an annual fee for use of its property for the tower. \n“It’s always good to look for any kind of an innovative sort of additional income that we can bring in to help reduce the cost of our tuition,” she said. “Besides the cell service, it’s just a nice little income stream.” \nThe plan requires planning commission approval because the university is in the historic Delano District, where cell towers are prohibited under the city’s wireless communications ordinance. \nHowever, the city’s Wireless Master Plan specifically encourages using stadium light poles as cell towers to minimize any additional visual impact on residential neighborhoods. \n“This proposed monopole at the site appears to be possibly one of the least intrusive proposals for this area,” the staff report said. \nThe commission meets at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Ronald Reagan Building, 271 W. Third St.",

      "text": "Courtesy of AOL April 20, 2016 | 06:52AM PT \nVerizon’s AOL has agreed to acquire RYOT , a small independent media company and virtual-reality content studio founded by a group of humanitarian aid workers and filmmakers, which will become part of the Huffington Post ’s global video operations. \nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. L.A.-based RYOT has about 25 employees. RYOT will join Huffington Post to deliver films, linear video, 360-degree and VR content for HuffPost’s 15 global editions, and AOL also will tap RYOT to deliver immersive branded content for advertising clients. \nHuffington Post has previously worked with RYOT on coverage of the refugee crisis in Greece, a project that combined “technology and storytelling to put flesh and blood on a human crisis that, for far too many around the world, had become an abstraction,” said Arianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of Huffington Post. “It’s just the beginning of what we can do together covering news events, leading cultural conversations on a global scale, and going beyond raising awareness to making a difference in people’s lives.” \nIn addition to Huffington Post, other AOL properties including Autoblog, Build, Engadget, Makers and TechCrunch will also have access to RYOT’s VR capabilities. \nRYOT founders Bryn Mooser, David Darg and Martha Rogers have produced 360-degree and virtual reality experiences spanning the globe, including documenting a Syrian war zone and the destruction following the Nepal earthquake. The studio earned a 2016 Academy Award nomination for best documentary short for “Body Team 12,” about the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. \n“The Huffington Post blazed the trail by empowering people to tell their own stories in their own voices,” Mooser said in a statement. “RYOT is born out of that same mission. Together, we’ll bring our immersive virtual reality storytelling to their global news network and we couldn’t be more excited.” \nRYOT also garnered attention last fall when it released what it claimed was the first documentary film shot on the new iPhone 6s Plus in 4K Ultra HD resolution . “The Painter of Jalouzi,” the short film that was posted on YouTube, is about a man in one of the largest slums in Haiti who rallies his neighbors to paint bright colors all over town in an effort to lift the community’s spirits.

      "text": "View Comments Print By Joseph Szadkowski - The Washington Times - Wednesday, November 16, 2016 \nWASHINGTON, DC — Stevie Nicks and Chrissie Hynde, two grande dames of rock and roll, delivered their distinct musical styles to a near-capacity crowd on Monday night at the Verizon Center. \nBoth female forces reminded fans of their combined, nearly 90 years of expertise in crafting hit songs, with an over 3-hour-long performance. \nFirst up, Miss Hynde, dressed in red Colonial regiment coat, Elvis T-shirt and skin-tight jeans, led her Pretenders through a 16-song, hourlong set featuring tunes from the band’s latest album “Alone,” along with a radio friendly mix of her more iconic hits. \nSEE ALSO: AC/DC and Axl Rose shook Verizon Center all night long \nShe apparently tailored the milder set to the throngs of Stevie Nicks admirers, most of which were probably unaware of her more punkish, bad girl roots. \nThat meant a kindler romp through her charting years with “Message of Love,”“Back on the Chain Gang,”“I’ll Stand by You,”“Don’t Get Me Wrong,”“Stop Your Sobbing,”“My City Was Gone” and “Brass in Pocket” leading the way. \nDespite her 65 years, Miss Hynde sang with a strong voice all night, her familiar sultry vibrato soaring through the crowd. Stalking around the stage like a tigress and wearing a guitar like a third appendage, she had a snarl as well as a smile during the whole set. \nSEE ALSO: Concert review: The Bangles back to the basics at Rams Head On Stage \nThe Pretenders are now guitarist James Walbourne, bassist Nick Wilkinson, pedal-steel specialist Eric Heywood and, most importantly, original member Martin Chambers, who continues to cement his legacy as one of the world’s greatest rock drummers. \nThe 65-year-old dude is ageless with a ferocious hitting style as he chewed the kit up behind a Plexiglas enclosure. He entered the stage in a hooded robe, much like a boxer about to climb into the ring, and often spit water in the air, bounced sticks and perfectly sang backup when required. \nIt’s also worth noting that Miss Hynde has again found a fantastic lead guitarist to work with in Mr. Walbourne. He played every solo at a frantic pitch (reference the rocking “Mystery Achievement” and “Middle of the Road”) and looked like he was wrestling with rattlesnakes as he captured the rawness of a harder rock style. \nAnd, in a testament of restraint, only twice did the singer display her activist roots, though I expected a much heavier diatribe considering she was in the nation’s capital. \nMiss Hynde dedicated a haunting version of a near a cappella “Hymm to Her” to Hillary Clinton and said a new song “Holy Commotion” was about “how white supremacists are not Christians.” \nDespite a great set, I could have listened to another hour. Now, what I really hoped she would do was give the rather lethargic audience, acting like the Pretenders were an opening act, a kick in the pants. \nA heavy dose of “Bad Boys Get Spanked,”“Precious,”“Tattooed Love Boys” and, heaven forbid, “The Adulteress” would have sent lightening bolts through the arena that also would have surely required a trigger warning before the show. \nNext up, the spry songstress, 68-year-old Stevie Nicks, continuing her “24 Karta Gold” tour, offered very much a “VH1 Storytellers” performance to the predominantly female crowd dressed in a sea of crushed velvet and shawls. \nClocking in at 2 hours and 15 minutes, her set allowed fans to methodically appreciate her talent to spin a yarn, twirl in place and sing 19 tunes in that unique vocal style. \nFor example, she told a longer story about being so proud of writing the only Fleetwood Mac No. 1 hit “Dreams” and perfectly recreated that night. \nShe further explained that she actually has the gold 45 record encased and hung up in her Santa Monica house and every time she walks by it, she smiles and gives the single a thumbs-up. \nAlthough Miss Nicks played many a hit from her solo and Fleetwood Mac career, such as “Gold Dust Woman,”“Stand Back,”“If Anyone Falls,”“Rhiannon” and “Edge of Seventeen,” she also catered to the rarities from her almost 50-year-old catalog of songs. \nThose included the almost-never-performed title track from the 1983 album “The Wild Heart” and “Crying in the Night,” released on the album “Buckingham Nicks” way back in 1973. Miss Nicks confided that she wasn’t sure if anyone ever heard that track. \nShe was accompanied by a seasoned, eight-piece band composed of veterans from previous tours. \nEach song was beautifully reproduced with help from back-up singers Sharon Celani and Marilyn Martin and her musical director of over 40 years, and a mighty fine lead guitarist, Waddy Wachtel. \nA highlight to Miss Nicks’ set had Miss Hynde step back on stage to help sing “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around.” Of course, fans were reminded that it was written and co-sung by her good buddy Tom Petty back in 1981, but the female infusion made it a fun take away for the audience. \nEven the last song of her encore, “Leather and Lace” came with a wonderful narrative about Miss Nicks writing the piece for Waylon Jennings and his then-wife Jessie Colter. She felt the need to get final approval from her then-boyfriend, Don Henley, before delivering the finished work. \nOf course, Miss Nicks, and not the Jennings, would eventually record the song as a duet with Mr. Henley in 1981, and it was one of the hits that launched her solo career. \nOverall, Miss Nicks offered a career’s worth of memories all night and told her fans that dreams do come true. \nSpecifically, she reminded all creative souls that at any point in their life, even at 68 years old, to “never ever give up, just reach out and get those stars and bring them into you. It’s all possible.”",

Post to Facebook Belle Isle Grand Prix 2017 tickets go on sale Thursday Tickets on sale for 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series weekend at Belle Isle.  //on.freep.com/2g02WdT   Join the Conversation   Belle Isle Grand Prix 2017 tickets go on sale Thursday Mike Brudenell , Detroit Free Press 9:01 p.m. EST November 16, 2016 Buy Photo Belle Isle Grand Prix chairman Bud Denker. (Photo: Mike Brudenell, DFP) Buy Photo \nThe fastest sports ticket in town will go on sale at 9 a.m. Thursday. \nRace fans can order their seats to the 2017 Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix, which will take place on the island June 2-4 and features the Verizon IndyCar Series \"Chevy Dual in Detroit\" double-header weekend. \nEvent chairman and Penske Corp. executive vice president Bud Denker said Wednesday that the Grand Prix will once again offer free round-trip bus service to and from Belle Isle with every ticket starting at $40 general admission. \nChildren 12 and under will be admitted into general admission seating free of charge with a ticket-bearing adult (limit two per adult), Denker said. \nPadded seating in some areas and access to historic Scott Fountain are also being offered for 2017, Denker added. \n\"Our intention is to be inclusive versus exclusive with our ticket prices,\" explained Denker, who said 2017 prices were \"virtually the same as at all levels as from 2016.\" \nDenker said his goal \"is to have all people from all demographics and race at our event.\" \n\"From a family prospective, it's a low-cost event,\" Denker said of the weekend of racing in the Motor City that will see not only Indy Cars, but also the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, SPEED Energy Stadium Super Trucks and the Trans Am Series on track. \nDenker noted that Friday, June 2, will continue the tradition of Comerica Bank Free Prix Day, when fans can enter the course and watch the action free of charge. \n\"Our goal is not to just create revenue -- it would be nice if one day we could break even -- but there's more objectives to simply raising a profit,\" said Denker. \"We want to create an event in Detroit. Big events are important to our city. They create confidence, awareness and enthusiasm. They showcase our city on TV and bring people downtown.\" \nDenker said the Verizon IndyCar Series would again run two races, on the Saturday and Sunday, at Belle Isle as in previous years. \nDetroit is the only double-header on the series schedule. \n\"What better way than showcase your city (on TV) twice a year instead of once?\" said Denker. \nDenker said the Grand Prix was reaching out to a younger audience and more minorities to attend the races. \n\"We are bringing hundreds of young Detroit school children down to Belle Isle over the race weekend,\" said Denker. \"We want their families to come along.\" \nThe Belle Isle Grand Prix has had its share of critics over the years who are opposed to the temporary disruption on the island of work crews erecting concrete barriers and safety fencing and closing some roads. \nDenker said his Grand Prix group was sensitive to their complaints, but added: \"We listen to them and try and respond in ways we can. You'll have doubters, no matter what the situation. People complained about the Super Bowl being here and of it being a nuisance downtown. You always have people who are dissatisfied with something, no matter what. \n\"We have invested $13 million dollars in improvements in Belle Isle. Roadways, bridges, lighting and safety measures. Belle Isle is a better place since the DNR has been involved and the Grand Prix.\" \nFans can obtain Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix tickets by visiting www.detroitgp.com/tickets or by calling 866-464-PRIX (7749). \nContact Mike Brudenell: mbrudenell@freepress.com.

When (or if) Verizon completes the Yahoo deal, additional layoffs are expected at both AOL and Yahoo. \nAOL chief Tim Armstrong, in an interview with Re/code, said most of the layoffs will come in the internet media company’s corporate units, and said the reorg is designed to bulk up staff in mobile, video and data groups. \nMore to come",

      "text": "Verizon’s AOL unit will lay off about 500 employees, or 5% of its workforce, on Thursday, CEO Tim Armstrong said.\nArmstrong, who ran the online media company before Verizon bought it for $4.4 billion last year, told the web site Recode that the cuts will allow him to devote more resources to mobile, video and data offerings.\n\"The layoffs are related to a 2017 strategy where we will add to our business,\" Armstrong told Recode. \"These are super targeted by area and we will be re-growing especially in video and mobile.\"\nA spokeswoman for Verizon confirmed the layoffs, which “are impacting a small percentage of our global workforce,” she told Fortune .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ‘s technology newsletter. \nSo far this year, Verizon vz has added 1,500 employees to AOL through the purchase of mobile ad marketplace Millennial Media and a separate ad deal with Microsoft msft .\nThousands more employees will come aboard if Verizon completes its pending $4.8 billion Yahoo yhoo acquisition. But that deal has been thrown into question by a massive hacking incident disclosed in September. Verizon has given mixed signals about how it will proceed, possibly seeking to lower the acquisition price or scrap the deal altogether .\nVerizon has said it is pleased with the performance of AOL. The Internet content unit brought in $486 million in net revenue last quarter, up 10% from the year-earlier period. But Verizon warned on its third-quarter financial call with analysts that AOL’s revenue will actually be lower than last year for the next six months.\nThe AOL and Yahoo acquisitions are part of Verizon’s effort to diversify its revenue base and find new areas of growth as its core wired and wireless telecommunications businesses slow. But the company has a long way to go--AOL’s $486 million in revenue constituted less than 2% of Verizon’s total revenue in the third quarter.",

      "text": "Just because the snazzy Blue Coral Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge first leaked out with Verizon branding all over , it doesn’t mean Big Red’s subscribers are looking at any sort of exclusivity period.\nTechnically, AT&T got a bit of a head start on its arch-rival, though even pre-orders filed last Tuesday at Ma Bell will only begin to be fulfilled tomorrow, November 18. Meanwhile, VZW has the GS7 Edge up for grabs in a fourth color today, alongside black, gold and silver, with deliveries underway today, and physical store inventory also available already.\nThe best thing about Verizon’s sea-inspired swanky blue 5.5-incher is that, like all other S7 and S7 Edge variants, it qualifies for a pre-Black Friday buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off deal . And it’s eligible for waived $20 activation fees , setting you back $33 a month for a total of two years.\nOverall, you’ll be paying $792 (or $1,188 for two units in whatever coats of paint tickle your fancy most), and at least in theory , you’ll get 90 percent of Note 7’s charm and super-premium specs with minimal explosion risks. Your move, T-Mobile .\nThe post Verizon battles AT&T for early Blue Coral Galaxy S7 Edge delivery appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 17th, 2016 \nIt was always odd to me that Verizon wasn’t the first out of the gate with Samsung’s new Coral Blue Galaxy S7 Edge considering we first heard of the color option when a backplate with their logo leaked online . \nNo matter, though — theirs is now available for your enjoyment . As you’d expect, it costs no different than any of the other models on tap, and it offers nothing more than a different coat of paint, too. If you are a Galaxy Note 7 refugee and looking to stay in the Samsung family, or simply have the type of money that allows you to buy an alternate color model because it goes well with your Thursday outfit, by all means, head to Verizon and snag one .",

      "text": "Verizon, the #1 rated network Media contacts @my3screens 93% of the time Verizon is #1, winning 83 RootScore® Metro Award Wins and Ties \nBusy families and millions of consumers depend on smartphones to stay connected wherever they travel, work and live. How do you know which wireless network will perform the best when you need it the most? \nNew ratings from an independent research firm that tests mobile performance confirm it: once again, Verizon’s wireless network has outperformed all others in more cities across the country, providing you with the top-rated network experience. \nLos Angeles, Miami, Dallas and Washington D.C. are just a few of the 83 of 89 Metro areas where RootMetrics® named Verizon #1 (won and tied) in overall network performance. That is more than double the awards of the nearest competitor. The testing was conducted for all wireless service providers between July 1 and November 15, 2016. \nEarlier in the year, Verizon was also rated #1 in the 1H 2016 national RootScore report across all six network performance categories: overall, reliability, data, speed, call and text performance. It was the sixth consecutive testing period, dating back to 2013, that RootMetrics named Verizon’s network #1 overall nationally. Tops in Reliability, Speed and Data for Verizon Customers \n“Customers enjoy our network to stay connected and share their experiences, and more importantly, depend on us when they need us most like in times of severe weather ,” said Nicki Palmer, Chief Network Officer, Verizon Wireless. “We work 24/7 to ensure industry leading performance and reliability – providing by far the best network experience available.” \nReliability, speed and data are crucial to a consistently good mobile experience. In network reliability, Verizon won and tied for first in 83 of the 89 Metro areas. Verizon also had nearly 3 times the number of wins and ties as its nearest competitor in speed and data results. Good info for your wireless buying decisions \nJust as any consumer would buy a smartphone, RootMetrics purchased Samsung Galaxy S7 devices from each of the four national wireless service providers, right “off-the-shelf.\" Then they conducted simultaneous testing of each network – uploading and downloading data, sending texts and placing calls. Testing occurred 24 x 7 for several days in each metro area, including both outdoor and indoor testing. \nRootMetrics crunched their data and gave awards in key performance categories – a great resource as you review your holiday shopping list. Want to give the high-quality wireless gift that works best? Verizon’s got you covered, and our network won’t let you down. More awards \nRootMetrics’ metro tests continue through year end and will eventually reach the top 125 metro markets. Their full second half 2016 results with metro, state and national awards will be announced in early 2017. \nOnce again, Verizon customers can count on the best Network experience. \nRankings based on RootMetrics® 2H 2016 Metro Area (July 1 – Nov. 15, 2016) RootScore Reports for mobile performance as tested on best available plans and devices on four mobile networks across all available network types. Your experiences may vary. The RootMetrics award is not an endorsement of Verizon. Visit www.rootmetrics.com for more details. Tags:",

In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015 as part of its effort to build a digital ad business. AOL owns Huffington Post and the tech site TechCrunch. Verizon has also proposed buying Yahoo for $4.8 billion. Today's Deals",

Verizon’s AOL Unit to Lay Off 5% of Employees, CEO Says \nVerizon’s AOL unit will lay off about 500 employees, or 5% of its workforce, on Thursday, CEO Tim Armstrong said. \nArmstrong, who ran the online media company before Verizon bought it for $4.4 billion last year, told the web site Recode that the cuts will allow him to devote more resources to mobile, video and data offerings. \n“The layoffs are related to a 2017 strategy where we will add to our business,” Armstrong told Recode. “These are super targeted by area and we will be re-growing especially in video and mobile.” \nA spokeswoman for Verizon confirmed the layoffs, which “are impacting a small percentage of our global workforce,” she told Fortune . Get Data Sheet , Fortune ‘s technology newsletter. \nSo far this year, Verizon vz has added 1,500 employees to AOL through the purchase of mobile ad marketplace Millennial Media and a separate ad deal with Microsoft msft . \nThousands more employees will come aboard if Verizon completes its pending $4.8 billion Yahoo yhoo acquisition. But that deal has been thrown into question by a massive hacking incident disclosed in September. Verizon has given mixed signals about how it will proceed, possibly seeking to lower the acquisition price or scrap the deal altogether . \nVerizon has said it is pleased with the performance of AOL. The Internet content unit brought in $486 million in net revenue last quarter, up 10% from the year-earlier period. But Verizon warned on its third-quarter financial call with analysts that AOL’s revenue will actually be lower than last year for the next six months. \nThe AOL and Yahoo acquisitions are part of Verizon’s effort to diversify its revenue base and find new areas of growth as its core wired and wireless telecommunications businesses slow. But the company has a long way to go—AOL’s $486 million in revenue constituted less than 2% of Verizon’s total revenue in the third quarter. ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Verizon Acquires Space Age Wi-Fi Kiosk Maker LQD \nVerizon has ramped up its effort to create more connected cities by buying a maker of wireless hot spot kiosks for urban areas. \nLQD WiFi, acquired by the telecom giant on Monday, sells futuristic 15-foot-tall towers that can be placed on city sidewalks, in parks or elsewhere to provide Wi-Fi to people nearby along with large screens that passersby can use to look at maps, learn about tourist attractions, and get safety warnings like news of an approaching hurricane. The company is still at an early stage, but it has a deal with New Rochelle, NY to install a total of 160 of its kiosks around the city starting next spring. \nTerms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed. \nVerizon vz has been looking for new growth opportunities as its core wired and wireless telecommunications markets slow. One promising area is the growing use of connected devices, also known as the Internet of things, which includes everything from traffic sensing street lamps to self-driving cars. Still, Verizon reported only slightly more than $600 million of IoT revenue in the first nine month of the year, less than 1% of its total revenue. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nVerizon said it planned to expand LQD’s kiosks, initially created by design firm Frog Design, beyond city street deployments to schools, entertainment venues and privately run spaces. The screens can also display advertising or other promotional content. \nThe goal is “to deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play,” Mike Lanman, who oversees Verizon’s enterprise products and Internet of things businesses, said in a statement. \nNew Rochelle plans to use its kiosks to promote parks, cultural events and job opportunities, in addition to providing free high-speed Internet connections, city manager Charles Strome said. The kiosks will also be used to broadcast emergency messages. \nCompeting urban kiosks with a greater number of features have run into controversy. New York City replaced hundreds of pay phones with Wi-Fi hubs from LinkNYC this year. But the company had to disable an Internet browsing feature after some people used the hubs to watch pornography. \nVerizon’s smart cities effort includes many other components, such as selling smart street lamps that vary the amount light based on how many people are nearby, security cameras that can trigger alerts on their own when they detect abnormal behavior, and traffic sensors to help ease congestion.

      "text": "0 \nSamsung confirmed at the tail-end of October that the Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge would be hitting the four major US carriers , and now Verizon customers can get one of their own. \nThe Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge is now available from Verizon . Pricing is the same as the other three GS7 edge colors, which is $0 down and 24 monthly payments of $33 each, or $299.99 with a two-year contract. You can also snag one for $792 full retail. \nIn addition to having the same price as the other GS7 edge colors, this Blue Coral model has all of the same specs. That means that it’s got a 5.5-inch 2560x1440 AMOLED display, 12-megapixel rear camera, Snapdragon 820 processor, a microSD slot, and a 3,600mAh battery. \nThis Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge gives potential buyers a color option that’s a bit different than the white, black, and gold colors that most other devices are sold in. If you’re looking for a new phone and want something different, you can now get the Blue Coral GS7 edge from Verizon. Source:",

      "text": "Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video Updated 9:21 am, Thursday, November 17, 2016 NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015 as part of its effort to build a digital ad business. AOL owns Huffington Post and the tech site TechCrunch. Verizon has also proposed buying Yahoo for $4.8 billion.

      "text": "By: Verizon via PR Newswire   12:56 PM EST Retail, shipping companies count on the Verizon Retail Index to help make sense of the holiday shopping season \nNEW YORK , Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With the holiday shopping season close at hand, and expected to be in full swing by Thanksgiving weekend, Verizon Enterprise Solutions launches the third annual Verizon Retail Index on Monday, November 21 , offering insights to retailers, distributors, manufacturers, hospitality companies and others who care about the season's retail trends. \nThe Verizon Retail Index tracks ecommerce traffic across Verizon's broadband networks to the top 25 U.S.-based online retailers as identified by eMarketer based on annual revenue. The Index monitors network traffic throughout the holiday shopping season, including during signature events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Additionally, the Index tracks mobile traffic across Verizon's wireless network to provide 'mcommerce snapshots' of the season. Throughout the season, Michele Dupré, group vice president for retail, distribution and hospitality with Verizon Enterprise Solutions, offers insights based on the Index findings. \n\"As last year's Verizon Retail Index revealed, the message for retailers continues to focus on honing digital strategies and 'storefronts' because customers are now living in a digital world,\" said Dupré. \"While bricks and mortar will continue to play a dominant role this season for capturing wallet share, it's imperative to make digital experiences seamless for consumers with mobile 'malls' in their hands and an incredible, easy-to-navigate array of choices at their fingertips.\" \nThe first edition of the 2016 Verizon Retail Index will capture digital shopping activity from this weekend and will be released on Monday, November 21 by 1pm Eastern time . Going forward, findings from the Index will be released throughout the season with an emphasis on key dates, such as final shipping deadlines, which historically have motivated consumers to shop. The complete list of report publication dates includes: Monday, November 21 – Initial report capturing data from the preceding weekend; Friday, November 25 – Thanksgiving report; Saturday, November 26 – Black Friday report; Monday, November 28 – Thanksgiving weekend report; Tuesday, November 29 – Cyber Monday report; Monday, December 5 – First week of December report; Monday, December 12 – Second week of December report; Monday, December 19 – Third week of December report; Tuesday, December 27 – Final week before Christmas report, including final shipping deadlines, Super Saturday and Christmas; Tuesday, January 3, 2017 – Post New Year's weekend report; and Thursday, January 5, 2017 – Wrap-up report. \n\"Consumers are now wise to the new holiday shopping season 'normal' where the old rules no longer apply when it comes to offering incentives, keeping stores open and making those critical conversions,\" added Dupré. \"The keys for retail success will involve tailoring offers to customers, meeting them where they're at for convenience and making them feel they are getting value so they do not hold out until the last minute.\" \nKey findings from the 2015 Verizon Retail Index ' It's a marathon, not a sprint ': The post-Christmas market is as important, if not more, than the Black Friday weekend as the highest traffic patterns of the season coincided with the New Year's weekend. Retailers should not give up on their engagement strategies once Christmas arrives. ' Cyber Monday has lost its shine ': Dates such as 'Cyber Monday' and 'Green Monday' are more like typical days during the season according to last year's traffic patterns. Effective digital engagement by the retail industry and fail-proof website platforms are essential throughout the season. ' Deadlines are motivators – it's that simple' : Whether final shipping deadlines, the frenzied hours before Christmas Day or time-bound Super Saturday sales, it's human nature to be motivated by deadlines and last holiday season was no different as there were significant spikes in traffic volume around these 'moments in time'. \nTo receive the Verizon Retail Index when it is released each day, contact Maria Montenegro at . In addition, Verizon Enterprise Solutions is offering last minute holiday tech tips for delivering seamless and positive shopping experiences to consumers this season. \nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ), headquartered in New York City , has a diverse workforce of 162,000 and generated nearly $132 billion in 2015 revenues. Verizon operates America's most reliable wireless network, with 113.7 million retail connections nationwide.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nWASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has approved Verizon Communications Inc's $1.8 billion acquisition of Carl Icahn's XO Communications fiber-optic business, an agency order published on Thursday said. \nVerizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless service provider, said in February the deal to buy XO Communications would include XO's fiber-based Internet protocol and Ethernet networks that will help serve its enterprise and wholesale customers. The acquisition still needs approval from some state regulators. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Grant McCool) Next In Deals",

      "title": "Verizon set for deeper dive into IoT in battle over network market share",
      "text": "Verizon is set to further its dive into the IoT space with planned network trials later this year and enterprise-focused consulting service launch in early 2017. DALLAS – The “internet of things” may still be a nebulous concept to many, but the growing number of networks looking to support the market seems to indicate expectations on its potential.\nWhile proprietary networks like Sigfox and LoRa are moving quickly to meet initial IoT demand, the bigger IoT picture will likely include established telecom operators relying on more open and standards-based technologies like LTE-based narrowband-IoT.\n“The window of opportunity for proprietary [low powered wide area]schemes to gain market share before the cellular juggernaut hits is drastically narrowing,” said Nick Marshall, research director at ABI Research, in a recent report. “While LoRa, RPMA, and Sigfox technologies account for almost three quarters of LPWANs today, there is significant traction in mobile network operator trials and planning for cellular LPWAN rollout.”\nSpeaking at this week’s 5G North America event, Faraz Shafiq, associate managing director for global IoT practice at Verizon Enterprise, said those early network moves filled a gap and need in the market caused by the rapid application and innovation development pace that occurred before policy and enterprises could react. \nHowever, despite that head start, Shafiq feels the business case for companies looking for larger-scale IoT platforms will marginalize those proprietary solutions to more localized efforts. For enterprises looking for quality of service guarantees or a worldwide scale, Shafiq said platforms provided by the likes of Verizon are likely a better option.\n“As narrowband-IoT expands, the use cases and adoption will be much faster,” Shafiq said, adding roadmaps for proprietary platforms could align with the broader industry, but that new applications and innovation probably won’t be seen as extensively in proprietary platforms. \nThat conclusion was somewhat echoed by fellow panel member Javan Erfanian, DMTS at Bell Canada, who added he would like to continue seeing various IoT network platforms in the market in order to address specific use cases, and that he hoped the proprietary platforms “will adapt so their value is not lost.”\n“I am not here to dismiss one or the other, but instead want to see how we can move forward with the best platform to meet requirements,” Erfanian added.\nAnother advantage touted by Shafiq was the ability for larger telecom operators to tap into analytics platforms in offering actionable information on data generated by IoT devices. \nAs for the opportunities and challenges going forward, Shafiq cited agriculture and energy management as industries most likely to take advantage of IoT platforms over the next two years, with health care and connected vehicles seen as opportunities further down the road. Challenges mentioned were similar to those offered up by other show panels, with security noted as a particularly tricky hurdle.\nShafiq noted the diverse set of devices already connecting to wireless networks is putting pressure on security issues, which could be easily tackled with simple password changes. He noted Verizon was looking to work more closely with device makers to prompt new passwords when devices are first connected to a wireless network, noting it’s “a simple component, but has a large impact.”\nBringing analytics to the table Verizon Communications plans in the IoT space are set to ramp as the telecom operator is set to begin NB-IoT network trials later this year. The carrier is also on deck to launch its IoT Fast Track platform early next year, which Shafiq said would target small- and mid-sized enterprises with help in getting started in the IoT space. The platform is said to offer consulting-like services as well as the option to have Verizon implement a service. \n“I big companies have already adopted IoT or have plans to adopt, Shafiq explained. “I think we will see more of these types of services from carriers.”\nEstablished telecom rival AT&T recently launched a network trial of LTE-M technology is San Francisco targeting the IoT space. The initiative, which the carrier claims to be the first in North America, includes help from Altair, Ericsson, Qualcomm, Sierra Wireless, U-blox, Wistron NeWeb and Xirgo in the site deployment, with pilot participants set to include Badger Meter, CalAmp, Capstone Metering, PepsiCo and Samsung. \nBored?

      "text": "More Verizon (NYSE: VZ - news ) -owned internet firm AOL (Xetra: 6OL.DE - news ) said Thursday it is trimming jobs as part of a restructuring plan making priorities of mobile, video and data. AOL did not disclose the number of layoffs planned, but a source close to the matter estimated 500 positions would be involved, many of them administrative functions such as finance, marketing and human resources. The move comes as Verizon warily moves forward with a deal to buy the core operation of internet pioneer Yahoo (NasdaqGS: YHOO - news ) with the intent of using the US telecommunication network as a platform for online properties and services. About 1,500 people have been added to AOL as a result of deals done by the company during the past year, chief executive Tim Armstrong said in an internal memo regarding the restructuring. \"As we have settled into those changes, there are a number of areas that require consolidation to improve operations and limit the amount of hand-offs in our business processes,\" Armstrong (LSE: 32414833.L - news ) said. \"This will impact a small percentage of the global workforce.\" AOL operates a number of online properties including the Huffington Post and TechCrunch news sites, and is known for its ad-tech services for web clients. The source close to the matter told AFP that the cuts were not directly related to the pending acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon in a deal valued at $4.8 billion. Verizon said when the deal was inked earlier this year that it planned to combine Yahoo and AOL with an aim of each building on the strengths of the other. The acquisition was expected to close next year, but the recent revelation that Yahoo was hit by a massive hack before the deal was made has fueled speculation that Verizon may try to cut the purchase price or even cancel the contract. As Verizon executives were moving ahead pending the outcome of an investigation into the hack, and have warned that what they learn could change how the matter proceeds. \"We are not going to jump off a cliff blindly, but strategically the deal still does make sense to us,\" Verizon executive vice president Marni Walden said at a technology conference in California. .",

According to police, Reynolds told police she was denied the upgrade. \n\"After being asked to leave several times, she eventually left the store and was confronted in the parking lot by officers,\" Epping Police Chief Michael Wallace said. \"She ended up backing up and struck detective Sean Gallagher in the elbow with the side of the truck.\" \nPolice said Reynolds was stopped, resisted arrest and allegedly told officers, \"I hope you die you lying pigs. You guys deserve to be shot. You guys get everything you deserve.\" \nWallace said Reynolds was \"uncooperative\" during the entire encounter. \nReynolds was charged with criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, reckless conduct (deadly weapon), resisting arrest, criminal mischief and second degree assault. She is currently held at the Rockingham County jail on $25,000 cash bail. \nReynolds was also arrested in Portsmouth and Seabrook earlier this year for alleged assaults, one on a Comcast worker in Portsmouth, the other on a police officer. \nReynolds was arrested Aug. 25 for simple assault and disorderly conduct after allegedly striking a Comcast employee with a plastic document holder during an exchange with the worker at the Comcast office on Greenleaf Avenue, according to Sgt. David Colby. Colby said Reynolds was upset about a bill and “lost her temper.” He said she knocked the desk item at the employee by either throwing it or knocking it with her hand. \nReynolds was then arrested in Seabrook Sept. 21 in the parking lot at her address for simple assault on an officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, according to Seabrook police.

      "text": "Dublin schools sued over threat to force sale of former Verizon building Related Items Dispatch file photo Dublin schools \nDublin schools is being sued in federal court by the owner of a building that the district said several months ago it would take by eminent domain. \nOn Wednesday, the owners of Denver-based Emerald Parkway Valley Equity Group filed suit in U.S. District Court in Columbus. They claim that the Dublin schools unconstitutionally \"deprived and continue to deprive Valley Equity of its property and liberty interests\" by threatening to force the sale of their office building but then not moving forward on that announcement. \nListed defendants are the five Dublin school board members and Superintendent Todd Hoadley. The company seeks compensatory and punitive damages, plus attorney's fees. >>> Read the lawsuit (PDF) \nThe building is the former Verizon building at 5175 Emerald Parkway in Dublin, which Valley Equity bought in April for $5.9 million in a distressed sale. Because the district announced several days later its intention to use eminent domain, Valley Equity co-owners Rachael Ward Sparwasser and Andy Ward say they lost all the tenants they were lining up, including Lancaster Colony, owner of Marzetti Foods. \nDublin schools officials are interested in the 118,000-square-foot building because they want to use it as a nontraditional high school for specialty programs, such as STEM and career courses. It is across from Dublin Coffman High School and minutes from the other two high schools. The 15,000-student district expects another 3,000 students within a decade and needs extra space. \nBecause of the pending litigation, district officials declined to comment. \nThe Dublin Board of Education approved filing the eminent domain suit, and Hoadley said in an August speech to staff members that he expected the district to file within 30 days, but it never did. The two parties had been negotiating but couldn't agree on a price. Valley Equity says the district is trying to lowball them. \nAccording to the complaint, \"Dublin Schools has continued to keep the specter of eminent domain over the Property in order to force a bargain sale, but has refused to actually file an eminent domain proceeding because that would provide Valley Equity with process to challenge Dublin Schools’ actions and would require Dublin Schools to pay fair market value for the Property.\" \nThen a few weeks ago, the board hired a real-estate group to seek out commercial buildings of about 100,000 square feet that could be converted to academic space. \n\"Right now, they're holding our building hostage while they shop around,\" Ward said. \n\"We think there is one of two possibilities here,\" Sparwasser said. \"Either they're really out there looking, or it's quite possible that they released that information to the press to pressure us to take the low market value.\"",

The agency had put a \"pause\" on its review in July as it sought more information, but has faced a busy year with a multi-month spectrum auction as well as pending reviews of deals between AT&T and Time Warner, and CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications. The deal was to include XO's fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks. It still requires OKs from some state regulators.",

      "text": "Verizon got federal approval for a key piece of its strategy to use up and coming 5G wireless technology to offer TV and Internet service in more areas.\nAfter some delays , the Federal Communications Commission late Wednesday formally approved Verizon’s $1.8 billion purchase of XO Communications’ national fiber optic network. The deal still must be approved by state regulators in Pennsylvania and New York, but the FCC was considered the most significant hurdle.\nXO’s network of 26,000 miles of fiber optic cable runs stretches from Seattle to Miami and New York to Los Angeles. The FCC had already allowed Verizon to enter a lease to use XO’s wireless spectrum licenses, which are in ranges that can be used for 5G.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nVerizon vz has a nationwide wireless network for 4G LTE and plans to add much faster 5G technology over the next few years. But because 5G signals do not carry as far as current wireless networks, Verizon says it will need to add many more cellular base stations, each of which needs to be connected to wired networks and the Internet via fiber optic cables. In the meantime, the XO network could be used to carry business and consumer traffic from Verizon’s wired Internet service.\n“We are pleased that the FCC has approved Verizon’s purchase of XO’s wireline business,” senior vice president Will Johnson said in a statement.\nThe carrier has said it will likely go national with cable TV and Internet service offered via 5G, which can carry signals at speeds of two to five gigabits per second—20 to 50 times faster that common 4G networks. And current 4G networks don’t have enough bandwidth to support the kind of cable TV and Internet connections consumers want at home.\nTo learn about 5G networks and self-driving cars, watch:\nMany of Verizon’s competitors had sought to have the FCC block the deal. Windstream Services, Transbeam and Dish Networks, among others, argued that the deal would quash competition for fiber optic network operators and wireless carriers that need to connect to wired networks and the Internet. “XO Communications serves as a significant, independent alternative path into at least some of Verizon’s U.S. network,” Dish dish argued in a filing with the FCC in June.\nBut the FCC, in the waning days of Obama-appointee and chairman Ton Wheeler’s tenure, disagreed. “Commenters have provided no evidence, and the record is to the contrary, that Verizon has any market power outside of its incumbent (local exchange carrier) territory,” the agency wrote in its 38-page decision. “Competitive harm is unlikely.”",

      "text": "Last week has been rather dull for the U.S. telecom industry with most of the major stocks losing value. Despite this,telecom companies witnessed a few developments which are worth noting.\nVerizon Communications Inc. ( VZ - Free Report ) announced the acquisition of LQD WiFi LLC -- a New York-based firm specializing on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. With the buyout, Verizon intends to deliver WiFi related public safety features for urban areas and upcoming smart cities.\nMoreover, Telephone and Data Systems Inc.’s ( TDS - Free Report ) subsidiary, TDS Broadband Service LLC, inked a purchase agreement for Internet service provider InterLinx Communications LLC and its unit Tonaquint Networks LLC based in Southern Utah, U.S. The deal will add more than 170 route miles of fiber-optic transport of InterLinx to TDS Broadband Services.\nMeanwhile, U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently fined U.S. telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc. ( T - Free Report ) on anti-competitive grounds. The company’s recent zero-rating practices and its DirecTV service plans seem to suppress competition and thus violate the FCC’s net neutrality rules. The FCC has set a deadline of Nov 21, 2016 for the company within which it has to respond to the allegations.\nNevertheless, it has been quite a busy week for AT&T further witnessed two more important events in the last week. The company has announced that it help wireless customers save data costs by offering them a choice to stream videos at a lower DVD quality (480p). The feature, dubbed as ‘Stream Saver’, is similar to the ones offered by T-Mobile US Inc. ( TMUS - Free Report ) in its ‘Binge On’ services. Also, according to the company’s technology vendor Synacor, AT&T’s project to launch a mobile Internet portal in the fourth quarter of this year has been shelved. The new multi-platform Internet portal launch has likely been shifted to early 2017.\nOn the other hand,leading wireless chipset manufacturer Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM - Free Report ) is leaving no stone unturned to strengthen its footprint in the field of communications and technology, especially when 5G is making inroads into the industry. Qualcomm’s subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., announced the launch of its first 5G New Radio (NR) spectrum sharing prototype system and trial platform.\nIn addition, Windstream Holdings, Inc. ( WIN - Free Report ) , a telecommunications and data services firm in the U.S., launched next-generation television service Kinetic in 13 North Carolina communities.\nOn the earnings front, DISH Network Corp. ( DISH - Free Report ) reported disappointing financial results for the third quarter of 2016 with the bottom and the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nRead the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Nov 10, 2016 .\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\n1. With the purchase of LQD WiFi, Verizon seeks to capture opportunities related to civic innovation and IoT. LQD WiFi presently develops outdoor interactive displays that provide WiFi connectivity along with news, emergency alerts and community information. Additionally, the technology possesses the ability to collect crowd, weather and other data through its sensors in the display. (read more: Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi to Expand IoT Portfolio .)\n2. Telephone & Data Systems is quite optimistic about its merger with InterLinx, which provides wholesale fiber connections to businesses, local Internet service providers and large carriers. Tonaquint Networks provides residential and business services using both fiber-to-the-premises and wireless Internet technologies. Tonaquint Networks also offers broadband wireless services. (read more: Telephone and Data Systems Arm Takes Over InterLinx .)\n3. The FCC claims that it is not against zero rating practices but is rather looking at the varied programs being offered at different prices. However, the regulatory body believes that AT&T has gone too far with the zero rating of DirecTV Now. Moreover, in the ‘Sponsored Data’ program, DirecTV will be paying to AT&T which implies that one division will be shelling out money to another, which in a way implies that the overall company still ends up paying no money. (read more: AT&T: FCC Calls DirecTV Now Services Anti-Competitive .)\n4. The 5G NR spectrum prototype is based on Qualcomm Technologies' sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G NR end-to-end prototypes which include both base station and user equipment. Hence, this new spectrum prototype is an add-on to Qualcomm’s existing 5G NR sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave prototype systems. Qualcomm Technologies’ spectrum sharing test bed is being expanded to support Listen-Before-Talk technology, wideband waveforms with low latency and enhancements in the radio and network protocols. (read more: Qualcomm Launches 5G NR Spectrum Sharing Prototype System .)\n5.

In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. Verizon bought AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015 as part of its effort to build a digital ad business. AOL owns Huffington Post and the tech site TechCrunch. Verizon has also proposed buying Yahoo for $4.8 billion. Today's Deals ",

      "text": "\nThe biggest feature of Lenovo’s recent lineup of Motorola Moto Z phones is its support for Moto Mods, the accessories that can quickly and magnetically snap on and off the back of the devices to add new functions and features. Today, wireless carrier Verizon quietly began selling yet another Moto Mod for those phones; a battery pack from the well known case battery company Mophie.\nSee also: Moto Z and Moto Z Force Cases September 20, 2016 This new Mophie juice pack battery mod works with the Moto Z, Moto Z Force and Moto Z Play phones. It has a 3,000mAH battery inside that the listing claims will extend the power of those phones by up to 60 percent. There’s also an LED power indicator at the bottom to show just how much energy is left in the pack. Owners can charge both the phone and the battery mod at the same time by simply charging the phone normally with the pack attached.\nThe price for this Mophie Moto Z battery mod is $79.99 from Verizon. So far, there’s no word on if any other retailer will be selling this new Mophie product, though obviously it should work just fine with your unlocked Moto Z as well.\nGet it at Verizon ",
