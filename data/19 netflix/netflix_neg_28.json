      "text": "Netflix Introduces Offline Viewing on Selected Titles Available on iOS and Android devices. By Michael Passalacqua \nNetflix will now let you download select titles for offline viewing on iOS and Android devices. \nThe new feature will be offered at no additional cost and can be used by clicking on the download button on the details page of select titles. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation. A look at the new feature, via Netflix Although a full list of titles with the download feature wasn't given, Netflix did reveal that popular shows like the aforementioned Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, and The Crown are all available for download today, with \"more on the way.\"\nThe service didn't shed light on when new downloadable titles will be available, or whether eventually all its content will be available on the move. \nIn the past, Netflix has been against offline viewing capabilities for users, but expressed interest in the feature earlier this year. Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing since last year. \nMichael Passalacqua is a freelance writer for IGN. Chat with him on Twitter about the New York Giants’ unsurprising mediocrity.",

      "text": "7 Movies Coming to Netflix in December That You Need to See Share December 1, 2016 \nThe editorial staff of RELEVANT Magazine. \nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year: Advent is in full swing, Christmas is coming, we’ll all be gathering regularly with family and friends. \nAnd also there’s a bunch of new movies, shows and documentaries on Netflix. There’s a lot there, so we tried to narrow the list for you. Here are seven movies (and shows) now on Netflix we think you should know about: White Rabbit Project (season 1) \nWhen Mythbusters ended after a fascinating 13-year run, we feared the science-y, curious parts of our TV consumption might just end, too. But in White Rabbit Project some of the old Mythbusters gang is back. Scientists Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara—all three of whom regularly appeared on the original show—investigate and attempt to explain weird, seemingly unexplainable “events from pop culture, science and history.” \nWe’re pretty excited about it. Barry \nThis Netflix original biopic takes a look at the early adult life of President Barack Obama, particularly his time at Columbia University during the early 1980s. Australian actor Devon Terrell’s portrayal of Obama is receiving a lot of critical praise. Chill With Bob Ross (1990) \nOK, so “chill” in the title of this three-episode collection is supposedly a reference to the temperature—because in each, the iconic artist teaches viewers how to paint wintery scenes. It’s a double entendre, of course, because nothing is more chill than watching America’s favorite TV painter do his thing. \nSomehow, there’s no trailer for Chill With Bob Ross , so here’s an entire episode: Breaking a Monster \nYou’ve likely heard of the metal band Unlocking the Truth. They’ve gotten a decent amount of national attention during the last couple of years—not directly because of their music, but because the members are 12 and 13 years old. \nBreaking a Monster is critically acclaimed—as in, a near impossible 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes —follows the highly unlikely journey of members Alec Atkins, Malcolm Brickhouse and Jarad Dawkins as they go from kids being kids to kids being legitimate rock stars. Killswitch \nEric Snowden started something. And whatever you think of his actions, Americans now have to deal with the information he brought to light. At the forefront of that battle is the internet and who is allowed to do what with it. Killswitch is a fast-paced documentary that takes a deep look at internet censorship, hacktivism, free speech and the idea of democracy in a digital age. D2: The Mighty Ducks \nRemember 1994? Of course you don’t. But thankfully Netflix is giving us a little piece of ‘90s nostalgia to help close out the year. Let this sequel to the iconic hockey movie take you back: Captain America: Civil War (2016) \nThis year was the year superheroes clashed because new movies make new money. And while at least one attempt (which may or may not be called Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice ) was just the worst. The infighting of the Avengers was a critical surprise, even earning a 90 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes . If you’re like half the world, you already saw Captain America: Civil War in theaters . But whether you’ve seen it or not, it’s worth some of your Netflix attention. \n(This one doesn’t go online until later this month.)",

Photo courtesy of Netflix. By Michelle Mills , San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: # Comments “Medici: Masters of Florence” is coming to Netflix in December. Photo courtesy of Netflix. \nAs we hurtle towards the holidays, many of us can’t help but think about time. We plan for the future and grow nostalgic for the past while worrying about just getting through our to-do list today. The movies and television series set to begin streaming in December reflect this obsession, so take a break and let them take you to another time…if only for a short while. \nExplore the past with “Medici: Masters of Florence” on Netflix. This political family drama set in the early 15th century Florence was filmed on location and boasts lush scenery and stars like Richard Madden, Stuart Martin and Dustin Hoffman. Cosimo de’ Medici (Madden) has his hands full, dealing with his sudden wealth after his father’s death and trying not to let it slip out that dad was really murdered as his seeks the killer. \nIf that’s not complex or timely enough for you, Netflix will also be offering the Canadian series “Travelers.” In this science-fiction piece, a group of surviving humans from the future use their consciousness to inhabit everyday people in the 21st century in a bid to save the world from its disastrous fate. \nAmazon Video will launch the second season of its Emmy Award-winning original series, “The Man in the High Castle.” Based on Philip K. Dick’s 1961 alternate history novel, it presents a view of what could have happened if the Allied Powers had lost World War II. \nKids can get into the time slip with “Lost in Oz” on Amazon Prime. Dorothy Gale finds her mother’s journal and quickly discovered that she — and her dog Toto — aren’t in Kansas anymore. She joins with a young witch and a giant Munchkin on a journey to find her way out of Emerald City and back home. \nIf all this jumping around through time tires you out, settle down with Netflix’s “White Rabbit Project.” Former “Mythbusters” members Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara continue seeking out the reality behind contraptions, weapons, stories and legends, taking on even bigger projects and raising the bar.

      "text": "Should You Be Expecting More Disney Movies on Netflix Soon? Netflix could be joining the Magic Kingdom. Rachel Aldrich Dec1,20161:40PMEST \nYou could be seeing a lot more Disney ( DIS ) movies coming to a Netflix ( NFLX ) queue near you. \nFor a while now, Wall Street has been open to the idea of Disney adding Netflix to its Mary Poppins bag of media networks that includes Freeform, ESPN and Disney Channel. In fact, Disney has already been building its presence on Netflix since September, when Netflix became the exclusive pay-TV service for new movies by Disney's Marvel, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Disney Studios. \nA Disney/Netflix merger could only up the ante on what is already the source of hours of binge-watching procrastination that includes Zootopia and Pirates of the Caribbean . Personally, I'm waiting on the day I can watch all three Toy Story movies in one sitting. \nWill Disney truly be the fairy godmother that makes all of our dreams come true? Only time and a CEO or two can tell. If you liked this article you might like",

      "title": "Netflix video download option breathes new life into old tablets",
      "text": "Shortly after Steve Jobs announced the iPad in 2010, I wrote a column titled, “The iPad is Underwhelming.” Boy, was I temporarily wrong.\nFor about three years, iPad sales kept climbing into the stratosphere, but sales started to decline in 2014. Apple’s tablets – along with tablets from other companies – have since been on a steady decline.\nBack in 2010, I wrote, “The problem with the iPad is that it doesn’t do anything that you can’t already do with a smartphone and a laptop,” which remains largely true.\nWhat I didn’t realize is the people would flock to any easy-to-use and easy-to-carry device with a great screen.\nBut that was before today’s “phablet” – phones that are big enough to rival small tablets. Now, many people who might have carried a tablet back in the first half of this decade are satisfied with what they can do with an iPhone 7 Plus, a Samsung Galaxy S7, a Google Pixel XL or any of several excellent phones with screens that – while decidedly smaller than the original iPad – are big enough to make tablets a bit less desirable.\nI bought one of those early iPads, but it mostly hung out in a drawer. I rarely used it. Then I bought an iPad mini, thinking that the smaller form factor would make me more likely to take it along. It didn’t. That, too, lives pretty much in a drawer along with a couple of Android tablets I picked up over the last few years.\nOn the other hand, I use my smartphone multiple times every day. Unlike those tablets that are too big for a pocket, my smartphone is always with me. I don’t have to plan to bring it along, nor do I have to put it into my backpack. It just hangs out in my pocket, ready for me whenever I want it.\nWhen I can, I prefer using a computer. At home, I have a Mac mini attached to two large screens. I love all that screen real estate as well as the terabyte of storage on the Mac and the ability to work with a mouse. When I travel, I carry a 3-pound laptop – currently an HP Spectre x360 or a MacBook Air, which I’m happy with because of their decent keyboards and more-than-adequate screens.\nBut, like most people today, I’m often out and about, so if I need to check email, catch up on the news or even read a Kindle book, I’ll reach into my pocket for my ever-present smartphone.",

      "text": "Share Regina King has booked yet another starring role. She’s joining the cast of Veena Sud ’s Seven Seconds , a crime drama slated for a 10-episode run on Netflix. In the drama, tensions run high between African-American citizens and Caucasian cops in Jersey City, where a teenage African-American boy is critically injured by a cop. King plays Latrice Butler, a devout churchgoer and a proud wife and mother. After she moved out of the projects with her family and becomes a first-time home owner, she is shaken to her core when she learns that her 15-year-old son, Brenton, has been involved an incident. When she learns that there’s more to Brenton than she and her husband were aware of, Latrice is rocked by the power of her anger at her son’s predicament — an anger that will change her life, her relationship with her husband. The Emmy-winning actress ( American Crime ) joins previously announced cast members David Lyons ( Game of Silence ), Michael Mosley ( Sirens ) and Patrick Murney ( Public Morals ). King is already slated to return for the third season of ABC’s American Crime as well as HBO’s The Leftovers . She’s also spent time behind the camera as well, directing Scanda l, The Catch and Greenleaf , among others. King is repped by ICM, John Carrabino Management and Del Shaw. Sud ( The Killing ), who will serve as showrunner on the series, executive produces with Gavin O’Connor, Lawrence Bender, Kevin Brown and Alex Reznik. The show hails from Fox 21. Sud The series is based on the 2013 Russian action movie, The Major , which was written, directed by and starring Yuri Bykov and produced by Rock Films. No premiere date has been announced yet.

      "text": "12 Dates of Christmas \nThe moral of the story (and of every story, let’s be real) is to never get back with your ex. Like, ever. The main character has to be reminded this over and over again until she can try to get it right with a new cutie. It’s a great reminder to not look at your past and keep moving forward, otherwise you might have to relive the same day and the same mistakes. Marry Me for Christmas \nThis girl is the queen of being a single lady at Christmas. She brings home a friend for the holidays and her family assumes that they’re dating, so she just rolls with it instead of dealing with the fact that she’s still #foreveralone. (I’m definitely debating stealing this plan!) It’s the classic idea that a woman can be super strong and successful, but she still is nothing without a man, but this lady is telling that stereotype to take a hike. Last Holiday \nQueen Latifah slays in this movie! It really makes you wonder what you would do if you only had a few weeks left to live, but I think we can all agree that she did it right. While traveling around the country, she was literally living like a queen. Christmas with the Kranks \nThis is one of the few Christmas movies that doesn’t involve a sappy love story! Tim Allen, the star of the movie, is trying to skip Christmas to go on a cruise with his wife. Seriously? Who would skip Christmas? It’s only the most wonderful time of the year! Santa Buddies \nIt’s puppies trying to save Santa Claus. Please tell me what can be cuter than that? And if the plot isn’t up to your high cinematography standards, you can just mute the movie and watch cute puppies run around for an hour and a half! White Christmas \nWhite Christmas is one of the most iconic Christmas movies of all time. Its classic songs are more than likely going to get stuck in your head until it’s not-so-white outside anymore. It’s something that can be watched with the whole family so your dad can constantly use his typical phrases, “in my days...” or “when I was a kid…” Love Actually \nThis movie is stacked with the best actors and actresses in town. It has Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Keira Knightley to name a few. It’s almost like if Beyoncé, The Weeknd, Adele and Bruno Mars all decided to go on tour together (please, can this happen?). It’s great acting combined with the multiple love stories makes for an all around great flick. Scrooged \nAnother Christmas classic that’s a must-watch for the holiday season. I don’t think it’s possible to get sick of hearing the story of Ebenezer Scrooge- the grumpy and selfish old man who despises Christmas but with some help, eventually comes to be the biggest Christmas fan of all time. There have been many versions done of this storyline, but the one with Bill Murray will have you laughing in the present and in the future. \nGet cozy this holiday season, Gophers, and let us know on Facebook what your favorite movies are from this list!

      "text": "Courtesy Netflix Stay on target The First 'White Rabbit Project' Trailer Drops You Can Finally Watch (Some) Netflix Videos Offline Archer has been renewed through season 10 , but unfortunately, that’ll be its last. If you’re not getting enough adult-oriented, action-packed, subversive satire of James Bond-esque films, you can always give Pacific Heat a shot.\nThe new series comes from Working Dog Productions , a group of Aussie comedy producers probably best known for Frontline , which was The Daily Show before The Daily Show was a thing. Most of the voices in the cast come from this group. The show was originally picked up for a run on the Comedy Channel in their home country before getting picked up by Netflix. The 13-episode season premiered on Nov. 27.\nThe show takes place on the Gold Coast of Australia, which is filled with crime. Pacific Heat is a group of operatives tasked with keeping the criminals at bay. They’re covert and highly-trained, but “they do have their own Facebook page.” Rob Sitch, an actor who voices the character Todd Sommerville, describes it as a combination of The A-Team , Hawaii Five-0 , and Charlie’s Angels .\nThe comparisons with Archer aren’t unwarranted since they’re pretty obvious. The animation has the same bright, stilted characters, who don’t seem to move unless they’re talking, blinking, or shooting something. Archer makes up for this by playing around with the low-budget appearance of its aesthetics with bombastic fight sequences and noir-esque backgrounds. From the Pacific Heat trailer, there looks to be plenty of action sequences that the animators can play around in. However, the people look off in a way I can’t describe. It might be the small eyes, the superfluous shadow on the faces, and the bodies that seem to be slightly disproportionate.\nEither way, the humor is similar, although dumbed down. In two clips shared with Geek, Pacific Heat shows off one of its characters, whose primary character trait seems to be that he’s an idiot who doesn’t know what year it is, and the dynamic amongst the group. Characters seem to talk over each other, misunderstand each other often, and talk to some off-screen presence instead of to each other. Plus there’s some old-fashioned racism.\nI’m an American with little exposure to Aussie comedy, so I’m not sure if there’s something I’m missing. Pacific Heat and the kind of awkward, obvious humor that can stem from over-the-top situations surely has an audience. It’s loud, bright, and uncomplicated. Much of the comedy comes from misinterpretation between the characters and how people as incompetent as them can be tasked with saving us. There has to be more I’m not seeing, right?\nThe series will debut on Netflix on Dec. 3.",

Photo courtesy of Netflix. By Michelle Mills , San Gabriel Valley Tribune Posted: # Comments “Medici: Masters of Florence” is coming to Netflix in December. Photo courtesy of Netflix. \nAs we hurtle towards the holidays, many of us can’t help but think about time. We plan for the future and grow nostalgic for the past while worrying about just getting through our to-do list today. The movies and television series set to begin streaming in December reflect this obsession, so take a break and let them take you to another time…if only for a short while. \nExplore the past with “Medici: Masters of Florence” on Netflix. This political family drama set in the early 15th century Florence was filmed on location and boasts lush scenery and stars like Richard Madden, Stuart Martin and Dustin Hoffman. Cosimo de’ Medici (Madden) has his hands full, dealing with his sudden wealth after his father’s death and trying not to let it slip out that dad was really murdered as his seeks the killer. \nIf that’s not complex or timely enough for you, Netflix will also be offering the Canadian series “Travelers.” In this science-fiction piece, a group of surviving humans from the future use their consciousness to inhabit everyday people in the 21st century in a bid to save the world from its disastrous fate. \nAmazon Video will launch the second season of its Emmy Award-winning original series, “The Man in the High Castle.” Based on Philip K. Dick’s 1961 alternate history novel, it presents a view of what could have happened if the Allied Powers had lost World War II. \nKids can get into the time slip with “Lost in Oz” on Amazon Prime. Dorothy Gale finds her mother’s journal and quickly discovered that she — and her dog Toto — aren’t in Kansas anymore. She joins with a young witch and a giant Munchkin on a journey to find her way out of Emerald City and back home. \nIf all this jumping around through time tires you out, settle down with Netflix’s “White Rabbit Project.” Former “Mythbusters” members Kari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara continue seeking out the reality behind contraptions, weapons, stories and legends, taking on even bigger projects and raising the bar. Coming to Amazon Video",

      "text": "My Life with Rory Gilmore By , December 1, 2016 The “Gilmore Girls” reboot on Netflix portrays a frustratingly frustrated Rory Gilmore. Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY SAEED ADYANI / NETFLIX I grew up in Stars Hollow. By which I mean, I was raised in a village—the “village” designation was always very important to my home town—where an overabundance of troubadours was dealt with in a town meeting, and where I was a dancer at, no kidding, a studio called Miss Patti’s. I was in sixth grade when “Gilmore Girls” premièred, a show in which those quirks were part of the atmosphere. One night after ballet, my mom and I watched. In the first scene I caught of the first episode, I saw a dazzling woman with a strange name looking for a missing bird—her daughter Rory’s science project—and shouting, “Stellaaaa!” My mom laughed. I didn’t know why, but I wanted to. Soon enough, I did. In this way, I also learned about Russian novels and Patti Smith and “Grey Gardens” and Dorothy Parker. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), a stylish innkeeper with an enviable music collection, and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), a sweet teen-ager aspiring to be Christiane Amanpour, were characters I sought to emulate, and dreamed of hanging out with. I was four years behind Rory in school, at just the right distance to follow. We Bush II-era teens escaped to Gilmoreland to watch democracy delightfully rendered as Town Selectman gags. We wanted a mom as fun as Lorelai and a boyfriend as cool as Jess. (He’s from New York.) When “Gilmore Girls” ended, in 2007, and the charmed enclosure of Stars Hollow—its seasonal festivals, its Edgar Allan Poe Society controversies, its coffee addiction—entered cryogenic freeze, I still clung to my parallels. And, even after my life moved beyond Rory’s time line, Stars Hollow remained a retreat (first on DVD, then on Netflix). Yet I can’t be the only one for whom, as the years passed, watching the young Rory brought some of the uncanny dread of a home movie. Ten years later, she seems never to have graduated to adulthood. In the revival for Netflix, “A Year in the Life,” our girls, now both women—Rory is thirty-two, the age that Lorelai was when the original series began—reunite after what “feels like years,” they say, with a hug. In the first episode, “Winter,” we learn that Rory is returning home to Stars Hollow after an extended reporting trip; she is now—the parallels continue—a writer for The New Yorker and The Atlantic . Perfectly coiffed and mascaraed, she and Lorelai banter fast and walk slow around the gazebo in the central square, where everything looks exactly as it did before. (And there’s Miss Patti teaching a dance class: hi, fictional Miss Patti!) Back at the house, Lorelai warns of “Proud Luke”—Luke Danes, the change-averse town-diner owner, who has remained her partner for nine years. When we see him again, he congratulates Rory on a recent piece for this magazine’s Talk of the Town section, and says that he’s now a New Yorker subscriber. But Rory slips from proud to perturbed to past hope. She regresses with an old boyfriend, forgetting her current one exists. Her latest story for The Atlantic is killed. In her early thirties, she is hitting a wall. Is journalism really a viable profession? What is she trying to discover with her writing? How could she fall asleep mid-interview and then have a one-night stand with a source dressed as a Wookiee? By “Summer,” Rory is swallowed by her past life, bumming around her childhood haunts. “Wow, like a time machine,” April, Luke’s daughter (an unfortunate character from the weaker, later years of the original series, who is, nevertheless, very perceptive), says, as she walks into Rory’s bedroom. April, a senior in college, tells Rory that she’s “still kind of searching.” Rory doesn’t seem to relate. “I think I’m having an anxiety attack,” April goes on, over Rory’s thin attempts to console her. “It’s just very weird here, seeing you back in your childhood room. It’s like a postcard from the real world.” Rory tries to squirm away, but we’ve got her now. Journalism is supposed to involve some discomfort; Amanpour’s eminence was built on years of dogged war reporting; and how could Richard Gilmore have been so mellow about his granddaughter pursuing a career that doesn’t necessarily promise insurance? The girl who had for so long been unencumbered by reality is, at last, facing genuine challenges, and her own shortcomings. Just like the rest of us Rorys must. Throughout “A Year in the Life,” it’s exasperating to watch Rory foundering in uncertainty, but she has atoned and reset before. Much more frustrating, to me, was seeing Lorelai stuck—in the office of a vacuous therapist in “Spring”; in a miserably overlong musical rehearsal in “Summer”; outside the Pacific Crest Trail (a tribute to “Wild”) in “Fall”; and, throughout, in murky relationship trouble with Luke. Happiness eludes her. Her father’s death fills her with a foggy kind of despair. (Rory somehow recovers quickly.) Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), the grandmother and Wasp queen, gets the lone satisfying arc, delivering herself from profound grief after taking one last D.A.R. cookie. But plot was never the point of “Gilmore Girls.” The new series, like the old, is all about the hang: “Talk. Don’t talk. Whatever,” as it was defined in the show’s early days. The pleasure of watching doesn’t come as much from what the Gilmores do as what they say (and how fast they say it). And so what is said, in the standout scene of the “Year,” stings. In “Summer,” Emily brings Lorelai and Rory to check on the fifth try at a headstone for Richard. The punctuation’s amiss. While Emily is off lambasting whoever’s responsible, Rory, having turned her framed David Carr headshot to the wall sometime before, tells her mother about her intention to write a memoir of their lives. “No,” Lorelai replies. “I don’t want you to write that.” Rory, like so many millennial writer types before her, has decided that she is her own best subject, but telling that story violates the fabulous vortex of Stars Hollow—of innocence itself. To dwell there is a privilege, and Rory has come to feel entitled to much too much, exposing the roots her mother had so arduously planted, simply to sell a book proposal. Her favorite works of art—journalistic, novelistic, whatever—overlap with life, but she ought to be well read enough to know that telling stories can upend the realities of living. Rory and Lorelai have always talked in circles, never moving, but, at the end of the “Year,” Rory has returned to where Lorelai began. Perhaps, since it’s revealed in the last four words that Rory is pregnant, it will be motherhood, again, that forces a girl to grow up. \nBetsy Morais, formerly a member of The New Yorker ’ s editorial staff, is an editor at Harper’s Magazine .

      "text": "Image source: Netflix.\nSince Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) first began producing original entertainment, stand-up comedy has been a key element. The genre can be cheap and easy to produce, and comedians crave the promotion a partner like Netflix can give them.\nThe streamer has teamed up to produce stand-up specials with comedians like Dana Carvey, Aziz Ansari, and Bill Burr, and it has put comedians including Ansari, Burr, Adam Sandler, and Chelsea Handler at the center of much of its other original programming.\nNetflix recently doubled down on the genre in October when it signed Chris Rock to a deal for a reported $40 million to make two stand-up specials, and it followed that up with a similar deal with Dave Chappelle, paying him $60 million for three stand-up specials.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE! Heres how to play the largest growth opportunity in history Forget Apple! Heres a Better Stock to Buy He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick Some analysts balked at those price tags as whole seasons of series often cost less than the sums Netflix is paying Rock and Chappelle for just two or three hours of content, but the company, which has more data than anyone else on viewer habits, seems to know what it's doing when it comes to selecting original programming. After all, Netflix has nearly 100 million viewers, and it has proprietary information like ratings and when viewers give up on series that traditional broadcasters don't. House of Cards , Netflix's first original hit show was made partly because the company knew its viewers had a penchant for the original British series, actor Kevin Spacey, and Director David Fincher's work.Unsurprisingly, the show has anchored Netflix's originals lineup ever since.\nTickling the funny bone ",

      "text": "BoJack Horseman in \"Fish Out of Water\" Image Courtesy Netflix \nBoJack Horseman fans are particularly fond of the season three episode \"Fish Out of Water.\" In it, our hero finds himself at an underwater film festival where, importantly, he cannot communicate via speech. The entire episode plays out silently, reliant upon the emotional weight and comedy found in non-verbal moments. \"Fish Out of Water\" was a \"must-watch\" per Vulture's own Jesse David Fox, who wrote an essay that encouraged fans and non-fans alike to check it out. \"Structurally, tonally, and thematically, the episode is most reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation ,\" Fox wrote, adding that reading his essay wouldn't spoil the experience of watching because, \"Words cannot spoil an episode that has almost none.\"\nWell today, BoJack creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg revisited the episode on Twitter by posting, in its entirety, the email he sent Netflix execs last year to convince them of the silent episodes's artistic and critical merit. In making his case, Bob-Waksberg evokes praise levied at other silent efforts, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's classic, mostly-silent episode \"Hush\"; Roger Ebert's approval of silent film throwback The Artist ; and — yes — Bob-Wakzberg even evokes BoJack 's \"friends at Vulture\" in our review of the silent stop-motion film Shaun the Sheep . Not only is the email very kind to us (thanks, Raphael!), but it is also a useful primer for anyone looking to convince their bosses that an off-kilter effort can pay off — provided that you do your research, show your work, and are already sitting on top of a great product. The tweet itself, which was posted in response to TIME magazine's assertion that \"Fish Out of Water\" was the best episode of television in 2016, can be seen in full below.\nIn my experience, it is always worth taking the time to convince those people. pic.twitter.com/Iq3j0XKb9a \n— Raphael Bob-Waksberg (@RaphaelBW) December 1, 2016",

      "text": "Finally, Netflix Lets You Watch Movies Offline \nTop clubs like Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, are all using the system, made by Catapult Sports . So if all of these big clubs swear by the technology, it stands to reason that there is something to it — beyond simply tracking fitness . With tech from companies like Garmin and Fitbit , virtually anyone can track their fitness — but the Catapult GPS system is like a fitness tracker on steroids. \n“Most GPS watches only record at one hertz. So one time per second. If you think of what an elite athlete can do in one second, it’s pretty significant,” said Ryan Warkins, Director of Business Operations for Catapult, the company at the helm of this technology. Collecting data one time per second is inaccurate — especially when tracking superstar athletes like Thomas Müller or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Catapult system tracks at 10Hz. “So you’re getting ten data points per second. You’re getting a much more refined system to increase the accuracy.” Catapult also uses both GPS and GLONASS for more accurate tracking. \n“If you think of what an elite athlete can do in one second, it’s pretty significant.” \nHow are clubs using this data? For starters, the training staffs tailor sessions for individual players with specific goals in mind. The Catapult system uses a metric called player load, or overall explosive movement, which is measured by accelerometers. “It measures the volume of work,” Warkins said. “You can then look at your practice and see where your athletes are expending the most energy.” In other words, if it’s the day before a game and you only want your players to train at 50 percent, you can actually see the data and make sure that they adhere to the restriction. \nPlayer load can also be used while rehabilitating an injured player. According to Warkins, the risk of injury goes up drastically once a player runs 12 mph or faster . When a player is just starting to get back into training, “you can look at how often they’re doing that, how often they are exposed to that risk and how often that happens during gameplay,” said Warkins. You can then, in real time, tell the player to slow down or reduce his work rate to mitigate risks of further injury. \nAs for the garment, it’s simply the best and least obtrusive way to attach the device on a soccer player’s body. “The man bra really keeps the device snug to the athlete. Having it that close to the athlete increases the accuracy of the device,” Warkins said. When worn, the device sinks in between the shoulder blades, which helps to keep it out of the way during play. Short of mounting it on the chest, the back and shoulder blades form the best place for the device because placing it there removes superfluous movement. “If you think when you’re running,” Warkins said, “your hips have a lot of left and right movement and a lot of gyration. So the gyroscopes will pick up more data if you sit the device there — less consistent data.” \nWhile the chief benefit is certainly better training, following a rule change by FIFA, GPS trackers are now allowed to be used during games. The potential for strategy changes and substitutions backed by hard data is endless. Much like in the NFL , FIFA events like the World Cup could also broadcast live data on TV — you could see how fast Jamie Vardy just sprinted or how quick Anthony Martial actually accelerated by Arsenal’s frail defense. Stats like these are on the horizon for professional soccer. They won’t just be beneficial to coaches and trainers — they’ll be fascinating to watch from the couch.",

      "text": "best netflix instant tv shows streaming More This list is continually updated to reflect recent Netflix availability as TV shows are frequently added and removed.\nNetflix has a treasure trove of awesome movies that you can stream right now, but if you’re looking for more than just a two-hour commitment, it’s also got a boatload of great TV shows you can delve into to keep yourself occupied for days, or even weeks, on end. If you just finished a good series and you need a new one to fill the void, Netflix is the place to go. Nothing beats a weekend-long marathon with no commercials, so without further ado, we give you our tightly curated list of the best Netflix Instant TV shows.\nRelated: Here’s what’s new on Netflix in December, and what’s going away\nNew for December Gilmore Girls netflix-tv-shows-gilmore-girls-image-1 More This comedic slice of life follows Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), a business-minded single mother, and her academic daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel). Living in the small New England town of Stars Hollow, the two women seek fulfillment and love. Lorelai, having dropped out of school after getting pregnant, wants to get her career on track, while Rory struggles with the pressure to succeed in school, navigating teenage rivalries and young love. The dialogue is frequently snappy, so those who enjoy quips will feel right at home. Lighthearted and episodic, Gilmore Girls is as comforting as a warm cup of coffee with a slice of pie. Longtime fans of the series will also appreciate that Netflix recently released four, 90-minute episodes that pick up the story where the original series left off.\n+ Instant Queue\nLovesick netflix-tv-shows-lovesick-image-2 More Read More After he is diagnosed with chlamydia, hapless romantic Dylan (Johnny Flynn) must contact all his former lovers from recent years and inform them. In the process, he must also reflect on those relationships, and get a sense of what he really wants in life. The show is told largely through flashbacks, with each episode focusing on a specific woman from Dylan’s past, and the story is complex; unlike in classic sitcoms where Dylan’s misadventures would be isolated stories, events from the past inform the present. Lovesick strikes a careful balance between comedy and drama. Hijinks abound, particularly when Dylan’s feckless playboy roommate, Luke (Daniel Ings), is around. Despite the comedy — or perhaps because of it — the somber moments hit hard. This is a show that understands the many facets of relationships, both platonic and sexual.\n+ Instant Queue\nDrama Mad Men Mad Men Photo More Set in New York in the 1960s, Mad Men follows one of the city’s most prestigious ad agencies on Madison Avenue. The agency is doing well, but as the industry grows, the competition begins to stiffen. The agency tries to survive in a time when everything, including the ad industry, is undergoing a radical shake-up. The two protagonists are the enigmatic Don Draper (Jon Hamm), a self-made executive whose childhood seems to always get in the way of his happiness, and ultra-terse Peggy Olson (Elizabeth Moss), a former secretary who works her way up the corporate ladder.\n+ Instant Queue\nBreaking Bad Breaking Bad Photo More Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. To secure his family’s finances before he dies, White uses his chemistry background to cook and deal premium blue meth. His partner is former student and burnout named Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). It’s teeming with moral consequences and family issues, and fittingly, it’s as addicting as the crystal meth Walt produces in his beat-up van in the desert.\n+ Instant Queue\nBetter Call Saul\nBetterCallSaul1 More Starring Bob Odenkirk, Better Call Saul takes fans of Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad back to the New Mexico desert for a look at Saul Goodman’s origin story. Before Goodman became the quirky, crooked lawyer Walter White played like a fiddle, he was Jimmy McGill, an aspiring lawyer who just couldn’t seem to keep his hands clean. The show is set six years prior to the events of Breaking Bad , and throws out the convention that a spinoff must pale in comparison to its source material. It also proves Gilligan and company remain at the top of their game.\n+ Instant Queue\nNurse Jackie\nNurseJackie1 More The Sopranos actress Edie Fnull",

      "title": "My Life with Rory Gilmore",
      "text": "The “Gilmore Girls” reboot on Netflix portrays a frustratingly frustrated Rory Gilmore. Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY SAEED ADYANI / NETFLIX I grew up in Stars Hollow. By which I mean, I was raised in a village—the “village” designation was always very important to my home town—where an overabundance of troubadours was dealt with in a town meeting, and where I was a dancer at, no kidding, a studio called Miss Patti’s. I was in sixth grade when “Gilmore Girls” premièred, a show in which those quirks were part of the atmosphere. One night after ballet, my mom and I watched. In the first scene I caught of the first episode, I saw a dazzling woman with a strange name looking for a missing bird—her daughter Rory’s science project—and shouting, “Stellaaaa!” My mom laughed. I didn’t know why, but I wanted to. Soon enough, I did. In this way, I also learned about Russian novels and Patti Smith and “Grey Gardens” and Dorothy Parker. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), a stylish innkeeper with an enviable music collection, and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), a sweet teen-ager aspiring to be Christiane Amanpour, were characters I sought to emulate, and dreamed of hanging out with.\nI was four years behind Rory in school, at just the right distance to follow. We Bush II-era teens escaped to Gilmoreland to watch democracy delightfully rendered as Town Selectman gags. We wanted a mom as fun as Lorelai and a boyfriend as cool as Jess. (He’s from New York.) When “Gilmore Girls” ended, in 2007, and the charmed enclosure of Stars Hollow—its seasonal festivals, its Edgar Allan Poe Society controversies, its coffee addiction—entered cryogenic freeze, I still clung to my parallels. And, even after my life moved beyond Rory’s time line, Stars Hollow remained a retreat (first on DVD, then on Netflix). Yet I can’t be the only one for whom, as the years passed, watching the young Rory brought some of the uncanny dread of a home movie.\nTen years later, she seems never to have graduated to adulthood. In the revival for Netflix, “A Year in the Life,” our girls, now both women—Rory is thirty-two, the age that Lorelai was when the original series began—reunite after what “feels like years,” they say, with a hug. In the first episode, “Winter,” we learn that Rory is returning home to Stars Hollow after an extended reporting trip; she is now—the parallels continue—a writer for The New Yorker and The Atlantic . Perfectly coiffed and mascaraed, she and Lorelai banter fast and walk slow around the gazebo in the central square, where everything looks exactly as it did before. (And there’s Miss Patti teaching a dance class: hi, fictional Miss Patti!) Back at the house, Lorelai warns of “Proud Luke”—Luke Danes, the change-averse town-diner owner, who has remained her partner for nine years. When we see him again, he congratulates Rory on a recent piece for this magazine’s Talk of the Town section, and says that he’s now a New Yorker subscriber. But Rory slips from proud to perturbed to past hope. She regresses with an old boyfriend, forgetting her current one exists. Her latest story for The Atlantic is killed. In her early thirties, she is hitting a wall. Is journalism really a viable profession? What is she trying to discover with her writing? How could she fall asleep mid-interview and then have a one-night stand with a source dressed as a Wookiee? By “Summer,” Rory is swallowed by her past life, bumming around her childhood haunts.\n“Wow, like a time machine,” April, Luke’s daughter (an unfortunate character from the weaker, later years of the original series, who is, nevertheless, very perceptive), says, as she walks into Rory’s bedroom. April, a senior in college, tells Rory that she’s “still kind of searching.” Rory doesn’t seem to relate. “I think I’m having an anxiety attack,” April goes on, over Rory’s thin attempts to console her. “It’s just very weird here, seeing you back in your childhood room. It’s like a postcard from the real world.” Rory tries to squirm away, but we’ve got her now. Journalism is supposed to involve some discomfort; Amanpour’s eminence was built on years of dogged war reporting; and how could Richard Gilmore have been so mellow about his granddaughter pursuing a career that doesn’t necessarily promise insurance? The girl who had for so long been unencumbered by reality is, at last, facing genuine challenges, and her own shortcomings. Just like the rest of us Rorys must.\nThroughout “A Year in the Life,” it’s exasperating to watch Rory foundering in uncertainty, but she has atoned and reset before. Much more frustrating, to me, was seeing Lorelai stuck—in the office of a vacuous therapist in “Spring”; in a miserably overlong musical rehearsal in “Summer”; outside the Pacific Crest Trail (a tribute to “Wild”) in “Fall”; and, throughout, in murky relationship trouble with Luke. Happiness eludes her. Her father’s death fills her with a foggy kind of despair. (Rory somehow recovers quickly.) Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop), the grandmother and Wasp queen, gets the lone satisfying arc, delivering herself from profound grief after taking one last D.A.R. cookie.\nBut plot was never the point of “Gilmore Girls.” The new series, like the old, is all about the hang: “Talk. Don’t talk. Whatever,” as it was defined in the show’s early days. The pleasure of watching doesn’t come as much from what the Gilmores do as what they say (and how fast they say it). And so what is said, in the standout scene of the “Year,” stings. In “Summer,” Emily brings Lorelai and Rory to check on the fifth try at a headstone for Richard. The punctuation’s amiss. While Emily is off lambasting whoever’s responsible, Rory, having turned her framed David Carr headshot to the wall sometime before, tells her mother about her intention to write a memoir of their lives. “No,” Lorelai replies. “I don’t want you to write that.” Rory, like so many millennial writer types before her, has decided that she is her own best subject, but telling that story violates the fabulous vortex of Stars Hollow—of innocence itself. To dwell there is a privilege, and Rory has come to feel entitled to much too much, exposing the roots her mother had so arduously planted, simply to sell a book proposal. Her favorite works of art—journalistic, novelistic, whatever—overlap with life, but she ought to be well read enough to know that telling stories can upend the realities of living. Rory and Lorelai have always talked in circles, never moving, but, at the end of the “Year,” Rory has returned to where Lorelai began. Perhaps, since it’s revealed in the last four words that Rory is pregnant, it will be motherhood, again, that forces a girl to grow up.",

      "text": "By Dana Getz 8 hours ago \nBy the time Netflix unveiled the much-hyped Gilmore Girls revival on Nov. 25, its famous last four words were near mythologized. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had exited the original series just ahead of its final season, ostensibly squashing any hope of seeing that final mother-daughter exchange play out on screen. But, a decade later, when those four little words finally made their way to air, it wasn’t what fans were expecting. In fact, many viewers were flat out fuming. But, with an assist from another beloved classic, Sherman-Palladino’s explanation of the Gilmore Girls final four words might help soothe some open wounds. \nFirst things first, if you’ve yet to make your way through A Year In The Life , turn back now. Here there be spoilers , and big ones. Exactly a week after the revival’s debut, Sherman-Palladino emerged with a batch of interviews defending that now-legendary ending. You know, the one where Rory tells Lorelai she’s pregnant, the credits roll, and we’re all left screaming franticly into a dark, black abyss. Much of the backlash has been tied to the lack of a concrete answer about who the father is , but Sherman-Palladino has news for you: it’s not about the boy, and it was never about the boy, so can we all just stop talking about the boys? It’s called Gilmore Girls for a reason. [Embed] \nDuring an interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Sherman-Palladino said she was frustrated with the obsessive debate surrounding Rory’s love life. Rory was so much more than her boyfriends, and Gilmore Girls reflected that. As she told THR , It really wasn't about the father; it was about the event. People can make their own conclusions about who the father is, there's not a thousand choices out there, but it really wasn't about the boy because, quite frankly, one of the things that's always been a little weird is how obsessed with Rory's love life everybody got when the point of the show was never about their love lives. Their love lives were a part of their lives, but these were women really grappling with who they were as people… it felt like the moment was on Rory and her future and not on, 'Gee, which boy is this?' That's always taken a backseat when we've broken stories on Gilmore. \nBut, beyond solidifying Rory as her own woman, the final page in the GG book signaled something much larger. Gilmore was always about mothers and daughters, and Rory getting pregnant when she’s still lost and largely alone was a very deliberate callback to Lorelai’s own pregnancy 32 years ago. Sherman-Palladino likened it to The Lion King ’s circle of life. Like Mufasa passing Simba the crown as King of the Jungle, Lorelai too passed on a torch of her own: the chance to become a strong, fearless, and totally independent mother. \nEven though Sherman-Palladino initially intended for Rory to get pregnant around 22, she said the revival’s timing fit flawlessly. As she explained to THR: These two women are very tied. They're very tied and to me, that history repeating itself and daughter following in mother's footsteps, where you lead, I will follow – we took the [theme] song very seriously. When we picked those words and we went down that path, it just felt right then and it actually feels even more right now especially because Rory is older. She's the same age Lorelai was when the show started. It really does feel a little Lion King -y, the whole circle of life. \nThat may all sound a little too perfect, but the plot itself was left intentionally messy. Gilmore has a proven knack for portraying tangible, real, and human characters. Closing things out on a happy, perfect note just wouldn’t have been true to the show. As Sherman-Palladino told TVLine , The thing about these women is their lives keep going. And keep changing. I like that we end with Emily being calm and settled. Lorelai, for the moment, is calm and settled. And Rory is, “Holy sh*t. What the f*ck?” That’s more real than if all three of them had lovely endings and we tied it up with a bow and everyone went home with a unicorn. \nSo there you have it, Gilmore Girls fans. The final four words may not have been what we wanted, but they were wholly and irrevocably Gilmore . That’s really all we can ask for, isn’t it? \nImages: Saeed Adyani/Netflix; Giphy ",

      "title": "Now, Netflix Users Can Watch Movies Offline on Their Mobile Devices",
      "text": " count=\"241\" data-total-count=\"241\"> Netflix announced on Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when internet signals are spotty or unavailable. Users boarding an airplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favorite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out.\nNetflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programs would become available for download later, saying only that there would be “more on the way.”\nEven in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content offline would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously.\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Customers who watch only a limited amount of video before incurring overage fees with their cellular carriers are more likely to stop watching videos — an unpalatable option for media companies like Netflix that want to keep eyes glued to their products.\nAT&T also appears to have come to a similar conclusion. In announcing DirecTV Now , a television service that can be streamed on mobile devices, the company said on Monday that its cellular customers would be able to watch shows without that usage counting toward their monthly data limits.\nAdvertisement\n “The last thing you want to do when you’re binging or enjoying entertainment is trying to calculate how many gigs I’m using or where I am in my data plan,” Brad Bentley, AT&T’s chief marketing officer, said on Monday, referring to gigabytes of data.\nNetflix is not the first video streaming company to introduce the offline option. Amazon Video, one of Netflix’s biggest competitors, has made some videos available offline since September 2015 .\nHulu does not offer offline viewing, but Ben Smith, Hulu’s head of experience and a senior vice president, said on Tuesday that the company was working on it, according to CIO , an industry publication.\n“We’ll get there, for sure, in our industry,” he said.",

      "text": "Email \nIt just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.” Related stories ",

      "text": "View photos\nMiramax Films\nAs we shared yesterday , Netflix has finally fulfilled our dreams and added the ability to download your favorite movies and shows to watch whenever you want. No longer will you be tethered to your wifi or forced to eat up all your data when you’re watching every episode of Breaking Bad . We’ve already covered the 21 best TV series you can start pulling now , but maybe you’re in the mood for some film binging on your next subway ride.

      "text": "Comments While she ended the Netflix revival 'in a Life Repeats Itself kind of way,' Amy Sherman-Palladino says Rory doesn't necessarily follow the footsteps of Lorelai as a single mom. \nAmy Sherman-Palladino brought \"Gilmore Girls\" full circle at the end of \" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \" with the last four words. [SPOILER ALERT!] \"Mom?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm pregnant,\" was Lorelai and Rory's last conversation in the fourth part of the Netflix revival and it left viewers with a lot of questions. Speaking about the big cliffhanger, Sherman-Palladino tells TVLine, \"I always wanted [the story] to end in a Life Repeats Itself kind of way. The daughter following in the mother's footsteps.\" She, however, notes that it doesn't necessarily mean that Rory will follow in the footsteps of Lorelai as a single mother. \"By the way, Rory doesn't have to keep the baby. There are choices here that she can make. It's just the left turn. It's that curveball that life throws you,\" she adds. Weighing in on the ending, co-creator Daniel Palladino tells EW that \"it was an open ending and there's a lot of unanswered questions about what her next move would be.\" Thus, when asked what the sex of Rory's baby will be, Sherman-Palladino won't say anything. \"I don't know, she hasn't had the baby yet. We have to wait until it comes out,\" she coyly answers. Sherman-Palladino explains why she ended the show with the cliffhanger. \"It wasn't open-ended for any nefarious reasons. It's open-ended because life is open-ended,\" she claims. \"One of the things that I always liked that we did on 'Gilmore' is we never ended things with a hug, we never concluded things, we never had the moment where it's like, 'Everything is going to be okay.' I think that that was the element here - it seems like Lorelai's settled, it seems like Emily's settled, but you know what? Life continues and life never is settled until you're dead and somebody throws you in a box.\" With that put into consideration, the series creators never planned a happy ending for the show. \"No, we weren't going for a happy ending,\" Sherman-Palladino says. Palladino adds, \"But we don't see it as a tragic ending.\" Since Sherman-Palladino said she had known the final four words years ago, she confirms that Rory was going to be younger when she got pregnant. \"Originally it was going to be that she was 22, just getting out of college and heading off to get a master's somewhere,\" she reveals. There's also a question about the father of the baby. To this question, Sherman-Palladino responds, \"It really wasn't about the father; it was about the event,\" stressing that it's not who the father is which is important. While the baby's father isn't confirmed yet, Matt Czuchry whose character Logan is the best candidate as the baby daddy has some advice for Logan. \"Don't marry Odette,\" he said during a Facebook Live chat on Thursday, December 1. Odette is Logan's fiancee. \"Chase down Rory. Make that work. She is the love of your life,\" he went on urging. \"Odette, I always kind of looked at as part of his family obligations, so I would say, if I could give Logan one piece of advice, it would be to chase down Rory. Follow his heart.\" So, will there be more episodes of \"Gilmore Girls\"? Sherman-Palladino says, \"No one is talking about that right now. We're all very tired. I have to finish this Amazon pilot ['The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel'].\" She, however, doesn't rule out the possibility According to streaming tracking company Symphony, the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival has delivered big ratings for Netflix. The show attracted 5 million adults 18-49 viewers for its four episodes during the program's first three days online, which is around 3.5 demo rating if it were on a broadcast network. The show is one of the biggest hits for Netflix, just behind \" Fuller House \" (7.3 million) and \" Orange Is the New Black \" (5.8 million). Unlike \"Fuller House\" which lost most of its viewers after the first episode, most fans who watched the first episode of \"A Year in the Life\" also watched the rest. \n© AceShowbiz.com",

      "text": "(The following is a story about Netflix \"ratings,\" so find a grain or two of salt before reading any further.)\nNetflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, it appears, is a big hit for the streaming service. Leading Netflix projection house Symphony Advanced Media, which has been leaking numbers on the streamer for more than a year, said in a Thursday release that nearly 5 million viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 have watched all four episodes of the revival.\nBy regular broadcast standards, that amounts to a 3.6 rating among adults 18-49. It should be emphasized that group, the key advertising demo for conventional series, is irrelevant to the ad-free Netflix, but it represents a large and appealing portion of the TV audience. Compared with other 2016 Netflix efforts, Gilmore Girls' binge audience in the first three-day window is only outmeasured by Orange Is the New Black's fourth season (5.8 million) and the first run of Fuller House (7.3 million).\nA vast majority of those who watched the first episode also tuned in for the entire run. Just shy of 6 million adults 18-49 watched the premiere in the live-plus-three-day window, and 83 percent of those viewers went on to watch the whole thing.\nAs sampling goes, Gilmore Girls did rank lower - outperformed by both Fuller House and Orange Is the New Black, as well as Marvel efforts Luke Cage and Daredevil. But it appears to be a hit.\nSymphony's numbers, which even the group calls out as preliminary, are not recognized by Netflix. The streamer is famously secretive about the number of subscribers who watch its individual original series. Symphony extrapolates its ratings based off a group who use their phones to monitor their TV viewing habits. Its panel size, according to the company website, presently consists of 15,000 individuals.\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' Bosses Discuss Final Four Words, Rory Criticism and Possible Future Installments",

      "text": "TAGS: Gilmore Girls Netflix \nNetflix has discussed the possibility of a second season from its recent Gilmore Girls revival series. \nGilmore Girls: A Year In The Life debuted on the streaming service last Friday (November 25). It picks up eight years on from the original series and opens with Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) dealing with the death of Richard Gilmore, Lorelai’s father. Edward Herrmann, who played the role of Richard, died in 2014. \nThe revival has been met with mixed reactions, with some viewers taking to social media to claim that Rory (Alexis Bledel) and other characters were “kind of awful sometimes”. \nRead more: Five ways the new Netflix episodes crushed the hopes of ‘Gilmore Girls’ fans . \nAfter the finale ended with a cliffhanger, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos has said that he is “open” to the possibility of a follow-up, but that it would depend on the desire of creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. \n“We’re definitely open to it if Amy is,” Sarandos told Pedestrian.tv . “It’s a surprisingly international show and we’re thrilled with how people have enjoyed the new show and introducing the old show to an entire new generation of viewers.” Netflix",

      "text": "Warning: Spoiler alert! The story below contains spoilers from all four episodes of Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\nGilmore Girls fans, your burning questions are about to be answered.\nNetflix's four-part revival series, A Year in the Life , ended in an unexpected, circle-of-life kind of way when a 32-year-old Rory ( Alexis Blede l) revealed to her newly-wed mother, Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ), that she was pregnant. Following Rory's life-changing revelation, questions abounded: Who is the father of her unborn child? Is it Logan ( Matt Czuchry )? Is it Paul ( Jack Carpenter ), Rory's underwhelming boyfriend?\nGilmore Girls executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino answered the revival's biggest questions -- including the possibility of new episodes.\nRELATED: 36 Unanswered Questions We Still Have After 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'\n1. Rory Was Supposed to Get Pregnant After College\n\"Mom. \"Yeah?\" \"I'm pregnant.\" Those last four words may have been a shock to the system to loyal Gilmore Girls viewers, but Amy Sherman-Palladino revealed that that was always the ending she had planned all along. In fact, Rory was supposed to be with child a decade earlier -- \"at 22 years old,\" she told TVLine . \"I always wanted [the story] to end in a Life Repeats Itself kind of way. The daughter following in the mother's footsteps.\"\n\"Younger people are a little younger longer these days, so we know a lot of 32-year-olds who are still quite young, haven't quite gotten their life paths completely decided yet,\" Dan Palladino told The Hollywood Reporter . \"And that felt like it felt right for Rory still and it felt right that those last four [words] and that specific ending could still work for these women.\"\nRELATED: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life': Those Last 4 Words Finally Revealed!\nNetflix\n2. Rory May Not Keep the Baby\nWhile Rory's pregnancy curveball likely forces her to take stock of her life and (lack of a) career, Sherman-Palladino insinuated that the open-endedness of the ending leaves her with big decisions to make -- one of which includes the possibility of an abortion. \"Rory doesn't have to keep the baby,\" she told TVLine. \"There are choices here that she can make. It's just the left turn. It's that curveball that life throws you. I will say, weirdly, that I like it much more now.\"\n\"But there's something about Rory being the same age as Lorelai was when we first met Lorelai [in the pilot] that has a lot more symmetry and means a lot more,\" Sherman-Palladino continued, adding, \"It's also the time to be thinking about having a baby if you're going to be thinking about it.\"\nRELATED: Alexis Bledel Reacts to Shocking Rory Pregnancy Twist\n3. The Father of Rory's Baby Is a Mystery (But the Clues Are There)\nWe won't find out definitively who the father of Rory's baby is, but \"a lot of clues are out there,\" Palladino told E! Online . \"People can make their own conclusions about who the father is; there's not a thousand choices out there,\" Sherman-Palladino told THR . It makes the most sense for the father to be Logan, whose unique relationship with Rory in the revival intentionally mirrored that of Christopher ( David Sutcliffe ) and Lorelai's. \"Yes,\" she confirmed to TVLine , when asked about the parallels between the two romances.\nRead More Matt Czuchry also commented on the \"open\" ending, telling THR it was the producers' intentions to \"put that out in the universe for fans to talk about and debate.\"\nFor the producers, it wasn't so much about who the father was, but how the life-changing event shapes Rory. \"I always feel a lot of people overlook a lot more of Rory because the focus was so much on the romance. And I didn't want this moment to be about a boy,\" Sherman-Palladino told TVLine. \"The moment was about, 'Here's what I'm going through in my life now!' It's an 'Oh, s—t' moment about Rory. Her discussion with Lorelai is going to be about, 'What do I do? Where do I go from here?' It's not going to be about, 'I can't believe it's this boy that wound up….'\"\nRELATED: Alexis Bledel and Matt Czuchry Defend Rory and Logan's 'Surprising' Relationship Choices\nNetflix\n4. Luke and Lorelai's Pre-Election Wedding Date Is Significant\nLuke ( Scott Patterson ) and Lorelai's wedding date, Thursday, Nov. 5, happened to fall just before the presidential election -- a decision that Sherman-Palladino said was intentional. \"To be totally honest with you, we did put it before the election, but [beyond that] there's not a lot of significance there,\" she told TVLine.\n\"These movies were written way in advance [of the election],\" Sherman-Palladino further explained. \"So it was weird for us to predict where we would be in November. Because if we [get it wrong] then [ A Year in the Life ] will feel dated by a political moment in time. I wanted it to stand on its own.\"\nRELATED: 'Gilmore Girls' Revival Replaced Chad Michael Murray With Another Actor\n5. Rory's Book Is a Potential Career Breakthrough\nIt seemed appropriate that Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ) was the one to ultimately push Rory into taking the leap and write a book, titled Gilmore Girls , about her and her mom. \"It just felt right that somebody important in her life, who Jess is, helped guide her towards… By the way, we don't even really know how successful it's going to be,\" Sherman-Palladino told THR . \"We just know that she was happy to write it and it seemed like it is pointing towards a sort of career breakthrough for her.\"\nAs for what the first three chapters contain, Sherman-Palladino admitted she hadn't thought that far ahead. \"People have asked me, 'What is Rory writing in the book?' And I'm like, 'I don't know what the hell she writes in the book,'\" she revealed to TVLine.\nRELATED: 'Gilmore Girls' Star Scott Patterson on What's Next for Luke and Lorelai\nNetflix\n6. There Are No Plans for More Gilmore Girls (for Now)\nThough Lorelai and Emily's stories ended on a happy note, Rory's final moment left the door open for the possibility of more Gilmore Girl s in the future. It just won't come any time soon. \"The old adage is you always want to leave them wanting more,\" Sherman-Palladino, who is working on Amazon pilot The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , told TVLine. \"You don't really want someone to walk away from something you worked so hard on going, 'Alright. I can move on.\"\n\"We pitched this as close-ended,\" she told THR. \"Netflix and Warner Bros., we all went into this sort of saying that this was it. So there really haven't been any more discussions about: Is there going to be anything else? I don't know.\"\nRELATED: Rachael Ray Dishes on Her Surprise 'Gilmore Girls' Role\n7. Emily Gilmore: The Spinoff ?\nMuch of the revival had Emily ( Kelly Bishop ) grieving -- in her own Emily Gilmore way -- over the death of Richard, but by the end of it, she seemed at peace in Nantucket and enjoying a stress-free life. Sherman-Palladino addressed fans' desires for a possible spinoff. \"Emily in Nantucket?\" she admitted to E! Online. \"I don't know, I haven't thought of it.\"\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming on Netflix.\nRelated Articles\nVictoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016: Must-See Moments Elizabeth Hurley Flaunts Killer Abs at Age 51 Ciara Shows Off Baby Bump on Red Carpet",

      "text": "Home » News » World News » Technology used in Netflix, Google can help planetary research Technology used in Netflix, Google can help planetary research 1 hour ago | 02-12-2016 | IANS Toronto, Dec 2 : Machine learning -- a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from fraud detection and sorting spam in Google, to making movie recommendations on Netflix -- can help scientists determine whether planetary systems are stable or not, a study says. [NK World] \"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" said study lead author Dan Tamayo from the University of Toronto Scarborough in Canada. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient. The researchers found that the same class of algorithms used by Google and Netflix can also tell us if distant planetary systems are stable or not. The method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. \"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" Tamayo said. It's important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed. It can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation. There are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, Tamayo noted. The method developed by Tamayo and his team was published online in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he added. It may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year. The two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system. \"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" Tamayo said. gb/vt",

      "text": "November 30, 2016 Updated: November 30, 2016 at 5:26 pm 0 \nNetflix recently announced that comedian Dave Chappelle will be bringing three new stand-up specials to the streaming network. One of the specials will be an original strand-up comedy set, the other two are never before seen performances filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium. All three specials are set to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy - searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, VP of Original Documentary and Comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nChappelle is best known for his Comedy Central sketch comedy series “The Chappelle Show,” which ended its run in 2006 after he left the series. A prolific road performer, Chappelle has kept himself busy. He’s performed in over 500 concerts in the last three years and recently had a successful stint hosting “Saturday Night Live.” \nGazette media columnist Terry Terrones is a member of the Television Critics Association.

      "text": "0 0 \nThese days, cable TV is all but obsolete as newer generations prefer to enjoy their entertainment online. If they have an internet connection and a computer or a mobile device, you can enjoy every type of content imaginable — and most of the time for free. Not everything is available to watch for free, however: The true bane of cable TV are online video streaming services lik Netflix . The service is pretty much dominating the market with its vast library of movies and TV shows which users can access for a monthly subscription. Offline access \nUntil recently, users were required to connect to the internet in order for Netflix to provide content. Now, that is no longer the case as Netflix has announced the implementation of a new offline feature. The new feature is pretty straightforward and users can use it instantly. When you access the Details page for a particular show or movie, you will see a Download button. This button will download the selected content on your local hard drive, making it available to you for viewing when there is no internet connection but still want to enjoy your favorite series. The limited library is growing \nThe feature has been made available for a large number of shows and users can hop on to the Netflix platform and download their favorite series. There is still content that isn’t available for download, though, meaning that you will still need connectivity if you want to watch one of the shows which not on the download list. The list of shows that can be downloaded online will continue to grow over time. Multi-platform \nThe feature is available for all Netflix supported platforms, meaning that users on both Android and iOS will be able to use the new Download option and take their favorite content on the go.

      "text": "So you’ve already watched all six hours of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival, and you’re starting to experience symptoms of withdrawal — like you haven’t had your usual six cups of coffee yet. (Don’t worry: We’re right there with you.)\nLuckily, the stars of A Year in the Life — Lauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Kelly Bishop (Emily) and Scott Patterson (Luke) — sat down with Vulture’s Gazelle Emami in New York on Tuesday night to ease our withdrawals and look back on the experience of returning to Stars Hollow nearly a decade after the original series ended.\nPHOTOS Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life : Michael Ausiello’s 10 Favorite Moments Ranked\nNow since some audience members hadn’t seen all four episodes yet — what’s wrong with these people? — the cast didn’t get into any spoilers, so your burning questions about those last four words will have to wait. But the actors did discuss the experience of slipping back into their old roles, the most emotional scenes to shoot, and the fan backlash to Rory’s treatment of poor Paul. (Who?)\nHere, the highlights of Tuesday’s Gilmore Girls panel:\nGilmore Girls A Year in the Life Netflix More * Graham said she was filled with conflicting emotions as she prepared to play Lorelai Gilmore again: “It was the same, but totally different. Everywhere we went, people were excited… which put a different pressure on it, too.” But the overriding emotion, she said, was gratitude: “Mostly, it felt like an opportunity to go back to something and just appreciate it.”\n* Bledel was frankly taken aback when she saw how messy Rory’s life was as the new episodes picked up: “I really wanted her to have had some great rewards, or to have enjoyed quite an interesting life… I wanted her to be on top of the world, so to learn that we pick up with her scrambling… I just had to imagine that for her.” She later added that creator Amy Sherman-Palladino probably wanted to inject some conflict into Rory’s existence: “I think Amy just didn’t want her life to be wrapped up in a bow.”\nRELATED Gilmore Girls : Who Played Emily’s Maid Berta? (Hint: It’s Someone You Know)\n* So why were Lorelai and Rory so mean to Rory’s forgettable boyfriend Paul? Graham brushed off any talk of online backlash: “We don’t pay attention to anything. None of us are on the Internet.” She defended the running joke at Paul’s expense: “The whole show has a heightened, theatrical quality. Just like Donald Trump, don’t take it literally. Does it go ten steps too far? I don’t know.” Patterson chimed in to add: “Paul was the sacrificial lamb, and he knew it.”\n* Bishop (who, it should be noted, got a rousing round of applause from the crowd) seemed confused by the audience’s affection for Emily Gilmore: “I’ve always been baffled by that. I’ve always enjoyed playing what I call the nasty, rich women. Because I can’t stand them. So I try to make them as awful as possible.” She did find something nice to say about Emily, though: “She is funny… if you don’t have to live with her.”\n* When asked about the most emotional scenes to shoot in the revival, Patterson picked the scene in “Fall” when Lorelai returns to Luke after her Wild excursion. “It was so fraught with tension,” he remembered, “and I just started to bawl my eyes out. That was the most impactful scene that Luke’s ever been involved in. It might be the most impactful scene I’ve ever done.” But the waterworks didn’t really work for Sherman-Palladino, who directed the episode. As Patterson remembers, “Amy says, ‘Cut. Scott, that’s really not what we want to do…'”\n* The loss of co-star Edward Herrmann (Richard) was deeply felt on the set of A Year in the Life , and Bledel recalled how great he was to work with: “We’d have those long Friday night dinner scenes, and he would share so much. He was such a generous actor.” Bishop added that she believes Herrmann really would’ve enjoyed being a part of this revival: “I thought, ‘He would’ve loved to have done this. He would’ve relished this.'”\nLaunch Gallery: 'Gilmore Girls' Revival: The Best Quote: s\nRelated stories\nLauren Graham Talks Return to Gilmore and Her 'Fall' Monologue -- Plus: Is a Parenthood Revival In the Cards?\nGilmore Girls' Amy Sherman-Palladino: The Revival Post Mortem Interview You've Been Waiting For\nGilmore Girls: The Scoop Behind That 'Elaborate' Life and Death Sequence\nGet more from TVLine : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThis list is continually updated to reflect recent Netflix availability as TV shows are frequently added and removed. \nNetflix has a treasure trove of awesome movies that you can stream right now, but if you’re looking for more than just a two-hour commitment, it’s also got a boatload of great TV shows you can delve into to keep yourself occupied for days, or even weeks, on end. If you just finished a good series and you need a new one to fill the void, Netflix is the place to go. Nothing beats a weekend-long marathon with no commercials, so without further ado, we give you our tightly curated list of the best Netflix Instant TV shows. New for December Gilmore Girls \nThis comedic slice of life follows Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), a business-minded single mother, and her academic daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel). Living in the small New England town of Stars Hollow, the two women seek fulfillment and love. Lorelai, having dropped out of school after getting pregnant, wants to get her career on track, while Rory struggles with the pressure to succeed in school, navigating teenage rivalries and young love. The dialogue is frequently snappy, so those who enjoy quips will feel right at home. Lighthearted and episodic, Gilmore Girls is as comforting as a warm cup of coffee with a slice of pie. Longtime fans of the series will also appreciate that Netflix recently released four, 90-minute episodes that pick up the story where the original series left off. + Instant Queue Lovesick \nAfter he is diagnosed with chlamydia, hapless romantic Dylan (Johnny Flynn) must contact all his former lovers from recent years and inform them. In the process, he must also reflect on those relationships, and get a sense of what he really wants in life. The show is told largely through flashbacks, with each episode focusing on a specific woman from Dylan’s past, and the story is complex; unlike in classic sitcoms where Dylan’s misadventures would be isolated stories, events from the past inform the present. Lovesick strikes a careful balance between comedy and drama. Hijinks abound, particularly when Dylan’s feckless playboy roommate, Luke (Daniel Ings), is around. Despite the comedy — or perhaps because of it — the somber moments hit hard. This is a show that understands the many facets of relationships, both platonic and sexual.",

      "text": "3 Surprising Reasons Netflix, Amazon and Broadcast Execs Will Skip January TCA More TV executives have a message for the winter TCA: No thanks.\nTop programmers from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox won’t come to Pasadena, California, in January to answer reporters’ questions at the Television Critics Association Winter press tour, the association revealed Tuesday. That marks the first time in at least 20 years the brass will skip the event (except for 2008, when the entire January tour was sacked due to the writers’ strike).\nThe broadcasters will still offer panels to promote individual shows, but reporters will have to chase the executives through the swanky corridors of the Langham Huntington Hotel if they want an interview. That’s still more access than Amazon is providing, though — TCA also announced that the streaming provider, home to the acclaimed “Transparent” and other fare, is bailing on the event entirely. Netflix, home of “House of Cards” and other critical favorites, previously revealed it’s not planning to attend, either.\nAlso Read: Amazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives\nWhat gives? Why, during this supposed Golden Age of TV, are the biggest purveyors of original programming squelching an opportunity to get in front of the media?\nChalk it up to the immense changes seizing the worlds of entertainment and journalism, shifts that are making many industry veterans question the utility of the TCA events themselves.\nThe old media world is dying\nWhen newspapers were the main news providers, network executives saw the TCAs as the most cost-effective way of getting the word out about new shows. Critics from around the country would pile into ballrooms in Beverly Hills or Pasadena, pepper stars and execs with questions and then save up stories that they would publish back home as the new shows premiered.\nAlso Read: 11 TCA Takeaways: Diversity Still Not Diverse Enough, Rape Repulses, Nerds Rule TV\nNow, newspapers have been decimated by online competitors and plummeting ad sales. The press tour is now filled with far fewer critics from hometown papers and many more bloggers and “genre press” from sites that only fanboys and fangirls have heard of. There are multiple representatives of Hollywood trades such as, yes, TheWrap. These outlets cover the networks and their shows like a blanket all year long. Why do the networks need to spend six-figure sums to reach them? What’s the point of putting executives in front of reporters?\nIt’s about the shows\nTCA is the source of a disconnect for journalists and TV executives. Reporters see it as opportunity to probe, ask questions, hold executives’ feet to the fire. But for networks, it’s a marketing and PR opportunity, pure and simple. From the executives’ perspective, it makes far more sense to spend their limited time at TCA promoting an actual show that may benefit from some media exposure, rather than taking a bunch of questions about the inside baseball of scheduling or ratings for on-demand viewing. The decision comes down to dollars and cents: One broadcast exec told TheWrap that each day of TCA can cost a network up to $1 million for hotel fees, flights for incoming cast members, food for critics and more.\n“We want TCA to be more about the shows,” one network exec told TheWrap (like everyone else interviewed for this story, the source spoke on condition of anonymity). “There’s more midseason shows now and not more time to present them.”\nTired of the grilling\nIt’s no secret that many executives hate TCA — or at least, hate their sessions in front of reporters. “How lovely to see you all again,” former UPN boss Dean Valentine (a former journalist himself) would purr sarcastically as his exec session began at every TCA back in the day.\nAlso Read: 13 New Fall TV Shows, Ranked From Best to Worst by Critics (Photos)\nRelations haven’t gotten any warmer lately. Glenn Geller of CBS last summer was raked by harsh questions about the diversity of programming on his network. HBO’s Casey Bloys caught flak over the sex and violence in the premium cable network’s shows. These types of exchanges may provide great copy for journalists.\n“But what,” one network executive asked, “am I getting out of it?”\nFor now, networks insist that they aren’t ready to bag their TCA involvement entirely. But the future is uncertain.\nRead More “In age when you can Facebook Live, and I can stream the talent to you, and you can sit in bed and watch … Is this the most logical way to do this?,” one executive said of the press tour.\nFor now, the networks are taking a wait-and-see attitude. But if the lack of executive sessions translates into empty ballrooms for the show panels come January, one executive has a stark warning:\n“We will just not do press tour anymore,” this person said.\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\nAmazon Bows Out of TCA Winter Press Tour Along With Broadcast Executives\n11 TCA Takeaways: Diversity Still Not Diverse Enough, Rape Repulses, Nerds Rule TV\n'Star Trek: Discovery' – Everything We Learned From Bryan Fuller's TCA Panel",

      "text": "It's been on the wish lists of subscribers for a very long time, and this week Netflix finally announced users will be able to download programs for off-line viewing. So to all the straphangers, frequent flyers and sufferers of wandering Wi-Fi, here's everything you need to know to get started.\nCan I Download Anything For Future Viewing?\nWe're afraid not. At least for now, only Netflix-owned shows like Making A Murderer, The Crown and The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt can be saved for off-line viewing. It's a good bet that copyright lawyers were involved in this decision.\nWell That's A Bit Of A Drag, But I Get It. What Devices Can I Download To?\nIf you want to take your Netlix shows on the go, you're going to need the iOS or Android app. Then again, if you want to take your Netflix shows on the go, you probably already have it. Either way, your device will need to be running at least iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 to be compatible with the app.\nI Notice \"Laptop\" Missing From That Answer\nCorrect! Only the mobile app can download programs for future viewing. You also won't be able to move downloaded files over to your computer.\nHow Much Data Does Downloading Guzzle?\nDownloading a program requires the same data needed for streaming it, so it's best to load up at home on your personal network before hitting the road to avoid hitting your cap.\nHow Much Storage Space Will I Need?\nThat all depends on how much programming you save, of course. An average hour-long episode in standard definition clocks in at around 280MB. SD is the default download setting, but if you crave that high-definition action, you'll need roughly twice that. Everything you save will be stored by and accessible within the app, similar to Spotify or common podcast apps.\nWill My Downloads Expire?\nThis one is kind of all over the place because each program has a different shelf life. If a saved episode expires in less than seven days, your app's My Downloads section will show you a countdown. Other programs will have to be completed within 48 hours of the first time you press play.\nSounds Simple Enough.\nTotally.",

      "text": "Netflix Announces Its Offline Download Option Netflix Finally Added The Most Requested Feature Of All Time Print   Long Story Short \nWith their latest update, Netflix has finally added an offline download option for some of their most popular content. Users can download shows and movies to watch anywhere at a later time, and it's included in all streaming plans. Long Story \nThe cool thing about Netflix is that it's a streaming service – you don't need a bunch of DVDs or terabytes of hard drive space to have the entirety of Black Mirror at your fingertips. But the sucky thing about Netflix is that it's a streaming service – if you have data caps on your mobile devices, or you've just moved and your internet's not setup yet, you're shit outta luck until something changes. \nThankfully, something did: Netflix's newest update includes an option to download content to watch it offline. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nIf you download the latest version of Netflix for iOS or Android (both updates should be available today), you'll notice a download button appear next to a lot of your favourite shows. Right now it's mostly limited to Netflix originals , though a bunch of movies and shows from other studios are available as well. And more are on their way, according to Netflix. They've also added a helpful new \"sort by available to download\" feature. Netflix \nThis is pretty handy in a lot of scenarios, mostly when traveling wherever WiFi and/or 4G cellular internet isn't reliable. But watching Netflix on a phone isn't ideal (a tablet is better), and right now the feature is only available in the app for mobile devices – if you primarily watch Netflix on your computer, smart TV or streaming device (Apple TV, Roku, etc.), not much has changed. But given how well devices interact nowadays, it shouldn't be hard to migrate video from your phone to a computer, if Netflix allows it. \nContent will be available in both standard and \"higher\" quality download options, though Netflix doesn't state the actual resolution for either. The offline download option is included with all streaming plans. \nFeatured Image Courtesy: Shutterstock Own The Conversation Ask The Big Question \nWill this help Netflix keep up with services like Amazon, who've already had offline downloads for a while?

      "title": "Netflix Buys Pope Francis Mini-Series From Berlusconi’s Mediaset",
      "text": "Courtesy Mediaset/Medusa  26AM PT \nROME — Top Italian commercial TV network Mediaset has announced the sale to Netflix of its event mini-series “Call Me Francis,” which portrays Jorge Maria Bergoglio’s path from Jesuit priest to groundbreaking pontiff. \nThe four-part skein is the most ambitious title destined for the international TV market so far by the broadcaster, which is owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. \nPresenting the $15 -million series to the Italian press in Milan, Mediaset Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi said Netflix had acquired global rights outside Europe to “Call Me Francis” and would release it in 40 territories. \nHe added that Mediaset held on to European rights, even though Netflix wanted to purchase them, in order to “pursue a pan-European over-the-top platform project” which it intends to carry out with other unspecified European partners in the wake of its breakup with French media company Vivendi. \nA European representative for Netflix did not immediately respond to a confirmation request. However, “Call Me Francis” is among titles listed by the Netflix media center in its “first run” category. \nDirected by Italian filmmaker Daniele Luchetti, “Call Me Francis” chronicles the life of Bergoglio as a young man in Buenos Aires before he finds his calling to become a Jesuit priest, and follows him as he rises through the ranks of archbishop and cardinal. Along the way, he struggles with difficult decisions under Argentina’s military dictatorship, and eventually becomes the first pontiff from the Americas, in 2013. \nArgentinian actor Rodrigo De la Serna, who played alongside Gael Garcia Bernal in Walter Salles’s “The Motorcycle Diaries,” stars in the title role for most of the show. Chilean actor Sergio Hernandez (“Gloria”) plays Bergoglio in his later years. \n“Call Me Francis,” which was conceived and shot to be both a feature film and a TV series, is produced by Pietro Valsecchi for Mediaset’s film unit, Medusa, in collaboration with Mediaset’s Taodue production unit. \nThe “Call Me Francis” feature film was released in December 2015 in Italian cinemas, where it opened at No. 2 and scored a robust roughly $4 million overall. Netflix has not purchased the feature film version. \nMediaset will air the mini-series in Italy on its flagship Canale 5 generalist channel on Dec. 8, the pope’s 80th birthday.",

      "text": "Andrew Handley @somescifiguy \nThere you are again, sitting on the couch, staring at Netflix. You're wondering whether to take a chance on that indie thing with the obscure cover art or just give in to your darker impulses and watch Face/Off for the sixth time. Life shouldn't have to be this hard, and we're here to make it just a little easier. From incredible underrated gems to timeless favorites that you haven't thought about in years, we've rounded up the best movies on Netflix right now. Spotlight (2015) \nBased on the true story of the Boston Globe 's investigation into allegations of widespread sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, Spotlight is one of those rare films that ignores all the unnecessary glamour and dives straight into the heart of the story. Spotlight stars Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Brian D'Arcy James as the Spotlight team, the tightly-knit investigative journalism squad that broke the real-life story in 2002 (and won a 2003 Pulitzer for their efforts). \nFor starters, the performances from the cast are simply phenomenal. Michael Keaton's brusque portrayal of team leader Robby Robinson and Mark Ruffalo's brilliantly neurotic acting mark the centerpoints to the film, but everybody on the cast clearly gave it their all. And we have to give a special shout-out to Liev Schreiber, who barely speaks above a whisper and all but disappears beneath a beard and glasses, yet somehow steals every scene he's in. It's no wonder Spotlight took Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay at the 2016 Oscars. Overall, Spotlight is pure, unflinching, and thorough in its take on what was then—and still is—a highly controversial subject. It's definitely a story that will resonate for years to come. Hush (2016) \nShh…hear that? It's the sound of a smart, sexy horror thriller. With a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes , 2016's Hush is definitely a movie you can't miss. The premise is simple: Maddie, a deaf/mute author, is staying in her isolated house deep in the Alabama woods when a masked killer appears at her window. While that concept could easily devolve into another run-of-the-mill suspense flick, Hush has no problem upping the thrill factor with deft camera work, unrelenting suspense, and a truly amazing performance from largely unknown actress Kate Siegel. Without saying a word, Siegel portrays Maddie as strong, capable, and intelligent, a breath of fresh air for a female role in a horror movie. \nOf course, the sound design in Hush is top-notch. It has to be. Just as he manipulated our perceptions of reality with 2013's Oculus , director Mike Flanagan here uses Maddie's disability to keep the constant threat of danger looming. He never gets gimmicky with his portrayal of Maddie's deafness, giving us exactly as much as we need to feel the fear of never knowing what's behind us. It's not always what you hear, it's what you don't hear. Saving Private Ryan (1998) \nSteven Spielberg's seminal World War II epic Saving Private Ryan is as engrossing now as it was the day it was released in 1998. This was a film so unflinchingly brutal in its portrayal of wartime combat that some veterans left the theater in the opening scene. It was just too real . \nStarring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Giovanni Ribisi, and Barry Pepper, Saving Private Ryan follows Captain John Miller (Hanks) and a small rescue team as they search the front lines for Private Ryan (Damon), a soldier whose three brothers have all been killed in action. Matt Damon's role is particularly memorable, especially the story he tells about his family near the end, which Matt Damon completely made up on the spot . \nSpielberg said that he wanted to make an \"unglamorous\" war movie, a film that dropped its audience in the trenches to experience the visceral reality of war firsthand. Whatever he did, it worked. He went home with an Academy Award for Best Director and four additional awards for Saving Private Ryan . If you haven't seen it, now's your chance to remedy that. If you have seen it, check it out again. Somehow, it only gets better with time. The Babadook (2014) \nThe hype surrounding this indie Australian horror film is already unreal, so we'll keep our praise to two simple words: Watch it. \nThe Babadook opens on Amelia, a widowed mother (Essie Davis), who's struggling to raise Samuel, her six-year-old son (Noah Wiseman). She's exhausted, on a mental teeter-totter, and finding it harder and harder to love the erratic child, who's a bit mentally unstable himself. \nAnd then there's the monster. \nThis is pure horror, far removed from the typical grab bag of jump scares and loud, jarring audio cues you find in most horror movies. Yeah, it can be uncomfortable. It's probably not for everyone. But it's also touching, heartwarming, and impossibly human in its emotions. The relationship between Amelia and Samuel is as real as it gets. Put simply, The Babadook is so fresh, so far removed from cliché, that it'll probably start a few new clichés of its own given enough time. This film will be emulated and studied for years to come. \nBut don't let that put you off. It's a fun, approachable watch, with one of the creepiest film antagonists since Hannibal Lecter. Well worth your time if you like a good scare. Oldboy (2003) \nGritty, moving, gut-wrenching, and beautiful, 2003's Oldboy succeeded on two massive levels: one, it breathed new life into the (frankly stale) hard-boiled revenge genre. Two, it brought Korean films into the international spotlight. Well, okay, it succeeded on three levels: it also showed us that we can have way too much fun being grossed out of our minds. \nOldboy tells the story of Oh Dae-Su, a middle-aged drunk who is kidnapped and locked in a room for 15 years. When he's inexplicably released one day, Oh Dae-Su embarks on an emotional, blood-soaked journey of revenge against the man who imprisoned him. The camera doesn't shy away from the uncomfortable moments—and there are plenty of those. You'll cringe, but you'll also laugh. Maybe, just maybe, you'll cry. \nIf you aren't in the mood for subtitles, Spike Lee filmed an inferior English remake of Oldboy in 2013 with Josh Brolin, although at present, it's no longer on Netflix. Pulp Fiction (1994) \nOkay, daddy-o. There are dozens of reasons Pulp Fiction has become such a modern cult phenomenon, but the main one has to be that it's simply rewatchable as all get-out. Quentin Tarantino's third feature film is regarded by many to be his best, with a punchy, high-energy script, awesome performances from the entire cast, and a retro-violent style that beats you over the head and doesn't let up until the credits roll. \nBefore Miramax picked up the script, it had already been passed over by one production company, who called it \"too demented.\" It almost had a completely different cast, too. Producer Harvey Weinstein was set on casting Daniel Day-Lewis in the role of Vincent Vega , and Tarantino had to fight to use John Travolta. Of course, neither of them were the original choice: Tarantino reportedly wrote the script specifically for Michael Madsen, who played Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs . Just weeks before Tarantino finished writing the script, however, Madsen dropped out, much to Tarantino's wrath. \nIt's hard to imagine Pulp Fiction with any other actors, but that's not the only last-minute switch. Bruce Willis was nearly Vincent Vega, while Matt Dillon was briefly cast as Butch and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss was offered the part of Mia. And Samuel L. Jackson came this close to not even being in the film. The part was ready to go to someone else, and Jackson was so hungry when he went in for his last-minute audition, not to mention angry that he'd just been mistaken for Lawrence Fishburne, that the producers were \"scared s***less\" when Jackson walked in the door and started yelling at them. He was given the part on the spot. Nightcrawler (2014) \nThis hidden gem flew pretty far under the radar, which is a shame because it was definitely one of the best movies of 2014. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal in one of his most quietly sinister roles, Nightcrawler follows Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal), a desperate young man who discovers that he can make some quick cash by filming crime scenes and selling the footage to the local news stations. Bloom gets sucked into the seedy world of nightcrawling—trolling the streets at night with a police scanner and a camera—where he begins an ambitious, grueling climb to become top dog in a world of bottom feeders. \nGyllenhaal is fantastic here, which shouldn't come as a surprise—he's been fantastic in just about everything recently. First-time director Dan Gilroy captures the grimy underbelly of Los Angeles perfectly, evoking a sense of disquiet and barely-concealed rage that surges just beneath the surface of both the city and its inhabitants. For a unique movie that will have you on the edge of your seat, definitely check out Nightcrawler on Netflix. The Princess Bride (1987) \nThe Princess Bride is an awesome, quirky film that gently stabs multiple genres in the back and sews them all into one beautiful tale. It's a romance, a pirate adventure, a Spanish revenge flick, and a Billy Crystal comedy. It's action-packed, funny, sweet, and charming, and it manages to do all that without being too cheesy or over-the-top. When it is cheesy, it's the snort-through-your-nose kind of cheesy, not the cringe-worthy variety. It's Gouda, ya know? Goes great with an MLT (mutton, lettuce, and tomato, when the tomatoes are so perky…) \nGlue it all together, and you have a timeless, hilarious adventure that's stood the test of time like few fantasy films ( Willow, anyone?). Part of The Princess Bride 's charm is that it never takes itself seriously. It's a fairy tale with dialogue that fled from the Renaissance and landed somewhere in '90s Brooklyn. Billy Crystal is a sarcastic, wisecracking peasant-wizard. Cary Elwes somehow manages to mangle a British accent, despite being actually British. Peter Falk is, well, Peter Falk, and who can blame him? \nGiddily quotable and surprisingly emotional (we still get chills when Westley gets off the bed), The Princess Bride is the perfect movie choice for a fun evening with the family. Or with friends. Or alone, because you already told your girlfriend you have \"plans.\" Really, is there any un perfect time to watch The Princess Bride ? Upstream Color (2013) \nWith only two films under his belt, Shane Carruth has already mastered the low-budget science fiction flick. With 2004's Primer , Carruth took four men and a box and made a thought-provoking time travel film that actually made sense (we're looking at you, Star Trek Generations ). With Upstream Color , he quadrupled the budget (from Primer 's $7,000 to $40,000, all of which he raised himself so he could keep full creative control) and filmed a gorgeous, emotionally moving character piece that stays with you long after the credits roll. \nSo what is Upstream Color ? The name doesn't reveal much, and the Netflix description is intriguing, but not much better: \"A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism.\" Awesome, right? But what does it mean? \nUpstream Color has gotten mixed reviews . Some people love it. Others hate it. The story certainly doesn't serve itself on a platter. You've gotta work to make sense of it. Is it worth the trouble? Definitely. You'll be blown away, then spend the next hour Googling it all just to see if your theories match what really happened in the movie. It'll nag you for weeks until you finally watch it again, at which point you'll spot something you missed the first time and then do it all over. \nAt the very least, give it a chance. You might be disappointed. But then again, you might find a new Netflix favorite. Good Will Hunting (1997) \nMatt Damon and Ben Affleck's critically acclaimed pet project is so firmly entrenched in pop culture that it's almost a punchline at this point. But joke about it all you want, because Good Will Hunting is a masterful blend of comedy and drama that can hold its own against all comers. \nThe story of a janitor at MIT with a rough past who's secretly a genius, Good Will Hunting broke new ground in 1997. Robin Williams gave us an emotional and often hilarious performance that garnered him the only Oscar of his career. Affleck and Damon co-wrote the script while they were living together. Director Gus Van Sant was at that time fairly well-known among the indie circuit, but had yet to break into mainstream Hollywood. It's an uplifting, powerful movie, and dang it, we still cry at the end. The Pirates (2014) \nOkay, granted: the cover of The Pirates looks like a cheesy rip-off of Pirates of the Caribbean —something in the vein of Transmorphers , but with boats. It's also a foreign film, which means subtitles. Chances are you've passed this one over without even thinking about it. But give it a chance, because this Korean adventure comedy is oceans of fun. \nHere's the story in a nutshell: When the Royal Seal for the new country of Jeoseung is eaten by a whale, a group of clumsy bandits led by a seasick-prone sailor decide to become pirates and hunt down the whale to claim the treasure for themselves. They won't let the fact that they've never seen a whale, or the fact that they're up against real pirates and a ruthless navy, get in their way. \nMixing glorious martial arts with top-notch special effects and epic battles, The Pirates is truly a hidden gem, buried in Netflix under reams of similar-looking films and covers. No Country For Old Men (2007) \nWhen No Country For Old Men swept the 2008 Oscars, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay, it didn't do it easily. The Coen Brothers' modern classic was up against heavyweight films like There Will Be Blood , Atonement , The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , and the criminally underrated The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford . \nAnd No Country For Old Men deserved every bit of it. Based on the 2005 Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name, No Country takes place in the 1980s in Texas, where a blue-collar worker named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across the aftermath of a violent drug shoot-out in the middle of the desert. Moss helps himself to a briefcase full of cash, unwittingly putting himself in the sights of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a killer sent to track down the missing money. \nPeople have been singing Bardem's praises since the film came out. He's truly chilling as the ruthless psychopath Chigurh, to the point where you figure his family probably got a little nervous around him for awhile after seeing the film. Beasts Of No Nation (2015) \nBeasts of No Nation is Netflix's first original feature film (they bought the distribution rights, but didn't actually finance the film) and was released simultaneously in theaters and online. Unfortunately, the resulting controversy—several large theater chains boycotted the film, saying it violated theater exclusivity —overshadowed the film itself. That's a shame, because Beasts is an amazing first choice for Netflix to break into original films. \nStarring Idris Elba ( Prometheus , Thor ) as a ruthless commander and newcomer Abraham Attah as the boy soldier Agu, Beasts of No Nation is powerful, shockingly real, and heartbreaking in its portrayal of the unspeakable horrors of war. It's not an easy film to watch—the pace is relentless, the imagery visceral. But it's a film you should watch, if only for a brief glimpse into the struggle of daily life in war torn Africa. \nThe country in the film is never defined, although the story could presumably fall into any of the African nations embroiled in turf wars. It was filmed in Ghana, and director Cary Joji Fukunaga spent years researching the conflict in Sierra Leone before finally settling on the 2005 novel as the source material for his film. Following (1998) \nIf you've never had a chance to watch this film, don't beat yourself up. Until Netflix picked it up, there was practically no way to get a copy. But now that it's streaming, you could do worse things with an hour than take a trip back in time to the humble beginnings of one of Hollywood's current biggest directors. \nThere's no doubt that Christopher Nolan devastates derriere with a big budget and city-sized set pieces ( Interstellar , Inception , The Dark Knight trilogy, and so on), but where he truly shines is with small, intimate performances. Nowhere is that more apparent than in his first feature film, Following . \nFollowing , er, follows a struggling writer who gets it in his head to pick a random person on the street and just…follow them. Not to rob them, or kill them, or anything like that. Just to see what their lives are like. While doing this, he follows the wrong guy—a small-time home burglar who lets the writer tag along while he breaks into apartments. From there, things go downhill in a hurry, leading to a twisting plot that never stops surprising. Saying any more would give too much away. \nDon't let the fact that Following was filmed in black and white turn you off from this gem. It's a masterpiece. The Little Prince (2015) \nFollowing the success of Beasts of No Nation , Netflix picked up distribution rights in 2015 for The Little Prince , an animated adventure about a young girl who befriends her quirky old neighbor and gets caught up in a larger-than-life story of a prince who lives on an asteroid. The center of the plot comes from the 1943 French novella of the same name, which is one of the best-selling books in history. \nThe Little Prince is nothing short of magical. It's a kid's movie, but like most Pixar films it has plenty for the adults, too, especially if you're familiar with the original novella. The movie both recreates the story and pays homage to the author of the beloved original, and boasts a voice cast that includes Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, James Franco, Benicio del Toro, Ricky Gervais, Paul Rudd, and Marion Cotillard.

      "text": "Arts & Culture Laura Roman · NPR · Nov 30, 2016 At no extra cost to the user, Netflix subscribers are now able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices. Netflix \nIn the race for video streaming domination, Netflix surges forward. On Wednesday, Netflix announced and implemented in its latest update, the ability to download TV and movie titles on mobile devices. \nAt no extra cost to the user, Netflix subscribers will now be able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices, then watch on the go without the need for an Internet connection. Say goodbye to lackluster in-flight movies, Netflix is now airplane-mode compatible. \nThe move places Netflix in direct competition with iTunes and other services that offer video rentals and purchases for download. \nNetflix is not the first streaming service to offer offline viewing. Last year, Amazon Prime Video extended its download service to iPhones, iPads, and Android devices after offering it exclusively for the Amazon Fire Tablet. \nThe rise of Netflix, and its over 86 million subscribers , has been a force to compete with. Content providers are scrambling to stay relevant in its wake. In 2015, HBO and Showtime introduced standalone streaming services, offering cord-cutters access to premium content without a cable package. \nHowever, what makes Netflix so attractive is the amount of content for the dollar spent. HBO Now begins at $14.99 a month. Showtime can be an add-on to a Hulu or Amazon subscription or at a standalone monthly price of $10.99. While Netflix's basic monthly package begins at $7.99, and the premium version is $11.99. \nCable providers are trying to evolve as well. Also Wednesday, AT&T launched DirecTV Now , an Internet streaming service available on phones, tablets, computers, and streaming devices. In February 2015, Dish introduced Sling TV , which streams cable channels through the Internet. \nThe convenience of streaming TV and movies has led many people to cut the cord. Hulu subscribers are willing to pay for the most up-to-date episodes and movies, and sit through 90-second adds every few minutes. While there is a premium Hulu service which does not include commercial breaks, the \"No Commercial Plan\" does not apply to popular shows such as Scandal , Grey's Anatomy , and How to Get Away With Murder . \nAs Netflix paves the way for online streaming, you have to wonder what former Blockbuster executives are thinking now. It was 16 years ago that Blockbuster passed on purchasing the then DVD mailing service for only $50 million . Netflix is worth $50 billion. Blockbuster has just a handful of stores left . \nLaura Roman is the social media intern at NPR. ",

      "text": "Netflix Is Finally Letting You Download Movies and TV Shows Megan Friedman From Marie Claire The holidays are for family togetherness, eating tons of food, and binge-watching Netflix shows. (Or at least having their yule log playing constantly on the television.) Now, you can keep watching shows like The Crown , even on the bus ride to and from your parents' house. That's because Netflix is letting you download your favorite movies and TV shows so you can watch them when you have no signal. The company made the announcement on Twitter Wednesday morning: Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 - Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 According to a company blog post , you can now go to the details page on a movie or show and click the download button, so you can watch it later. Some titles are already available for download, and more will become available later. Downloads are now available for all plans, for no extra cost, but only for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. Just make sure you have the most recent update on the Netflix app. The feature is similar to what is already available for Amazon Prime members. If you're a Prime subscriber, you can use the Amazon Video app to download select videos and TV shows to your phone or tablet, sometimes for a limited time, so you can watch while you lack signal or simply don't want to rack up data charges. But the Netflix announcement changes the game when it comes to the site's original series and movie catalog. The Netflix app now has an \"Available for Download\" section that can help you find stuff to pre-install for your next long trip or subway commute. Though Gilmore Girls is weirdly not on there, Black Mirror , Stranger Things , and Orange Is the New Black are there for you when you need an escape from family.

Thanksgiving is over here in the U.S. and so MashTalk returns.\nYours truly, Mashable Chief Correspondent Lance Ulanoff and Tech Editor Pete Pachal turned to a couple of big tech stories in the digital realm, especially one involving Netflix .\nSEE ALSO: Everything you need to know about Netflix downloads\nAs you may already know, Netflix finally announced downloads for movies and TVs shows . It's a huge step forward for Netflix given Amazon Video added download support for videos and movies last year.\nThe ability to download videos is pretty handy if you're offline or want to save on cellular data. It's definitely a feature I'll be using more during my work commute. No more video streaming cutting in and out because of spotty LTE connections between stations and no more waiting for videos to buffer!\nFor a more thorough breakdown of file sizes and video quality and content you'll be able download, be sure to check out this handy guide .\nAT&T also made the news this week with the launch of DirecTV Now . The streaming service, which starts at $35 per month, lets subscribers stream over 100 live TV channels through an app on popular set-top boxes such as the Apple TV, Fire TV and Chromecast, as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.\nIt's arguable whether DirecTV Now simplifies or complicates the myriad of TV streaming options out there. Lance believes it's a win for consumers and Pete disagrees. Me? I don't subscribe to TV services or streaming services other than Amazon Video and Netflix; who has time for so much TV when we've got Twitter?\nThe last topic on this week's podcast centered around the always controversial Reddit and its CEO Steve Huffman, who, in his own words \"messed up\" when he went and edited comments made about him on the site by Trump supporters.\nShould he be fired for his actions or not? Did he have a right to essentially activate \"god mode\" on the service? You'll have to listen to the podcast to find out.\nThanks for your support and don't forget to leave your questions and comments by tweeting @Mash_Talk with the #MashTalk hashtag.\nBONUS: This is what happens when you binge-watch Black Mirror",

      "text": "CNN NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. Netflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment \nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Netflix \nThere was a lot of hype surrounding two of Netflix's newest original offerings, the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival and the high-priced \"The Crown,\" but are people actually watching them?\nAccording to  SymphonyAM , whose app listens to sounds from users' televisions and takes that data to extrapolate viewership, the shows had very mixed results. \nSymphonyAM measured how many adults aged 18 to 49, the demographic most desired by advertisers, watched Netflix's originals on the day they premiered and the three following days. It then ranked them according to those measurements. \nThe ranking is great news for \"Gilmore Girls,\" which shot to No. 3 on the list with nearly 5 million viewers and a 3.59 rating in the 18-to-49 audience. While \"Fuller House\" and the fourth season of \"Orange Is the New Black\" still rank higher than \"Gilmore Girls,\" first and second respectively, the revival beat Marvel's \"Luke Cage,\" the second season of \"Daredevil,\" and the cult sci-fi hit \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nNetflix For \"The Crown,\" the picture is less regal. It ranked No. 22 against higher-rated Netflix originals with just a .43 18-to-49 rating and 590,000 adult viewers under the age of 50. It's joined at the bottom of the list by digital thriller series \"Black Mirror\" and comedy \"Grace and Frankie.\" \nThere are a few caveats to this data. First, Netflix has said that SymphonyAM's numbers aren't accurate. \nSecond, Netflix's business model is based on subscriptons, not advertising, so the 18-to-49 ratings really just place their series in context with the broadcast networks. For example, a series like \"Grace and Frankie\" may have more viewers in the older demographics. \nAnd third, Netflix's originals are offered internationally and SymphonyAM only measures US viewership. So,  Netflix's expensive show, \"The Crown,\"  which follows the life of young Queen Elizabeth, may have bigger audiences overseas. \nTake a look at SymphonyAM's Netflix show rankings below: \nNetflix \nNOW WATCH: Netflix is giving part of the ‘Mythbusters’ team their own show — here’s the trailer \n",

      "text": "print \nKelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Netflix \nThere was a lot of hype surrounding two of Netflix's newest original offerings, the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival and the high-priced \"The Crown,\" but are people actually watching them? \nAccording to SymphonyAM , whose app listens to sounds from users' televisions and takes that data to extrapolate viewership, the shows had very mixed results. \nSymphonyAM measured how many adults aged 18 to 49, the demographic most desired by advertisers, watched Netflix's originals on the day they premiered and the three following days. It then ranked them according to those measurements. \nThe ranking is great news for \"Gilmore Girls,\" which shot to No. 3 on the list with nearly 5 million viewers and a 3.59 rating in the 18-to-49 audience. While \"Fuller House\" and the fourth season of \"Orange Is the New Black\" still rank higher than \"Gilmore Girls,\" first and second respectively, the revival beat Marvel's \"Luke Cage,\" the second season of \"Daredevil,\" and the cult sci-fi hit \"Stranger Things.\" \nClaire Foy and Matt Smith as Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, on \"The Crown.\" Robert Viglasky/Netflix \nFor \"The Crown,\" the picture is less regal. It ranked No. 22 against higher-rated Netflix originals with just a .43 18-to-49 rating and 590,000 adult viewers under the age of 50. It's joined at the bottom of the list by digital thriller series \"Black Mirror\" and comedy \"Grace and Frankie.\" \nThere are a few caveats to this data. First, Netflix has said that SymphonyAM's numbers aren't accurate. \nSecond, Netflix's business model is based on subscriptions, not advertising, so the 18-to-49 ratings really just place their series in context with the broadcast networks. For example, a series like \"Grace and Frankie\" may have more viewers in the older demographics. \nAnd third, Netflix's originals are offered internationally and SymphonyAM only measures US viewership. So, Netflix's expensive show, \"The Crown,\" which follows the life of young Queen Elizabeth, may have bigger audiences overseas. \nTake a look at SymphonyAM's Netflix show rankings below: \nSymphonyAM",

      "text": "  Ken Shepherd - The Washington Times   \nNetflix has paid $15 million for a four-part series on the life and ministry of Jorge Maria Bergoglio, the Catholic priest who become Pope Francis, Variety reported Friday. \nThe deal allows the video-streaming service to offer the series, titled “Call Me Francis,” in 40 territories outside of Europe, Variety said. Italian production company Mediaset is retaining the rights to the series in Europe in the hopes of “pursu[ing] a pan-European over-the-top platform project,” said company CEO Pier Silvio. \nAn over-the-top platform is an internet-based alternative to traditional satellite or cable television programming. \nMediaset will air the mini-series in Italy on Dec. 8, Variety reported. It’s unknown if the pope might tune in out of curiosity, but it will be a busy day for him as he, along with Catholics worldwide, celebrates the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.",

      "text": "Nick Schmiedicker December 02, 2016 \nHave you ever logged into Netflix and gone through the recommended categories looking for something new to watch only to find nothing catching your eye? Despite having gone on a Disney movie binge, maybe I want to look through something other than \"Feel-good Animation\" or \"Children & Family Movies.\" Maybe I'm looking for a classic war movie or cult sci-fi and fantasy movie. \nLucky for me (and you), there's a way to curate those searches to find exactly what you're looking for. Netflix has a master list of categories it uses to curate its content list and anyone can access that list with the right URL and code. \nUsing the URL http://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/#### as a jumping off point, just substitute the #### for a code corresponding to the category you're looking for. Like, \"Classic War Movie\" is 48744 and \"Cult Sci-Fi and Fantasy Movies\" is 4734. \nIt's a pretty broad range of categories to pick from and some won't even show up in search at all without using one of these codes. I've highlighted some of my personal favorites below (plus some that are just plain weird) or you can head to the Netflix Secret Categories page for a full list. Happy bingeing!

      "text": "Machine learning — a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from fraud detection and sorting spam in Google, to making movie recommendations on Netflix – can help scientists determine whether planetary systems are stable or not, a study says. ”Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that’s predicting whether planetary systems are stable,” said study lead author Dan Tamayo from the University of Toronto Scarborough in Canada. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not",

      "text": "(Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Netflix) \nThere was a lot of hype surrounding two of Netflix's newest original offerings, the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival and the high-priced \"The Crown,\" but are people actually watching them? \nAccording to SymphonyAM , whose app listens to sounds from users' televisions and takes that data to extrapolate viewership, the shows had very mixed results. \nSymphonyAM measured how many adults aged 18 to 49, the demographic most desired by advertisers, watched Netflix's originals on the day they premiered and the three following days. It then ranked them according to those measurements. \nThe ranking is great news for \"Gilmore Girls,\" which shot to No. 3 on the list with nearly 5 million viewers and a 3.59 rating in the 18-to-49 audience. While \"Fuller House\" and the fourth season of \"Orange Is the New Black\" still rank higher than \"Gilmore Girls,\" first and second respectively, the revival beat Marvel's \"Luke Cage,\" the second season of \"Daredevil,\" and the cult sci-fi hit \"Stranger Things.\"\n\n(Claire Foy and Matt Smith as Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Philip, on \"The Crown.\"Robert Viglasky/Netflix) \nFor \"The Crown,\" the picture is less regal. It ranked No. 22 against higher-rated Netflix originals with just a .43 18-to-49 rating and 590,000 adult viewers under the age of 50. It's joined at the bottom of the list by digital thriller series \"Black Mirror\" and comedy \"Grace and Frankie.\" \nThere are a few caveats to this data. First, Netflix has said that SymphonyAM's numbers aren't accurate. \nSecond, Netflix's business model is based on subscriptions, not advertising, so the 18-to-49 ratings really just place their series in context with the broadcast networks. For example, a series like \"Grace and Frankie\" may have more viewers in the older demographics. \nAnd third, Netflix's originals are offered internationally and SymphonyAM only measures US viewership. So, Netflix's expensive show, \"The Crown,\" which follows the life of young Queen Elizabeth, may have bigger audiences overseas. \nTake a look at SymphonyAM's Netflix show rankings below: \n(SymphonyAM) \n\nNOW WATCH: Netflix is giving part of the ‘Mythbusters’ team their own show — here’s the trailer \n\nMore From Business Insider \nLeah Remini's new Scientology expose TV show has giant ratings \n'Gilmore Girls' star talks about the surprising revelation of his character's sexuality \n'Gilmore Girls' star says a 'very pivotal' scene in his story was cut from the show",

      "text": "0 comments \nWith Legendary’s big budget Spectral hitting Netflix exactly one week from today ( December 9 ), you have to wonder why we haven’t seen a trailer or any footage for it yet. In fact the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it footage seen in this December promo video is all we’ve seen to date with no indication we’ll get more leading up the film’s release. \nFor comparison’s sake, Netflix released a trailer for Chris Sparling’s Mercy five months prior its release while ARQ received a trailer fifteen days before it was released. \nAdd to this the fact that Spectral was pulled from its August theatrical release and you have to wonder if the film isn’t something of a disappointment. And yet, Netflix hardly has a reputation of being a dumping ground, so I’m still hoping the film is as kick ass as it appears to be in concept. \nDirected by Nic Mathieu and starring James Badge Dale ( World War Z ), Max Martini ( Pacific Rim ), Emily Mortimer ( Shutter Island ), and Bruce Greenwood ( Super 8 ), the film follows “ a special ops team who battle supernatural entities taking over a European city. ” Think Black Hawk Down meets Ghostbusters . \nSpectral footage appears at :27 in the promo video below.",

Bayona will direct with Frank Marshall producing, along with Pat Crowley and Belén Atienza. Colin Trevorrow, who helmed Jurassic World , penned the script with his writing partner, Derek Connolly. Trevorrow will also exec produce with Steven Spielberg. \nHere’s the trailer for Netflix’s “The Get Down”; if it piques your interest I can guarantee you’re going to love it.",

      "title": "FANG Stocks To Keep Going Strong In 2017: Analyst",
      "text": "Flip \nInvestors who hold the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google/ Alphabet) may want to consider recalibrating their holdings… perhaps into GFAN, GNFA or ANFG, according to one analyst. However, it looks like nothing will stop the FANG stocks as the sky’s the limit for all four of them. The only one of the four in question lately has been Netflix, even it remains a darling among Wall Street analysts, despite the questions about content spend and subscriber numbers. FANG stocks take a bite out of BAGEL \nAround this time last year, some analysts were thinking that BAGEL (Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Expedia, LinkedIn) would replace FANG in 2016, but that didn’t happen. A lot has changed since December 2015. LinkedIn is out of the picture, as it’s in the process of being acquired by Microsoft. Alibaba is rising in popularity still but facing questions about its accounting procedures, and Expedia has failed to turn into the hot stock some thought it would, although it has managed to climb back to around the level it was trading at a year ago. \nCanaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham noted in his Nov. 30 update on the FANG stocks have outperformed the broader market “by a wide margin” over the last two years, although they had a rather mixed third quarter. He explained that each member of the group had a difference performance around its earnings report. \nThen after Donald Trump surprised everyone by winning the presidency, there was a broad sell-off of all the FANG stocks and the tech sector as a whole, although that was short-lived. Cantor Fitzgerald recently did a study of how Trump’s presidency might affect the constituents of FANG, and one of the key risks he found for all of them was an overhaul to net neutrality rules. He named Trump’s protectionist views as a far smaller risk for the FANG names than for other tech plays such as Apple, which relies heavily on China. \nGraham still expects the group to perform well throughout 2017, although he suggests fine-tuning exposure to the individual stocks based on time horizons. FANG stocks to benefit from strong tech sector \nGraham’s colleague Tony Dwyer expects the tech sector to do well in the coming year based on the current macro backdrop, which is strong and features a steeping yield curve, low P/Es and buyback support. President-elect Trump is widely expected to instigate corporate tax reform, with one likely outcome being incentives for companies to repatriate cash. If this happens, companies could have some fresh cash to buy back shares with. \nGraham also believes that the four main drivers of the FANG stocks – digital advertising, digital video viewing, e-commerce and cloud services – are still intact, with the tech sector being “mid-stride” in all of them. One headwind for the group, however, is the ongoing shift from non-GAAP to GAAP metrics. Graham said Netflix isn’t affected at all by the shift but that Facebook is the most affected of all the FANG stocks. Timing impacts positioning in FANG stocks \nThe analyst also suggests that investors examine and readjust their positioning based on “time horizons.” For example, for the first quarter, they suggest GFAN rather than FANG, with investors buying more of the first stock in the list, Google. \nThe reason is because he expects Google parent Alphabet to “power through Q4 with valuation support” and because the company doesn’t issue guidance. He believes the lack of guidance will help keep the momentum in the company’s stock going through March, adding that Facebook has the same features except it lacks the valuation. He expects Netflix to have a strong fourth quarter but possibly give a cautious guide for first quarter subscriber numbers. \nFor all of 2017, Graham suggests GNFA. He sees Google and Facebook as having “achievable mandates,” although Facebook could be hurt by the shift toward GAAP metrics. Meanwhile he expects Netflix to deliver on subscriber numbers in the second half of the year but spend more on content, while first-half estimates for Amazon may fall as a result of price cuts. Adjusting price targets for FANG stocks \nBecause of the change to GAAP metrics, Graham also adjusted his price targets for the FANG stocks. He cut his Facebook stock target by $10 to $150 per share based on GAAP numbers, although increased estimates slightly offset that shift. He slashed his target for Amazon stock from $900 to $875 due to the shift to GAAP and lower expectations for Amazon Web Services. \nHis price target for Google stock moves to $925 from $950 per share due to the shift to GAAP numbers , although higher estimates offset the drag from that shift. His target for Netflix stock remains at $140.",

      "title": "Why Netflix Moved to a Microservices Architecture | ProgrammableWeb",
      "text": "By John Piela \nBack in 2008, a dubious public looked on as Netflix announced plans to move to the cloud. Adrian Cockcroft, Netflix's cloud architect, explained the general reaction stating, \"everyone said we were completely crazy [….] They didn’t believe we were actually doing that, they thought we were just making stuff up.\" Despite public opinion, Cockcroft understood Netflix needed to push away from monolithic vertically-scaled datacenters and move towards cloud-based microservices architecture. The potential benefits in a structural overhaul starkly overshadowed any foreseeable disadvantages. Fast forward roughly 8 years, and Netflix has become one of the first major corporations to exist completely in the public cloud. This article from SmartBear looks at how their architectural shift revealed significant improvements in performance, development, and scalability resulting in a remarkable period of growth. Netflix’s success with cloud-based microservices architecture has been so remarkable that, in hindsight, it’s hard to imagine that Netflix would have moved in any other direction. After a single missing semicolon led to a major database corruption in 2008, Netflix understood they had to change their approach. Their vertical monolithic data structure meant separate compartments of code were intimately woven together; an error in one section could cause issues for the whole system. By segmenting their data into a network of horizontally connected API services, Netflix could minimize the frequency and severity of code errors and related issues. This is known as separation of concerns, or as Cockcroft calls it, “Loosely coupled service oriented architecture with bounded contexts”. He admits that by having more systems, more time would be spent managing those systems, but this approach would translate into greater system-wide stability. Cockrofts explains that these API services would break at different times causing smaller, localized problems, rather than losing “the whole system at once”, which, in turn, resulted in less manual intervention for Netflix engineers. \nThis compartmentalized structure also meant the developmental process was less intrusive. Netflix was able to build and tests services with a relatively low-risk of impacting their service. As such, Netflix was free to diversify their developmental portfolio. Netflix created 30+ separate engineering teams capable of independently developing and implementing new services on a variety of new platforms. To put that in perspective, prior to their architectural shift, Netflix would “have at least 10 minutes of downtime to put in the new schema,” every two weeks. Yet, their cloud migration and horizontal shift offered Netflix much more beyond the realm of stability and flexibility. By employing Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their cloud computing, Netflix was able to take quantum leaps forward in terms of scalability. Previously, Netflix datacenters proved to be bulky and slow to adapt. Changes in capacity could take days and different components were unable to scale at different rates. Additionally, Netflix was expanding so rapidly that they struggled to build data centers quickly enough to meet user demands. However, AWS offered Netflix the ability to change their capacity within minutes, differentiate rates between components, and expand unencumbered. \"We don't have to plan capacity in advance, we don't need to ask permission of other people to build things for us, and we don't worry about running out of space or power”, Cockcroft explains. As of early 2016, Netflix announced their expansion of services to over 130 new countries. Their rapid expansion is due, in no small part, to the very nature of their cloud-based microservices architecture. Although their migration took the better part of a decade, it offered lasting solutions to long-standing issues and has paved the way for other major corporations to follow suit. Original Article ",

      "text": "Cyber Week: Find the Best Cyber Deals \nMachine learning -- a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from fraud detection and sorting spam in Google, to making movie recommendations on Netflix -- can help scientists determine whether planetary systems are stable or not, a study says. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 Photos \n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" said study lead author Dan Tamayo from the University of Toronto Scarborough in Canada. \nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient. \nThe researchers found that the same class of algorithms used by Google and Netflix can also tell us if distant planetary systems are stable or not. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. \n\"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" Tamayo said. \nIt's important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed. It can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation. \nThere are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, Tamayo noted. \nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team was published online in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. \n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he added. \nIt may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year. The two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system. \n\"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" Tamayo said.",

      "text": "\nIf you’re among the many Gilmore Girls fans who feels as if the final four words in Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life leaves the door open for a continuation down the line, you’re not alone.\nActress Lauren Graham , who plays Lorelai Gilmore, recently opened up about the final four words in her new memoir, Talking As Fast As I Can .\nAccording to Bustle , Graham explains within the book that she actually had no idea what Palladino’s ending entailed until they got around to filming the scene. That’s fairly impressive considering the showrunner has had the ending of Gilmore Girls planned since the very beginning. So what was Graham’s reaction to hearing how the show would end? Like many fans, she was a bit stunned.\n“I think my reaction goes something like ‘Huh.’ And after that it goes something like. ‘Really?’” says Graham in her memoir, according to Bustle .\nLike many Gilmore Girls fans who were left with a dozen questions about what the final four words could mean for some of our favorite characters, Graham also writes that she doesn’t necessarily consider them to be an ending, so much as the start of something new.\n“They do not end the story we are telling as much as they introduce something that was not previously known,” continues Graham. “Which, to me, is not precisely an ending.”\nIn fact, Graham also admits that when she finally heard the final four words, she remembers responding to Palladino by saying, “Isn’t that more of a cliffhanger?”\nUnfortunately, it sounds like if there’s more story to be told, Palladino is keeping tight lipped!\n“Amy doesn’t answer me,” continues Graham. “She just smiles. Hmmmm.”\nIt sounds as though Graham isn’t quite convinced of the fact that the Gilmore Girls have told their final story. If we’re being honest, we’re not so sure either— we definitely have more than a few questions we’d love to ask Palladino about where the story goes from here, and we hope she gets around to answering them someday.\nIs it wishful thinking to hope that we’ll get the answers in the form of a Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life season 2 ? Probably, but that’s not going to stop us from crossing our fingers anyway!\n(H/T: Bustle ) \n\nTagged: Gilmore Girls , Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , lauren graham , Talking As Fast As I Can ",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix  00AM PT \nFrance appears to have firmed up its reputation as home to the world’s second biggest animation industry behind the U.S. — for proof, look no further than this year’s Oscar animated feature race. \nIn the mix are Mark Osborne’s “ The Little Prince ,” Franck Ekinci and Christian Desmares’ “ April and the Extraordinary World ,” Claude Barras’ “My Life as a Zucchini,” Remi Chaye’s “Long Way North,” Michael Dudok de Wit’s “The Red Turtle,” Alexandre Heboyan and Benoît Philippon’s “Mune, Guardian of the Moon,” and Alain Gagnol and Jean-Loup Felicioli’s “Phantom Boy.” Two more animation entries, “The Secret Life of Pets ” and “ Sing ” from Illumination MacGuff, were entirely created in France. \nAlthough these films have different animation styles, tones, approach, and scopes, they all have a Gallic element in common: a French director and/or producer, or they were made in France with local creatives. \n“France has a very strong auteur filmmaking tradition, of course, so that’s a big piece of it. But it also has some of the best animation schools and talent, government support, a vibrant co-production environment, and a domestic market that supports independent animation,” says Eric Beckman, co-founder and president of GKids , the U.S.’ biggest supporter of European toons. This year, it’s got “My Life as a Zucchini,” “Mune,” “Phantom Boy,” and “April and the Extraordinary World,” among others, on its slate. \nIndeed, Paris’ prestigious Gobelins School of the Image has become so popular among U.S. studios — from Disney to Illumination and DreamWorks Animation — as a source of fresh talent that this year it launched an English-language master of arts in character animation and animated filmmaking. \nFrance’s track record in animation features also stems from its large pool of top-notch producers such as Les Armateurs, Sacrebleu Prods., as well as distribution house Gebeka Films, and its leadership in TV animation — a heavily subsidized industry that requires TV channels to pre-buy and program homegrown toon shows. \nAnd animation in France is considered a crown jewel of local culture and as such is nurtured not only by schools but also by film festivals, such as Annecy Animation Film Festival or even Cannes Film Festival, including Directors’ Fortnight. \nIndeed, auteur-driven prestige toons have been gaining ground at international festivals. For instance, “The Red Turtle” premiered in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard and won the special jury prize (Sony Pictures Classics distributes in the U.S.), while “My Life as a Zucchini,” a GKids pickup, premiered in Directors’ Fortnight and was chosen by Switzerland to rep the country in the Oscar’s competitive foreign-language race. \nFrench animators also benefit from a vibrant short film culture, says Gilles Renouard, co-managing director of Unifrance . He points to the record 14 French animated shorts (out of 70) in the running for this year’s Oscars and the previous wins of 2009’s “Logorama” and 2013’s “Mr. Hublot.” \nThe wide-ranging selection of films with French directors, partners or makers also underscores how global the animation business has become on every level. \nCase in point: A wordless tale of a lone castaway surviving on a desert island, “The Red Turtle” was directed by Dudok de Wit, a Dutch-born, London-based animator (whose 2000 short “Father and Daughter” won an Oscar), co-written by French director Pascale Ferran (“Bird People”), and co-produced by France’s Why Not Prods. (“I, Daniel Blake”) and Japan’s iconic Studio Ghibli. \nOn a bigger scale, “The Little Prince,” a reimagining of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s 1943 children’s classic, was directed by “Kung Fu Panda” director Mark Osborne and produced by French outfit ON Entertainment with a budget of $75 million-plus. The movie pioneered a breed of big-budget French toon pics showcasing a U.S. creative input; next up is Quad Films with “Ballerina.” \nAssembling international teams has also proven the right recipe for Illumination MacGuff, whose Paris studio is mainly staffed with Gallic creatives. \n“I think our international crew component helps us in a huge way to appeal globally. We rely on the good ideas of the artists at every step of the way as part of our process, and we benefit always from the expansive talents and unique perspectives that our diversity provides,” says Illumination MacGuff’s Paris-based producer Janet Healy. She also acknowledged the major role played by French production designer Eric Guillon, on both “The Secret Life of Pets” and “Sing.” \nIn terms of international sales and foreign box office prospects, French animation is a huge driving force. \nAs much as 90% of all French animated features travel abroad and most, if not all, of French animated films find U.S. distributors, says Renouard. He notes that a trio of French toons — “The Little Prince,” “Asterix and the Domain of the Gods,” and “Mune” — repped 20% of Gallic films’ ticket sales outside the country in 2015. \nWith nearly $100 million in worldwide box office, “The Little Prince,” produced by Aton Soumache and Dimitri Rassam, is France’s most successful animated film to date, with nearly 12.5 million admissions. \n“Smart family content is indeed in high demand internationally,” says Anna Marsh, head of international sales at Studiocanal, which reps “April and the Extraordinary World.” “Both arthouse theatrical circuits and SVOD platforms have a real appetite for quality animation, not to mention physical DVD sales which, for this genre, are still very much alive.” \nMarsh says arthouse animated pics have also proven a viable economic bet for distributors looking for an alternative to studio movies. The role played by digital players such as Netflix and multi-platform distribs like Shout! Factory have also optimized the commercial potential and exposure of non-Hollywood animated films beyond the Los Angeles and New York theatrical audiences. \n“With their millions of subscribers around the world, streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu are allowing our films to reach mass audiences in U.S. for the first time and without necessitating gigantic P&A spends, and as a result, they’re enabling audiences to discover the eclecticism of animation production,” says Soumache. \nNetflix mounted a limited day-and-date theatrical release for “The Little Prince” in the U.S. to qualify for awards consideration. \nCross-platform Shout! Factory has also been active on the arthouse animated film front and is pushing for “Long Way North” to clinch an Oscar nomination. “Since digital distribution creates a wealth of opportunities and an accessible playing field for independents, we work diligently to maximize sales in that channel,” says Melissa Boag, senior VP of family entertainment at Shout! Factory and Shout! Factory Kids. \nThe combined work of traditional arthouse distributors like Sony Pictures Classics, which previously handled animated films “Persepolis” and “Waltz With Bashir,” as well as dedicated animation distributor GKids, has played a key part in getting Academy voters as well as world cinema lovers and adult audiences to embrace these director-driven features. \nBeckman calls the increased appeal of arthouse animation the “Kirikou” effect, referring to Michel Ocelot’s cult hit. \n“We are still reaping the benefits of the ‘Kirikou’ effect, where a highly original, auteur-driven film was also a big financial success,” he says. “This led directly to ‘Triplets of Belleville,’ ‘Secret of Kells,’ and ‘Ernest and Celestine’ from ‘Kirikou’ producer Didier Brunner, and tons of other French producers piled into animation as well, bringing us ‘Persepolis,’ ‘A Cat in Paris’ as well as ‘My Life as a Zucchini,’ ‘Mune,’ ‘Phantom Boy,’ and ‘April and the Extraordinary World.’” \nBecause they’re working with more contained budgets than U.S. films, French animators often have more freedom to experiment with new visual styles or place more emphasis on the story and characters. \nMaking his directorial debut with “Long Way North,” Chaye, a former first assistant director on such films as the Oscar-nommed “The Secret of Kells,” acknowledged that he took a gamble with the film’s minimalist graphic style to focus on narration and characters’ emotions rather than the animation’s details. \n“Our idea was to find a graphic style that would ignite the imagination and let it fill the blanks, because when too many details are given, it tends to dampen the imagination,” says Chaye. His film follows the epic journey of a strong-headed young Russian aristocrat in the 19th century who sets off the find her grandfather, an explorer, in the North Pole. \n“My Life as a Zucchini,” the debut feature from Swiss director Barras, based on a script from Céline Sciamma (“Girlhood”), also dares to tackle drama, a genre that U.S. studios shy away from in animation. The film, adapted from a children’s novel, turns on a boy dealing with his mother’s sudden death and who is placed in a foster home. \nWhile Pixar/Illumination-style films are bound to dominate the box office for the foreseeable future, Beckman predicts “more and more films will break that mold … as there are more and more ways to get a film distributed without a $30 million P&A budget. \n“There is a growing appetite for different kinds of animated filmmaking, from families looking for alternatives to mainstream fare, to adult audiences looking for new cinematic experiences, to a wide and passionate audience of people who grew up with Japanese animation,” Beckman says. \nTooned Up Animated films from France or with a Gallic provenance in the Oscar race \nThe Little Prince \nApril and the Extraordinary World Directors: Franck Ekinci, Christian Desmares \nMy Life as a Zucchini Director: Claude Barras",

      "text": "(Dave Coulier at the season one LA premiere of Netflix's \"Fuller House\" in February 2016.Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) \n\"Full House\" star Dave Coulier made his directorial debut on the second season of Netflix's spin-off \"Fuller House,\" show creator Jeff Franklin told Business Insider. \nCoulier, who starred on the original ABC comedy series as Uncle Joey Gladstone and guest-stars on at least three episodes of the upcoming sophomore season, directed one of the biggest episodes of the new run: the Christmas episode.\n\"He really did his homework and he did a great job,\" Franklin said of Coulier's work. \" He gets an A+. He really did a wonderful job. Everyone felt he was so good with the actors.\" \nIn order to prepare for his directing debut, Coulier shadowed a couple of the franchise's veteran directors, Rich Correll (whose credits also include Disney Channel's \"Jessie\" and \"K.C. Undercover\") and \"Full House's\" original stage manager-turned-director Mark Cendrowski (\"Big Bang Theory,\" \"Dr. Ken\").\nHelming an episode that can cost millions to produce is a high-level job, so Franklin admitted that he did have some reservations. But Coulier aced the gig.\n\"We were a little nervous, because Dave’s a big kid,\" Franklin said of the comedian. \"But he really stepped up, took it very seriously, and did a great job.\" \nFranklin said that Coulier would be welcomed back to direct another episode if Netflix renews the show for a third season. And as for other actors directing on the series, Franklin said there are currently no plans. \n\"We haven't heard from anyone else yet,\" the producer said. \"But who knows. That's something that actors like to do in later years in a series in order to flex some other muscles. So, yeah, that could happen.\" \n\"Fuller House\" returns for its second season December 9 on Netflix. \nNOW WATCH: Netflix is giving part of the ‘Mythbusters’ team their own show — here’s the trailer \n\nMore From Business Insider \nHere's how many people are watching one of Netflix's most expensive shows yet — and it's not great \nWatch 'Shark Tank' star Kevin O'Leary skate off with a potential deal on the next episode \nJennifer Aniston blasts 'B.S.' tabloids that 'mobbed' her: 'We have to stop buying them'",

      "text": "MORE >> \nBy now, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life has been available to stream on Netflix for a week now and you’ve likely already binged all four installments (and maybe, possibly started the entire show all over again). In the week since the revival’s release, a surprising amount of controversies have cropped up as well. Last night (Dec. 2, 2016), Lauren Graham paid a visit to The Late Show where she addressed the latest Stars Hollow scandal… \nStephen Colbert mentioned to the TV star that viewers have been critical online about the way Lorelai holds her Luke’s Diner coffee cup (from the bottom) and wondered if the actors are ever actually drinking coffee on the show. \n“I want to tell you one thing, that is a true thing,” Graham told the late-night host. “ There is always coffee in my cup . Always. That is a pet peeve of mine. I’m holding it. I’m holding it like this [picks it up]. I’m looking at snow, I’m holding the cup. I’m drinking. I love the controversies that are cropping up!” 10 Photos » \nAfterward, Graham effortlessly demonstrated that just because you’re holding a cup of joe from the bottom does mean it’s impossible to take a drink. \nDuring her visit, the actress also discussed the chance to get to return to the beloved fictional town, which she described as “halfway between New Haven and our imagination,” and a character she adored, a rarity in Hollywood. \n“It was so emotional for so many reasons. You hardly ever get a chance at any point in life to appreciate the moment you’re in while you’re in it,” she said. “The fact that it was sort of the people who brought us back and we got to finish a story that we hadn’t gotten to finish and this character I love so much. I was just a freak, and I had so much appreciation. It was actually very overwhelming. I’m not a person who cries very easily, but I cried almost every day.” \nWatch the entire interview in the clip above.",

By: Blue Polar Bear 08.05.2016 @ 1:18 PM \nNearly 3 months later, and they still haven’t figured this out. Then again, how many years with no edit feature on comments, so I don’t have much confidence on them coming around to either. By: Shawskank 05.03.2016 @ 5:07 PM \nFrances Ha! and Upstream Color are the most obscenely overrated movies these past years. No one understands what Upstream Color is about so everyone just says “Hey this must be amazing since we can’t tell wtf the story is! Definitely highbrow stuff!”. Frances Ha! is boring as watching a Documentary about C-Span. Who gives a shit! Nothing happens in this movie. Literally nothing. They don’t a purpose at all. They’re just there on the screen doing nothing and no one gives a crap whether they find a meaning or direction in life because with no character development the viewer doesn’t give a rats ass!! So many better movies with the same topic are out there. The Graduate, Liberal Arts, hell Even Garden State is better than this waste of time… By: tgbusteed 09.29.2016 @ 4:21 PM \nYo, Upstream Color is not a difficult movie to follow. I think a large subsection of people dislike it because it doesn’t follow traditional narrative structure, but that’s exactly what makes it good. When a movie rewards your attention with legitimate “A-ha!” moments, then it deserves praise. It’s odd structure is exactly why it’s good. If anything, it’s underrated. That being said, if you don’t like movies that require inference and what is essentially “viewer participation,” I can see why you wouldn’t like it. But that doesn’t mean its overrated.

      "text": "Tweet \nWelcome back to our weekly Top 10 Android App Updates column, where we take a look at the most frequently upgraded apps for the week. We’ve found that one of the best ways to discover useful apps is to find the ones that are actually being updated by the developers rather than selecting the apps with the most installs. As in the past, we’re going to filter out minor updates for the super-popular apps that have over 10 million installs, but we’ll make exceptions for apps that have had significant updates. We hope you enjoy this weekly feature and that you discover some apps that end up being useful. Google Santa Tracker - Version 4.0.09 \nWhat’s new in this version : Santa and the elves’ are back for 2016 with a new game, a redesigned village, updates for Android Wear and you can follow Santa’s journey on Android TV!",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThis list is updated monthly to reflect recent availability and to showcase films currently streaming on Netflix, whether we’re talking classics or modern gems. \nNetflix offers roughly a gazillion different movies available through its streaming platform — well, approximately a gazillion. While the landmark service might become surprisingly accurate with its suggestions once you’ve been using it for a while, it’s still often tough to find something worth watching amid the trove of terrible choices.That being the case, we’ve taken the time to wade through the ridiculous amount of content in order to bring you a list of some of the best films currently available on Netflix. Planning your weekend has never been easier. New for December Animal House \nAs a wise man once said, “there’s a time and place for everything… it’s called college.” Nothing exemplifies this point more than National Lampoon’s Animal House , a 1978 film that follows the mischievous antics of the scofflaw-riddled Delta Tau Chi fraternity in cartoonish fashion. After a series of events lands the fraternity on “double-secret probation,” the ragtag crew of misfits must get their act together or risk losing their charter. The timeless classic showcases stupendous performances from the likes of John Vernon and John Belushi, along with Donald Sutherland, Tim Matheson, and others. From the derelict toga party to Belushi’s cafeteria antics, the iconic scenes just keep coming. Will Delta house make things right with the Dean, or will it set its sights on its rivals and go out in a flaming ball of glory? + Instant Queue O Brother, Where Art Thou? \nThe Coen Brothers’ sepia-toned adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey is a delightful romp through Depression-era Mississippi, one that follows three bumbling convicts — Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro), and Delmar O’Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) — who escape their chain gang and set off in search of Everett’s buried treasure. Their journey takes them across a surreal vision of the South, as they encounter several characters and events inspired by episodes in the aforementioned epic. In addition to the dusty color palette, the film makes extensive use of period-appropriate music, including blues, gospel, and bluegrass tunes. It’s safe to say that T Bone Burnett’s production has never been so on point. + Instant Queue Barry \nTold through a series of anecdotal moments dotting the college days of the 44th President of the United States, Barry is more of a coming-of-age story than Southside With You , writer-director Richard Tanne’s nostalgic journey through a day in the life of young Barack and Michelle Obama. Australian actor Devon Terrell plays the titular Barry with a surprising amount of depth and persuasion, rolling with the punches as he searches for an identity between the Columbia classroom and the Harlem projects. As he does, he juggles the privileges and the responsibilities that come with dating a white woman. Because of this, the film makes for a skillful examination of bi-racial America and cultural identity as a whole — the fact that the film is a nonfiction piece about a future president just makes it even more striking and relatable. Coming December 16 Captain America: Civil War \nThe opening salvo of the third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is, predictably, spectacular. The titular “civil war” occurs when the opinions of Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) differ regarding control of the Avengers. The two leaders recruit teams for the ensuing clash, with characters such as Spiderman and the Black Panther making their first appearances in the MCU. However, despite the film’s cacophony of special effects and adrenaline-touched sequences, it somehow manages to balance an upwards of 10 comic book characters with plenty of gusto, while presenting a throng of thought-provoking ideas in its wake. Civil War represents Marvel at it’s most entertaining, and, dare we say, mature. Too bad we can’t say the same thing for D.C.’s Batman vs. Superman.. . Coming December 25 The Rock \nWhile Michael Bay has never been known as a great director, his first feature film is a fun, restrained action flick. The Rock opens with a disgruntled general (Ed Harris) and a group of his most loyal men stealing chemical weapons and setting up a base on Alcatraz. When they demand a hefty ransom, the FBI plans a covert operation, sending chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nic Cage) to infiltrate the prison and disarm the weapons. In order to break into Alcatraz, however, he will need the help of the only man to have ever escaped the facility: John Mason (Sean Connery), a retired SAS captain. The remained of the film plays out like a buddy film, with Goodspeed and Mason getting on each other’s nerves as they try to thwart their enemies. Watching a manic Cage play off of the suave, no-nonsense Connery is just one of the film’s many delights . + Instant Queue Pirate’s Passage \nMade-for-TV movies are hit or miss. Pirate’s Passage falls in the former category, however, taking William Gilkerson’s novel of the same name and infusing it with colorful visuals, tremendous voice talent, and a fair share of adventure. The coming-of-age tale involves a 12-year-old boy from Novia Scotia and his mother, both of whom have fallen on hard times as a result of bullying and are struggling to hold on to the family inn. Things quickly change when an enigmatic sea captain (Donald Sutherland), who may or might not be a pirate who supposedly died more than 200 years ago, arrives on the scene to help out. The ensuing journey is exciting, creative, and — best of all — even somewhat enjoyable to adults.",

      "text": "Netflix crime drama “Seven Seconds” adds cast December 2, 2016 - 18:02   Regina King has booked yet another starring role. \nShe’s joining the cast of Veena Sud’s “Seven Seconds” , a crime drama slated for a 10-episode run on Netflix, Variety reports. \nIn the drama, tensions run high between African-American citizens and Caucasian cops in Jersey City, where a teenage African-American boy is critically injured by a cop. \nKing plays Latrice Butler, a devout churchgoer and a proud wife and mother. After she moved out of the projects with her family and becomes a first-time home owner, she is shaken to her core when she learns that her 15-year-old son, Brenton, has been involved an incident. When she learns that there’s more to Brenton than she and her husband were aware of, Latrice is rocked by the power of her anger at her son’s predicament — an anger that will change her life, her relationship with her husband. \nThe Emmy-winning actress (“American Crime”) joins previously announced cast members David Lyons (“Game of Silence”), Michael Mosley (“Sirens”) and Patrick Murney (“Public Morals”). \nKing is already slated to return for the third season of ABC’s “American Crime” as well as HBO’s “The Leftovers.” She’s also spent time behind the camera as well, directing “Scandal,”“The Catch” and “Greenleaf,” among others. \nKing is repped by ICM, John Carrabino Management and Del Shaw. \nSud (“The Killing”), who will serve as showrunner on the series, executive produces with Gavin O’Connor, Lawrence Bender, Kevin Brown and Alex Reznik. The show hails from Fox 21. Sud \nThe series is based on the 2013 Russian action movie, “The Major,” which was written, directed by and starring Yuri Bykov and produced by Rock Films.

      "text": "TWEET If there's one thing Chelsea Handler likes more than vodka, it's Hillary Clinton . Ever since Handler's Chelsea premiered on Netflix in May, I wondered when her Clinton praise would subside and the Donald Trump jokes would evolve into more than the occasional jab. When would Handler use her chance as Netflix's first-ever talk show host to get characteristically outspoken? Once Clinton secured the Democratic nomination, Handler urged viewers to buy into the progressive fantasy that Donald Trump had no chance at winning, which fed into the show's general light and positive air (except when it comes to addressing marriage and having children, which she skewers over and over). Then Trump won. When CNN anchor Jake Tapper appeared on the Nov. 18 episode of Chelsea , \"Inside the Trump Tower Bubble,\" he assured Handler that Trump's win will be a boon to her show — that it would be \"better than ever with Donald Trump in the White House than it would've been with Hillary Clinton in the White House.\" \"Because your voice and your opposition — that's where comedy thrives, is in opposition and speaking truth to power,\" Tapper said. \"And you're a fan of Hillary Clinton, obviously, and I think your voice will be more valuable and more powerful in opposition to the person in the White House.\" I couldn't agree more. We need Handler to use her presence on the web's most popular video streaming site to burn Trump. Chelsea Handler Source: Mark Davis/Getty Images Chelsea has suffered from what the New York Post has described as too many \"polite, pat-on-the-back exchanges.\" Instead of being her usual scathing self, Handler has thus far spent too much time inviting her friends onto the talk show and congratulating their successes. As much as I agree with Handler politically, her repeated endorsements of Clinton only added to the show's sweet and chirpy tone. \"Sweet and chirpy\" works for plenty of entertainers, but those are not the qualities I love about Handler. What I love about Handler is that she's biting, bold and honest. This is the woman whose book, My Horizontal Life , chronicled her fifty most memorable one night stands in an era when the word \" slut \" is still used pejoratively. Talking to Gwyneth Paltrow about her lifestyle kingdom isn't exactly edgy material. No wonder the show's reviews from the Hollywood Reporter , Variety , Fortune , and other outlets have been less than raving. As the New York Times points out, it \"seems just like the talk shows it says it isn't.\" Tapper's appearance on Chelsea came after the segment about Maria Shriver critiquing Handler's interviewing style, which in and of itself felt like a turning point in the show. The CNN host acknowledged that Handler would've preferred to have her candidate of choice, even if it meant not having as \"good of a show\" for the next four years. But this is an opportunity for her to thrive. \nComedy isn't supposed to be nice. As English novelist Mark Haddon told the Guardian in a 2004 interview, \"Comedy without darkness rapidly becomes trivial. And darkness without comedy rapidly becomes unbearable.\" \nTrump is selling a \"Make America Great Again\" Christmas ornament. It comes with a tiny Access Hollywood bus with Billy Bush underneath. Handler already knows that comedy thrives on the edge. She hasn't built her career on being demure or a so-called nice girl. I've been hanging onto Chelsea in the hope that the host will sharpen the unapologetic mean girl schtick I find so inspiring, especially since she is the first and only talk show host on Netflix. Of course, just because I find Handler's usual candor inspiring doesn't mean I think she is perfect, particularly when it comes to making race jokes. Like Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham, Handler is a problematic white feminist comedian. The Tumblr page Your Fave is Problematic does a fine job of documenting Handler's less-than-shining moments, like joking that she needs a new \"black lady friend\" because her last black girlfriend robbed her. Or calling a Chinese photographer Vietnamese for the sake of making a Vietnam War joke. Or saying that Persians are only good for oil and hummus. Handler herself says over and over again on Chelsea that she has much to learn. As the child of an Salvadoran immigrant, I'm somewhat reassured by her out-of-studio segments that involve visits to other countries where she asks people about their culture. They can be annoying, but at least they demonstrate effort and interest. Hopefully, that involves learning that this is her time to use Chelsea (and namely Netflix ) to hone in on Trump's misogyny. While Handler still has a lot to learn about intersectional feminism, she triumphs when it comes to using comedy as a means to observe sexism. She's all about women having the right to make choices — in sex , marriage, child-rearing and beyond. Many women can relate to these predicaments, just as many women (even those who voted for him) found Trump's pussy-grabbing remarks offensive. Handler didn't have much funny to say about Clinton because she was constantly complimenting her. She was too adoring to be critical. But Chelsea is already showing signs of improvement, with the newer \"A Day in the Life of Donald Trump\" segments that popped up on the show not long before the election. Source: Netflix/YouTube We need Handler's scathing criticism to help keep politicians like Trump in check and to keep us laughing through the hard days ahead. We need as many voices in comedy and entertainment at large to take on this challenge — especially the voices of women, people of color, immigrants, and Muslims. Add Chelsea to the chorus. Netflix has given her the platform for its first ever late-night talk show. She might as well use this opportunity and her talent as a comedian to thrive under the Trump administration.

And if you're at risk of this, especially in those last couple days of your phone plan, there's nothing that kills more than streaming videos. Fortunately, Netflix , following Amazon's example , has updated their app on Apple and Android phones and tablets to give subscribers the opportunity to watch their favorite TV shows and movies offline. \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation said in a statement . On the app there is now a download sidebar, where a mix of original and old content is available to download. Netflix gives two downloading options : standard and higher quality. Standard quality takes less time to download and also takes up less space. Higher takes more time and space. \nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. https://t.co/g7QZA3TyE8 Since announcing this service on Wednesday, Nov. 30, Netflix has said there's still more to come (the latest installment of Gilmore Girls is still not available), but until then, these are the shows available to download for the next time you're traveling on an airplane or commuting to work. \nOf Netflix's original television content, some of titles you can get offline include: Stranger Things, The Crown, House of Cards, Lady Dynamite, Narcos, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Orange is the New Black . 'Narcos' season 2 Source: Netflix Other shows available to stream include Mad Men , Breaking Bad , The Office, The Flash, The 100, Supernatural and 30 Rock . Their movie selection is equally random. Kids movies available to download include Paddington , Minions and Kung Fu Panda. Some comedies featured are Love Actually, Leap Year and Moonrise Kingdom. Dramas available to view offline include Pulp Fiction, Boyhood and Nightcrawler. Netflix has yet to announce when other shows and films can be downloaded in the future, or what they will be.
