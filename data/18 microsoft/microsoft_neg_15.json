      "text": "  \nEarlier in June, Microsoft released a new Authenticator app on Windows 10 Mobile for Windows Insider in the Fast Ring, explaining that this new app would support both Microsoft account and Azure AD accounts. The app was later released on iOS and Android back in August , but today the new Authenticator app is now available to all Windows 10 Mobile users as well. \nIn a blog post on the company’s Enterprise Mobility and Security Blog, Director of Program Management Alex Simons shared some technical details about the new release which had to be delayed to fix some bugs: \nJust like Android and iOS, the new app provides push notification approvals for both our Azure AD and Microsoft consumer accounts. For anyone currently using the app, this new version will arrive as an update. All of your accounts will seamlessly move over to the new app. \nBesides the complete redesign, there are quite a few changes under the hood as well, including tons of performance, reliability, and accessibility features. One change to note involves moving to Window’s’ latest notification service. This might prevent you from receiving the first few approval requests from outside the app. It’s only temporary, and the requests can still be easily found by opening the app. The new Microsoft Authenticator app on Windows 10 Mobile. \nThe Microsoft Authenticator app is only available on Windows 10 Mobile for now and you can get it from the download link below. Be aware that your handset will need to run the Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update to use it. In this story stream:",

      "title": "Slack CEO has been “paranoid” about Microsoft and others entering the market",
      "text": "  \nMicrosoft appears set to compete in the evolving enterprise messaging space which has some championing their presence while others may be quietly nervous about the company’s new offering. \nUnderstandably, Slack may be one of those company’s cautiously alarmed by Microsoft’s announcements of its competing messaging software, Teams. \nI’ve been paranoid about this for a long time,” Slack Chief Executive Stewart Butterfield said in an interview after the Microsoft Teams announcement. \nAccording to a report from Nasdaq writer Rachael King , Slack Technologies is bracing itself for a potentially intense competitive arena with Microsoft despite the company’s relative lead in the landscape. \nSome analysts say the market is Slack’s to lose. “Microsoft Teams put out a road map and they’re going to build out a lot of business partnerships, but right now this doesn’t take anything away from Slack,” said Mike Gotta, research vice president of Gartner Inc.” \nTo avoid becoming an also-ran company, Slack has apparently been lining up some heavy hitting partnerships to make its offering more viable in light of increased competition, not only from Microsoft but Google, Facebook, Atlassian, and Symphony Communication. Slack has been bracing for the assault. It signed a partnership last month with International Business Machines Corp., to use its Watson artificial-intelligence services.” For the past couple of years, Slack has reigned relatively unencumbered within the tech community as a bastion of hope from a business world run entirely on email, but Microsoft’s new Teams app not only offers similar functionality as Slack but caters to a larger audience still using email. Team members can can engage with bots via queries and quick actions. Slack may not be in competitive danger just yet as it reports increases in usage, up to four million daily users in October while Microsoft has yet to fully market its Team app to businesses. However, down the line, Microsoft’s Teams and Office 365 may begin to cutoff Slack’s potential growth by its bundled nature, making Teams a relatively inexpensive solution in comparison. It’ll be interesting to see how each company competing in this sector handles one another as well as its current install base as customer demand for features and integration appear set to increase.

      "title": "Despite privacy concerns, Microsoft calls Windows 10 'the most secure version of Windows'",
      "text": "Security Despite privacy concerns, Microsoft calls Windows 10 'the most secure version of Windows' Microsoft recently penned a blog post explaining some of the security updates in the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, especially dealing with protecting against ransomware. By Conner Forrest | November 14, 2016, 11:14 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/maxkabakov \nDespite a plethora of concerns around its privacy policies and default settings, Windows 10 is the \"most secure version of Windows,\" according to a recent blog post from Microsoft. The post, which was written to explain the ransomware protections in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, said that Windows 10 devices are \"58% less likely to encounter ransomware than when running Windows 7.\" \nAlthough not a new threat, ransomware seems to be ramping up lately, grabbing headlines around major attacks. According to Microsoft , the number of ransomware variants has more than doubled in the last year, and ransomware encounters have increased by 400% from December 2005 to July 2016. \nBecause of this, Microsoft decided to highlight some of the security improvements in the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, and how they protect against ransomware. For starters, it claims the browser is more secure. \nSEE: Windows 10 violates your privacy by default, here's how you can protect yourself \nMany ransomware threats come through the browser or browser plugins, the post said. So, Microsoft has improved its Microsoft Edge browser's ability to defend against ransomware. For example, the Adobe Flash plug-in now runs in an isolated container on Edge. According to the post there are \"no known zeroday exploits or exploit kits successfully targeting Microsoft Edge to date.\" \nMicrosoft email also got some machine learning upgrades that make it easier for the service to block emails that may contain ransomware links or attachments, a Microsoft white paper said. And, Microsoft also released Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection to give even more context and insight around potential attacks. More about IT Security Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter \nAnother feature that Microsoft pointed to in its post was the Block at First Sight feature in Windows Defender. This feature uses machine learning and automated analysis to help admins determine whether or not a certain file is malicious. Of course, this feature should be enabled by default, but Windows 10 has been criticized for some other default features that have caused privacy concerns among users. \nThe fact that Microsoft would dedicate time to address ransomware specifically further highlights how the threat has evolved over the past decade. Bob Gourley, co-founder of the cyber security consultancy Cognitio and former CTO of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that ransomware used to be taken lightly, but it has grown to be more troublesome. \n\"Over the last two years we have seen ransomware evolve to the point where it can come in from multiple paths, spread throughout an enterprise and backup holdings while remaining covert to standard detection, and then lock down files all at once causing an enterprise-wide crisis,\" Gourley said. \"What was once seen as a joke is now one of the most significant threats in enterprise IT.\" \nNew tools in automation and other technologies are making it easier to fight ransomware, but everyone should still be working hard on their data backup strategies, Gourley said. Additionally, network segmentation and employee training can also go a long way in helping prevent an attack. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Microsoft recently highlighted some of the security advancements in the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition that deal specifically with ransomware. Microsoft said the number of different types of ransomware have doubled over the past year and encounters are increasing as well. New technologies are helping mitigate ransomware threats, experts say, but companies should still work on data backup and employee education.

      "text": "CHANNEL: Customer Experience \nHere's another reason for Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff to be nervous about Microsoft. \nThis morning Microsoft introduced Outlook Customer Manager, a lightweight customer relationship management (CRM) solution to help companies administer their relationships directly from Outlook. \nAimed at newer and smaller businesses, the idea is to bring together tasks, meeting invites, call logs, Excel sheets, handwritten notes and other items that already live in Office 365 right next to your Outlook Inbox. Productivity Play \nPitched as a productivity play, cloud-based Outlook Customer Manager takes information gleaned from emails, meetings, calls, notes, files, tasks, deals and deadlines and presents it where and when it is easy to act. \nThis not only frees sales reps and others from the drudgery of manually entering customer data but also from needing to wade through documents and prior communications to find it. \nIf all works as promised Outlook Customer Manager will also surface reminders at the right time and provide the right information around a contact, company or deal such as deals by stage, close dates, priority and amount. \nThe result? What Microsoft calls a \"Focused\" list which is a new feature much like the Focused Inbox. Team Effort \nMicrosoft has also made it easy for team members to access customer and customer interaction data so that they can pick up the ball from where their coworkers left it. This isn’t a read-only feature, mind you, making it ideal for sales representatives who work together to bring home deals. \nOutlook Customer Manager is also available on iOS starting today. \nWhile some small business owners might be too cost conscience to spend money on a CRM app, Outlook Customer Manager is free to Office 365 Business Premium subscription holders and has begun to roll out today. It will appear as an icon in the home tab in Outlook 2016 for Windows when you get it. \n“Microsoft Outlook Customer Manager brings interaction histories and relationships to life,” Constellation Research analyst R. “Ray” Wang told CMSWire. \nIt may also keep small business owners who aren’t yet ready for Microsoft Dynamics from moving onto competing solutions, like Salesforce and Pega Systems, in the interim. \nA smart play by Microsoft.",

      "text": "Microsoft Stock Trades Ex-Dividend Tuesday (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | November 14, 2016 — 3:54 PM EST \nShares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) will begin trading ex-dividend on Tuesday, Nov. 15. To qualify for a dividend check, investors must own Microsoft shares before Tuesday, which is the day the company's management will finalize its roster of shareholders to whom it will mail payments. \nMicrosoft stock closed Friday at $50.02, up 0.55%. The shares have risen 6.38% year to date, including 15.61% returns over the past six months. This compares with a 5.9% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index ( SPX ). Microsoft stock, which has a consensus Buy rating, has risen 7.5% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 has risen 4.3%. (See also: The Trump Effect on Large Tech Multinationals .) \nIn its fiscal first quarter earnings results , reported last month, the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant beat Wall Street estimates on both earnings per share and on revenue . The company reported adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share, which beat analysts' projections by 8 cents, while revenue of $22.30 billion grew 3% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $590 million. \nLooking ahead, for the quarter ending December, Microsoft is expected to deliver earnings of 78 cents per share, which would be flat from a year ago, while revenue of $25.28 billion would mark a decline of 1.6% year over year. For the full year, ending October 2017, earnings are projected to rise 6% from $2.79 per share to $2.96, while revenue of $93.81 billion would mark a 1.9% rise from the year-ago quarter. \nBased on Friday's closing price, the company's 39-cent per share quarterly dividend yields 2.60% annually, or about 60 basis points above the 2.00% average yield of the S&P 500 index. Microsoft will send its dividend payment on Dec. 8 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 17. (See also: Microsoft Stock Caught in the Tech Downdraft .)

      "text": "(Bloomberg) — Microsoft Corp. committed to its largest wind-power purchase to date with a deal to buy 237 megawatts of capacity from projects in Wyoming and Kansas.\nAllianz Risk Transfer AG’s Bloom Wind Project in Kansas and Black Hills Corp.’s Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming will provide all of the power needed by a data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, under two long-term contracts cover, according a Microsoft blog post Monday. Terms weren’t disclosed.\nUnder a new arrangement with Black Hills’s utility in Wyoming, backup generators at the data center will be available as a secondary resource to provide power to the local grid when needed. That means the utility can avoid building a new power plant.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook to Add Fourth Building to Ft. Worth Construction Project \n“This is a small step toward a future where other customer-sited resources may help make the grid more efficient, reliable and capable of integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar,” Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in the post.\nMicrosoft’s data centers will get about 44 percent of their electricity from wind, solar and hydropower sources this year and 50 percent in two years, Smith said. The company already has deals for 20 megawatts of solar power and 285 megawatts of wind, according to the blog post.\nThe top 50 U.S. corporate buyers of solar and wind energy will add 17.4 gigawatts by 2020 and another 63.4 gigawatts by 2025 to meet their own goals, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.",

      "text": "Microsoft: Windows 10 PCs 58% less likely to encounter ransomware than Windows 7 PCs   17:23   \nWindows 7 users more frequently encounter ransomware than Windows 10 users, according to a report (PDF) from Microsoft. The software giant added security measures to Windows 10 that should protect users against ransomware and therefore Windows 10 users are better protected than Windows 7 users. \nMicrosoft has published a report on ransomware and how Windows 10 deals with it. The report shows that Windows Defender, the antivirus scanner built into Windows 10, saw a 400% increase of ransomware encounters from December last year till July this year. However, especially Windows 7 systems have a higher risk of becoming infected with ransomware. A computer running Windows 10 is 58% likely to encounter ransomware than a system running Windows 7. \n“Cyber threats won’t stop, and neither will we. As long as ransomware remains a threat, we will continue to enhance our defenses to better protect your Windows 10 devices,” Microsoft writes on its blog. \nIn the report Microsoft explains many new measures it has added to Windows 10 and its Edge browser to stop malware which includes browser hardening, machine learning and email protection.

      "text": "Reddit \nSome companies have already started their Black Friday sales, but Microsoft isn’t one of them. The company’s deals won’t be available until November 24, but they have been detailed ahead of time, giving you a chance to figure out where your money’s going.

Other models are also offered at greater discounts: Dell’s Inspiron 15, for example, will drop from $749 USD to $399 USD. \nAmazon Black Friday 2016 is already underway: Here’s what you want \nThose looking to pick up gaming items for themselves or others will find a bunch of options.

      "title": "Microsoft, Google Redefining Search Through Chatbots, Messaging",
      "text": "Google and Microsoft redefined the definition of search through messaging technology like chatbots and apps for mobile and desktop by making a case that it can reach across a brand's or retailer's Web site to find and return information on consumer queries.\n\nMessaging creates a new form of search advertising simply by returning information based on chatbot queries. Last week at the Bing Ads Next event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft demonstrated how companies like airline ticket site Skyscanner, as well as Delta Airlines in a demo, use a chatbot by pulling information from its Web site to answer questions. Microsoft also demonstrated a chatbot that serves up on bing.com in search results. A restaurant called Moksha is testing the technology in the Redmond, Washington area. \nAs consumers warm up to the idea of talk to machines, for brands, agencies and developers integrating the data from chatbots becomes one of the biggest challenges. The disparate systems do not communicate with each other. Apple focuses on Siri, Google on Allo, and Microsoft on Cortana. This next step — not too far into the future — will play out similar to the integration of advertising channels such as mobile, desktop and television. \nNearly one-third of consumers —28.9% — prefer to use a chatbot rather than the 29% who prefer to pick up the phone or the 27% who prefer to email when interacting with retailers, according to [24]7, a provider of chatbot and human agent assistance for retailers, released Monday.\nBreak down the numbers in the study — A Retailer's Guide to Chatbots, Live Chat and Messaging — and Millennials lead when it comes to adopting chat technology — chatbots and apps. Some 37% of survey respondents ages 18 to 34 rank chat as their favorite way to contact companies when making a purchase, with 30% choosing online chat and 7% selecting messaging apps.\nOverall, 39% of consumers are open to interacting with a chatbot in a retail scenario, but when the study broke that down by demographics, it found that only 9% of Millennials prefer to always interact with a chatbot compared with a human. Millennials, 40%, prefer use a messaging app.\nSurprisingly, the ability to chat online or through a mobile device has surpassed the use of using a phone and sending an email as the most popular way for consumers to interact with retailers, according to the [24]7 study.\nWhile customer services seems the most popular use for online chat applications such as messaging and chatbots, a study from Support.com found a home for the technology in tech support.\nIt turns out that millennials are 75% more comfortable using chatbots, compared with baby boomers, when it comes to tech support. Millennials also are 138% more likely than baby boomers to think chatbots are better because they can respond faster than a live agent.\nAbout 60% know when they’re interacting with a machine for tech support and they are not comfortable with it, with 71% of baby boomers and 65% of women agreeing. \nNot all believe chatbots improve tech support. In fact 81% don’t think chatbots improve tech support interactions or respond faster than a live agent, according to the Support.com study.\nThe survey of 2,000 consumers reveals expectations for more personalized and automated technology support in the near future. The study focuses on technical support, but through the numbers marketers can clearly see how consumers think about chatbots.\nBrands planning to implement a chatbot to support consumers online, will have a lot of things to contemplate. Humanizing technology through virtual assistants and chatbots won't work for all strategies. It will depend on the company's customer base.\nPrivacy will become one of the biggest issues brands will need to consider when implement a chatbot.\nSome consumers are reluctant to share personal information this way. Companies will need to test the waters before they fully jump in.",

      "text": "Small businesses now get CRM tool with their Office subscription Microsoft launched a tool for Outlook that helps manage customer relationships More good reads Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | November 14, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Microsoft \nSmall businesses that need a tool to track their relationships with customers now have a new weapon from Microsoft in their arsenal. \nOn Monday, the company launched Outlook Customer Manager, a lightweight customer relationship management (CRM) system. It allows users to track their customers, manage deals in progress, track tasks and more, all from their Outlook email client. \nThe launch builds on Microsoft's ongoing push to capture the small business market. Earlier this year, the company launched Bookings, a service designed to help service-focused businesses manage customer appointments. \nIt's a move by Microsoft to further compete with Salesforce and other players in the cloud CRM space. Companies that already have an Office 365 Business Premium subscription may not want to choose one of the competing CRM systems, if they can get OCM for free. \nAs the needs of those businesses grow, they may be more likely to turn to Microsoft's Dynamics 365 cloud CRM system. OCM gives users a path to migrate to the more powerful service when their needs become more complex. Microsoft \nOutlook Customer Manager provides users with information about their customers right inside Microsoft's email client. \nOCM takes a few forms inside Outlook on the desktop. First, users can pull up customer records alongside their emails so it's possible to track the history of a customer's account, what tasks are associated with them, and what appointments they have scheduled. \nThere's also another screen where users can see a list of all the customers they have, and then drill down into individual accounts, similar to a traditional CRM system. Microsoft \nOutlook Customer Manager lets users see a list of customers at a glance. \nIn addition to working inside Outlook, OCM also has an iOS app that people can use to access the system on the go. In the future, Microsoft says that it plans to bring the app to other mobile platforms. \nThe service will roll out first to Office 365 Business Premium customers who are part of Microsoft's First Release track. The company expects that it will be available to everyone with a Business Premium plan in the coming months, and Microsoft is also working to make it available for Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 customers as well.

      "title": "Kaspersky Asserts Windows Defender Blocking Competing Antivirus Apps",
      "text": "Founder of security firm thinks that Microsoft is blocking security vendors from Window 10 Eugene Kaspersky, founder of security vendor Kaspersky Lab isn't happy with Microsoft's business practices and he wants the whole world to know about it. In a scathing public post, Kaspersky alleges that Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system makes it more difficult for his firm's antivirus software to be used by customers. Kaspersky's claims are not falling on deaf ears either, as the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation is now investigating the situation for any potential wrongdoing. \"Since Microsoft itself develops antivirus software—Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for Microsoft in the software market,\" Anatoly Golomolzin, Deputy Head of FAS stated . \"Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market.\" Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment from eWEEK by press time. A Kaspersky Lab spokesperson did not directly respond to a question from eWEEK about what, if any response the firm has yet received from Microsoft about its complaint. The spokesperson only noted that the press will need to wait for a response from Microsoft.Other antivirus vendors have remained largely quiet as well, eWEEK reached out to multiple antivirus vendors including Comodo, Trend Micro, Avast and Symantec and did not get any comments back by before this story was published. Kaspersky Lab's spokesperson noted that the company is not excluding the possibility of potentially working with other antivirus vendors in attempting to force concessions from Microsoft to make its system more open for the antivirus vendors.The core of Kaspersky's complaint is relatively simple, he just wants consumers to have the ability to choose which antivirus software they want to run, without Microsoft pulling the rug out from under users. According to Kaspersky Lab, it wants to prohibit Microsoft from switching on its Windows Defender software by default without the explicit consent of the user. Windows Defender is Microsoft's antivirus technology and first became publicly available as a free download for Windows XP in 2005. Over the years, Windows Defender has become a more capable product than its initial version and is now directly integrated with Windows 10. \"When a user migrates to Windows 10, and the current version of their antivirus software is not compatible with this operating system, the user is not informed in advance of the need to install a compatible version,\" Kaspersky Lab stated in a press release. \"Instead, without the explicit consent of the user, the antivirus software is removed and Windows Defender is switched on by default.\" Kaspersky Lab wants Microsoft to inform users, prior to updating to Windows 10, that third-party antivirus technologies need to be updated to versions that are compatible with Windows 10. Additionally, Kaspersky Lab isn't happy that Microsoft now only provides security vendors with new Windows 10 builds several days before a release, which doesn't provide enough time for antivirus vendors to make adjustments. According to Kaspersky Lab, Microsoft used to provide two months lead time for changes with Windows 7 and 8. The security vendor would like to see Microsoft provide at least two week lead time before a new Windows 10 build. \"We think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own product,\" Eugene Kaspersky alleged in his blog post. \"The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyber-attacks.\" Kaspersky notes that his company has had a long-term successful partnership with Microsoft, but only decided on going public about the issue after direct negotiations didn't yield positive results. After being in market for a decade with Windows Defender, it's actually somewhat surprising that it has taken this long for an antivirus vendor to complain about anti-competitive behavior. The challenge now is that Windows Defender wasn't always directly integrated and Microsoft didn't used to force users to take some action to avoid accepting Defender as the default antivirus app on their desktop. In some respects, the claims made by Kaspersky are reminiscent of claims about browser bundling made by Netscape and others back in 2003. Microsoft ended up settling with AOL, for $750 million in 2003 over the browser issues, though in Europe the issue was handled a bit differently. Microsoft since 2007 has had to provide its users in Europe with a browser choice screen, as part of any new Windows installation. The same kind of choice screen has not been an issue for antivirus software although this could come under discussion by regulators in Europe or the U.S. in the years ahead.   @TechJournalist",

      "text": "last » \nKaspersky Lab is taking aim at Microsoft, alleging the software vendor is edging out competitors in ways that violate antitrust laws with its latest Windows 10 update. \nKaspersky alleged that it was only given one week to make its software compatible with the latest security updates to Windows 10. The Moscow-based company said that included automatically deactivating all other anti-virus software and replacing it with Windows Defender anti-virus, limiting the number of anti-virus companies on a PC to one (other than Defender), as well as urging customers to replace compatible anti-virus alternatives with Windows Defender. Kaspersky alleged Microsoft is also limiting the ways for anti-virus companies to alert customers when renewals are due. \nMicrosoft, Redmond, Wash., did not respond to requests for comment. \n[Related: Here's Who Made Gartner's 2016 Magic Quadrant For Endpoint Protection Platforms ] \nIn a blog post late last week, Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky said he used to respect Microsoft's efforts to increase the security of its operating system, but the recent moves by the company have \"left me very disappointed and dismayed.\" He said the changes make it clear that Microsoft's previous steps around security and overhauling of its operating system were part of a move to squeeze out independent software vendors. \n\"The trend is clear: Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose,\" Kaspersky said in the blog post. \"In doing so, Microsoft is acting against the interests of users since a lot of its products are of inferior quality.\" \nOn Friday, the Russian antitrust authority opened an investigation into the issue, saying it will look into whether Microsoft violated country laws that prohibit companies from using their market position to prevent competitors from operating against them. In a statement about the investigation, Deputy Head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service Anatoly Golomolzin said the agency is looking into whether Microsoft's actions lead to an \"unreasonable advantage\" for the vendor. \n\"Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market,\" Golomolzin said in a statement. Kaspersky said he has also urged the European Union to take action. \nKaspersky said he is pushing for Russia and the European Union to require Microsoft to provide updates to software developers well in advance of their release, inform users of incompatible software before updates, and ask users for permission before enabling Windows Defender. \n\"Diversity of an open ecosystem is an essential condition of its security. Competition gives rise to new ideas; technologies get polished, infrastructure gets developed, and all-round security gets raised,\" Kaspersky said in his blog post. \"I hope we can find a resolution to this issue. I hope that we can work together with Microsoft not only for the benefit of the independent development community, but also – and more importantly – for those who trust us to protect them in the evolving threat landscape. Our companies need to be fighting cybercriminals together instead of fighting each other, and I have hope that this is still possible,\" he continued. Pages",

      "text": "Microsoft exec says Xbox Scorpio will deliver 'true 4K' 14 Written By David Craddock All new first-party games will run at native 4K resolution on Scorpio, due out next year. \nXbox Scorpio, Microsoft's planned Xbox One upgrade to counter Sony's PS4 Pro, isn't due to ship until holiday 2017, but company executives believe it will one-up Sony in at least one key way: true 4K resolution. \nAaron Greenberg, head of Xbox Games marketing, touted the Scorpio's hardware at this weekend's Xbox FanFest held in Mexico City (via GameSpot ). \n\"This will really bring the most powerful console you've ever seen,\" Greenberg said. \"It will bring these really true 4K, really incredible visual games that we've never seen before on the console.\" \nGreenberg claimed that PC gamers spend thousands of dollars on their rigs to get a true-4K experience. Xbox Scorpio aims to minimize that investment and transplant it into the living room. \"That's a big part of what Project Scorpio is about,\" he said. \nIt will be up to publishers to decide if Xbox One games will support native 4K resolution. You can expect first-party games released within and after Scorpio's launch window to take advantage, Microsoft Studios publishing general manager Shannon Loftis told USA Today earlier this fall. \nPS4 Pro runs many games such as Skyrim Special Edition in native 4K, but some games run slower at that level of fidelity than they do on standard PS4 consoles connected to 1080p HDTVs. If Xbox Scorpio is as powerful as Microsoft claims, it should be able to offer a more consistent visual experience. \nScorpio has plans to edge out PS4 Pro, which launched last week for $399, in other areas. Somewhat surprisingly, the Pro does not include a 4K Blu-Ray drive despite Sony being one of the chief architects of Blu-Ray technology. Meanwhile, Microsoft packaged this fall's Xbox One S with a 4K Blu-Ray player; it stands to reason that Scorpio will feature one as well. David Craddock Contributing Editor \nDavid L.

      "text": "TOP 5326933 \nTech giant Microsoft announced Monday that it has signed a deal to power its American data centers with wind energy, despite the inherent unreliability of the technology. \nThe tech company announced two new contracts representing 237 megawatts of wind power generating capacity, backed up by several natural gas generators to compensate for the unreliability. Microsoft did not disclose the amount of money they spent purchasing the wind power or the natural gas backup. \n“These agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our data centers,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in the company statement . \nMicrosoft isn’t the first tech company to purchase large amounts of wind power. Google made a similar purchase back in 2013 , but didn’t end up actually using any of the energy because it wasn’t reliable enough to power their servers . \nExperts believe that the ability of an electrical grid to absorb unreliable green energy becomes increasingly more difficult at scale . \nFor example, South Australia’s reliance on wind power makes blackouts more likely because the amount of electricity generated by a wind turbine is very intermittent and doesn’t coincide with the times of day when power is most needed . This poses an enormous safety challenge to grid operators and makes power grids more fragile .",

      "title": "Suspense Over Visual Studio For Mac",
      "text": "Suspense Over Visual Studio For Mac Written by Kay Ewbank Monday, 14 November 2016 \nA Microsoft blog post has appeared, announcing Visual Studio's forthcoming availability for the Mac. \nBefore you get too excited, the post then promptly disappeared, and the details of what was actually being offered wasn't really Visual Studio. \nThe original post Introducing Visual Studio for the Mac was made by Microsoft’s Mikayla Hutchinson, who came into the company when Microsoft bought Xamarin earlier this year. \nHutchinson said: \"At Connect(); in November, Microsoft is launching a preview of Visual Studio for Mac. This is an exciting development, evolving the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio IDE into a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#, and bringing the Visual Studio development experience to the Mac.\" \nThis all sounds good, but the article continued with more details that made it obvious that things were a little more complicated. If Visual Studio were to be made fully available on the Mac, it would involve significant re-writing the entire UI as Visual Studio on Windows uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) as its UI. \nWhat the article seems to indicate is that what Microsoft will apparently call Visual Studio for the Mac is in fact a revamped version of Xamarin Studio, which Microsoft acquired when it bought Xamarin. Studio started life as a cross-platform IDE, and became Mac specific. \nIn the article, Hutchinson says that: \"At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. Below the surface, Visual Studio for Mac also has a lot in common with its siblings in the Visual Studio family. Its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. Compatibility is a key focus of Visual Studio for Mac. Although it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format.\" \nSo essentially Xamarin Studio has been reworked to look more like Visual Studio, and it now uses MSBuild so you can share projects. \nThe IDE has been made to look quite similar, with a central tabbed source editor with a number of other docked windows or “pads” around it, such as Solution, Output, Properties, Document Outline and Toolbox. Hutchinson said that: \"Like Visual Studio, this layout is highly customizable and switches automatically, depending on whether you’re coding, debugging or using the drag-and-drop designer.\" \nThat's not quite the same as Visual Studio for the Mac, though, is it. \nAdding to the confusion, the post was later removed, though it seems likely that the removal is temporary so as not to take the attention away from the actual launch. This looks as though it will happen on Wednesday at Microsoft Connect, as James Montemagno, Principal Program Manager of Xamarin at Microsoft, tweeted \"I'm going to be on stage showing off amazing things at # MSFTConnect on Wed.

Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 9:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nSmall businesses that need a tool to track their relationships with customers now have a new weapon from Microsoft in their arsenal. \nOn Monday, the company launched Outlook Customer Manager, a lightweight customer relationship management (CRM) system. It allows users to track their customers, manage deals in progress, track tasks and more, all from their Outlook email client. \nThe launch builds on Microsoft's ongoing push to capture the small business market. Earlier this year, the company launched Bookings, a service designed to help service-focused businesses manage customer appointments. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 3D printing will transform these five industries \nIt's a move by Microsoft to further compete with Salesforce and other players in the cloud CRM space. Companies that already have an Office 365 Business Premium subscription may not want to choose one of the competing CRM systems, if they can get OCM for free. \nAs the needs of those businesses grow, they may be more likely to turn to Microsoft's Dynamics 365 cloud CRM system. OCM gives users a path to migrate to the more powerful service when their needs become more complex. Microsoft \nOutlook Customer Manager provides users with information about their customers right inside Microsoft's email client. \nOCM takes a few forms inside Outlook on the desktop. First, users can pull up customer records alongside their emails so it's possible to track the history of a customer's account, what tasks are associated with them, and what appointments they have scheduled. \nThere's also another screen where users can see a list of all the customers they have, and then drill down into individual accounts, similar to a traditional CRM system. Microsoft \nOutlook Customer Manager lets users see a list of customers at a glance. \nIn addition to working inside Outlook, OCM also has an iOS app that people can use to access the system on the go. In the future, Microsoft says that it plans to bring the app to other mobile platforms. \nThe service will roll out first to Office 365 Business Premium customers who are part of Microsoft's First Release track. The company expects that it will be available to everyone with a Business Premium plan in the coming months, and Microsoft is also working to make it available for Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 customers as well.

      "text": "The Russian antitrust agency has started investigating Microsoft after a complaint from rival antivirus software company Kaspersky Lab. The government agency will investigate Microsoft's anticompetitive behavior in the country. ( David Ramos | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nKaspersky Lab, an international antivirus software and cybersecurity provider based in Russia, has accused Microsoft of anticompetitive practices. Russian authorities have started an investigation after Kaspersky's complaint. Why Is Microsoft Accused Of Anticompetitive Behavior? \nEugene Kaspersky, the cofounder and CEO of Kaspersky Labs, claims that Microsoft bundled its antivirus software Windows Defender with Windows 10 , which is an anticompetitive behavior. \nKaspersky added that Microsoft has significantly reduced the time period given to independent developers to adapt their antivirus software for the company's latest operating system - Windows 10 - from two months to just six days. This has resulted in many security apps to be flagged as incompatible and then replaced with Microsoft's own Windows Defender. \nThe Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service is investigating the allegations from Kaspersky. The FAS explains that Microsoft may have violated Part 1, Article 10 of the Federal Law, which regulates protection of competition. \nKaspersky claims that Microsoft used its dominant market position to restrict and eliminate competition. Investigation By The FAS \nRussian authorities say that they want to offer equal opportunities to all companies doing business in the country. \n\"Since Microsoft itself develops antivirus software — Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for Microsoft on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market,\" says Anatoly Golomolzin, FAS deputy head. Microsoft Facing Other Problems With Russian Government \nThe latest investigation started by Russian agencies is not the only problem that Microsoft is facing in Russia. \nIn June 2016, Microsoft announced that it is acquiring LinkedIn, a social networking website for professionals. However, LinkedIn will be blocked in Russia as a local court has ruled that the service breaches the country's data protection rules. The ruling came after LinkedIn failed to shift data of users on Russian servers to comply with the country's laws. \nRussia's president, Vladimir Putin, is also making a move to push off various foreign software providers from the country. The government sees Microsoft as a major threat as Putin believes that some Microsoft products like Office and Windows can be potentially used by governments of other countries to spy on Russia. \nMicrosoft is facing difficult times in Russia. The Kaspersky complaint is an addition to Microsoft's woes in the country and if found guilty, Microsoft may to pay huge fines to Russian antitrust agencies. \nMicrosoft has not issued any statement on Kaspersky's allegations but it is likely that the company will release its official stance over the allegations.

      "title": "Surface Book vs. MacBook Pro 2016: Can The Updated Microsoft Laptop Give The New MacBook A Run For Its Money?",
      "text": "Microsoft launched the Surface Book i7 a day before Apple unveiled the MacBook Pro 2016 lineup. With specs for both laptops closely similar to one another, which laptop is the better option? ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nThere is no denying Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for at least the past three decades. This year is no exception: both companies revealed their new flagship laptops just a few hours apart, with the hope of tempting customers away from the other. \nMicrosoft unveiled the Surface Book i7, a revamped version from last year's flexible laptop with a funny hinge , on Oct. 26. Representing Apple, on the other hand, is the latest MacBook Pro variant complete with a new Touch Bar display right above the keyboard. \nBut which is the better option? Design \nMicrosoft has not changed the physical appearance of the Surface Book i7 model. It still has the matte gray color and dynamic hinge, a spring-like system that folds into itself, leaving a noticeable gap between screen and keyboard when closing the laptop, in which the tech giant takes pride. \nMore importantly, users can completely detach the screen from the keyboard, leaving a 13.5-inch tablet to use, something that the MacBook Pro 2016 does not offer. \nMeanwhile, Apple slimmed and lightened the MacBook Pro 2016 and added a new Touch Bar feature above the keyboard that changes the controls it shows according to the application currently in use. \nFor example, bookmarks and favorites appear when opening the Safari browser, while editing tools show up when viewing photos. It can also display emoji suggestions or predicted words when typing out sentences. \nIn terms of size, the MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch or 15-inch variants whereas the Surface Book i7 only has the 13.3-inch model. As for the resolution, the former can render up to 2,880 x 1,800 pixels while the latter has 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. Specs and Battery Life \nBoth laptops use Intel's latest 6th generation i7 and i5 chipsets. Both devices use SSD drives and dedicated graphics cards for gaming and video rendering: NVIDIA GTX 965M for Microsoft and Radeon Pro 455 for Apple. In fact, both devices are so alike that it is difficult to exactly pinpoint which performs better straight out. \nOne thing the Surface Book i7 has an advantage over the MacBook Pro is battery life: the former reportedly lasts up to 16 hours while the latter only promises 10 hours of laptop usage . Price \nTo put it mildly, pricing for both laptops is quite expensive. The entry level Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar display costs $1,799 while the 15-inch variant costs $2,399. A 13-inch MacBook Pro sans the feature retails for $1,499. \nMicrosoft's Surface Book i7 starts at $1,899 for the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage option, while the higher 16 GB RAM and 1 TB variant retails for a whopping $2,999 thanks to a $200 discount. Conclusion \nMicrosoft clearly edges out Apple in terms of pricing. As regards specs too, it would appear that the Surface Book i7 is slightly better with its superior battery life and screen resolution than the MacBook Pro 2016. \nOf course, there are other things to consider such as software, operating system, and compatibility with other devices. Apple's MacBook Pro would work better with an iPhone or iPad. For those who want more customizability and compatibility options, Microsoft's Surface Book i7 could be a better choice.  ",

      "text": "Home » Design » Hands-On Review of the Microsoft Surface Studio Hands-On Review of the Microsoft Surface Studio The New Microsoft Surface Studio. A New Solution for Creatives? 0 Comments \nRecently Microsoft announced their latest pieces of hardware for the Surface product line: an all-in-one desktop called the Surface Studio and an accessory called the Surface Dial, as well as an update to the Surface Book laptop. \nWhile at Adobe MAX, I had the opportunity to get a hands-on experience with the Microsoft Surface Studio and was really impressed with it across the board. You can see my thoughts on it and a real demonstration here . First Impressions of the Microsoft Surface Studio \nAs someone who has used both Apple and Microsoft products the majority of their life and career, I approached this without any major bias. I honestly believe that for creatives the operating system choice between Windows and MacOS stopped being truly relevant for most people with the introduction of Adobe Creative Cloud. \nThinking about the way I’ve used my iMac in combination with a Wacom tablet, I found the Surface Studio eliminated some key issues: it consolidated space and provided me with more options. \nDrawing and working within Photoshop with the Surface Studio felt natural and very comfortable. The design and aesthetic were great, and the functionality and flexibility of the product were even better. I could use it as a powerful large screen workstation or as an art media for photo retouching, digital painting, animation or design. \nThe computer components of the Surface Studio rest in the base of the machine rather than behind the screen, allowing it to have an even thinner display than the iMac. It supports up to 32GB of RAM, dedicated GPU, an SSD and HDD for storage, and USB 3.1 connections rather than USB C. Tilt functionality is supported by what Microsoft calls a “Zero Gravity Hinge.” This allows the display to have the greatest range of tilt ever offered in an all-in-one computer. The base price starts at $2999.99. Who is the Microsoft Surface Studio Really For? \nMany think that this product is an “Apple Killer.” I disagree. I also don’t believe this product is only for digital artist and enthusiast. You have to understand the current product philosophy of Apple. While the company was built on the patronage of creative professionals (like many of you reading this), it has shifted its focus over the past decade towards mainstream audiences. In the process, Apple has left creative professionals behind in many regards, and disregarded our needs and the way we work. If you need specific evidence, Exhibit A is the 2016 Macbook Pro, which lacks basic necessities like the SD card slot used by photographers and filmmakers. \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro (and the Surface product line as a whole) is geared towards working creatives in the professional arena, or those making a significant profit from their creative interests. As someone who edits and produces videos on a weekly basis, I thought about the use cases for the Surface Studio. It occurs to me that I could do masking and composite work in videos and animation much easier with this tool, and I could see many people applying in that way. As a photographer, I already have a retouching workflow that is heavily influenced by the use of a tablet, having the ability to work directly on the screen is ideal and natural for me. Obviously, designers, animators, and 3D modelers could benefit from using a product like this as well, and Microsoft is introducing its own software to help creative professionals at the entry level. The Surace Dial Accessory \nThe Microsoft Surface Dial is an accessory sold separately from the Surface Studio that can add to the experience of any Surface product, including the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. When placed directly on the screen of the Surface Studio, the MS Surface Dial gives you more options when working within certain applications. It also works when placed off screen as well. Note that on-screen functionality is not currently supported with other Surface products. Final Thoughts on the Surface Studio \nOverall, the Surface Studio is a fascinating and innovative piece of technology for creatives—and an attractive alternative to Apple products. The largest barrier to adoption for Microsoft Surface products will be getting creatives used to Mac OS to let go of their attachment to the operating system they are so familiar with. \nThe Surface Studio is not for entry-level creatives. This is a product aimed at (and priced for) the professional market. Microsoft has done their homework in crafting hardware that turns creative work into an opportunity to play with something very cool, while still delivering the performance and features that professionals need.

      "text": "Internet Explorer (10.1%) Edge (3.0%) \nThe bottom one is Microsoft’s new miracle browser that people refuse to use. And IE has dropped to 4th place with a 10% share. A few years ago, well, many years ago, before the arrival of Chrome, IE was the number one browser, having crushed Netscape during the First Browser War (being bundled with Windows did the trick). \nAccording to Net Market Share , Edge 12, 13, and 14 combined have a market share of 5.2%. Everyone has slightly different market-share numbers. But at that level – whether it’s 3% or 5% doesn’t matter – Edge is an also-ran, something statistically insignificant, abandoned by burned-out IE users. \nSo Microsoft appears to go to extremes to force Windows users who still cling to their IEs to upgrade to Windows 10 and switch to Edge. \nIt had already gone to extremes to get Windows 7 users – a reasonably happy crowd, unlike the Windows 8 crowd – to upgrade for “free” to Windows 10. The inescapable desktop harassment-and-interdiction campaigns from Microsoft finally stopped a few months ago, and Windows 7 users could go about their business unmolested. The survivors all knew: If someone is trying to push you that hard to “upgrade” to a “free” program that took years and thousands of people to put together, it’s a sign that you are the product, and you’re going to get sold . \nBut when Microsoft threw in the towel on its Windows 10 harassment-and-interdiction campaign, at about that time, IE, never particularly stable, became very unstable. And it has gotten worse since. \nI use Chrome, Firefox, and IE all day long, in Private Browsing mode, doing different things with different browsers, on two different computers, to make it confusing for internet tracking programs to collect my browsing and personal data. I want someone else to be the low-hanging fruit. \nAnd IE has been driving me nuts recently. So here is what I got today, over the course of about two hours, I took screenshots to show how terrible IE has become. \nThe first warning sign: the fan from the laptop starts whirring maniacally because the processor is busy running around in circles, and it’s generating heat. Soon, Norton opens a popup at the lower right-hand corner of the screen, warning, “High Memory Usage by: Internet Explorer”: \nA little later, I got this message across the bottom of the screen (I took out the blank middle part, indicated by the red line, to make it fit the column width here): \nBy now I have a bunch of tabs open. The machine is slowing to a crawl. The processor is running in circles and doesn’t have time for much else. After a while, when I try to open a new tab, IE informs me that it is “not responding.” \nI soldier on, determined to take this to the bitter end. Soon this box pops up: \nI click “Restart the program.” It shuts down an offending page and tries to reopen it which doesn’t work either, and the same box pops up. So I close that particular page directly and move on. Things are getting worse. The cursor is starting to dance around, and it’s difficult to maneuver it to the right spots. Taking a screenshot and pasting it into Paint requires enormous patience. \nTo see what’s going on, I open the Windows Task Manager. It shows that processor usage is 100%, when normally, with what I do, it should be under 10%. And the system uses 89% of the Physical Memory: \nThis is becoming a battle. Progress is at snail’s pace. Hardly anything moves. The bitter end is nigh. I can smell it. Not much later, it’s coming. IE hangs up. Links don’t work anymore. The scrollbar is dead. Switching tabs is impossible. I try to close IE, but can’t. So I return to Windows Task Manager to close IE that way. This all too familiar sign pops up. \nOnce IE is shut down, the fan stops whirring, things speed up, the cursor moves normally. The battle is over. \nFor current and former IE users, it’s easy to explain why the number of Edge users is still low. Edge may be great. But why even try? Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers beckon. And the above frustrations – which heavy IE users encounter on a daily basis – are leaving their marks. But apparently, Microsoft has trouble digesting the message. Instead, it seems to hound its surviving IE users by crashing their work in order to push them to upgrade to another Microsoft browser. But the market-share data shows that something in this twisted math doesn’t quite seem to work. 3 views Previous story Obama Continues To Send Tanks and Troops To Russian Border, Trump Avoids WW3 And Liberals Have Meltdown Over Phone Call \nFollow: It only takes a few moments to share an article, but the person on the other end who reads it might have his life changed forever Subscribe to our newsletter Please wait...

      "text": "Researchers Break MarsJoke Ransomware Encryption October 3, 2016 , 5:00 am \nOther anti-ransomware hardening includes applying a machine-learning infrastructure and cloud-based approach for identifying, classifying and protecting against specific ransomware attacks in seconds rather than hours, according to Microsoft. \n“The ways attackers are executing attacks are becoming more complex, and the results of the attack are becoming increasingly costly to its victims,” Microsoft wrote in its report. In fact, it’s fair to say, 2016 has been a devastating year for many individuals and companies stung by ransomware. \nBetween April 2015 and March 2016 the number of users hit by ransomware rose 17.7 percent worldwide compared to the prior year, according to Kaspersky Lab . Incidents of encryption-based ransomware that locks up data on a PC has risen five-fold over the past year jumping from 6.6 percent in 2014/2015 to 31 percent the preceding year. \nMicrosoft says it has bolstered Windows 10 to reflect those changing tactics of criminals. The company, in a push to get customers to upgrade, says its Windows 10 Anniversary Edition users are 58 percent less likely to encounter ransomware than when running Windows 7. \nWindows 7 is still the dominant version of Microsoft’s OS in use today with 48 percent market share compared to Windows 10 with 22 percent, according to the most recent data available from Net Market Share . Windows 8 is the third most popular Windows OS in use with 8.4 market share followed closely by Windows XP with 8.2 percent. \nMuch of Microsoft’s anti-ransomware hardening centers on its Edge browser defenses. Microsoft said that between January and July, six of the top 10 ransomware threats used email and browser exploits, or browser-plug-in related exploits, with the remaining four using browser exploits. \nTo that end, in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Adobe’s Flash Player is isolated when running in the Edge browser and has its own dedicated application container. In addition to container management, Microsoft adds new kernel protection to Windows 10 Anniversary Update that limits the ways in which system calls can be used by Microsoft Edge, according to Microsoft. \n“If a malware author attempts using a vulnerable system call to escape the browser’s sandbox and download and install ransomware in a way that does not fit within these new restrictions, Microsoft Edge will block the system call, preventing the attack,” Microsoft said. \nPart of Microsoft’s anti-ransomware security also includes a combination of human and machine learning to protect against malware. On one hand, Microsoft bolsters its Edge browser with its SmartScreen Filter (introduced with Internet Explorer 8). It’s SmartScreen Filter roughly competes with Google’s Safe Browsing initiative in that they both use a human and machine-generated URL blacklists to block users from visiting unsafe sites. \nOver the past six months, Microsoft says it has also been leveraging its machine-learning technology and cloud-based automatic sample submission features in Windows Defender to help block ransomware from inboxes. Using both can block previously unidentified malware, Microsoft says. “Definition updates can take hours to prepare and deliver; our cloud service delivers this protection in seconds,” Microsoft said. \nAs part of Windows Anniversary Edition the company introduced Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), a new service that gives remote security staff members a shared dashboard to view security events and alerts in their network and mitigate remote threats. \nDespite ransomware victories, such as CrySis being neutralized via the release of master decryption keys , the threat of ransomware persists with most strains targeting Windows users. In August, ransomware called Fantom was discovered masquerading as a fake critical Windows update. Last summer, shortly after Windows 10 was released , attackers began launching spam and phishing email campaigns around the operating system. Victims received messages claiming users could upgrade to Windows 10 for free. Those who downloaded the malicious .zip archive were ultimately hit with CTB-Locker ransomware and had their files encrypted.",

      "text": "Reddit \nMicrosoft recently announced plans to launch Visual Studio for Mac, something it revealed in a blog post that was deleted a short while after it went live. Though the announcement appears to have been made prematurely, all the details are now public and it seems the preview will arrive during the company’s Connect developer event. Once it does, the days of Mac users having to use a Windows or virtual machine to run the software will officially end. \nThough the original blog post has been deleted, the Internet never forgets and you can see the post yourself via this cached version. Microsoft included numerous screenshots of the software, one of which is below, while explaining that the Mac version won’t be far removed from the Windows version. \n“At its heart,” Microsoft said, “Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio.” The Mac version’s user experience has been designed in such a way that it will ‘look and feel’ like a native macOS application, but with the same undertones you’ll find in the Windows version. And, of course, there’s still Visual Studio Code as a more lightweight option. \nMicrosoft says you won’t have to convert or migrate products if you switch between Windows and Mac machines, and you’ll be able to ‘seamlessly share’ your projects from the macOS version to other users who run the Windows version. The preview version of the software will support C# and F# with the same F# compiler found in VS for Windows. Once the software is officially unveiled, you’ll be able to download the macOS preview from VisualStudio.com.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Announces Biggest-Ever Wind Energy Buy \nMicrosoft on Monday said it has inked its biggest deals yet to acquire renewable wind energy to power its massive U.S. data centers. \nIts two new contracts represent 237 megawatts of generating capacity, bringing Microsoft’s wind power total in the United States to more than 500 megawatts, the company said. Megawatt (or 1000 kilwatts) is a standard measurement of electricity production. \nMicrosoft msft signed with insurance organization Allianz Risk Transfer to acquire energy from a new 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas. The deal “fixes” its contracted energy costs over a long-term agreement. Second, it inked a long-term contract with Black Hills Energy to buy 59 megawatts of energy “certificates” related to two wind projects near Microsoft’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center site. The combined output of those two sites should produce enough energy per year to supply its Cheyenne facility with all the energy it needs, Microsoft said. Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nCloud computing, despite its ethereal name, depends on lots of power-slurping data centers. That’s why companies like Facebook fb , Amazon amzn , Google goog , Salesforce.com crm , and Microsoft like to find—and publicize—clean or renewable energy sources. A few weeks ago, Amazon Web Services announced plans for a 189-megawatt wind power farm in Ohio slated to come online in December 2017. \nMicrosoft and Black Hills Energy have worked out a new tariff that will enable the energy company to, as needs dictate, use the local data center’s backup generators, thereby eliminating the need for Black Hills Energy to construct a new power plant. \n“These agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our data centers,” Microsoft president Brad Smith said in the company statement announcing the latest deals. Amazon to buy wind power from North Carolina facility \nMicrosoft said it has already contracted with the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas and signed a pact with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy to bring 20 megawatts of solar energy onto the grid in Virginia. For more on renewable energy, watch \nThe two Wyoming projects are operational. The Bloom site is under construction and expected to come online in July, 2017, according to a Microsoft spokeswoman. \nNote: This story was updated to reflect when the power from these sites will be available.",

      "title": "Kaspersky: Windows-bundled Defender is anticompetitive, Russia opens antitrust probe",
      "text": "Comments \nAfter Eugene Kaspersky, the founder of Kaspersky Lab, ripped into Microsoft for anticompetitive behavior in Windows 10, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) opened a case against Microsoft for “abusing dominance.” \nMicrosoft claimed to have a “long history of cooperation” with Kaspersky and that it is “committed to work in full compliance with Russian law.” \nYet, Russia has already decided to block Microsoft-owned LinkedIn , since the law requires Russian citizens’ personal data to be stored on servers within its country. In the past, Microsoft made LinkedIn censorship changes to cater to China, as opposed to being blocked like Google and Facebook. It remains to be seen if Microsoft will localize Russian users’ data as the country’s law demands. The New York Times added that it was unclear why LinkedIn was targeted, “rather than any other major social networking site,” but that is a “sign of growing tensions for American tech companies operating” in Russia. \nSpeaking of growing tensions, Kaspersky has “had enough” and roasted Microsoft toasty last week for anticompetitive bundling in Windows 10, namely the way the bundled Defender is Microsoft’s way of “squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose.” \nWhen upgrading, Windows 10 does have a habit of uninstalling users’ apps and replacing them with Microsoft-flavored versions. Even after selecting “Keep personal files and apps” during the upgrade process, third-party software can get axed—and that includes antivirus. Kaspersky wants Microsoft to knock off that behavior and stop “foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyber attacks.” \nKaspersky pointed out that upgrading to Windows 10 results in “incompatible security software” being deactivated and replaced with Defender. He lashed out at Microsoft, writing: \nBut what did it expect when independent developers were given all of one week before the release of the new version of the OS to make their software compatible? Even if software did manage to be compatible according to the initial check before the upgrade, weird things tended to happen and Defender would still take over. \nThis point was also hammered upon by the FAS, which claimed Microsoft “cut down significantly the period for adapting compatibility of antivirus software developed by third parties for the Windows 10 operational system: from 2 months to 6 calendar days.” \nKaspersky was irked about Microsoft’s use of a “big juicy Defender ‘Turn on’ button.” So, even if your security software is compatible, the pop-up window looks like a warning and urges users to enable Defender, which will uninstall any existing AV program. Eugene Kaspersky \nHe bashed the effectiveness of Defender, saying independent test labs find it to be “below average” and lacking functionality built into other anti-malware solutions. \nWindows 10 allows only one antivirus solution to be installed on a PC—two if you turn on Defender, he explained. If you have an AV solution but install a trial version of security software, when the trial period is up, Windows doesn’t revert back to the first AV solution but “quietly turns off both AVs” and instead turns on Defender. \nUnder a heading of “the harmful consequences of greed” is the question: Who most benefits from the monopolization of cybersecurity market? Kaspersky said, cybercriminals, of course! \nKaspersky suggested all independent software developers band together and fight Microsoft. \n“Users have the right to choose the best; freedom of choice enables the development of competition; and competition leads to technical progress. We intend to fight for such freedom, even if we have to do so alone,” he said. \nAfter Kaspersky’s post made it sound like Microsoft is trying to push independent software vendors out of the market, FAS Deputy Head Anatoly Golomolzin said, “Since Microsoft itself develops antivirus software—Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time—such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for Microsoft on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market.” RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Microsoft announces largest wind energy purchase to date [November 14, 2016] Tweet \nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Monday, Microsoft Corp. announced its largest purchase of wind energy to date with the signing of two agreements. Combined, these agreements represent 237 megawatts of wind energy, which brings Microsoft's total investment in wind energy projects in the U.S. to more than 500 megawatts. \n\"Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,\" said Brad Smith , president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. \"Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.\" \nMicrosoft has contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to fix its long-term energy costs and purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas . The project is the first to use a novel structure developed by ART and designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace. \n\"It is important for investors in renewable energy projects to secure long-term, stable revenues, and our structure does just that,\" said Karsten Berlage, managing director of ART. \"We are thrilled to be partnering with Microsoft on this groundbreaking project.\" \nIn addition, Microsoft has contracted with Black Hills Corp. subsidiary Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement, to purchase 59 megawatts of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, which are adjacent to Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming , datacenter. The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the annual energy used at the datacenter. \n\"Our longstanding partnership with Microsoft productively led to this landmark collaboration. This collaboration provided them the opportunity to utilize significantly more renewable energy while still ensuring the reliability they've come to expect through our energy infrastructure and generation resources,\" said David R. Emery , chairman and EO of Black Hills Corp. \"We are proud to be a strong supporter and partner in their mission to power their datacenters with increased renewable energy resources, and look forward to our continued collaboration in the years ahead.\" \nMicrosoft and Black Hills Energy also worked together to create a new tariff, available to all eligible customers, that allows the utility to tap the local datacenter's backup generators, thereby eliminating the need for Black Hills Energy to construct a new power plant. The tariff received approval from the Wyoming Public Service Commission in July. \n\"We are constantly looking for new ways to approach energy challenges and avenues of engagement with our utility partners,\" said Christian Belady, general manager of cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture at Microsoft. \"The team worked closely with ART to come up with a completely new model to enable faster adoption of renewables. Likewise, the tight engagement with Black Hills created the opportunity for Microsoft's datacenter to become an asset for the local grid, maintaining reliability and reducing costs for ratepayers. This kind of deep collaboration with utilities has great potential to accelerate the pace of clean energy, benefitting all customers — not just Microsoft.\" \nThese are Microsoft's third and fourth wind energy agreements, joining the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas . In March, Microsoft also signed an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy Inc. to bring 20 megawatts of solar energy onto the grid in Virginia . These projects are in addition to the renewable and carbon-free energy Microsoft purchases from the grid mix in the markets in which it operates. \nMore information about this announcement is in the Microsoft on the Issues blog post by Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith . \nAbout Allianz Risk Transfer \nAllianz Risk Transfer (ART) is the center of competence for alternative risk transfer business within the Allianz Group offering tailor-made insurance, reinsurance and other non-traditional risk management solutions to industrial and financial clients worldwide.

      "title": "Microsoft adds curated playlist support to Groove on iOS and Android",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft has pushed out an update to Groove Music on iOS and Android – finally adding the curated playlists feature Windows 10 users received months ago.\nNow in the Explore tab on the iPhone and Android, users can now find features playlists curated by Groove Editors, providing them with Dance Tracks, Rock Ballads and more.\nMicrosoft says this update is available for iOS and Android but some features appear to be inexplicably missing on the former,\nAfter completing the update on my iPhone, it ended up adding only “Featured Playlists” on iOS 10 on my iPhone, while it added Genres, Activities, and Moods on Android – it could be a bug, or it could be server side activated, I’m not sure at the moment.\nIt;s worth noting that Groove Music on iOS and Android still doesn’t have Microsoft’s “Your Groove” algorithmically generated playlists. This is a shame as this puts it behind much loved and popular music apps such as Apple Music, Spotify and Google Play Music. Especially ironic as Google Play Music recently overhauled their app to improve their support for curated playlists.\nNevertheless, Microsoft Groove is improving for Microsoft first users on iOS and Android, making it a good basic streaming option for those who don;t want all the bells and whistles.\nHere’s the changelog:\nAdded playlists by genre, mood and activity to the Explore hub\nVarious bug fixes\nYou can download the update from the links below:\n",

It can bypass antivirus programs by its internal functioning (using only trusted tools), it can retrieve credentials information and manipulate memory to get shellcode executed and to modify process in memory. Today, PowerShell is everywhere and, just like this tool is useful for system administrators to accomplish their tasks, it can also be a very useful tool for attackers when it is time to exploit things in a corporate environment. The other component for attacking corporate environment could be an innocent other tool like a Microsoft debugger. The debugger allows us to access everywhere in user-land and kernel-land. To abuse Windows, a lot of tools provide access to memory through Windows APIs and, where necessary, use kernel drivers to access it. But when it is time to abuse user-land and kernel-land, it doesn't stop there, as the operating system can be abused by reading and writing its memory with simple trusted tools: debuggers. Why use a debugger to do the abuses? Because we chose Microsoft debuggers which are trusted with sha1/sha256 certificates. To automate the attacks, we will use PowerShell because it is installed on every corporate computers. As our method doesn't need Windows API reflection, this kind of attacks could become very hard to detect and mitigate. With such simple tools, we will demonstrate that we can do a lot. As far as I know, my attack approach is different because it only uses Microsoft debugger and PowerShell tools to succeed. Mimikatz and WCE already reveal passwords but I was not able to find tools using my approach. Also, the Pass-The-Token attack approach is not documented and could be a very easy and effective attack simply using a Microsoft debugger to be able to impersonate any process identity. How \"deep\" can we dig into the memory without any other help than the debugger?

      "text": "Doesn’t do the one thing it’s supposed to do by Vulgar demos I’ve gotten used to MS products not working on the Mac, despite the fact that they are the largest apps and take more CPU resources than film software. However, I expected that at the very least they’d have a functioning cloud service since all it’s doing is culling files from their server. Unfortunately, it does not work — it “processes files” forever, without actually syncing. Also, the app store says its ready for an update and yet nothing happens — I won’t blame MS for that, though. None of this would be an issue if OneDrive had a passable web interface. But of course it does not. Searching on it useless unless you have a very unique name for every file and are only searching names. It’s hard to believe anyone uses Microsoft for any other reason than the fact that other software/people rely on it and are forced to use it for the purpose of formatting, collaboration, etc. In sum, like the other Office products, OneDrive simply is not compatible with the Mac. (That said, Microsoft’s iOS development team is clearly far more competent and have had far fewer issues on my iOS devices. I now type out my graduate-school essays on MS Word on my iPhone because the mac version crashes frequently. If you haven’t yet used the iOS apps, they’re a good alternative to the Mac.) For now, I would wait until Microsoft releases a non-beta version of OneDrive. Works fine by ibleo02 As a previous Windows user, I have most of my work files stored in the OneDrive cloud. After purchasing a new MacBook I was able to install OneDrive on my mac with no issues. Once I logged on, my files were all there. I was able to get right to work without having to hunt around for my files. It works fine for me. No issues syncing and no crashing. The only little annoying thing is if you have a white menu bar, it will wash out the OneDrive icon and wont be able to see it. I have a black menu bar so no big deal. Both personal and 365 runs better than on Windows 10 by MACcarsten The personal onedrive works flawlessly and compared to Windows 10 it is MUCH better on MAC.The 365 / business sometimes doesn’t start up by itself, but otherwise it works fine. You can open both with office docs and from finder. No problem.Very happy recently converted hard core Windows guy - MAC is great and onedrive / office works great on a MAC.",

      "text": "Here's Why You Need to Watch Microsoft's Connect Event Microsoft will spell out the future of development. Microsoft November 14, 2016 \nM icrosoft’s third annual developer conference will take place Wednesday through Friday this week, and if previous years are anything to go by, it’s gonna be big. The catchily-titled Connect(); conference is mostly targeted at developers, but there’s signs that big things could be in store for the future of technology. \nOn Wednesday at 10am EST, Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, will join principal program manager of Open Source .NET Scott Hanselman in a two-and-a-half hour keynote streamed live through the company website . It’s also an interesting time for Microsoft: the company has announced plans to expand Windows Holographic to other virtual reality headsets, and the HoloLens is making its mark in the developer community. The Surface Studio , Microsoft’s foray into desktop computing, has introduced a circular dial that promises a new mode of PC interaction. \nNobody’s quite sure what Microsoft will announce at the show, but clues suggest we could be in store for something big. Jennifer Marsman, a Microsoft developer evangelist who specializes in using machine learning and brain activity to improve lie detectors, said on Twitter that she is “very excited” for the announcements to come. Microsoft solution architect Robert Stackowiak also said that “ cool stuff for developers and the open source community ” will be on the way. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella \nLast year’s show may provide some clues. At the 2015 event, Microsoft revealed plans to open source Visual Studio Code, so developers can get into the nitty-gritty of the company’s cloud development code editor. At the same time, Microsoft announced Visual Studio Dev Essentials, a cross-platform set of tools used for releasing apps for a number of devices and operating systems. Best of all, Dev Essentials is free. \nWhatever Microsoft ends up announcing at the show, it’s sure to mean big news for the developer communities. The impacts may only make themselves known further down the line, but any improvements to the tools used by software makers will help harness the power of Microsoft’s exotic new hardware advancements. It’s an exciting time.

      "title": "Visual Studio for Mac: Microsoft publishes details a little early",
      "text": "Comments \nPremature publication of news is a common mistake on both our end and that of vendors. Today was Microsoft's turn to suffer an oops with the premature announcement that it is bringing its flagship development tool to the Mac. \nMicrosoft will be hosting its Connect(); 2016 developer conference in New York City later this week, which will be the launch grounds for Visual Studio for Mac, but for whatever reason, the news was published early to an MSDN blog. \nSeveral sites, including TechCrunch and Neowin, got the news before the blog post was taken down, although a cached version is available from Google . \nIn the announcement, Microsoft notes this version of Visual Studio offers the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio IDE as a \"true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#,\" along with bringing the Visual Studio development experience to the Mac for the first time. \n\"At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor,\" wrote Mikayla Hutchinson, a senior program manager at Microsoft. \nVisual Studio for Mac also has a lot in common with its Windows brother, but not everything. Its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and it uses the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. \nHowever, Hutchinson's post also says it doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, but she does not say which project types are not supported. For those that are, team members on macOS and Windows can seamlessly share their projects across platforms without conversion or migration. \nConnect() takes place Nov. 16-18. Scott Guthrie, head of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, will deliver the keynote address. RELATED TOPICS",

      "title": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 MSHTML CMapElement::Notify Use-After-Free",
      "text": "A specially crafted web-page can cause MSIE 11 to interrupt the handlingof one `readystatechange` event with another. This interrupts a call toone of the various `C<ElementName>Element::Notify` functions to makeanother such call and at least one of these functions is non-reentrant.This can have various repercussions, e.g. when an attacker triggers thisvulnerability using a `CMapElement` object, a reference to that objectcan be stored in a linked list and the object itself can be freed. Thispointer can later be re-used to cause a classic use-after-free issue.Known affected versions, attack vectors and mitigations An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.DescriptionWhen a `DocumentFragment` containing an applet element is added to theDOM, all elements receive a notification that they are removed from the`CMarkup`. Next, they are added to the DOM and receive notification ofbeing added to another `CMarkup`. When the applet is added, a`CObjectElement` is created and added to the `CMarkup`. This causes a`readystatechange` event to fire, which interrupts the current code.During this `readystatechange` event, the DOM may be modified, whichcauses further notifications to fire. However, elements in the`DocumentFragment` that come after the applet element have alreadyreceived a notification that they have been remove from one `CMarkup`,but not that they have been added to the new one. Thus, these elementsmay receive another notification of removal, followed by twonotifications of being added to a `CMarkup`.AFAICT, this event-within-an-event itself is the root cause of the bugand allows memory corruption in various ways. I discovered the issuebecause the code in `CMapElement::Notify` is non-reentrant and does nothandle this sequence of events well. This code maintains a singly linkedlist of map elements that have been added to the document. An objectshould never be added to this list twice, as this will cause a loop inthe list (a map element pointing to itself as the next inthe list). However, the event-within-an-event can be used to first causetwo consecutive calls to remove the same element from this list followedby two calls to add the same element to the list. This results in thefollowing sequence of events:* The first call to remove the element will remove it from the list.* The second call to remove the element will do nothing.* The first call to add the element will add it to the list.* The second call to add the element will try to add it to the list again, causing the list to contain a loop. This list is now corrupt.At this point, an attacker can remove the `CMapElement`, causing thecode to try to remove it from the list and free it. However, because ofthe loop in the list, the above code will not actually remove it fromthe list. After this, the pointer in the list points to freed memory andan attacker can force MSIE to reuse it.Time-line**September 2014*: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.**September 2014*: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.**September 2014*: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.**February 2015*: Microsoft address this issue in MS15-009.**November 2016*: Details of this issue are released.Cheers,",

The latest version of the Bing app includes a feature that puts an augmented reality twist on searching for nearby places to eat, drink and otherwise entertain users.\nSee also: Microsoft apps coming soon to a Xiaomi phone near you June 1, 2016 When you open the app and tap on the camera logo on the left side, it brings up the view from your rear camera. Then you tap on the new “360” option on the left bottom portion of the app and it will bring up a list of nearby places such as restaurants, coffee houses and more. There are even options to see more practical locations like gas stations, grocery stores and more. There’s also a compass on the left top side so you can quickly see where your nearby picks are, or you can quickly switch to an overhead map view of those same places with the tap of the map icon on the lower right side.\nThe AR feature isn’t the only thing that’s new with Bing for Android. You also get a music page that is supposed to direct users to videos, lyrics and related songs from their favorite artists. The change log says the Bing app also says there’s an Events page with upcoming local concerts and sports events, and a Lottery page for the latest on the jackpot amounts and winning numbers. However, we didn’t see either one of those features with this update.\nWhat do you think of Microsoft adding these new AR search features in the Bing app. Are they actually useful or is this just a gimmick?\nGet it at Google Play ",

      "text": "\"Game of Thrones\"/HBO \nWork email is finally dying. The future is all about chat apps.\nWhether you work at a startup or a Fortune 500 company, you'll probably be using a work chat app soon, if you're not already.\nThese tools make real-time collaboration a snap, letting you fire off quick conversations with colleagues on your phone or laptop, share documents and use your favorite third-party apps.\nAt the head of the pack is Slack, which has grown like crazy since launching in 2013 and currently  claims 4 million daily users and 1.25 million paid users. \nBut social networking giant Facebook recently launched its first business app called Workplace and it's already winning fans.   And Microsoft has doubled down on this young market with Teams, a new homegrown app that it announced earlier this month. \nSo which of these apps is right for your workplace? \nBusiness Insider took a hands-on look at the three big workplace chat apps to see how they compare. Read on to see which one you like best: \n \nSlack is organized into \"channels.\" Every team in a company can have its own channel where team members communicate in one big chat room. Slack \n\nSlack has several advantages over other chat apps. First, it is really easy to use. Anyone can create a channel around any topic, like a project. Public channels use a pound sign (#) and are open to anyone in the company. Private channels use a lock sign and require an invite. Slack \n\nYou can also send private messages to another person, or a group of others. In addition to typing messages, you can also upload photos, files, links to newspaper articles (that will preview the article), videos, tweets, etc. And you can find stuff via search. Slack \n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "\"Game of Thrones\"/HBO \nWork email is finally dying. The future is all about chat apps. \nWhether you work at a startup or a Fortune 500 company, you'll probably be using a work chat app soon, if you're not already. \nThese tools make real-time collaboration a snap, letting you fire off quick conversations with colleagues on your phone or laptop, share documents and use your favorite third-party apps. \nAt the head of the pack is Slack, which has grown like crazy since launching in 2013 and currently claims 4 million daily users and 1.25 million paid users. \nBut social networking giant Facebook recently launched its first business app called Workplace and it's already winning fans. And Microsoft has doubled down on this young market with Teams, a new homegrown app that it announced earlier this month. \nSo which of these apps is right for your workplace? \nBusiness Insider took a hands-on look at the three big workplace chat apps to see how they compare. Read on to see which one you like best: \nSlack is organized into \"channels.\" Every team in a company can have its own channel where team members communicate in one big chat room. Slack Slack has several advantages over other chat apps. First, it is really easy to use. Anyone can create a channel around any topic, like a project. Public channels use a pound sign (#) and are open to anyone in the company. Private channels use a lock sign and require an invite. Slack You can also send private messages to another person, or a group of others. In addition to typing messages, you can also upload photos, files, links to newspaper articles (that will preview the article), videos, tweets, etc. And you can find stuff via search. Slack But Slack's real appeal is that it is integrated with a ton of other apps. You can drop a link to a Google Drive/Dropbox/Box file, GitHub or MailChimp project, for instance, and it works a bit like an attachment, showing a part of the file. Slack You can set it up to get notifications from these other apps in Slack, too. Slack Slack is integrated with dozens of apps like this. Everything from travel deal alerts, to ordering an Uber to voting on where to go for lunch. You can also create your own bots. One favorite is the \"Giphy\" bot, which lets you share .gif images with them. Business Insider Slack charges nothing for a basic version. Pricing for more advanced versions with more storage and features is either $6.67/user/month or $12.50/user/month. Slack Microsoft recently announced a direct competitor to Slack called Teams. It was so inspired by Slack that on a quick glance it's hard to tell the two of them apart. For instance, it also uses \"channels\" to create chat rooms based on teams or projects. Microsoft Teams is not yet openly available but will be in 2017. Only a preview version is available now. Teams has two big differences from Slack. First, its price. Microsoft Teams will be a free app included with most of the business versions of Office 365 including Business Essentials ($5 per person/month). Microsoft The second big difference is that Teams is integrated with all of the other Microsoft Office apps including Skype for video and audio conference calls. Microsoft Integration with Office includes Word, Excel and all the others. So a team can work on a document together in the chat room. Microsoft has also made it easier to search and find shared documents, using artificial intelligence to automatically find documents, conversations and stuff for you. Microsoft Teams will also be able to work with other apps built by all sorts of software developers. Like Slack, Teams also has a bot framework so these apps can respond to commands and chat with you inside Teams. Microsoft Of course, before Teams, Microsoft already had a chat app called Yammer that it bought in 2012 for $1.2 billion. Microsoft, just last summer, finished integrating Yammer with Office 365, too. But Microsoft built Teams in-house from scratch, waved its wand and repositioned Yammer as an \"enterprise social experience.\" So poof, that's the difference between Teams and Yammer. Meanwhile, Facebook also launched its work app, called Workplace. Workplace was inspired by Facebook employees' own internal use of Facebook instead of email or other chat apps. A Workplace account is completely separate from your personal Facebook account. Facebook When Workplace launched, more than 1,000 businesses were already using it as part of the private beta program Facebook launched about a year ago. It is essentially a modified, private version of Facebook for company use. Facebook Like the others, Workplace lets anyone create a Group, making it open or closed/invite only, or even \"secret.\" Workplace has a newsfeed that tells you about all the open discussions happening in the company and in your groups, and it shows you the important and trending discussions. Facebook Like the others, you can share photos and files. And you \"follow\" coworkers to get all their public posts in your newsfeed. It also supports video calls, private chats via a Messenger-like interface and Facebook Live video, so one person can broadcast to a group while the group chats in response. Facebook Workplace also does other Facebook-y things, like help you plan corporate events and track RSVPs. Facebook Facebook charges $3 per user for the first 1,000 monthly active users, $2/user for 1,001 – 10,000 monthly active users, $1/user per 10,000+ monthly active users. It's free for nonprofits and schools. Facebook These are not the only three workplace chat apps available. Another popular one is Atlassian HipChat, which also lets you chat to your team, share files, and do videoconferences with screen sharing. The basic version is free. The paid version costs $2 per person per month. Atlassian",

      "text": "\"Game of Thrones\"/HBO \nWork email is finally dying. The future is all about chat apps. \nWhether you work at a startup or a Fortune 500 company, you'll probably be using a work chat app soon, if you're not already. \nThese tools make real-time collaboration a snap, letting you fire off quick conversations with colleagues on your phone or laptop, share documents and use your favorite third-party apps. \nAt the head of the pack is Slack, which has grown like crazy since launching in 2013 and currently claims 4 million daily users and 1.25 million paid users. \nBut social networking giant Facebook recently launched its first business app called Workplace and it's already winning fans. And Microsoft has doubled down on this young market with Teams, a new homegrown app that it announced earlier this month. \nSo which of these apps is right for your workplace? \nBusiness Insider took a hands-on look at the three big workplace chat apps to see how they compare. Read on to see which one you like best: \nSlack is organized into \"channels.\" Every team in a company can have its own channel where team members communicate in one big chat room. Slack Slack has several advantages over other chat apps. First, it is really easy to use. Anyone can create a channel around any topic, like a project. Public channels use a pound sign (#) and are open to anyone in the company. Private channels use a lock sign and require an invite. Slack You can also send private messages to another person, or a group of others. In addition to typing messages, you can also upload photos, files, links to newspaper articles (that will preview the article), videos, tweets, etc. And you can find stuff via search. Slack But Slack's real appeal is that it is integrated with a ton of other apps. You can drop a link to a Google Drive/Dropbox/Box file, GitHub or MailChimp project, for instance, and it works a bit like an attachment, showing a part of the file. Slack You can set it up to get notifications from these other apps in Slack, too. Slack Slack is integrated with dozens of apps like this. Everything from travel deal alerts, to ordering an Uber to voting on where to go for lunch. You can also create your own bots. One favorite is the \"Giphy\" bot, which lets you share .gif images with them. Business Insider Slack charges nothing for a basic version. Pricing for more advanced versions with more storage and features is either $6.67/user/month or $12.50/user/month. Slack Microsoft recently announced a direct competitor to Slack called Teams. It was so inspired by Slack that on a quick glance it's hard to tell the two of them apart. For instance, it also uses \"channels\" to create chat rooms based on teams or projects. Microsoft Teams is not yet openly available but will be in 2017. Only a preview version is available now. Teams has two big differences from Slack. First, its price. Microsoft Teams will be a free app included with most of the business versions of Office 365 including Business Essentials ($5 per person/month). Microsoft The second big difference is that Teams is integrated with all of the other Microsoft Office apps including Skype for video and audio conference calls. Microsoft Integration with Office includes Word, Excel and all the others. So a team can work on a document together in the chat room. Microsoft has also made it easier to search and find shared documents, using artificial intelligence to automatically find documents, conversations and stuff for you. Microsoft Teams will also be able to work with other apps built by all sorts of software developers. Like Slack, Teams also has a bot framework so these apps can respond to commands and chat with you inside Teams. Microsoft Of course, before Teams, Microsoft already had a chat app called Yammer that it bought in 2012 for $1.2 billion. Microsoft, just last summer, finished integrating Yammer with Office 365, too. But Microsoft built Teams in-house from scratch, waved its wand and repositioned Yammer as an \"enterprise social experience.\" So poof, that's the difference between Teams and Yammer. Meanwhile, Facebook also launched its work app, called Workplace. Workplace was inspired by Facebook employees' own internal use of Facebook instead of email or other chat apps. A Workplace account is completely separate from your personal Facebook account. Facebook When Workplace launched, more than 1,000 businesses were already using it as part of the private beta program Facebook launched about a year ago. It is essentially a modified, private version of Facebook for company use. Facebook Like the others, Workplace lets anyone create a Group, making it open or closed/invite only, or even \"secret.\" Workplace has a newsfeed that tells you about all the open discussions happening in the company and in your groups, and it shows you the important and trending discussions. Facebook Like the others, you can share photos and files. And you \"follow\" coworkers to get all their public posts in your newsfeed. It also supports video calls, private chats via a Messenger-like interface and Facebook Live video, so one person can broadcast to a group while the group chats in response. Facebook Workplace also does other Facebook-y things, like help you plan corporate events and track RSVPs. Facebook Facebook charges $3 per user for the first 1,000 monthly active users, $2/user for 1,001 – 10,000 monthly active users, $1/user per 10,000+ monthly active users. It's free for nonprofits and schools. Facebook These are not the only three workplace chat apps available. Another popular one is Atlassian HipChat, which also lets you chat to your team, share files, and do videoconferences with screen sharing. The basic version is free. The paid version costs $2 per person per month. Atlassian",

      "text": "Xamarin co-founder Miguel de Icaza on stage at Microsoft Build in 2014 Xamarin \nMicrosoft is bringing Visual Studio, its widely used tool for writing software, to Apple's Macs. \nThe news will be announced at Microsoft's Connect conference later this week, but it was revealed early when the official blog entry went live a few days before. The blog has since been taken down, but a cached version remains via Google . \nVisual Studio is how a lot of programmers get work done, particularly those building software for Microsoft Windows or the web. \nBringing Visual Studio to Apple MacOS, the operating system preferred by many programmers, is going to turn a lot of heads. It's just the latest way Microsoft is reaching across the aisle to former rivals to win over programmers. \nThere's a catch: As Ars Technica points out in more technical detail , Visual Studio for Mac may share a name and aesthetic with its PC counterpart, but it won't be exactly the same as Visual Studio for Windows. \nUnder the hood, the Mac version of Visual Studio mainly functions as an update to Xamarin Studio, a tool for quickly and easily building apps that can run on Windows, iPhone, Android, Mac, the web, or anywhere else. Microsoft got Xamarin Studio, alongside the rest of Xamarin's technology , in a big buy earlier in 2016. Visual Studio for Mac Microsoft \nIn the same way that Microsoft's excellent Outlook apps for iPhone and Android are a direct successor to Acompli, a startup Microsoft bought in 2014 , this new Visual Studio for Mac looks to be a new name and face for Xamarin's technology. \nLots of programmers love Xamarin in its own right, though. So while Visual Studio for Windows may be more powerful on paper, there are still lots of developers who will still be able to do what they need to do on the Mac version, too. \nAnd it's a big flag in the ground for Microsoft — Xamarin Studio, and now Visual Studio for Mac, are designed to make it really easy for programmers to build their apps to the Microsoft Azure cloud , which is a big focus for Microsoft. By bringing a flagship brand to Mac, Microsoft is hoping to give that business a leg up.",

      "text": "\nAround 30% of Windows 10 Mobile handsets are still not on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.\nFor those devices on Threshold 2 it seems Microsoft has decided to push out a new build of the OS, taking it to build 10586.682. The new build does not take the devices to the Anniversary Update and it is not clear what advantages it brings, but it is presumably the usual bug fixes and performance improvements.\nThe update may be particularly beneficial for devices such as the Moly above which was never allowed onto the Anniversary Update and also older Windows Phones which managed to get up to Threshold 2 via the Insider program but which were ultimately stranded when Microsoft did not allow them onto the Anniversary Update.\nAre any of our readers affected?

      "text": "  \nGet your wallets ready – Microsoft announced their Black Friday plans fopr the Microsoft Store this week, including discounts on the Xbox One S itself as well as a bunch of games. \nIf you’re wanting to go big and get a 1TB Xbox One or Xbox One S, Microsoft is putting those on sale from November 20 to 23. Starting on November 24, though, any and all Xbox One S or Xbox One bundle can be picked up for that same discount. Both will be $50 cheaper. \nAlso starting in the 24th, Gears of War 4 and the Gears of War Xbox 360 Collection are $25 off, while ReCore is $20 off. You can also pick up a 3-mouth or 6-month Xbox Live subscription for $10 off. \nStarting on November 22 (November 18 for Xbox Live Gold members) up through November 28, the Xbox Store’s Black Friday games sale is starting. Microsoft hasn’t yet published the list of games, but cites just about every platform-exclusive title in their library as being up for discount, including Forza Horizon 3 , Quantum Break , and Ori and the Blind Forest. \nSony, on the other hand, has yet to announce any formal discounts for their systems. It’s unlikely the new PlayStation 4 Pro will see a discount so soon after release, and the slim PlayStation 4 is only a couple months older than that, but hey, we’d love to see it happen, Sony.",

      "text": "  \nBill Gates \nJEDDAH: Microsoft cofounder and philanthropist Bill Gates believes young people in Saudi Arabia are key to the country achieving its Vision 2030 reform plan.Gates is set to give a video address at the inaugural MiSK Global Forum, which opens today in Riyadh, in which he will encourage Saudi youth to seize new opportunities.The chair of one of the world’s largest private philanthropic foundations will highlight the essential role young people must play in the Kingdom’s reform program, according to a statement by the conference organizers.In the recorded opening address, Gates will say: “The future of any country is about its young people, in Saudi Arabia that is even more true because you’re the majority and you’re more educated and inquisitive than any generation that’s come before.”“Vision 2030 is a powerful set of goals, but it will be the young people whose innovative work is needed to achieve them, that means lots of studying and getting the new skills that will equip you for the evolving job market, it means building on the deeply engrained values of giving back, caring for others and working toward a common goal.”The MiSK Global Forum is aimed at connecting the Saudi youth to the global economy. The two-day event brings young Saudi men and women in front of a range of global thought leaders, business and sports people from over 65 countries.Speakers will share their insights and ideas across the range of opportunities available to young people in the global economy, and reflect on the lessons required for future success. The two-day conference will host CEOs from major international companies such as Siemens, BP and Cisco, the chairman of Goldman Sachs and former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso.The conference is designed to provide an opportunity for leaders to share their experiences, provide points of guidance, and bolster the aspirations of the young delegates attending.MiSK spokesperson Shaima Hamiddadin said: “This event is about empowering, nurturing and inspiring Saudi Arabia’s young men and women to fully realize their potential as part of the Kingdom’s on-going economic transformation. We are honored to have Bill Gates provide the defining context to the forum that will encourage our young people to generate new thinking, explore their creative potential and create innovative approaches to the modern era.“We look forward to the diverse contributions from our assembled guests over the days ahead. It promises to be a highly enriching event.”MiSK will also be announcing a major new strategy aimed at accelerating the pace of tech entrepreneurship and innovation in the Kingdom, a comprehensive program aimed bolstering skills in the tech sector alongside a range of new international partnerships.The MiSK Foundation, created by Prince Mohammad bin Salman, has established the MiSK Global Forum (MGF) to empower, nurture and inspire Saudi Arabia’s youth to fully realize their potential.

      "text": "  \nIncreasingly, as Microsoft Surface hardware continues to fill niche use cases for a varying degree of clientele it also appears to legitimize the case for the adaptive and usefulness of the company’s 2-in-1 hybrid devices. \nTake for instance the Windows Blog showcased story of the Siemens NX team’s who recently certified its software to work with Surface devices. \nToday, we’re announcing Microsoft Surface devices, including the new Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base, which are all certified to run Siemens NX software, one of the world’s most advanced product design software applications. This will give engineers the confidence in their ability to utilize Surface devices to help them design and create such innovative products. \nThe Siemens NX team joined us in New York City for our recent launch and I was fortunate enough to sit down with Joe Bohman, Vice President of Product Engineering Software for Siemens’ product lifecycle management (PLM) software business, where he told me more about why he thinks Surface represents the future of devices for engineers like himself. Microsoft Surface and Siemens NX \nIn a sort of Q&A style of presentation, the team behind Siemens NX software answer questions about how its updated tools will work with the Surface Studio, in specific, how NX will incorporate the Surface Dial, the unique use cases the new hardware creates and what certification means to Surface users. \nThe Siemens NX certification is granted only to devices that have passed our series of hundreds of tests, which weigh a device’s ability to deliver a highly satisfactory end-user experience. Our customers, including numerous major airplane and auto manufacturers, require and depend on this certification to tell them what devices will offer their team the best user experience. To do so, our team tests device capabilities like processor performance, graphics systems and more. \nWe’ve worked closely with Microsoft and feel confident in certifying both Surface Book and Surface Studio to run Siemens NX software. For us, the most important outcome of these certifications is that our customers have the confidence that Siemens and Microsoft are committed to them.” \nTo read more about how Siemens NX software and the Microsoft Surface Studio work together, visit the Windows Blog here . \nLet us know in the comments which niche your Surface devices has filled.

But he got up, brushed himself off, looked out at his dad, who was at the bus stop, and gave him a thumbs-up. \nLater that morning the school nurse called his father and said Billy had an accident at school. He ran into another student during a gym class and had a bump on his forehead but was OK. The nurse said Billy seemed more concerned about the other student. \nAt the end of the day, as Billy was heading for the school bus, he slipped on some ice and broke his wrist trying to catch his fall. \nWhen his father arrived at the hospital, he found his son chatting away with the nurses. \nHe said, \"Dad, look,\" as he clutched a dollar bill. \"I found this when I fell. Today is my lucky day.\" \nLife and our circumstances are all about how we think of them. Career success is an ongoing journey, not a destination. You've got to show up every day and concentrate consistently on the activities that lead to achievement. You can keep moving forward from goal to goal, but your job satisfaction and performance will suffer if you don't bring your best attitude to work. \nIf you recognize some negative traits invading your attitude, take some action before it's too late. Focus on the bright side. Emphasize what you genuinely enjoy about your job and the people you work with, and express your gratification. \nKeep your eye on results. It's easy to fall into routines and patterns that emphasize the process instead of the outcome. Learn the rules, but apply them with an eye on what you want to achieve. \nTreat failures as an opportunity to spot mistakes and move forward. Ultimately, the only control you have in life is over yourself, your thoughts, actions, responses and behaviors. \nUltimately, the only control you have in life is over yourself, your thoughts, actions, responses and behaviors. \nDon't fixate over what you can't control; concentrate on what you can. \nYou'll stay positive if you remind yourself of what you already possess. Every day, spend some time thinking about your health, family and friends and the advantages you have, instead of focusing on what you lack. \nYou aren't doing yourself, or the people around you, any favors by staying in a situation that will only get worse. \nIt's up to you to fix what you can, and that starts with your attitude. Don't sell yourself short. You deserve better. \nWhen it comes to having a winning attitude, think about this story of a taxpayer and an IRS tax auditor, who was reviewing the taxpayer's records. \nWhile the auditor worked through the papers, the taxpayer shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \nThe auditor adjusted his glasses and said, \"Mr. Smith, we at the IRS feel it's a great privilege to live and work in the United States. And as a U.S. citizen, you have an obligation to pay taxes. \nAnd we expect you to pay them eagerly with a smile.\" \n''Oh, thank goodness,\" Mr. Smith said, wearing a giant grin on his face. \"I thought you were going to want me to pay with cash.\" \nMackay's Moral: Take control of your attitude before it takes control of you. \nHarvey Mackay can be reached at www.harveymackay.com . \nReach Harvey Mackay at www.harveymackay.com .",

      "text": "Microsoft Now Lets Users Use Skype Without An Account  36 PST \nLike tech videos? Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube \nOne of the problems with using online services is that usually you’ll have to sign up for a new account. This is why single sign-on options like using your Facebook or Google credentials can save you a lot of time, but what if you’d rather not link your Facebook or Google accounts with certain apps or services? \nFacebook did away with the need for an account for Messenger , and the good news for those who might need to use Skype every now and then is that Microsoft has announced that starting from today onwards, users will no longer need a Skype/Microsoft account to use the service. All they have to do is head on over to Skype’s website and join as a Guest. They’ll get to pick their own name and also participate in all of Skype’s features like voice and video calls. \nHowever the only downside here is that your conversations will only last for 24 hours, meaning that if you wanted to maintain a chat history you’ll have to find some way of downloading the logs manually. We suppose this might be useful for people who only need Skype for certain events, so instead of having to juggle more accounts and passwords to remember, this will let them hop in and out of the app without much fuss. \nLike we said, the feature is now live so head on over to Skype’s website if you’d like to take it for a spin. \nFiled in General .

      "title": "Microsoft Outlook Customer Manager Keeps Small Businesses on Task",
      "text": "Microsoft released its new Outlook Customer Manager feature that helps small business ensure that tasks and deadlines don't fall through the cracks. Microsoft today took the wraps off Outlook Customer Manager, a new software tool for Office 365 small business customers that enables them to keep track of their customer communications and engagement activities directly within the email client. While viewing an email from a customer, Outlook Customer Manager collects emails, calls, meetings, Office files, deadlines, tasks and other related content into a timeline. It appears as an additional pane in the Outlook interface, right alongside the inbox. The new tool is being billed as a major time-saver, helping busy entrepreneurs reclaim hours lost to digging up customer information as they go about their workweek. \"The information in the timeline is automatically gathered from the email, calendar and call log data from your Office 365 environment, minimizing the need to manually enter data about your customer interactions,\" wrote the Microsoft Outlook team in a Nov. 14 blog post . \"With all your customer information gathered in one place, you can spend less time entering data, or searching for it in various places, and more time with customers.\"To help users keep track of their deadlines, commitments and other aspects of healthy customer relationships, Outlook Customer Manager automatically surfaces reminders. Users can also consult the tool's Focused List, akin to Outlook's own Focused Inbox , to keep track of their VIP customers. Information can be shared among colleagues, allowing teams to work together to meet a customer's needs.Finally, Outlook Customer Manager is also available as an iOS app, providing access to customer communications, appointments and tasks on the go. Microsoft is working on bringing the app to other mobile operating systems. Outlook Customer Manager is available now, although it is currently rolling out to Office 365 Business Premium customers participating in the First Release early access program. Widespread availability will occur in the coming months. Microsoft is also working on adding the tool to Office 365 E3 and E5 plans sometime in the future. Microsoft has been bulking up its small business software ecosystem in recent months. This summer, the company launched Skype Meetings at no cost to small businesses. Available to users with a business email address, Skype Meetings offers a remote meeting experience with screen sharing, PowerPoint presentation capabilities and video calls with up to 10 participants, a number that drop to three people after an initial 60-day trial period. In July, the company launched an online appointment management product called Bookings . Also available to Office 365 Business Premium customers, Bookings allows appointment-based small businesses like salons to offer self-service scheduling to their customers. The offering works in tandem with Outlook, Outlook.com and Google Calendar to help both businesses and their customers align their schedules. Last month, Microsoft debuted a major, cloud-inspired update to its enterprise resource planning (ERP) software platform for small and midsized businesses. Dynamics NAV 2016 includes native integration with Dynamics CRM Online, an all-cloud Azure SQL Database installation option and new business analytics capabilities powered by Microsoft's cloud business intelligence software, Power BI.",

      "title": "Microsoft Announces Windows Azure Pack Support to January 2027",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/14/2016 \nMicrosoft has published updated lifecycle support information for Windows Azure Pack, claiming that its datacenter solution for organizations and service providers is \"far from being dead.\" \nThe newly published information shows support information for Windows Azure Pack on Windows Server 2016, which hadn't been available before. \"Mainstream support\" will end in January 2022 on Windows Server 2016, while \"extended support\" will end in January 2027, according to Microsoft's announcement on Monday . \nIn a nutshell, per this policy, new features get developed through the mainstream support end date, while security updates continue though the extended support end date. After the end of extended support, the software doesn't get patched at all by Microsoft, which is a potential security issue. An explanation of Microsoft's lifecycle support policy for its business software can be found at this page . \nThe information on Windows Azure Pack support on Windows Server 2016 had been a long time in coming. Back in late January, Microsoft had published a roadmap document urging organizations and service providers to stick with the Windows Azure Pack, even though Windows Server 2016 support information for it hadn't yet been published. Microsoft originally had developed the Windows Azure Pack for Windows Server 2012 R2, and formally launched it on Jan. 14, 2014. \nThere has been confusion around Windows Azure Pack because Microsoft released a preview in late January of a \"Microsoft Azure Stack\" alternative that promised a truer Azure-like datacenter experience. Microsoft has since announced that Azure Stack is planned for release in mid-2017, so it's not technically available for deployment in production environments. \nStill, organizations just didn't have support information for Windows Server 2016 until now. That lack of information, as well as confusion about Azure Stack plans, may have affected their decisions to proceed with Windows Azure Pack deployments or not. \nThe two solutions, Windows Azure Pack (WAP) and Microsoft Azure Stack (MAS), likely will \"co-exist together for a long time,\" according to Microsoft's announcement. Surprisingly, Microsoft sees them as distinct. \n\"MAS and WAP have a different purpose -- WAP is a great solution to build IaaS, and MAS is a great platform to run Azure services in your datacenter,\" Microsoft's announcement stated. \"They are totally different inside and very different from the outside -- WAP looks like a simplified old Azure Portal , while MAS looks exactly like new Azure Portal .\" \nAnother difference between the two is that users of the Windows Azure Pack can run it on their own datacenter hardware. In contrast, Microsoft Azure Stack is only supported on Microsoft-approved vendor hardware . Part of the rationale for the hardware restriction had to do with keeping Microsoft Azure Stack instances properly patched, Microsoft explained in August . \nMicrosoft's announcement on Monday urged organizations and service providers to not wait for the Microsoft Azure Stack to arrive. Instead, they can test Azure Stack Technical Preview 2 . Windows Azure Pack users that are running it on Windows Server 2012 R2 infrastructure should keep using it, but they should switch to Windows Server 2016 and they should make that switch \"today,\" according to the announcement.

      "title": "Microsoft Rebrands Deployment Toolkit with Build 8443 Release",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/14/2016 \nThe latest Microsoft Deployment Toolkit for deploying Windows client and server operating systems was released this month, but don't call it \"MDT 2016.\" \nInstead, it's just called \"Microsoft Deployment Toolkit build 8443,\" according to Microsoft's announcement today . The kit can be downloaded at the Microsoft Download Center here . It succeeds MDT 2013 Update 2 and is designed for deploying client OSes (from Windows 7 to Windows 10), as well as Windows Server OSes (from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Window Server 2016), according to a Microsoft forum post . It also works with System Center Configuration Manager 2012 and newer versions. \nThe use of MDT build 8443 requires having the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) for Windows 10 version 1607 installed, which can be downloaded here . \nMicrosoft claims to be simplifying the kit's branding with this release. It plans to release MDT updates (new builds) whenever they are needed to keep pace with \"Windows, Windows ADK [Assessment and Deployment Kit] and Configuration Manager,\" according to the announcement. \nMDT build 8443 supports the \"current branch\" and \"long-term servicing branch\" of Windows 10. It supports System Center Configuration Manager 1606. However, Microsoft mercifully isn't planning to use its Windows 10-style service-branch lingo with future MDT releases. \n\"This is not necessarily a 'current branch' of MDT,\" Microsoft's announcement clarified. \nIn addition, Microsoft isn't necessarily planning to release monthly updates to MDT as it does with Windows 10 and System Center Configuration Manager. \nMDT build 8443 contains \"multiple fixes\" for performing in-place upgrades to Windows 10. Microsoft also removed \"imagex/ocsetup dependencies,\" among other fixes. \nPossibly, documentation for MDT build 8443 is yet to come. At press time, Microsoft's TechNet library page just showed MDT 2013 documentation. About the Author \nis senior news producer for the 1105 Enterprise Computing Group. <>",

      "title": "Security Firm Launches Antitrust Complaint Against Microsoft and Windows 10",
      "text": "By Scott Bekker 11/14/2016 \nSecurity firm Kaspersky Lab is crying foul after accusing Microsoft of creating an environment in Windows 10 that puts competing security products at a disadvantage compared to the company's Windows Defender. \nThe Moscow-based company has filed an application with the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of Russia and is preparing a similar application for the European Commission, a spokesperson said in an e-mail on Monday. Asked if the company had any plans to file complaints in the United States, the spokesperson said, \"Any additional actions will be communicated when appropriate.\" \nThe antitrust spotlight shined brightly on Microsoft through the late 1990s and early 2000s, but Microsoft's consecutive misses on the search, smartphone and tablet markets, alongside the general declines in PC sales overall, have diminished its once fearsome reputation. Kaspersky Lab's high-profile chairman and CEO, Eugene Kaspersky, unveiled his company's campaign to bring Microsoft back to the attention of antitrust regulators in a lengthy blog post on Thursday. \n\"We think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own product. The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn't beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks,\" Kaspersky wrote. \"The company is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market, and infringes upon the interests of independent developers of security products.\" \nWindows Defender is the built-in anti-virus (AV) protection that comes as part of Windows 10. In a statement on its application to the Russian FAS, Kaspersky Lab described two main problems with Windows 10. \n\"When a user migrates to Windows 10, and the current version of their antivirus software is not compatible with this operating system, the user is not informed in advance of the need to install a compatible version. Instead, without the explicit consent of the user, the antivirus software is removed and Windows Defender is switched on by default,\" the statement said. The statement continued, \"Microsoft provides security vendors with new RTM Windows 10 builds several days before their official release, compared with the 2 months they gave for Windows 8 and Windows 7. Several days are not enough for developers to modify security solutions properly, to make them compatible and effective against all types of cyberthreats from the day of release, leaving users without the level of protection they have chosen and paid for.\" \nIn his blog, Kaspersky cataloged other complaints about the way Windows 10 handles third-party AV -- including warning pages showing that Windows Defender is turned off without sufficient notification that another AV solution is running, as well as policies that automatically turn on Defender if Windows finds two different AV solutions running at once. \nThe company is asking antitrust officials to force Microsoft to provide new versions and updates of Windows to security vendors in time to allow them to ensure compatibility with Windows 10, to inform users of the presence of incompatible software before the Windows upgrade, and to require that users always be asked for explicit approval before Windows Defender is enabled. \nMicrosoft declined to comment on Kaspersky's blog post or the Kaspersky Lab complaints.

      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/14/2016 \nMicrosoft today announced a new Outlook Customer Manager solution for small businesses as part of its Office 365 Business Premium subscription plan. \nThe new customer relationship tool is currently available to some \"first release\" testers, but Microsoft is planning a more general product release worldwide \"in the coming months,\" according to its announcement . The new solution won't cost extra for Office 365 Business Premium subscribers, and Microsoft is also planning to add it to Office 365 E3 and E5 subscriptions at some point, but no timeline was indicated. \nOutlook Customer Manager, when it arrives, will show up under the Home tab in Outlook 2016 for Windows. Nothing needs to be installed on the backend to get it to work, but the new offering does depend on using Microsoft's datacenters to store the information that gets surfaced by the application within Outlook. It organizes information from \"emails, meetings, calls, notes, files, tasks, deals and deadlines\" within Outlook in a timeline format. The solution produces reminders within Outlook on the tasks that need to get done. \nThere's also a \"focused list\" view that shows business deal information in a table format: [Click on image for larger view.] Outlook Customer Manager's list view. Source: Microsoft blog post . \nThe information brought together by Outlook Customer Manager can be viewed on iOS-based mobile devices. Microsoft is planning apps support on other mobile device platforms \"over time.\" The mobile app lets users scan business cards to store the information. It also provides access to customer information while on the go. \nThe information tracked in Outlook Customer Manager can be shared with coworkers, if wanted. The product's name suggests it's a somewhat lightweight version of a customer relationship management solution, but that's just the next step, according to Microsoft's description. \n\"And as your business needs grow, you can move to Dynamics 365 to take advantage of enhanced customer information, process efficiency and consistency, and deeper financial and customer insights,\" the announcement suggested. \nThe addition of Outlook Customer Manager is the latest addition to the Office 365 Business Premium plan that's specifically focused on aiding small businesses. In July, Microsoft added a new Bookings appointment portal feature for Office 365 Business Premium subscribers that lets customers set up appointments with small businesses. Bookings is designed to work with Outlook, Outlook.com Google Calendar, and it also can connect with Facebook .

      "text": "Software Microsoft has found a way to bring human language intelligence to our dumb computers When it comes to human language, computers are dumb. But Microsoft thinks it has a way to teach computers how to read and understand human language. By Mark Kaelin | November 14, 2016, 4:00 PM PST Google Plus \nImage: iStockphoto.com/Niyazz \nDespite what companies like Microsoft may have told you, when it comes to truly understanding human language, computers are still just dumb machines. Sure, a computer can recognize the word \"cat\" and repeat it in a text message, but it has little concept of what a \"cat\" is. Whereas a human knows that a cat is an animal, a cat is a mammal, a cat is domesticated and humans keep them as pets, and that cat videos have taken over the internet. \nThis discrepancy between knowing a \"word\" and understanding a \"word\" is the missing link that keeps artificial intelligence and machine learning from reaching its full potential as a tool that can help users work, play, and live better. Notwithstanding self-aware machines taking over the world in an earth-shattering cataclysm, of course. \nIn November 2016, researchers at Microsoft Research Asia announced technology designed to help computers conceptualize in a humanlike fashion . They call it the Microsoft Concept Graph , and it may provide the means for computers to finally understand human language. Microsoft Concept Graph Want more about Windows?

The idea is a major component of ongoing efforts to computationally simulate human thinking. If a computer can understand the concept behind a word, it can then understand the context surrounding the use of the word. So a computer can stop taking everything we say literally and instead start understanding and anticipating what we actually mean. \nOne of the practical concepts the researchers mentioned was keyword advertising. It would be helpful for all concerned if the keyword advertising you see when you are web browsing were more pertinent and a lot less ham-fisted. The subtlety of not only knowing that I am searching for the price of a house for sale down the block, but also knowing that I don't want to buy it and am just curious about the potential price of my house if it were for sale, is important. \nWith this kind of research, artificial intelligence may be able to make those subtle distinctions and provide a better experience for us all. Bottom line Microsoft News \nArtificial intelligence and machine learning applications are the prototype technologies that companies like Microsoft are trying so desperately to make an everyday reality. As a business strategy, it makes sense. Many of us are carrying computers around with us all day, after all. The more that smartphone can conceptualize and contextualize about you and the environment you exist in, the more it can do to help you navigate through that environment. \nResearch like the Microsoft Concept Graph uses our previous behavior patterns to give our computing devices \"experience\" they would not normally possess. Armed with that knowledge, someday your smartphone may end up knowing more about you than you know about yourself. Perhaps one day, all any of us will have to do in the morning is say, \"Cortana, what should I do today?\" Keep up with all the latest news from Microsoft.

      "text": "0 Panos Panay, Corporate Vice President for Surface Computing holds the new Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop at a live event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nThe Surface Book 2, which is technically the Surface Book i7 or the Surface Book with Performance Base, is one of Microsoft’s most popular new products. It is basically a slight upgrade from the original device, but with a better and more powerful base unit. \nThe strongest selling point of the Surface Book has always been its feature to transform from a standard notebook to a tablet, thereby making it one of the most efficient hybrid devices in the industry. It acts as a laptop when connected to the keyboard, but separating the screen from its base turns it into a tablet. And while the original Surface Book was well received, the Surface Book i7 is even better though more costly at US$3,299 (AU$4,360). \nREAD: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017 specs and features: Stylus with rechargeable battery system hinted; Early 2017 release possible \nThe Performance Base sports an upgraded GPU, which features a 2GB GDDR5 Nvidia 965M chip. Microsoft also improved the battery life as the entire Surface Book i7 will reportedly last 16 hours on a full charge. Straight from the box, the device also runs on the latest update of Windows 10. \nInterested buyers have an option between 8GB or 16GB of RAM, as well as internal storage variants of 256GB, 512GB and 1TB. The weight of the laptop is relatively heavy at 1,647g, while the tablet itself is 725g. The screen, which is 13.5 inches with PixelSense, boasts a 3000x2000 pixel resolution. It also has the same sixth generation Intel Core i7 processor, Surface Pen compatibility, USB A 3.0 ports, SD Card slot and 3.5mm audio jack as the original. \nREAD: Microsoft Surface Book i7 latest news & update: Insanely long battery life & super graphics performance overshadow high price \nOne possible drawback of the Surface Book i7 is that it is slightly heavier and thicker than its predecessor. However, as Windows Central reported, it actually feels better to hold and use. Furthermore, Microsoft delivers on what it seems to have intended, which is a powerful device that caters to the top-end of the market.",

      "text": "Comments 0 Advertisement \nGive Microsoft credit for announcing what they're going to do, then doing it -- or at least planning on doing it, if the website hijinks of Monday, November 14, are any indication. Today, briefly, a page went live announcing that Visual Studio would be made available for the Mac platform. This is a big deal because it's one more sign that Microsoft is pushing its constellation of products and services away from a Windows-centric world. \nPlatform agnosticism -- the notion that it should not matter which OS your software runs on, it just matters that you can work on whatever device or machine you need to -- is everywhere, especially in the development community. When Microsoft bought Xamarin Studio, they were buying into that idea. In practical terms, if Microsoft's got a built-in audience of people who were used to Xamarin, then that helps Microsoft expand its mobile apps space; the developers can more easily write something that works in macOS/iOS and Windows. \nBut the long-term play here is not \"We'll fool people into developing for Windows.\" The long-term play is the same one that's been articulated in earnings calls and even keynotes: Microsoft is moving away from the desktop operating system as the driver of its revenue and the font of its ingenuity. It's going all-in on a business model where user adoption is predicated on cloud and mobile use, not desktop share. \nAnd on Wednesday -- when we're likely to see that yanked page back up -- we'll see if Microsoft sticks to the message they've been sending: Platforms are merely a detail in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.",

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 20 screenshots Collect your information in one easy-to-find place, gather all sorts of data, organize them your own way, and share them with others with just a click IMPORTANT NOTICE Part of different editions of the industry-leading Microsoft Office suite, Microsoft OneNote is an advanced, rich-featured note taking application that aims to take information organization to a whole new level. Its purpose is to provide a reliable and streamlined digital notebook capable of replacing traditional paper notes and encouraging multi-user collaboration. Microsoft OneNote comes with a variate array of tools for easy information gathering and managing. Its main advantage is related to the organizational capabilities, enabling the users to collect text, multimedia content (images, video, audio) and all kinds of data and place it in a single document in order to structure ideas and thoughts in an efficient manner. Notes can be organized in any way you want and jumping between notebooks is possible thanks to the easy to use navigation bar. You can merge notebook sections to change its structure and avoid information regrouping using the quick filling function. A notebook can embed tables, charts, pictures, screen clippings, links, handwritten text, drawings, audio and video recordings, equations, symbols and attached files. The enhanced search tool enables you to immediately find the desired section, while note prioritization and recent file recordings makes it easier to identify the information you are looking for. OneNote seamlessly integrates, as expected, with utilities included in the Office suite, as well as other applications. You can link notes to a webpage, assign them a reference to a Word document or a PowerPoint presentation or transfer a task to Outlook. Sharing notes with other users is also possible and thanks to the technology it relies on, OneNote allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, bringing people together and encouraging team work. With its familiar Ribbon-based interface, Microsoft OneNote combines ease of use with advanced capabilities and robust features. It provides efficient and reliable information organization options, offering you the possibility to create your own work style.

      "text": "The meeting that made Marc Benioff run away from a deal with Microsoft The new Microsoft is too much like the old one, the Salesforce CEO says. share While Microsoft and Salesforce have been partners — and at times considered being even more than that — Marc Benioff says the relationship has soured, in part because the new Microsoft is too much like the old one. In particular, Benioff pointed to a meeting that was set up between him and Scott Guthrie, who was then running Microsoft Azure, the company’s cloud-based operating system. A few weeks after the meeting, Benioff learned that Guthrie was taking over as head of the CRM business that competes directly with Salesforce. “I was just very kind of surprised by this,” Benioff said Monday, speaking at Code Enterprise in San Francisco. “It’s not something I would do. Things like that kept happening.” Things escalated when Salesforce found itself invited and then uninvited to a Microsoft partner conference, Benioff said. Salesforce and Microsoft have always had something of a complicated relationship, being partners, competitors and even potential participants in a merger. More recently, though, the rivalry has turned bitter. In addition to the issue with Guthrie, Microsoft and Salesforce were also in a bidding war over LinkedIn. Benioff actually offered more for LinkedIn , and said he was even willing to go higher . More recently, Benioff has warned that Microsoft could be violating antitrust laws by combining its powerful position in office software with LinkedIn’s data, asking officials in Europe to look into the matter . recode_divider",

      "text": "\nPhoto via Microsoft BTW \nToday Microsoft announced the release of Microsoft Visual Studio for Mac, bringing its mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C# to Apple products for the first time. A few hours later they pulled the announcement notice down . \nVisual Studio is a platform tool for developers. By making it work across platforms, Microsoft will hopefully be able to encourage developers who work on Macs to build their apps for Windows as well. \nYou can find the original announcement via Google cache . While Visual Studio will be coming to Mac in mostly the same format as its found on Windows, there will be some minor differences. \nAccording to the original release: ￼ \nAt its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. \nThere are some reasons Microsoft might have pulled down the announcement, from changing features to an internal schedule. Either way, you’ll see it debuted later this week at its Connect developer event. ",

      "text": "Thomson Reuters \nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff made it clear he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella.\nSpeaking at the Code Conference on Monday, Benioff talked about the short-lived bromance between the two companies and how it all ended up falling apart over a course of just two years.\nIn particular, Benioff pointed to a meeting that took place between him and Microsoft's cloud boss Scott Guthrie that really killed the trust he had placed in the company.\nThe story goes that Benioff took a meeting with Guthrie after his old friend and Microsoft chairman John Thompson connected the two last year. He believed the meeting was intended to share more about Salesforce's business in hopes of possibly becoming an Azure cloud customer one day. But that wasn't Microsoft's real goal, according to Benioff. He said:\n\"The message was 'Why don’t you meet with Scott Guthrie? He runs Azure and would really like to walk you through the details of your business because maybe we could get Salesforce to run on Azure'... and I'm like OK, and it was clear also that he was someone not in our business, he was running Azure.\"\nBut then a couple weeks later, Benioff found out through press reports that Guthrie had suddenly been promoted to also run Microsoft's CRM business, which is a direct competitor to Salesforce. Things got even worse when Salesforce was disinvited from a Microsoft customer event without prior notice. Benioff continued:\n\"I just came to the conclusion at that point that the new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft. ... And little things like this started stacking up and we put it all together, I don’t feel like this is exactly the new Microsoft that we were looking for.\"\nSalesforce and Microsoft were not always on the best terms before Nadella became CEO in 2014. The old Microsoft is known for not being particularly friendly with outside partners and Benioff used to openly criticize ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.\nNadella was different, quickly becoming good friends with Benioff, and even speaking at Salesforce's big annual conference Dreamforce for the first time in 2015.\nBut the relationship took a quick turn lately after Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn earlier this year.\nSalesforce is now trying to convince European regulators to block or impose certain conditions on the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal, claiming it would shutter access to LinkedIn's data. Salesforce, meanwhile, signed a deal with Amazon Web Services, instead of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform this year.\nNOW WATCH: Here's what it's like to use Microsoft's new Paint 3D \n",

      "text": "Comment Microsoft's Windows Defender is currently under investigation by the Russian antitrust authority Federal Antimonopoly Service. The tech company is alleged to have abused its position among other antivirus software. (Lasse Havelund via Flickr) \nMicrosoft has already patched the critical vulnerability of Windows 10 that Google exposed. However, the tech giant has another serious issue to deal with. Microsoft is under investigation by the Russian antitrust authority Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). The alleged culprit is its antivirus software Windows Defender. The company is alleged to have violated a federal law. This was initiated by a complaint from the Russian internet security company Kaspersky Lab. \nZDNet reports that Microsoft may be in violation of the Part 1 Article 10 of the Federal Law \"On Protection of Competition\" . The tech company could have abused its position among other antivirus software. The law states that Microsoft is prohibited to occupy dominant positions in the market from engaging in actions that can lead to \"preventing, restricting, eliminating competition\" and/or \"infringing the interests of other persons (economic entities) in business activities or consumers at large\". \nThe investigation came after the Kaspersky Lab pointed out how Microsoft cut down the adapting compatibility of third-party antivirus software for the Windows 10 OS from 2 months to 6 calendar days. Apparently, this abuse in dominance could affect the performance of the antivirus software on the devices. The said software should be made compatible to the operating system of the device used. \nFAS' Deputy Head Anatoly Golomolzin explained the issue further. He said that Windows Defender \"switches on automatically if the third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time\". Thus, the user would have to depend on Microsoft's own antivirus software. The FAS pointed out that this gives an unreasonable advantage to the tech company in the antivirus software market. The Federal Antimonopoly Service just wants to make sure that all antivirus software are given fair competition in the said market. \nAccording to the International Business Times UK , Microsoft said in a statement that \"Microsoft Russia and Kaspersky Lab have a long history of cooperation in different areas.\" The company ensured that they are committed to fully complying with the Russian law. Though they are already under investigation, Microsoft revealed that they have not received an official notification from the FAS. The tech giant guaranteed to review it carefully. \nThe Windows Defender is not the only issue that came out of the Windows 10. Google had exposed the said operating system's critical vulnerabilities last October. Microsoft was not particularly pleased of the said public disclosure by Google. The flaw found in the system was just recently patched by Microsoft. ",

      "text": "Artificial Intelligence Microsoft, Nvidia work to speed up AI platform powering Cortana Microsoft and Nvidia collaborate to boost the deep-learning capabilities of CNTK, the underlying AI technology behind Cortana and Skype language translator More good reads \nNvidia's DGX-1 supercomputer packs the horsepower of 250 servers. Credit: Nvidia Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | November 14, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Hardware \nThanks to artificial intelligence, we have autonomous cars, chat bots, and speech recognition. Microsoft's CNTK (Cognitive Toolkit) is one among many platforms that trains computers to learn, and it's getting an upgrade. \nCNTK drives the Microsoft services Cortana and Skype language translation, and it boasts more than 90 percent accuracy in speech recognition tasks. Microsoft will soon release an upgraded CNTK toolkit, and one hardware maker wants to ensure the toolkit works best on its hardware. \nNvidia is partnering with Microsoft to optimize its GPU development tools for CNTK. The companies have created a set of deep-learning algorithms and libraries that will speed up CNTK to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition on GPUs. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nDeep-learning tools like CNTK are sandboxes in which developers can create a model for computers to solve a particular problem. The ultimate objective is to build a well-trained model that can accurately perform a specific task, such as shuffling through loads of medical data to diagnose a disease. \nBased on input, researchers are continuously modifying models and tweaking parameters. One such tweak optimizes neural networking connections for better AI capabilities and for scaling the training model over more GPUs and servers. \nThe training of computer models can run for days and require intense computing horsepower. GPUs power deep learning for companies like Google and Facebook, and Microsoft is allowing some customers to test GPUs as part of its Azure cloud service. The updated CNTK tools will run faster on Microsoft's Azure N Series cloud offerings, which run on GPUs based on Nvidia's older Kepler and Maxwell architectures. \nThe updated CNTK tools could be bought on-premises with Nvidia's DGX supercomputer, which costs US$129,000 and has eight Tesla P100 GPUs based on the latest Pascal architecture. \nNvidia has been working closely to optimize its GPU deep-learning libraries for the upcoming CNTK release, said Ian Buck, vice president for accelerated computing at Nvidia. \nGPUs from Nvidia already work on CNTK with existing libraries, but the new framework will provide a big performance upgrade. There is a 7.4 fold improvement in deep-learning training times across eight GPUs in a system, Buck said. \nBuck declined to comment on when the new tools would be released. \nNvidia has made improvements in tools like CUDNN, which provides the libraries and algorithms for GPU-based deep-learning. CUDNN is a core underlying technology of CUDA, which is Nvidia's parallel programming framework. \nThere are other deep-learning frameworks like Google's Tensor, Theano, and the open-source Caffe, which excels at image recognition. Companies like Intel and IBM have forked those frameworks to work best with their hardware. Nvidia's GPUs already support most of the deep-learning frameworks, but CNTK now has an edge. \nGoogle has come out with its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit, which is designed to improve deep learning results. Google can afford to build its own hardware because it deploys deep learning across on a larger scale, but it could be expensive for smaller companies to deploy deep-learning systems; instead they can turn to cloud services like Azure.

      "text": "Q: This morning I received an e-mail from Microsoft informing me that Outlook added an event (motel reservation in October) to my Outlook calendar. I was able to go in and click that I did not want events from my e-mail added to my calendar. But the bigger question is, “Why is Microsoft reading my e-mails at all?” I have Windows 10 which sent a major “upgrade” a few days ago to my computer.\nI Googled “Microsoft reading my e-mails” to see if others had the same experience, and got only a 2015 article in a British newspaper . Does it not disturb anyone else that Microsoft and apparently other large providers are reading our e-mails? From now on, I’ll make all reservations by phone, and bank in person. Am I overreacting? What are your thoughts on this matter? — Tom Obremski\nTech+ Anytime I hear something like this I always think about a saying popular in the cybersecurity community: “There are two types of companies in the world: Those that know they’ve been hacked and those that don’t.”\nBut in this case, there appears to be a third: people who use e-mail.\nHowever, local experts say, this isn’t some covert operation to spy on your messages or hack your technology. It’s technology that is trying to provide users with more information, including, at times, target advertisements. Google and other e-mail providers offer similar features, to pop up UPS shipping notifications, for example.\n“Many large software vendors have been attempting to implement automation to improve the user experience. While this step forward does encroach on user privacy, they are hoping this will help users to stay organized by automatically scanning for dates/times that could be imported to the calendar,” said Connor Madsen, threat research analyst at Webroot in Broomfield. “For typical users, it provides an ease-of-access function by cutting out several steps. For more advanced users, or those needing to maintain a higher level of security, Microsoft does provide the option to opt-out.”\nRelated Articles When a cyber stranger wants $300 in iTunes gift cards to fix your PC, please question it Messing with telemarketers — just don’t do it, say security experts Will anti-virus software prevent rootkit attacks? Should you trust a Yahoo security e-mail sent from Yahoo? Greg Foss, security operations lead at cybersecurity firm LogRhythm in Boulder, said that companies like Microsoft use algorithms to scrape your e-mail and look for words related to travel and reservations, shipping and delivery or other instances where the company can offer users additional services.\n“Now, that said, many people have issues with this just the same. It is the great tradeoff with using ‘free’ software. A common saying in the IT industry is that if a product is free, then the product is actually the user, not the service itself. They use this information to provide targeted advertisements to generate revenue, and some services go as far as selling this data directly to advertising agencies,” Foss said.\nScreenshot of Microsoft Outlook Logging into Microsoft Outlook online for the first time, here’s what I saw: Add-ins that were turned on that allowed companies to check for certain details in my inbox. Within Microsoft’s Outlook Mail online, a slew of add-ins are on by default including Bing Maps, PayPal for Outlook, Uber Ride Reminder and Yelp, when I checked my own account, which I never use. As Microsoft notes: “When this add-in is clicked, it will be able to access limited information in the active message, such as phone numbers, postal addresses or URLs in the message body or subject.”\nUncheck those if they are of no use. While you can also opt out of personal ads from various internet companies, that doesn’t mean ads will stop. However, here’s where to go to opt-out of personalized ads at the following sites:\nMicrosoft: choice.microsoft.com Google: dpo.st/googleoptout Yahoo: aim.yahoo.com Digital Advertising Alliance (represents many companies): aboutads.info/choices But to really get out of this uncomfortable situation, Foss recommends using a different e-mail service, such as ProtonMail , which encrypts the message and nixes advertising.\n“Therefore, if you’re concerned about advertisers potentially gaining access to your information, I would suggest that you look into services like ProtonMail, as they go to great lengths to protect their customers’ privacy,” he said.\nSee past Tech+ answers or ask your own tech question at dpo.st/mailbag .

      "title": "5 reasons to be excited for Microsoft’s Surface Studio",
      "text": "0 Comments \nOne of the biggest tech announcements of 2016 was Microsoft’s reveal of their upcoming Surface Studio device . Besides seeing Microsoft return their focus to desktop computers, there’s a lot of reasons to be excited for this specific product’s launch. Here are the five biggest features that have us most excited for the launch of the Surface Studio in 2017. The Surface Studio is Powerful \nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio is a beast. Powered by 6th Gen Intel Core processors and discrete NVIDIA GeForce graphics, this next gen PC should have no problem running any of the popular mainstream photo and video editing programs. There will also be three different models with a variety of power options for consumers who want something a little less-powerful at a lower price or need the top of the line specs at a price more premium. The Surface Studio is REALLY Thin \nThe Surface Studio looks stunning and is ridiculously thin for a device as powerful and fully-featured as it is. The 28-inch screen features a uniform depth from edge to edge and still manages to support Microsoft’s PixelSense Display technology, which can be seen on the current Surface Pro and Surface Book line of products . Microsoft Surface Dial and the Surface Studio The Surface Studio Transforms \nProbably the Surface Studio’s most prominent feature is its ability to transform from a traditional desktop computer form into a drafting table mode. This flexibility makes it not only an ideal device for showcasing media but for also creating it. There’s very little learning curve required for artists and designers to use the Surface Studio as it adapts to how people create media instead of requiring users to learn a new skillset. The Surface Dial \nMicrosoft is launching a new peripheral with the Surface Studio called, the Surface Dial . The Surface Dial will actually function with Surface Pros and Surface Books after a software update rolls out in the coming months, but there’s no denying that it’s been designed with the Surface Studio in mind. The Surface Dial is an entirely new concept that sort of merges the functionality of the touch-navigation and a mouse’s wheel to create a new form of interaction between the users and the technology they’re using. The way the Surface Dial is used will vary depending on the software that’s currently open. For example, in Word, the Surface Dial can be used to flick through pages while in a graphics program, the device can function as a color gradient tool and for selecting different filters and brushes. It’s going to be very interesting to see how developers and consumers implement the Surface Dial throughout 2017. Microsoft’s Surface Studio and Xbox Controller The Surface Studio is a Fully-Featured Windows 10 PC \nWhile the Surface Studio is primarily being marketed as a device for consumers in the media production industry, it’s worth mentioning that, at its core, the Surface Studio is also a fully-functional Windows 10 PC . It will ship with a copy of the Windows 10 Pro operating system and can be used for all of the usual Windows 10 applications. In particular, the Surface Pro will also make for a great media consumption device. With its large and pixel-dense screen, watching movies and TV shows will be significantly more enjoyable than viewing them on a Surface Pro as will playing video games like the growing library of Xbox Play Anywhere titles . \nAre you excited for the launch of the Surface Studio? What do you think its biggest selling points are? Let us know in the comments below. In this story stream:",

The addition will bring the company's total investment in related projects within the U.S. to over 500 megawatts. Through two separate agreements, 178 megawatts to be purchased in connection with the Bloom Wind project in Kansas (working with Allianz Risk Transfer) and 59 megawatts to come from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage projects in Wyoming (working with Black Hills Corp.), adjacent to Microsoft's Cheyenne datacenter. The combined generated output is expected to cover energy used at the Cheyenne center on an annual basis. Microsoft ( MSFT -2.1% ) president and chief legal officer Brad Smith: \"Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters. Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.\" The arrangements will results in Microsoft's third and fourth wind energy projects, with operations in Illinois and Texas already underway.

      "text": "SPAM Inappropriate ageofmythology 8h ago (Edited 8h ago) That is true. I didn't say Sony was going out of business anytime soon. First to market is undeniably big, especially from a sales standpoint. But being first doesn't mean the Pro doesn't have serious shortcomings. EDIT RESPONSE TO YOUR EDIT: Sony slams Microsoft in terms of first-party support, I agree. And really, Nintendo slams Sony, because they've had to essentially support their consoles themselves since the Wii. But just because Sony has more first-party support doesn't mean the Scorpio won't be a better multimedia and multi-platform console. As for the Switch, its hardware and its third-party support is still mostly unconfirmed. Whether the 4GB of ram will be seriously limiting remains to be seen.",

      "text": "  22:00 PM EST NVIDIA and Microsoft Accelerate AI Together GPU-Accelerated Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit Now Available in the Cloud on Microsoft Azure and On-Premises with NVIDIA DGX-1 \nSALT LAKE CITY, UT -- (Marketwired) -- 11/14/16 -- SC16 -- To help companies join the AI revolution, NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate AI in the enterprise. \nUsing the first purpose-built enterprise AI framework optimized to run on NVIDIA® Tesla® GPUs in Microsoft Azure or on-premises, enterprises now have an AI platform that spans from their data center to Microsoft's cloud. \n\"Every industry has awoken to the potential of AI,\" said Jen-Hsun Huang, founder and chief executive officer, NVIDIA. \"We've worked with Microsoft to create a lightning-fast AI platform that is available from on-premises with our DGX-1 supercomputer to the Microsoft Azure cloud. With Microsoft's global reach, every company around the world can now tap the power of AI to transform their business.\" \n\"We're working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world's most pressing problems,\" said Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft. \"By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we've made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.\" \nThis jointly optimized platform runs the new Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK) on NVIDIA GPUs, including the NVIDIA DGX-1 supercomputer , which uses Pascal architecture GPUs with NVLink interconnect technology , and on Azure N-Series virtual machines, currently in preview. This combination delivers unprecedented performance and ease of use when using data for deep learning. \nAs a result, companies can harness AI to make better decisions, offer new products and services faster and provide better customer experiences. This is causing every industry to implement AI. In just two years, the number of companies NVIDIA collaborates with on deep learning has jumped 194x to over 19,000. Industries such as healthcare, life sciences, energy, financial services, automotive and manufacturing are benefiting from deeper insight on extreme amounts of data. \nThe Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit trains and evaluates deep learning algorithms faster than other available toolkits, scaling efficiently in a range of environments -- from a CPU, to GPUs, to multiple machines -- while maintaining accuracy. NVIDIA and Microsoft worked closely to accelerate the Cognitive Toolkit on GPU-based systems and in the Microsoft Azure cloud, offering startups and major enterprises: Greater versatility: The Cognitive Toolkit lets customers use one framework to train models on premises with the NVIDIA DGX-1 or with NVIDIA GPU-based systems, and then run those models in the cloud on Azure. This scalable, hybrid approach lets enterprises rapidly prototype and deploy intelligent features. Faster performance: When compared to running on CPUs, the GPU-accelerated Cognitive Toolkit performs deep learning training and inference much faster on NVIDIA GPUs available in Azure N-Series servers and on premises.(1) For example, NVIDIA DGX-1 with Pascal and NVLink interconnect technology is 170x faster than CPU servers for the Cognitive Toolkit. Wider availability: Azure N-Series virtual machines powered by NVIDIA GPUs are currently in preview to Azure customers, and will be generally available soon. Azure GPUs can be used to accelerate both training and model evaluation. With thousands of customers already part of the preview, businesses of all sizes are already running workloads on Tesla GPUs in Azure N-Series VMs. \nNVIDIA and Microsoft plan to continue their collaboration to help optimize the Cognitive Toolkit for NVIDIA GPUs in Azure and as part of a hybrid cloud AI platform, when connected to NVIDIA DGX-1 on premises. \nMore Resources",

      "text": "Taqtile co-founder Dirck Schou and Vice President of Product Management Kelly Malone take me through their new HoloMaps application. Credit: Taqtile. Seattle-based Taqtile has developed a new interactive and collaborative 3D maps app for Microsoft’s HoloLens and other virtual and mixed reality headsets — blending the physical and digital worlds for a variety of interesting and practical uses.\nUnveiled at the Smart City Expo in Spain this week, Taqtile’s new HoloMaps program renders cityscapes, forests and many other types of areas and landscapes using Bing 3D, and allows multiple people to view and play around with maps at the same time.\nOn a consumer basis, the app is only being released for HoloLens right now, through the Microsoft Store , but the enterprise version also works on other headsets such as HTC Vive and Oculus Rift . Additionally, people using different devices can still participate in the same collaboration session. Right now, the HoloLens version of the product sports a few more capabilities, such as voice searching, though Taqtile is continuing to work on and add to all versions of the product.\nGeekWire got a chance to demo the new application at Taqtile’s Seattle office last week. Our demo was HoloLens-centric with a little bit of Vive thrown in. That makes sense, given that Taqtile is one of seven firms in Microsoft’s HoloLens Agency Readiness Program, and Kelly Malone , the company’s vice president of product management spent more than 10 years at Microsoft.\nIn our session, Malone effortlessly manipulated the maps, rotating and zooming as he pleased and switching to different locations via voice command. We started in downtown Seattle, where traffic was snarled on Friday afternoon (go figure) due to an accident that showed up on the map. From there we went to the Space Needle and then started traveling the globe, visiting Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Niagara Falls and Torrey Pines Golf Course.\nHere is a portion of my visit, captured by Taqtile:\n\nIt was a cool experience to look down on the Seattle skyline and be as tall as the Space Needle. The images were not of the highest resolution but were clear enough to tell what everything was. That is a result of running the program on the headset. Using a tethered PC, as is the case with the Vive and the Rift, allows images to be displayed at a much higher quality.\nA variety of data can be laid over the 3D maps. The options we saw included traffic conditions, location-tagged tweets and weather forecasts for the areas displayed on the map. Users can also draw and write notes on maps that can be saved for later use. Businesses can bring in their own information and Taqtile will work with them to integrate it into maps.\n“The concept for this whole platform is to make it very easy for customers to bring in whatever sort of data sources they want to overlay on top of this,” said Dirck Schou, co-founder of Taqtile.\nFuturistic apps like this are a blast to play with, but they also represent a less exciting, but definitely practical, innovation for the business community: the evolution of working collaboratively. Meetings gave way to calls and eventually services like Skype. This is the next step in that progression.\n\nTaqtile’s first maps customer was the PGA Tour. GeekWire got a chance to demo the PGA Tour app earlier this year , which lets folks interact with 3D models of different holes overlaid with a bevy of statistics. The bootstrapped firm is also building a HoloLens app for Real Madrid, which inked a four-year partnership with Microsoft in 2015 .\nMalone said Taqtile is in active discussions with a couple of sports teams to use the app to display stadium remodel plans for the public and also use it as a sales tool for potential sponsors. It’s no surprise that Taqtile is emphasizing sports early on, as the company spent its early years building sports and venue related apps. But the company has grown to approximately 90 people in six offices around the world in places like Brazil and Belarus. With that growth, Schou and Malone envision many uses that go beyond sports.\n“The list of different things you can integrate is somewhat endless,” Malone said.\nIn an emergency situation like a terrorist attack, or something less severe, like a traffic backup, representatives from different agencies could join each other in a virtual command center and figure out the best escape routes. Annotating streets and other sites could be useful for public works projects, allowing workers in the field to compare notes with people at the office. In the legal world, Schou said, the product could be used to recreate crime scenes and bring them into the courtroom.\nMalone and Schou said they are talking to security agencies about using the maps to build plans for big events like the Super Bowl. The maps can be used to look at points of interest in a stadium and figure out things like line-of-sight for the best places to station security personnel.\n\nTaqtile recognizes that not everyone is going to have a HoloLens or a virtual reality headset in every situation. To that end, maps can be captured, via the camera on a HoloLens device, or a stabilized camera hooked up to a headset, and projected onto a screen. That could be useful in the case of a public meeting, where, for example, a municipality might want to show what a rezoned neighborhood looks like, or how a power company putting in new lines might affect an area.\nThe biggest challenge for Taqtile, as well as other companies building apps and experiences for virtual and mixed reality, is the devices themselves. These devices are spendy, and there are still some kinks to work out. HoloLens isn’t even widely available yet, and the developer edition runs $3,000. The HTC Vive, which is available publicly, runs for $799. There are cheaper alternatives out there as well, but the reality — at least for now — is that not everyone can afford one. But Schou says it’s still early for virtual/mixed/augmented reality, and devices will get better and cheaper over time.\n“This is a V1 device, what you are seeing is V1, and it’s able to do this, imagine what the next version is going to be,” Malone said. “It’s probably going to be lighter, smaller, and it’s probably going to actually be much higher quality.”",

      "text": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff speaks during an interview Nov. 14, 2016, by Recode co-founder Kara Swisher at Code Enterprise in San Francisco, via webcast. Despite his wishful predictions that Donald Trump would never become president, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff suggested on Monday evening that people forget their anxiety and give Trump a chance – at least initially. Speaking at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco, the politically outspoken and activist Benioff also revealed what turned him away from acquisition talks with Microsoft, and talked about the company’s brush with buying Twitter.\n“Over the weekend, I’ve seen a wide variety of emotions from my friends – from tears to anger to anxiety and stress – and we have to have a reset, let go of our fears,” Benioff said during his 45-minute interview by Kara Swisher, the co-founder of conference organizer Recode . “There’s a rhetoric when you’re campaigning, and now there’s an adjustment. He said President Obama is actually a great guy. So there’s a lot of positive stuff coming. I’m going to keep that position for now.”\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff is interviewed Nov. 14, 2016, by Recode co-founder Kara Swisher at Code Enterprise. After the election he tweeted , “Congratulations President Trump. This is what makes America great – our democracy. Now is the time for us to come together as one country.”\nAsked just what Silicon Valley wants from Washington, D.C., Benioff said it wants patent reform, which “unfortunately got killed in the Senate,” as he noted. Silicon Valley also wants repatriation of foreign capital at a reasonable tax rate, which hasn’t happened under Obama but has been promised by Trump . It and wants H-1B visa expansion, while Trump has vowed to curtail their use.\nIn response to the election of vice president-to-be Mike Pence, against whom he squared off over a restrictive state LGBTQ law when Pence was Indiana’s governor, Benioff said, “I’ll continue to do everything I have been doing. It’s important to me that we keep looking out for everybody in all our people. He signed the law, and then he changed it. There was some enlightenment involved. We were able to move on and move forward.”\nBenioff called for more CEOs to become more activist.\n“We’re shifting from CEOs being all about the shareholders to being all about stakeholders,” he said. “You should have a point of view and be clear about what it is. The CEO has to be willing to take on the risk (that he could be fired by the board for being outspoken). If this election shows anything, it shows you’d better let your voice be known.”\nMicrosoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff. (Microsoft File Photo) Asked whether Salesforce had ever been an acquisition target, Benioff related that when Satya Nadella became Microsoft CEO and an old friend, John Thompson, became chairman of the board, Thompson “made the case that it’s a new Microsoft, they were going to change their business ethics and how they want to do partnerships, and we should engage.”\nShortly thereafter, “we had a lot of conversations about the different possible relationships between Salesforce and Microsoft. . . . We looked at every possible option.”\nAt about the same time, Nadella called Benioff and asked Benioff to meet with Scott Guthrie, the head of Azure, “to walk him through the details of your business, because maybe we can get Salesforce to run on Azure and that would be very exciting for you. It was clear he wasn’t in our business, so I had this meeting with him.”\nA couple of weeks later, Benioff said, “I read that Scott was now running (Microsoft’s) CRM business. I was very surprised by that. I came to the conclusion that the new Microsoft was actually the old Microsoft.”\nSimilar things continued to put him off Microsoft, including first being invited to a partner conference and then being disinvited, he said.\nThe companies announced a cloud partnership in May 2014 but more recently competed against each other for LinkedIn, and Benioff has asked regulators to investigate Microsoft’s planned $26 billion acquisition of the business social network.\nAs to Salesforce’s flirtation with purchasing Twitter , “one my key stakeholders – my shareholders – made it very clear they wanted me to exit that idea, and I did, because I had no choice. . . . I had a really uncomfortable meeting with 200 shareholders at Dreamforce, and they said, ‘You need to listen more closely to us,’ and I agreed.”\nCode Enterprise, which also features appearances by Google Cloud senior VP Diane Greene and LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, is oriented toward senior-level executives and continues through Tuesday. Watch the archived video of Benioff’s appearance below.\nEditor’s Note: Salesforce is a GeekWire annual sponsor. ",

      "text": "Forget MacBook Pro tales, Microsoft's Surface is already a success  01 AM EST   Getty images/Microsoft Surface pro) A Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet \nApple has for a very long time maintained a reputation as the best computer pro ducer in the world, especially when we come to hardware qualities. However, this title is about to fade away with the looming Microsoft Surface gadgets, which are about to be released. Already, the existing Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book are doing really well in the market. However, these two remained a scrawny threat to the MacBook Pro for the entire 2016, until rumor broke out that their upgrades would completely eliminate the need for any Mac Laptop. Namely, the two upgrades are Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Microsoft Surface book 2 . Advertisement \nAccording to Forbes , Microsoft 's choice of hardware quality for the current Surface devices is something that should worry Apple . The existing Surface devices are comparatively equal to the current MacBook Pro in terms of durability and compactness. The earlier Surface RT hardware which was a bit wobbly at its launch in 2 01 2 has been replaced with something that is pretty much undistinguishable from Apple 's MacBook Air in the current Microsoft Surface Books . \nEven so, Apple is not ignorant of the fact that its serious competitors such as Microsoft are coming up really well and they are therefore working on better flagships such as their rumored MacBook Pro 2 016. CNET has revealed the possibility of 4K resolutions in the successive MacBook laptops as well as likelihood that all new Mac s will feature next generation Intel Kaby Lake pro cessors. This can be easily concluded from the fact that Apple has been working closely with LG in developing 4K screens, probably to ensure that all consequent Mac s have 4K resolutions. Advertisement \nOn the other hand the new Surface Gadgets will not only feature 4K screens but also new designs that are more attractive and practical than those of MacBook laptops. All the same we are hopeful that the subsequent MacBook laptops will compete favorably with the Surface gadgets. Though, from the look of things Apple is a few steps behind Microsoft. © 2016 Mstars News, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Advertisement",

      "text": "By John Allwright • November 14, 2016 \nDriven by customer demand, Pivotal and Microsoft are working together to help enterprise customers realize their digital transformation goals. We’ve delivered a fully self-service Pivotal Cloud Foundry in Azure to give customers the ability to run cloud-native Java and .NET applications on Microsoft’s global public cloud infrastructure. “For us, enterprises are not an afterthought, they’re our design point.” Scott Guthrie – Executive Vice President, Cloud and Enterprise, Microsoft \nMicrosoft Azure provides an ideal enterprise cloud, building on Microsoft’s heritage of datacenter software, developer tools and, more recently, cloud services such as Office 365 and Bing. If you’re a Microsoft customer, you have significant investments in on-premises software and are likely taking a close look at how to extend your footprint to Azure. \nJoint customers such as GE , Ford , Dell , and Manulife are already realizing the benefits of deploying cloud-native applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Microsoft Azure infrastructure and services. \nMany of these customers aren’t just looking for another place to run their applications but for a different way to build their applications. Pivotal and Microsoft offer a solution to help these customers transform into software-driven enterprises. Microsoft and several of our customers have also shown their commitment to this vision by investing in Pivotal. \nHere are just a few reasons why customers are so excited about Pivotal Cloud Foundry on Microsoft Azure: 1. Built For Business \nPivotal’s close collaboration with Microsoft goes way beyond simply making Cloud Foundry available in Azure’s global marketplace. Together we’ve delivered an end to end, enterprise-class cloud-native platform experience. We’ve built Azure specific integrations, as well as invested in full support of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Service Brokers and the BOSH CPI through Microsoft’s global support teams working with Pivotal’s experts. Whenever you need help, you quickly get experts on-hand, whether they’re at Pivotal or Microsoft. \nMany enterprise customers are hungry to transform their businesses through software, but struggling to find the right partners to make such a big bet. If you’re looking for partners that can teach you how to build cloud software the Silicon Valley way but also understand the needs of enterprise, Microsoft and Pivotal are a great choice. “As enterprise customers are looking to the cloud to transform their businesses, they are increasingly turning to Microsoft Azure as the enterprise-ready cloud platform that supports customer choice. Many of these customers are also choosing the combination of Pivotal’s deep expertise in agile development and ops and the open source Cloud Foundry platform, coupled with Azure’s enterprise credibility and global reach, to give them competitive advantage.” Corey Sanders, Partner Director of Program Management, Microsoft Azure 2. Simple to Deploy \nAzure’s support for the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager tool streamlines the process of building and running Pivotal Cloud Foundry environments. Ops Manager also offers deployment ‘tiles’ for quickly deploying and upgrading popular services onto Cloud Foundry, including Redis, RabbitMQ, GemFire and other 3rd party services. In place of manual assembly with the risk of human error, Ops Manager gives you a repeatable, predictable tool for constructing highly available systems. Caption : Operations Manager running on Microsoft Azure 3. Cloud-Native, On-Demand, Wherever You Need It \nWhen used as the infrastructure beneath Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Microsoft Azure offers excellent geographic and hybrid flexibility to meet your needs when deploying and operating cloud-native applications. Microsoft Azure claims more datacenter regions worldwide than any other cloud vendor, including support for 34 regions in 8 different countries, allowing you to plan for business continuity and disaster recovery while maintaining compliance with data sovereignty and security requirements. 4. Java, check. .NET, check. \nWith Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Microsoft Azure adds an open source microservices platform for enterprise developers to build and run applications in Java, .NET, Node.js, and other popular frameworks. For Java developers, Pivotal is the main contributor to the Java Spring Boot project, the most popular microservices developer technology, with over 8.8 million downloads per month. Naturally, Spring and Spring Boot run seamlessly on Pivotal Cloud Foundry—but . NET developers are also well catered for as SteelToe provides them with painless microservice patterns. In reality, many enterprises today have both Java and .NET development efforts and the good news is that a single Cloud Foundry environment can support both, enabling consolidation of development process and operations around a single platform. 5. Add Azure Superpowers To Your App \nThe service broker for Azure makes many of Azure’s powerful, enterprise-grade services available to developers through Cloud Foundry, including: SQLDatabase : A managed cloud database for app developers Blob Storage : Massively-scalable object storage for unstructured data Redis Cache : High throughput, consistent low-latency data access DocumentDB : Blazing fast, planet-scale NoSQL ServiceBus : Reliable cloud messaging as a service (MaaS) and simple hybrid integration \nThe Cloud Foundry service broker helps developers connect their applications with other services— it’s a hugely popular pattern and one that other open source projects are looking to adopt. Service Brokers help developers get the best out of the underlying cloud services. They give developers access to the range of underlying cloud services, but through a consistent interface. For more on services brokers and how they work, check out the documentation . 6. Compliance Without The Grind \nWhen it comes to compliance, Microsoft’s already done a lot of the heavy lifting for you at the infrastructure level, with the broadest set of certifications of any cloud provider: \nBuilding on this foundation, Michael Cote explains how building on a cloud native platform helps ensure compliance in your applications to match those in the underlying cloud infrastructure: When we standardize on a cloud platform, like Pivotal Cloud Foundry™ , and then get our auditors to trust it, we can dramatically reduce compliance bottlenecks. One of the US federal agencies taking this approach has shown that you can fold compliance wait-times down from about a year to just two or three days .
