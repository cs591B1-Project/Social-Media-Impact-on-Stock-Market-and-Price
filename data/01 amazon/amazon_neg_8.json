      "text": " 21 PM EST Jamaican Cookbook “50 Favorite Jamaican Recipes” debuts as #1 Best Seller on Amazon \nColorful new cookbook ‘50 Favorite Jamaican Recipes’ debuted as a #1 Bestseller in Cookbooks and #13 in all promotional book downloads on Amazon Kindle in September 2016. The collection of authentic recipes has been described by readers as “gorgeous”, “spot on” and “an absolute necessity in the kitchen of all Caribbean foodies”. \nExecutive Producer of Caribbean cooking show “Taste the Islands” Calibe Thompson admits that although she’s a fan of food, she isn’t so much a fan of cooking. Chef Irie, the star of her national PBS / Create TV series, creates culinary masterpieces effortlessly, but Thompson herlsef needs a little help where the kitchen is concerned. \nLooking for a reliable source of the traditional Jamaican recipes that hearkened back to her island upbringing, she could only identify an Enid Donaldson cookbook from back in the 80s. So she set about creating a new reference book for Jamaican and non-Jamaican food lovers. \n‘50 Favorite Jamaican Recipes’ is a beautifully illustrated, delightfully annotated recipe collection that includes the most popular traditional and authentic Jamaican foods and drinks. The 138 pages of flavor-filled recipes, some of which inspired the gourmet creations from “Taste the Islands with Chef Irie”, include simple, step-by-step instructions and mouthwatering images. \nFive sections including Breakfasts & Appetizers, Side Dishes, and Drinks & Desserts list dishes like Stuffed Roasted Fish, Stewed Oxtails, Cream of Pumpkin Soup, Ripe Banana Fritters and Coconut Drops. Notes included with each recipe aptly describe the flavors so that any reader, Jamaican or not, can make informed decisions about which to try. There are also breathtaking photos of the Jamaican landscape accompanied by witty commentary scattered throughout the book. \nThompson acknowledges that while there are many Jamaican cookbooks with new and unique recipes, there has not been one with these most staple, authentic favorites published for a generation. “These recipes were carefully curated and customized by the team at ‘Taste the Islands’ and we couldn’t be prouder of our first publication,” she said. \nThe newspaper Caribbean Today says, “It could easily take pride of place on your living room coffee table with its gorgeous pictures… The tidbits of history along with the mesmerizing images will definitely appeal to cooks and non-cooks. Inviting pictures of pristine waterfalls, a raft on a meandering river, and cows along a sparkling beach tell as much the story of Jamaican food as do the descriptive labels.” \nJamaican Eats Magazine says, “Wow. Gorgeous book. Love it. 50 recipes — very compact and efficient.” While one of the more than 8,000 Amazon readers who downloaded the book in its first 3 days online says, “Love the show and love this cookbook. The recipes are authentic and simple to follow. The photos are beautiful. And the finished product (the few that I’ve tried so far) are scrumptious! A marvelous achievement.” \n‘50 Favorite Jamaican Recipes’ is available now in ebook format and in print, both on Amazon. Signed copies are also available directly from the show’s website at www.tastetheislandstv.com/store , just in time for the holidays. \nAbout Taste the Islands \nTASTE THE ISLANDS is a half-hour cooking series featuring delightfully exotic, deliciously accessible Caribbean fare. Find it nationwide on PBS stations and Create® TV. Learn more at www.tastetheislandstv.com .",

      "text": "Apple, Amazon, Facebook fall as technology antipathy continues Disney advances as investors focus on forecast over earnings Share on Facebook \nU.S. stock-index futures fell, indicating the S&P 500 Index will halt a four-day winning streak, as investors continue to parse the implications of a Donald Trump presidency for the economy and interest rates. \nS&P 500 Index contracts expiring in December slid 0.6 percent to 2,154.25 at 6:35 a.m. in New York. The equity benchmark capped its longest winning streak since July yesterday, as financial companies extended gains, although progress was tempered by losses in technology and some defensive stocks. Bucking the trend, the Nasdaq 100 Index dropped the most since September. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,714, today, after the index posted its first record close in three months. \nAs the dust settles after the shock election result, the spotlight is intensifying on Trump’s policies and the possible winners and losers. Financial and health-care industries have so far emerged as the most likely beneficiaries amid speculation that the president-elect and Republican-controlled Congress will pare down regulations. Trump’s promise to revive the nation’s infrastructure means commodities needed for everything from airports to bridges will benefit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \n“The U.S. market is having a think about what a Trump presidency means,” said Paul Wildman, an analyst at Avalon Capital based in London. “I don’t think it will be terrible for business despite perhaps some protectionism. The market is worrying about not just one rate rise in December, it’s looking down into next year and thinking maybe the Fed might have to raise two or three or four times next year.” \nInvestors are also considering what a Trump presidency means for Federal Reserve policy and the trajectory of interest rates. Odds for a December increase in borrowing costs have risen to 80 percent from 78 percent a week ago. The University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment in November will be scrutinized today for indications of the health of the world’s biggest economy. \nAs Trump prepares to take over the White House, earnings season is coming to an end. About 76 percent of companies that reported so far beat profit projections and 56 percent topped sales estimates. Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth of 2.5 percent for the benchmark’s constituents, reversing forecasts for a 1.6 percent decline at the start of the month. \nAmong stocks moving in premarket New York trade, technology companies continued their declines, with Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. each losing more than 1 percent. \nWalt Disney Co. climbed 1.1 percent after predicting renewed growth next year and beyond even as fourth-quarter profit fell short of estimates. Nvidia Corp surged 13 percent after the biggest maker of graphics chips used by computer gamers forecast quarterly sales that signaled continued strong demand for its signature products and gains in new markets such as data centers.

      "text": "Printer-friendly version \n11 November 2016 \nKey market actors such as Amazon are bypassing their legal obligations to workers and putting public safety at risk in the process. That’s the stark finding of the BBC Inside Out’s latest investigation, with advice from the University of Bristol Law School on sham employment practices and supply chains. \n‘ What cost online shopping ?’, which airs on BBC1 on Friday 11 November at 7.30pm, highlights the practices of an agency, AHC Services Limited, which hires drivers to deliver parcels for third parties. One of the companies utilising AHC’s services is Amazon. Evidence about AHC and Amazon practices found by the BBC’s team of investigators was analysed by Tonia Novitz, Professor of Labour Law at the University of Bristol’s Law School. \nAmong the evidence examined by Professor Novitz were contracts issued by AHC to its supposedly self-employed drivers and information regarding relations between drivers and depot staff. Professor Novitz drew on established legal principle and precedent in concluding that the terms of the contract were most probably a ‘sham’, that drivers weren’t self-employed, that ANC controlled the relationship, and that there were fundamental breaches in the drivers’ rights as agency workers when it came to rest breaks, poor pay and working conditions, as well as apparent discrimination against foreign workers. \nA senior road safety officer and former police officer was also involved in analysing the evidence. With Professor Novitz, he confirmed there was potential disregard for health and safety protections – vehicles “hired” to drivers were not always roadworthy, and drivers were expected to work longer than UK regulations stipulate. \n“The case is upsetting on a number of levels,” said Professor Novitz. “Not only the poor treatment of workers, particularly migrant workers, but also what it means in terms of cost cutting for road safety and impact on our daily lives. There is an imperative to get parcels delivered rather than ensure the safety of a child on the pavement. It is time to put in place effective legislation on supply chains – and quickly. \n“This is a highly exploitative situation that leads people to believe they have no legal rights. Based on the evidence, it appears AHC are tying people into a sham contract in order to avoid responsibility and to save money. I don’t believe this is an isolated case and am worried about such changes in the workplace. Regardless of the legal status of the contract, Amazon also has a moral duty to protect workers in its supply chains.” Printer-friendly version Copy this html code to your website/blog to embed this press release. <a href=\"http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/bristol-law-expert-assists-bbc-exposing-sham-practices-distribution-firms\" class=\"active\">Bristol Law expert assists BBC in exposing sham practices of distribution firms</a>",

      "text": "By Ric Cowley , News Editor \nA federal judge has ruled that Amazon must reimburse parents of children who made in-app purchases without permission. \nChildren are estimated to have generated $86 million in unauthorised charges due to the ease of buying IAPs. \nAs a result, Amazon has been told to begin a year-long process to provide refunds to affected parents. It will have to set up a claims service in early 2017, and reimburse eligible users by the end of the year. \nChild's play \nThe suggestion that these refunds could be in the form of gift cards was denied. The judge said that the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue\". \nThe ruling comes over two years after Amazon had been accused by the Federal Trade Commission of making it too easy for children to buy IAPs in their games.",

      "text": "Tweet \nDash buttons have been growing in popularity since Amazon rolled them out in March of last year. The device is simple: Press the button, and you’ve ordered a product. Right now, all of Amazon’s Dash Buttons are $4.99, but that amount is refunded when you make your first order. \nWe’ve noticed, however, that some of Mainers’ favorite products weren’t offered as Dash Buttons. Through the magic of crude photo editing, here they are: \n1. Moxie \nMoxie’s dash button would be a hit with Mainers and out-of-staters who can’t find the product locally. Just make sure it’s not an antique six-pack you’re ordering. \n2. Quick-melt salt \nIt gets slippery on the front step when the temperatures drop. Make sure you’re stocked up with quick-melting salt to keep your traction. \n3. B&M Baked Beans \nWhat better than a can of Portland-packed baked beans during a nor’easter? \n4. Wool socks \nYou have L.L. Bean boots to keep you dry, so, naturally, you need wool socks to keep you warm. \n5. Bug spray \nThere’s nothing worse about summer in Maine than mosquitoes and black flies. One press of a button, and you’ll be comfortable at camp. 6. Windshield wipers \nBetween all the rain and snow, our windshield wipers take a beating. I might press this button every time the seasons change. \nAre there any products you find yourself needing on a regular basis? Let us know in the comments. Recommend this article",

      "text": "advertisement \nA federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission — but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger \nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\" \nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\" \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple and Google, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.

      "text": "SEATTLE (AP) – A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission.\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents’ money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google.\nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password.\nSeattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC’s request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims.\nThe judge denied Amazon’s request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.",

      "text": "\nA federal judge has ordered Amazon to partially reimburse the parents of children that made unauthorized in-app purchases (IAPs) to the tune of $86 million. Amazon was found liable in the case more than six months ago, but the verdict has only just been handed down by U.S. District Judge John Coughenour.\nAmazon was accused of making it too easy for children to make IAPs without parental permission as far back as mid-2014 in games like “Ice Age Village” and “Pet Shop Story”. Following this verdict, Amazon will be required to establish a notice-and-claims process, informing parents of their eligibility for reimbursement and issuing refunds.\nSee also: State of IAPs: iOS vs Android July 1, 2016 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had originally requested damages of $26.5 million, but Judge Coughenour claimed that figure was too high. The judge also denied Amazon’s request to issue the refunds as Amazon gift cards. The year-long refund process process will begin in early 2017.\nWith this verdict, Amazon joins the ranks of other tech giants like Apple and Google, that have also faced the wrath of the FTC in the past over unauthorized charges. In 2014, Apple was ordered to repay over $32 million dollars and Google coughing up around $19 million.\nHave you ever had an unauthorized IAP made on your account?",

      "text": "Valerie Williams Nov 11, 2016 Amazon will pay back parents for unauthorized in-app purchases made by their kids \nKids are brilliant little creatures and often, we don’t give them enough credit for their ability to beat the system. One such example of their genius is the way our digital age babies manage to circumvent any and all safeguards in order to download and purchase things they shouldn’t. Thankfully, Amazon is being forced to cut parents a little slack. \nThat’s right. Amazon is going to right some wrongs at the behest of a federal judge’s ruling. The online retail giant is going to reimburse parents for in-app purchases made by their children through a process-and-claims program beginning in January 2017. According to NBC News , the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon in 2014 on the grounds that it was too easy for kids to figure out how to spend their parents’ money through in-app purchases made on mobile devices. The ruling cites apps such as “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” that resulted in an estimated $86 million in sneaky, unauthorized charges. \nHoly shit. That’s not chump change. \nOriginally, the FTC asked for Amazon to pay out a lump sum of $26.5 million in damages, but instead, the judge is forcing them to let parents know if they’re eligible for repayment through the upcoming process-and-claims system and if so, to reimburse them. \nAmazon is not the first company to receive this kind of ruling with both Apple Inc. and Google facing similar charges in the past. Now, those companies, and Amazon, require a password for in-app purchases. \nAmazon requested to reimburse parents with Amazon gift cards, but the judge denied them. They’ll have to refund customers’ credit cards in order to comply with the ruling. \nFor parents, this is ridiculously good news. Sure, you could say we should’ve been more careful, but the fact is, in-app purchases can be tricky and kids are pretty damn smart. Any technology they have access to is mastered a lot faster than we can imagine. I didn’t have a smart phone when my children were toddlers, but at age six, my son was taught by a kid on the bus (ugh) how to spell “sex” and that was enough for him to get into our on-demand programming and find the porn version of the Grammy Awards. It was horrifying, but it taught my husband and I that we had to be a lot more vigilant with our children and technology. \nBut once again, it’s hard to stay on top of all of it. Parents can use all the help we can get. \nThat’s why it’s not only more than fair, it’s necessary for companies like Amazon to be held accountable when they make it too easy for kids to get the best of us. We should be able to wander Target in a daze without worrying that the toddler sitting in the cart playing with our phone is going to spend that month’s mortgage payment on Angry Birds in-app purchases. It’s totally reasonable to give parents a break as technology is always updating and changing. A momentary lapse in supervision shouldn’t punish us to the tune of hundreds of dollars. \nAnd hello , Amazon. If we have all those extra dollars back, we will probably still spend them with you. Because God bless Prime.  ",

Now it's offering an Australian miner lower tech advice - guidance on handling costly projects as it plans to develop the country's largest untapped copper deposit. PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 11, 2016 2:04 PM \n[MELBOURNE] Amazon.com Inc. has provided its expertise on cloud computing to the Central Intelligence Agency and BMW AG. Now it's offering an Australian miner lower tech advice - guidance on handling costly projects as it plans to develop the country's largest untapped copper deposit. \nThe world's biggest online retailer is sharing its experience in project planning and spending with OZ Minerals Ltd ahead of a decision next year on whether to proceed with the A$980 million (S$1 billion) Carrapateena project in South Australia. It comes as miners increasingly look outside the industry for ideas to curb costs and foster innovation after a downturn in commodity prices. \n\"There are lots of big capital decisions that we make and we've shared with them insights into how we've gone about making those decisions,\" Paul Migliorini, managing director for Australia and New Zealand for Amazon Web Services, said by phone. \nSeattle-based Amazon's web services unit, the leader in the cloud computing market according to Synergy Research Group, is extending its reach beyond pure technical support, according to Mr Migliorini. In addition to advice on computing capacity, the unit is offering guidance on clients' wider businesses and corporate culture either through its own staff or by partnering with traditional advisory firms, he said. \nAdopting new technology and business methods is taking a greater role in lowering production costs, according to BHP Billiton Ltd, the world's biggest miner, while Barrick Gold Corp is investing an initial US$100 million in a collaboration with Cisco Systems Inc to overhaul its global operations. OZ Minerals, which is also working with Amazon and a third party on cloud computing services, is looking to tap broader benefits from its relationship with the retailer. \n\"We've sat down a number of times and we've had them come and present their strategy, more on innovation, on how do they innovate, how do they get people thinking differently,\" OZ Minerals chief executive officer Andrew Cole said in an interview in Sydney. The producer will rule on the Carrapateena investment after completing a feasibility study by the end of March, it said Monday in a statement. \nLessons from Amazon include limiting resources to drive employees to find more creative ways of achieving goals, said CEO Cole. The producer lowered its annual exploration budget to between A$10 million to A$15 million in a bid to improve results, he said. Exploration expenses of A$20 million in the last full-year included work on Carrapateena. \n\"If you take away a little bit of the money that probably would have been needed to do a project and not quite give them as many people, but you want the same outcome, they have got to think differently about it,\" Mr Cole said. \"That's what I think helps drive innovative behaviour.\" \nGetting Carrapateena up and running would help meet a predicted deficit in the copper market forecast to arrive by the end of the decade. The deposit will have average annual production of 61,000 metric tons of copper and 63,000 ounces of gold over a life of at least 20 years, according to the Adelaide-based company. \nAmazon's other resources customers include BHP and Rio Tinto Group, the world's two biggest miners, according to Mr Migliorini. Woodside Petroleum Ltd, Australian second-biggest oil and gas producer, has worked with Amazon's cloud unit and Accenture Plc to use data generated from 200,000 sensors at its Pluto liquefied natural gas plant off Western Australia, to predict and prevent potential unplanned shutdowns at an acid gas removal unit. \nThe largest miners and energy producers \"have some big, big problems that they are trying to tackle and they are using technology in interesting and innovative ways to do that,\" Mr Migliorini said. Efforts to instigate change have been helped by the drive to slash costs as commodities prices retreated from their 2011 highs, he said. \n\"It's a really good forcing function for people to innovate aggressively.\" \nBLOOMBERG ",

      "title": "Muhammad Ali Photographic Art Book \"THE FINAL VICTORY\" Third Heavyweight Championship Belt, by Paul Leo Faso, just released on Amazon Books",
      "text": "THE FINAL VICTORY - A Tribute to Muhammad Ali's Third Heavyweight Championship Belt, is now available at Amazon Books. This book has over 170 photo/art/graphics of the last and most important victory of Muhammad Ali, clinching him as \"The Greatest of All Time\", at The Superdome on September 15, 1978. This artistic photographic archive is being published as a Coffee Table Book for the first time. After 38 years, the Kodak film has been restored, digitized, computer enhanced and artistically re-rendered. The photographs document the moments before, during and after the fight and include fighters, Muhammad Ali, Leon Spinks, along with ABC Sports Announcers Howard Cosell, Frank Gifford and Chris Shenkel. Additionally, images of former Heavyweight Champion, \"Smokin' Joe Frazier, life long trainer, Angelo Dundee, ringman Bundini Brown, plus actor Sylvester \"Rocky\" Stallone and actress, Edy Williams. Ms. Williams's much talked about, but never seen, images of her infamous topless performance in the ring just prior the fight, are published here for the first time in print.\nTHE FINAL VICTORY defines for the historical record, Muhammad Ali's stunning sports achievement to regain the Heavyweight Championship for an unprecedented third time. Throughout the creative photo/art plates are numerous moving quotations of some of the greatest celebrities, sportsmen, sportswomen, writers, broadcasters, fighters, trainers, super stars, Presidents, international figures and authors, all commenting on the fascinating life and times of Muhammad Ali.\nAdditionally, there are some of the most famous and profound quotations of \"The Greatest\" himself, portraying Muhammad Ali as never before,\nWhen first published as an e book in 2013 on Amazon, there were less than 100 images and fewer Quote: s. This expanded Coffee Table Book has 170 photo/art plates with many more Quote: s added since the passing of Muhammad Ali this last summer of 2016,\nTHE FINAL VICTORY gives impetus to the reason why thousands of books, articles, movies, videos and magazine articles have been written about what actor Will Smith has claimed Muhammad Ali to be; \"The Greatest Figure of the 20th Century\".\nTHE FINAL VICTORY does not presume to be the last book published about Muhammad Ali, but will only add to the new chapters yet to be written of his enduring legacy.\nTo order this book please visit Amazon Books .",

      "text": "  The Associated Press \nSEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission. \nThe Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google. \nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable in spring but rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and let them make claims. \nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.",

      "text": "Valerie Williams Nov 11, 2016 Amazon will pay back parents for unauthorized in-app purchases made by their kids \nKids are brilliant little creatures and often, we don’t give them enough credit for their ability to beat the system. One such example of their genius is the way our digital age babies manage to circumvent any and all safeguards in order to download and purchase things they shouldn’t. Thankfully, Amazon is being forced to cut parents a little slack. \nThat’s right. Amazon is going to right some wrongs at the behest of a federal judge’s ruling. The online retail giant is going to reimburse parents for in-app purchases made by their children through a process-and-claims program beginning in January 2017. According to NBC News , the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon in 2014 on the grounds that it was too easy for kids to figure out how to spend their parents’ money through in-app purchases made on mobile devices. The ruling cites apps such as “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” that resulted in an estimated $86 million in sneaky, unauthorized charges. \nHoly shit. That’s not chump change. \nOriginally, the FTC asked for Amazon to pay out a lump sum of $26.5 million in damages, but instead, the judge is forcing them to let parents know if they’re eligible for repayment through the upcoming process-and-claims system and if so, to reimburse them. \nAmazon is not the first company to receive this kind of ruling with both Apple Inc. and Google facing similar charges in the past. Now, those companies, and Amazon, require a password for in-app purchases. \nAmazon requested to reimburse parents with Amazon gift cards, but the judge denied them. They’ll have to refund customers’ credit cards in order to comply with the ruling. \nFor parents, this is ridiculously good news. Sure, you could say we should’ve been more careful, but the fact is, in-app purchases can be tricky and kids are pretty damn smart. Any technology they have access to is mastered a lot faster than we can imagine. I didn’t have a smart phone when my children were toddlers, but at age six, my son was taught by a kid on the bus (ugh) how to spell “sex” and that was enough for him to get into our on-demand programming and find the porn version of the Grammy Awards. It was horrifying, but it taught my husband and I that we had to be a lot more vigilant with our children and technology. \nBut once again, it’s hard to stay on top of all of it. Parents can use all the help we can get. \nThat’s why it’s not only more than fair, it’s necessary for companies like Amazon to be held accountable when they make it too easy for kids to get the best of us. We should be able to wander Target in a daze without worrying that the toddler sitting in the cart playing with our phone is going to spend that month’s mortgage payment on Angry Birds in-app purchases. It’s totally reasonable to give parents a break as technology is always updating and changing. A momentary lapse in supervision shouldn’t punish us to the tune of hundreds of dollars. \nAnd hello , Amazon. If we have all those extra dollars back, we will probably still spend them with you. Because God bless Prime. Get the best of Scary Mommy & \"The Mom Club\" (e-book), free!",

      "text": "November 11, 2016 8:00 AM ‘Night Manager’ on Amazon delivers shadowy suspense Season 1 of “The Night Manager” is streaming on Amazon Prime. Courtesy of AMC i \nBy Tim Swanson \ntswanson@sacbee.com \nIf election season has left you shaken and stirred, and you’re in need of that special type of escapism that only international espionage can provide, now is the time to plant yourself on the couch and partake in an extended James Bond marathon. \nEarlier this month, Amazon Prime made 20 pre-Daniel Craig Bond films available for streaming. They run from classic Connery (“From Russia with Love,” “Goldfinger”) into the Brosnan era (“Tomorrow Never Dies,” “The World is Not Enough”), with plenty of Moore (“Moonraker,” “Octopussy”) and Dalton ( “The Living Daylights,” “Licence to Kill”) in between. \nBut maybe Bond’s exploits feel a little retrograde at this point. Maybe you’re searching for a thriller with more contemporary currency than what Ian Fleming’s creation has to offer. If so, Amazon subscribers also can access “The Night Manager,” an excellent six-episode BBC (and later AMC) series adapted from the 1993 book by that other great English spy novelist, John le Carré. \nOriginally set during the first Gulf War, le Carré’s novel has been updated to present day. The series begins with British-soldier-turned-hotel manager Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston) working in a luxury Cairo hotel on the eve of the Egyptian revolution. An unexpected interaction with a guest puts Pine in contact with Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie), a British business/philanthropist who also happens to sell napalm and nerve gas. Pine shares this information with an embassy friend, and he’s later recruited by MI6 agent Angela Burr (Olivia Colman) to infiltrate Roper’s inner circle. \nDirected by Oscar-nominated Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier (“After the Wedding”) with an artist’s eye, “The Night Manager” makes the most of its jet-setting locations, taking viewers from Cairo to Zermatt, Switzerland to Devon, England, and Majorca, Spain, within the first two episodes. \nBut the real joy of the series lies in cagey interactions between Hiddleston’s and Laurie’s characters. Hiddleston, perhaps best known to American audiences for playing the villain Loki in Marvel comic-book films , imbues the guarded, watchful Pine with a damaged nobility and a zeal for violent retribution. Laurie, who spent close to a decade starring as a cranky-but-charismatic doctor on the Fox TV show “House,” masks his character’s cruelty with a warm, paternalistic charm. \n“Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” and “A Most Wanted Man,” the most recent films based on le Carré novels, were gripping but also could feel compressed or overly dense. As a series, “The Night Manager” has the space to stretch and tease its shadowy suspense. The results are blood tingling. \nThe Night Manager",

How is a true retro Nintendo fan supposed to wait several weeks before getting one of these as a stocking stuffer? \nAccording to Nintendo, the following is an appropriate way to introduce this new version of the old NES: “Are you ready to go back in time? Grab your neon sunglasses and jelly bracelets. Things are about to get radical.” Yes they are going to get so very radical indeed. The console has been released this morning to Amazon and physical stores will have stock by Sunday, at the latest. \nEach console includes a single controller and the system, which itself is relatively tiny. It’ll still look like the original NES, but it wont be nearly so bulky. Instead of being the size of a couple of Kleenex boxes, this console is now the size of a small stack of CD jewel cases. \nIn the box comes the NES Classic Edition system, one NES Classic Controller, an HDMI cable, an AC adapter, and 30 pre-installed games. The 30 pre-installed games will be all the user is able to work with, ever – this isn’t the sort of console you buy and buy new games every few weeks. The set of games here is the set you’ll have, from the start until the end. \nUnless we get into hacking the device and modifying what it does, which is also entirely possible, but not recommended by Nintendo. This sort of thing happens all the time with every single console ever. But for now, Nintendo’s set of games is what you’ll get. \nUPDATE: According to GameSpot’s senior reviews editor Peter Brown on Twitter , it’ll be impossible to add new games. Unless you like to get in deep and dirty to hack away at the machine physically. Which might not be the worst idea in the world if you want to go all-in, hardcore. \nThe above gallery shows the games included with this console, all 30 of them from launch. This console will cost users $60 USD and is said to be coming to Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and Target first. But Walmart is inevitable, and Amazon is the only store with stock right this minute.

      "title": "FANG Is Dead",
      "text": "FANG stocks have led the market for the last two years. \nAmazon is the leader of FANG stocks. \nWhat happens when the leader of the leaders rolls over? Amazon's ( AMZN ) importance to the stock market can't be overstated. Every equity rally has its leader, and through 2015-2016 Amazon has been the stock forging ahead to new all time highs and setting the pace. Among the so-called 'FANG' stocks (Facebook ( FB ), Amazon, Netflix ( NFLX ) and Google ( GOOGL )), only Netflix comes close in terms of performance, and it does so with a 52bn market cap compared to Amazon's 358bn. Click to enlarge source: Google finance And it's not just the percentage gains. Amazon's lead in the cloud space was a big catalyst for tech in the last two years. Google and Microsoft ( MSFT ) were playing catch up, both in the cloud, but also in the position of their rallies. This is something I've written about a number of times and has provided a few decent trades. When Google (and Microsoft) gapped to new highs in 2016, it was something we had seen with Amazon about three months earlier. When they re-tested the break-out I used previous Amazon price action to predict the level would hold and lead to a rally in Google. This was from my article in early September: Google and Microsoft soon followed Amazon higher. So Amazon leads FANG stocks, which lead (and often hold up) the market. When Amazon (the general) is shot, the troops are in disarray. Amazon's earnings miss on the 27th October led to a heavy sell off the next day. Google soon followed despite posting a beat of top and bottom-line earnings estimates and making a brief all-time high of $839. The sell off in Amazon obviously spooked investors and Google quickly declined 8%, making a 3 month low only 5 days later. In fact, I was one of those investors. As I said in my September article, \nIf Google continues to try and catch up with Amazon, it should end its consolidation very soon and continue higher to above $820 by November. What happens after that is up to Amazon's lead. I had already closed half of my long position at my $825 target, but wanted to hold the rest for higher. When I saw what Amazon did after earnings I changed my plans pretty quickly. How Bad Is The Amazon Sell Off? Amazon has had sharp sell offs before and every time it has recovered and made another all time high. Long term holders have seen it all before, and I'm sure they won't be in a panic. That doesn't mean Amazon will keep going up and up forever. The equity bull market in the S&P500 ( SPY ) is the second longest ever. You cannot argue with the fact Amazon and the market are mature and will pull back at some point. I've been approaching the market with a fairly short term tactic and will not buy and hold anything at this stage in the bull run, no matter how good a company it is. My July 22nd article, ' Why I Bought Amazon At $690 - And Will Be Out At $800' received a mixed response, especially from long term holders, \nYour article was a grand waste of your time and mine - see you at $1000+ This kind of complacency is dangerous. Bears are always mocked at market tops (see the quote from Wikipedia below). And for the record, my article was not a waste of time for anyone trading Amazon in the last six months. Yesterday's low was 10% below my exit price. My reasons for selling were down to my interpretation of Elliott Wave cycles. I personally don't know if the recent Amazon miss is hugely significant or how to value a company so large. I rely on other people knowing this and I look at how they are behaving. On the long term weekly chart, Amazon has been in a wave 5 rally from the February lows. This is what Wikipedia says about a wave 5, \nWave 5: Wave five is the final leg in the direction of the dominant trend. The news is almost universally positive and everyone is bullish. Unfortunately, this is when many average investors finally buy in, right before the top. Volume is often lower in wave five than in wave three, and many momentum indicators start to show divergences (prices reach a new high but the indicators do not reach a new peak). At the end of a major bull market, bears may very well be ridiculed (recall how forecasts for a top in the stock market during 2000 were received). An here is the chart, Click to enlarge This is just an updated chart from my September article. Note the momentum divergence and drop off in volume as described in the Wikipedia passage above. The S&P500 is in a similar part of its cycle, but I suspect it may rumble along for a while yet. To conclude, it looks like there is a complete long term cycle present in Amazon and there is a medium term top present. This will be corrected by time and price and should eventually break the channel shown in the next few years. In the very long term Amazon will likely continue higher. Shorter Term There is a nice pattern forming in the shorter term. Amazon should complete its first leg down around the 2015 high and the 200dma at $697. The bounce from here could take it right back toward $800 again. Click to enlarge I'm watching the sell off closely as it already looks quite similar to December '15 to February '16. The initial drop from $697 on 30th December '15 to $547 on 20th January was $150. If Amazon was to do something similar now, a $150 drop takes it from the $847 to exactly $697, the support we already identified. A comparative bounce would take it $93 higher, but lets see if $697 area holds first. FANG Stocks Without their general, FANG stocks will struggle. Facebook (on a log chart) looks like it may have completed trend sequence with the completion of a wedge for wave 5. Click to enlarge Google looks like it may have completed 5 waves, and is at the top of its channel. Click to enlarge Netflix (on a log chart) is at the top of its channel, but the count isn't too clear. Click to enlarge I can't say I am 100% certain the top for FANG is in, but I wouldn't initiate a new buy and hold position here. Conclusions There appears to be a major shift underway in the markets. Amazon may have topped and FANG stocks are finally correcting. This doesn't necessarily mean the market will top straight away. The shift into oversold sectors since Trump's victory shows how markets can rise without FANG stocks. However, longer term this may be the beginning of the end. I will continue to look for longs with a shorter term perspective and adapt my methods to the market as I see it.

      "text": "Yahoo Finance is tracking the stocks you’re following, based on your Yahoo Finance ticker searches.\nJCPenney ( JCP ) – The department store chain reported third quarter revenue that missed analysts’ forecasts and lowered its sales forecast for the year. JCPenney now expects comparable store sales to rise between 1% and 2% in fiscal 2017, down from its previous estimate of 3% to 4% growth.\nDeutsche Bank ( DB ) – Barclays ( BCS ) says the German bank could get a better deal from the US Department of Justice as a result of Trump winning the presidential election, according to a report by Bloomberg . Barclay’s says Democratic DOJ officials may want to settle before leaving office. Deutsche Bank has been asked to pay $14 billion for its mortgage lending activities during the housing crisis.\nAmazon ( AMZN ) – The online retail giant is under pressure for the third day in a row following Trump’s win on Tuesday. Trump has targeted Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, criticizing the company for not paying its fair share of taxes. In 2015, Trump tweeted “If @Amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @WashingtonPost scam is saving it!”\nGrubhub ( GRUB ) – The CEO of the online food delivery service sent a company-wide memo Wednesday suggesting that employees who agree with Trump’s rhetoric and hateful messages should resign. Maloney’s email included, “I absolutely reject the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump and will work to shield our community from this movement as best as I can.”\nUPS ( UPS ) – The packaging company unveiled plans to build a $400 million facility in Atlanta. It will be the third-largest processing facility in the UPS network and will create 1,250 jobs.",

      "text": "Share \nThey made it too easy. That’s what a federal judge has decided Amazon did, making it too simple for children to purchase and rack up in-app charges without their parents’ permission. \nSix months after finding Amazon to be liable in the case brought to court by the Federal Trade Commission, Seattle-based U.S. District Judge John Coughenour has decided that Amazon will be charged with reimbursing those parents. Coughenour, however, rejected the FTC’s request for $26.5 million in damages payout, saying it was too high. The reimbursement for parents will follow a notice-and-claims process in early 2017. \nThe FTC’s case was originally filed in July 2014, accusing Amazon of allowing children to bill continuous charges while playing “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” mobile device games. The suit calculated more than $86 million in unauthorized charges related to the games. \nInterestingly, Coughenour rejected Amazon’s request to reimburse through gift cards because he said that the tech giant would likely “recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” \nNow it’s something that will likely no longer be an issue, among simple security procedures like child locks and other ways to ward off unauthorized purchases.",

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Is Amazon.com thinking of providing good housekeeping as its next Prime member perk?\nTwo Seattle job postings for \"home assistants\" on Amazon's website suggest so.\nThey call for potential recruits to join \"Amazon Assistants,\" which the Seattle-based company describes as \"experts in helping Amazon customers keep up their home.\"\nThat means helping customers with \"tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away.\"\nThe goal is to provide, as part of a two-person team, \"timesaving assistance to Amazon Prime members,\" so they can run an \"errand-free\" home.\nAmazon didn't respond to a request for comment.\nThe apparent venture serves to underscore how creative Amazon is becoming when it comes to reasons to join the Prime membership program.\nMembers pay $99 a year for guaranteed shipping, and also get perks that range from a Netflix-like streaming video service to photo storage and even free books.\nMembership also includes discounts to Amazon Music Unlimited, a Spotify-like music-streaming service, in addition to a more limited music library at no extra cost.\nIn exchange, Amazon receives cash flow that helps cover the cost of the perks. Most important, it gains loyal shoppers. Members spend twice as much as nonmembers do ($1,200 annually on average, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a research firm.)\nThe success of the program has been such that it has become one of Amazon's main \"pillars,\" multibillion-dollar revenue generators. Nearly half of U.S. households belong to the program, according to analysts.\nCIRP, the research firm, says membership growth is beginning to slow somewhat as it starts to reach the limit of households that can afford it.\nSo the obvious way to stir up more interest is by packing in more perks. CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted Prime in his most recent letter to shareholders, saying that \"we want Prime to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.\"\nAmazon devotees can already hire a housekeeper through Amazon's marketplace for independent home-service providers, launched last year.\nBut this seems different: Amazon's job posting is for a housecleaning Amazonian, with benefits ranging from Amazon stock and health insurance, as well as possibly overtime pay.\nThe posting is written with the cheerful prose the company uses to entice engineers or data scientists.\n\"If you love making a house feel like a home then this is the role for you,\" the ad says.\n\"Tasks you will become awesome at\" include housecleaning alongside a professional cleaner, washing and folding laundry, restocking essentials and groceries.\nAlso, Amazon is looking for \"outgoing, detail-oriented, and tech savvy\" college graduates or those with an equivalent degree to fill the job. Five or more years of experience as a hotel concierge or a barista help, according to the job posting.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "Has your kid ever made in-app purchases? Amazon might owe you a refund. Photo by Getty Images/Photononstop RM \nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a complaint in 2014 alleging Amazon makes it too easy for kids to make in-app purchases. \nAfter rejecting the FTC's requested $26.5 million in damages and Amazon's request to repay parents in gift cards, Seattle-based U.S. District Judge John Coughenour today ordered Amazon to notify those affected starting in early 2017 and refund the charges, Reuters reported. \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to a request for comment. \nSimilar FTC cases against Apple and Google have resulted in payouts as well.

Read my Advertiser Disclosure policy here. \nThe monthly $10 free promotion code is back! This is for targeted Amazon.com accounts where if you purchase a $50 gift card you’ll receive a a free $10 promotion code to use at Amazon at a future time. Typically accounts are only targeted once every few months, so if you’ve taken advantage of this promotion recently, there is a good chance you will not be eligible this go-around. But, you might as well check and see! \nYou’ll need to sign onto your Amazon account, add a $50 gift card to your cart and use the promotional code 1116GCARDS to see if it accepts the code. Or, you can try this direct link and it will tell you if you are eligible or not. \nIf you are eligible and shop at Amazon, this is a great offer! Essentially all you need to do is purchase a Amazon.com Gift Card during the month of November and within a few days you’ll receive your $10 promotional code via email. The $10 promo code does expire so make sure to use it by the expiration date! You can then enter both the $50 gift card and $10 promotion code into your account to use for a future purchase (go to Your Account > Apply a Gift Card to Your Account). I’ve heard mixed results about purchasing two $25 gift cards – some state that it did not work for them in the past, so to be cautious I recommend purchasing one $50 gift card. \nWere you targeted for this $10 free promotion credit deal? If so, enjoy! More From Deals We Like",

      "text": "Ashley King Nov 11th, 2016 \nIt’s that time of year again where retailers start listing their Black Friday sales to try and entice consumers into a spending frenzy the day after Thanksgiving. We’ve already seen Black Friday deals from T-Mobile and HTC leak, while brick and mortar retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy have shared some of their deals. \nWhile Amazon is expected to have a wide range of items with big discounts on Black Friday, they’ve specifically highlighted the discounts that will be available for their own products including Kindle, Amazon Echo, Echo Dots, and deals on Fire TV and Fire tablets. Here’s a quick peek at what Amazon will offer. Amazon Black Friday Deals November 20 – Kindle Paperwhite for $99 – $20 off November 24 – Amazon Echo for $139 – $40 off November 24 – Echo Dot for $39 – $10 off November 24 – Fire HD 8 for $59 – $30 off November 24 – Fire tablet for $34 – $16 off \nIt’s worth noting if you’re considering expanding into a smart home ecosystem, right now Amazon’s Alexa offering is much more fleshed out than Google Home. While the Amazon Echo has been around longer and is the main competitor to Google Home, Amazon’s Echo Dot and Fire TV stick with Alexa remote bring Alexa all over the house for much less of an investment.",

      "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) — The latest news from CBS Chicago is just an ask away through Amazon’s Flash Briefings, making it easy to listen to local headlines and stories from your Alexa-enabled devices.\nBy saying “Alexa, tell me the news,” or “what is the news in Chicago?” users can hear what’s happening in the Chicago area on demand from any Amazon Echo device, and soon from the latest generation of Fire HD tablets.\nTo add CBS Chicago to Flash Briefings, users update their personalized accounts via a smartphone with the Alexa app or online at Alexa.Amazon.com. \nFrom the menu’s Settings, under Account users can select Flash Briefing and tap the “CBS2 News Chicago” toggle to turn on the updates.\nOnce enabled, Flash Briefings will include the top CBS 2 news stories happening now, summarized in less than 90 seconds and updated throughout the day.\n“Our station is now positioned to provide news on all platforms,” Marty Wilke, CBS 2 president and general manager explained. \n“From TV to web – and now on demand on Amazon Echo – CBS 2 is prepared to deliver the latest news to our audience where and how they want to receive it.”\nLaunched by Amazon two years ago, the Echo is an internet-connected, voice-enabled speaker that listens for commands and can carry out a wide range of functions: perform web searches, order food deliveries, control temperature and lighting in a smart home, play music, tune in to news and sports radio, and more.\nA portable version called the Amazon Tap became available earlier this year, and the smaller second-generation Amazon Dot ships this month. \nAmazon plans to add Alexa voice-controlled functionality to more of its devices in the future.

      "text": "  @01:35PM from the fix-things dept. A federal judge has directed Amazon to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout . Reuters reports: U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges.",

      "text": "Sitting just mere weeks away from a mountain of festive fun, it's easy to begin panicking and rush into shopping for loved ones and yourself. But hold your reindeers, amigos, because the seasoned vets of this process understand that you only begin sabotaging your bank account on/after Black Friday - yep, that sale holiday that's suspiciously found its way across the Atlantic. While it's easy to be cynical about such devilish savings, it's also hard to argue with a healthy wallet. And in that spirit, Amazon is setting up to drop 12 days of huge deals on the British public. The retail giant has announced the dates of its sale, which is set to begin next Monday, November 14, and finish on the official Black Friday date of November 25. Related: Black Friday 2016 deals - where are the best tech offers? As you can imagine, the deals won't come to an abrupt halt after the Friday. Ironically, the day of sales has found itself merging with the weekend and even discovered a weekday brethren in Cyber Monday, which is set to go down on November 28. With Black Friday getting bigger every year, it's no surprise that Amazon is ramping up the action with an eye-popping 12 days of deals. The company claims \"millions of pounds\" of deals will be on offer, including several perks for Prime members, such as access to deals before the entire internet crashes. Amazon also noted that products in the categories of TVs, phones, toys, and home accessories will see price reductions, though it's unclear when exactly these will be staggered. Instead of you having to keep a consistent monitor on all the best the holiday has to offer, though, make sure to keep it locked to our Black Friday deals.

      "text": "Amazon must repay parents for kids' in-app purchases Posted: Updated: Damir Loretic/CNN \n( NBC News ) - A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission — but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\" \nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\" \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple and Google, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.

Original price was $53.98, so the price drop seems slick. I bought their other watches a few months ago and it comes in a gift box, so it's a great inexpensive gift for friends and family for Xmas.\n\n*Length: Mens: 7.5'' Womens:7.2'' Case Dia: Mens: 1.45*1.73'' Womens: 0.98''*1.22'' Please use a watch band removal tool to resize the band.\n",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Evercore ISI ’s Ken Sena today offers up his findings from his firm’s “Machine Learning Symposium” in San Francisco, with implications for Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , among others, of the revolution in artificial intelligence that’s sweeping computing. \nOne takeaway is just how important it is that Amazon and Google have the hardware power to do artificial intelligence in the cloud: \nHardware was brought up frequently not only in terms of the raw compute power required for AI and machine learning, but also in terms of the proliferation of devices. Gridspace’s Evan MacMillan spoke to the rise of quality microphones as a key enabler of his companies natural language processing tools and pointed out that one of the most expensive components in any phone is the microphone array. Similarly, Kevin O’Brien from Orbital Insights mentioned that the explosion in the number of satellites from private space companies like Planet Labs have created more imagery demand as the influx in satellites is leading to influx in data and hence performance. In addition, Jack Clark from OpenAI highlighted the hardware necessary for the raw compute power needed to power machine learning applications as creating just as much a moat as the data itself. This perspective on hardware makes us think that companies like Amazon and Google that provide cloud-based machine learning services are poised to benefit. \nAt the same time, there’s a rise of application-specific A.I. , writes Sena, where the big names like Amazon may not dominate: \nThe conclusion among panelists and speakers seemed to be both, as there will be several AI service providers for application providers to leverage with these application providers holding certain domain expertise. For example, Gridspace is using similar voice recognition technology as Google and Amazon, but remains focused purely on enterprise applications rather than the consumer-facing application of voice recognition technology found in Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. \nAnd another topic was the limited engineering talent available relative to the high demand:\nThere are an estimated 1,000 engineers with the needed skills in this field and concerns were expressed around the drain of the pipeline of data scientists within academia. Our VCs spoke to this bottle neck specifically, contrasting the notion of choosing to remain in school for five years (or more) with seven figure job offers coming in every six months. \nFor more thoughts on A.I., see my interview with Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang this morning .",

Talk about the perfect holiday gift! It comes with 30 original titles in all of their 8-bit glory. It's only been on sale for a few hours and it is already sold out at most retail locations.\nAmazon is selling the NES Classic Edition starting at 5PM ET/2PM PT. Unfortunately, the largest retailer in the world will only have \"very limited quantities\" at launch. Amazon notes that demand is expected to be very high. The online seller will have more in stock over the coming weeks, but if you want one right away, it's going to be tough.\nSo, load up the web page, set an alarm, and get your clicking finger ready. It is limited to one order per customer, so if you want more than one, you're going to have to get some help.\nIf you're worried about having to sit two feet away from your giant 40-inch television screen to play these highly pixelated games, you can always get yourself a controller cable extender like this one .\nGood luck!\n",

      "title": "Amazon, Google: Here Comes Application-Specific A.I., Says Evercore ISI - Tech Trader Daily",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Evercore ISI ’s Ken Sena today offers up his findings from his firm’s “Machine Learning Symposium” in San Francisco, with implications for Amazon.com ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , among others, of the revolution in artificial intelligence that’s sweeping computing.\nOne takeaway is just how important it is that Amazon and Google have the hardware power to do artificial intelligence in the cloud:\nHardware was brought up frequently not only in terms of the raw compute power required for AI and machine learning, but also in terms of the proliferation of devices. Gridspace’s Evan MacMillan spoke to the rise of quality microphones as a key enabler of his companies natural language processing tools and pointed out that one of the most expensive components in any phone is the microphone array. Similarly, Kevin O’Brien from Orbital Insights mentioned that the explosion in the number of satellites from private space companies like Planet Labs have created more imagery demand as the influx in satellites is leading to influx in data and hence performance. In addition, Jack Clark from OpenAI highlighted the hardware necessary for the raw compute power needed to power machine learning applications as creating just as much a moat as the data itself. This perspective on hardware makes us think that companies like Amazon and Google that provide cloud-based machine learning services are poised to benefit.\nAt the same time, there’s a rise of application-specific A.I. , writes Sena, where the big names like Amazon may not dominate:\nThe conclusion among panelists and speakers seemed to be both, as there will be several AI service providers for application providers to leverage with these application providers holding certain domain expertise. For example, Gridspace is using similar voice recognition technology as Google and Amazon, but remains focused purely on enterprise applications rather than the consumer-facing application of voice recognition technology found in Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa.\nAnd another topic was the limited engineering talent available relative to the high demand:\nThere are an estimated 1,000 engineers with the needed skills in this field and concerns were expressed around the drain of the pipeline of data scientists within academia. Our VCs spoke to this bottle neck specifically, contrasting the notion of choosing to remain in school for five years (or more) with seven figure job offers coming in every six months.\nFor more thoughts on A.I., see my interview with Nvidia ( NVDA ) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang this morning .",

The case originated in 2014 when the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon, alleging it made it too easy for children to spend their parents' money on in-app purchases while playing games like \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village.\" The lack of oversight -- and the failure of parents to monitor their children's behavior on their mobile devices -- led to $86 million in unauthorized charges, according to the FTC. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google. \nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password, according to the Associated Press. The AP also reported Coughenour rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty. \n  News on WMCTV.com News More>>",

      "text": "Craig Roberts and Alexandra Socha (Photo: Amazon) More Red Oaks , the likable little streaming sitcom about young people in the 1980s, begins its second season on Amazon Prime on Friday. The new season finds its young hero, aspiring filmmaker and New Jersey country-club tennis pro David (Craig Roberts), pursuing both his career dreams and Skye (Alexandra Socha), the aspiring painter whose ambitions are just as big.\nSince Red Oaks ’ first season premiered, Netflix’s Stranger Things has done its own ’80s nostalgia trip and garnered a lot more attention than this mild sitcom. But when it comes to summoning up that decade, Oaks is just as good — precise in its details and for the most part rarely exaggerating the hairstyles, the fashions, or the music for mere campy effect.\nThe new season begins with David visiting Skye in Paris, where she’s spending the summer taking art classes and sketching David in the nude. It’s all going swimmingly until her parents, played with bumptious energy by Paul Reiser and Gina Gershon, arrive unexpectedly.\nSoon enough, though, everyone’s back in Jersey, where Reiser’s Doug Getty is facing legal problems as well as a threat to his presidency at the Red Oaks Country Club. Reiser plays the role well, but in the early episodes of the season, there doesn’t seem to be much firmly established motivation for him to be so hostile toward David. Yes, he’s a protective dad for Skye, but the scripts call for him to be aggressively angry in a manner that works against the show — even David, not the boldest character, doesn’t seem very intimidated, perhaps because Getty is just too ridiculously over the top.\nRichard Kind and Jennifer Grey are back as David’s parents, now in the process of divorce. David’s pal Wheeler (Oliver Cooper) is still trying to capture the attention of blond-goddess lifeguard Misty (Alexandra Turshen) while also aiming to move up from country-club valet to bartender. Caught in the middle of every subplot, Roberts, as David, remains the series’ greatest strength, bringing subtlety to a show that sometimes strains for early-period Woody Allen-style humor.\nFor a show that comes from big-league moviemakers such as producer-directors Steven Soderbergh, David Gordon Green, and Hal Hartley, Oaks remains assiduously small-scale, and that only works toward its charm. (Compared with ABC’s blasting ’80s sitcom The Goldbergs, Red Oaks is a masterpiece of low-key discretion.) The pacing is sometimes tediously slow, but for the most part, Oaks is cozily welcoming.\nRed Oaks Season 2 is streaming on Amazon Prime now.",

      "text": "Enlarge Image Type \"aguamenti\" into the search box at Amazon.com and suddenly, splish-splash, you've created a flood.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Gael Fashingbauer Cooper/CNET Want to cast spells like Harry Potter and Hermione? All you need to do is head to Amazon.com and remember five words. \nThe online store has teamed up with the new Potter universe movie, \" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ,\" which opens November 18. Here's what to do.\n1) Go to Amazon and type \"aguamenti\" into the site's search box (capital or lowercase letters both worked for us). Oooh, you've conjured a flood of water, which gently waves over Amazon's page of search results for Harry Potter materials before offering you a movie promo to watch and a link where you can buy tickets. (\"Aguamenti\" is a water-making spell that Harry and others used in the books for various purposes .)\nMore from the Potterverse Casting Harry Potter spells from your Android phone isn't so magical Pouting about your Pottermore Patronus results? Try this quiz Harry Potter actor longs to be killed off on 'Game of Thrones' 2) Want to fight that water with fire? Try typing \" incendio \" to see bright-colored flames suddenly start licking at your computer screen.\n3) An unexpectedly beautiful spell to try is \" orchideous ,\" which will send your screen bursting into colorful flowers. It's also touching, if you remember that Hermione once used it to present Harry with flowers to put on the graves of his parents.\n4) Now try \" reducto !\" In the books, it blasts things into pieces, on Amazon, it will make your computer screen briefly appear cracked.\n5) And last but not least, typing \" lumos \" will briefly turn your screen dark, then slowly brighten it up with a white light.\nEarlier, we told you about a partnership between Google and the new Harry Potter universe film, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" that let Android users cast a few spells , including \"lumos,\" using their phones. But if your phone was a little hard-of-hearing, your spells might have failed. These Amazon spells worked every time, as long as you spell your spells (!) correctly. They even worked on phones, though you need to go to Amazon, type the spell you want, and then confirm you want to see it by clicking on the \"Fantastic Beasts\" link that pops up ahead of regular search results.\nWondering about the darker Potter spells, like torturing spell \" crucio \" and killing curse \" avada kedavra \"? Amazon knew you'd want to try them. When you do, it offers up a link to movie info, but doesn't cause your screen to writhe in pain or kill your computer. Nice try, Voldemort.\n(Via PopSugar )",

(Photo: Amazon) \nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales. \nStarting today and extending through Cyber Monday (or until supplies last), Amazon is offering discounts on some of its devices through the certified refurbished store . Inside you'll find deals on the Amazon Echo, three versions of the Fire TV, and Kindle e-readers. \nIf you don't mind the refurbished tag, this is the lowest price we've seen on the Echo so now's the time to snag one up. Especially as the list of compatible devices continues to grow every day. For a voice controlled hub for all of your smart home needs, it's hard to beat the extensiveness the Echo and Alexa, the Amazon voice-assistant, offers. \nAs far as the Fire TVs go, there's a reason they're some of our top pick for the best streaming devices out there—especially if you're an Amazon Prime member (or want to be ). And the Kindles? Well, there's a reason e-reader is basically synonymous with Kindle. We'll leave it at that. \nThese are only a small sample of the deals Amazon has been promoting for its countdown to Black Friday event . Until the big day hits after Thanksgiving, Amazon will continue to roll out new deals throughout the day every day. Smart Home Amazon Echo (Certified Refurbished) ( $119.99, SAVE $51 ) Home Theater Fire TV 1st Gen. (Certified Refurbished) ( $49.99, SAVE $44.01 ) Fire TV Stick, 1st Gen.

      "text": "Enlarge Image Type \"aguamenti\" into the search box at Amazon.com and suddenly, splish-splash, you've created a flood.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Gael Fashingbauer Cooper/CNET Want to cast spells like Harry Potter and Hermione? All you need to do is head to Amazon.com and remember five words.\nThe online store has teamed up with the new Potter universe movie, \" Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ,\" which opens November 18. Here's what to do.\n1) Go to Amazon and type \"aguamenti\" into the site's search box (capital or lowercase letters both worked for us). Oooh, you've conjured a flood of water, which gently waves over Amazon's page of search results for Harry Potter materials before offering you a movie promo to watch and a link where you can buy tickets. (\"Aguamenti\" is a water-making spell that Harry and others used in the books for various purposes .)\nMore from the Potterverse Casting Harry Potter spells from your Android phone isn't so magical Pouting about your Pottermore Patronus results? Try this quiz Harry Potter actor longs to be killed off on 'Game of Thrones' 2) Want to fight that water with fire? Try typing \" incendio \" to see bright-colored flames suddenly start licking at your computer screen.\n3) An unexpectedly beautiful spell to try is \" orchideous ,\" which will send your screen bursting into colorful flowers. It's also touching, if you remember that Hermione once used it to present Harry with flowers to put on the graves of his parents.\n4) Now try \" reducto !\" In the books, it blasts things into pieces, on Amazon, it will make your computer screen briefly appear cracked.\n5) And last but not least, typing \" lumos \" will briefly turn your screen dark, then slowly brighten it up with a white light.\nEarlier, we told you about a partnership between Google and the new Harry Potter universe film, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" that let Android users cast a few spells , including \"lumos,\" using their phones. But if your phone was a little hard-of-hearing, your spells might have failed. These Amazon spells worked every time, as long as you spell your spells (!) correctly. They even worked on phones, though you need to go to Amazon, type the spell you want, and then confirm you want to see it by clicking on the \"Fantastic Beasts\" link that pops up ahead of regular search results.\nWondering about the darker Potter spells, like torturing spell \" crucio \" and killing curse \" avada kedavra \"? Amazon knew you'd want to try them. When you do, it offers up a link to movie info, but doesn't cause your screen to writhe in pain or kill your computer. Nice try, Voldemort.\n(Via PopSugar )",

      "text": "AT&T downgrades video quality on mobile with ‘Stream Saver’ \nWe knew the NES Classic Edition , with its retro aesthetic and solid game selection, would be hard to get at first , but this is some next level, Tickle Me Elmo style demand. Amazon, which made its supply of the console available at 2PM Pacific today, sold out in what appeared to be less than a minute. \nClearly thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of gamers were sitting on the product page hammering the F5 key and some random selection thereof got their wish. Traffic on that page in particular that Amazon appears to have taken it down. \nThere’s no indication of how many consoles Amazon had to sell, but it had to have been a fair few. I can confirm at least one was sold: \nI and pretty much everyone here at TechCrunch failed to secure one, though. \nEverywhere else seems to be fresh out as well. The GameStop near me said it only received 17 units and sold them within half an hour of opening. There were plenty of reports of people waiting outside Targets and Best Buys in order to get theirs. \nMore will be arriving, though: in a series of tweets this morning, Nintendo assured an agitated public that “there will be a steady flow” of the hot gadgets. The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. 1/3 \n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 11, 2016 \nThanks Nintendo. Let’s make sure this doesn’t happen with the Switch though, okay? 0",

      "text": "  \nIt looks like Netflix won’t be officially offering offline playback anytime soon — at least in the U.S. — but that doesn’t mean someone else isn’t working on it. This week, MediaMall launched PlayOn Cloud, a service that records video from Netflix, HBO Now, and others, allowing them to be viewed offline on a mobile device. \nThe company refers to PlayOn Cloud as “a DVR for streaming video,” and that is the easiest way to think about it. The app keeps a copy of the recording in the cloud for 30 days, allowing it to be downloaded to the device of your choice. The app even includes AdSkip technology, similar to what DVR progenitor TiVo offers. \nMore: DirecTV Now live TV-streaming service will feature premium channels from Starz \n“The PlayOn Cloud iOS app takes our revolutionary Streaming Video Recorder to the next level and untethers it from the PC,” PlayOn’s president and CEO, Jeff Lawrence, said in a statement. “We are now offering streamers something they’ve always wanted — a way to watch their favorite streaming programming on their mobile device when no internet is available. This is a game changer for commuters, travelers, users with mobile data caps, and those who don’t want to miss movies and TV shows when they expire from streaming services.” \nWhether or not PlayOn Cloud is for you likely depends on how often you watch video where a reliable connection isn’t available. In our time with a beta version of the app, the user interface felt slightly clunky, and often wasn’t as intuitive as the actual streaming services’ interfaces. Then there’s the issue of cost. \nMore: Hands on: Plex Cloud \nIn order to record, you’ll need to purchase recording credits, with each credit costing $1. Each credit allows you to record one movie or episode of a TV show, but if you’re planning on recording a lot, this could quickly add up. \nThe PlayOn Cloud app is currently only available for iOS devices, and is a free download in the App Store . PlayOn is currently running a promotion, with anyone who downloads the app and creates an account before November 13 getting five free recording credits. Also watch: Sony Xperia Z5 – Hands on",
