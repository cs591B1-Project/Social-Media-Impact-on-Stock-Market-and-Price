Cramer reiterates his opinion that Apple should have purchased Harman ( HAR ) instead of Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) . Samsung announced it plans to buy Harman ( HAR ) for $8 billion in a move that will boost its competitiveness in the fast-growing automotive electronics technology business. The Suwon, South Korea-based conglomerate will pay $112 a share in cash for Harman, whose offerings including car systems, audio and visual products and other connected products.

      "text": "(Bill Maher suggest that what liberals need now is the Apple iDefenderYouTube/Real Time with Bill Maher) \nHalf the nation needed comic relief after seeing their candidate fail to win the 2016 presidential election. And liberal comic and political commentator Bill Maher delivered on his Friday night HBO show \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\" \nWhile the show was filled with many laugh-out-loud funny moments (as well as a \"We're still here\" call to action for Democrats and others appalled by Trump's divisive campaign rhetoric), there was a particularly funny idea from Maher for Apple. During a shtick on what Democrats should do now, he said (emphasis ours):\nIt’s now Liberal’s Turn to become Doomsday-prepping gun nuts. They just need survival products tailored to our lifestyle like freeze-dried kale and quinoa salad, pomegranate-scented emergency candles, camouflage in Pantone spring fashion colors of pale dogwood and hazelnut and most importantly, the Apple iDefender. It’s like any other shotgun only twice as expensive, only accepts Apple’s proprietary iShells, and they removed the barrel sight to make it thinner. \nHere's the clip:\n\nAnd, as we are all painfully aware these days, we live in a very divided nation, so Maher was an equal opportunity offender to the other side. During a bit called Future Headlines, he also took on Samsung (as well as driverless cars and a pretty funny joke about MSNBC's liberal news commentator Rachel Maddow):\n\nNOW WATCH: Trump goes on a tweetstorm less than 48 hours after promising to be more 'restrained' on Twitter \n\nMore From Business Insider \nMark Zuckerberg: We will rid site of fake news, but 'identifying the truth is complicated' \nChina says it will cut iPhone sales and retaliate 'tit-for-tat' if Trump follows through with trade threats \nSilicon Valley is divided on whether California should secede from the US in a 'Calexit'",

      "text": "Let’s face it. The best part of the Thanksgiving meal is the sides! I’m a big fan of stuffing — or dressing for those who like it cooked outside the bird — but it must be a delicious one. Growing up in the Midwest, my mom’s secret stuffing recipe included oysters. Since Chicago was far from the ocean, she would use canned oysters. (Everyone loved it, except me.)\nRelated Articles Quick Party Appetizer: Blue Cheese & Pecan Puff Pastry Spirals Quick party recipe: Goat Cheese and Tomato Jam Crostini Quick Side Dish: Spicy Broccolini With Garlic and Lemon Ultimate brunch dish: Asparagus-Fontina Bread Pudding The great thing about stuffing is that it’s so versatile. I use sweet fennel sausage, but you can use any chicken, turkey or vegan sausage. This stuffing uses a mixture of white bread with cornbread, for texture and flavor. You can buy cornbread in the bakery section of your favorite market, or make it yourself, from a box or from scratch. The fruit and nuts are variable, as well. I like to use apples, but I have also used firm fruit, such as persimmon, quince or dried plums.\nMy final trick: I toss the stuffing in a bit of the reserved sausage fat to prevent the stuffing from drying out. Remember, fat is flavor, so I often baste the turkey in the sausage fat, too. Now that’s turkey and stuffing I can salute!\nApple, Cornbread and Sausage Stuffing Serves 14\n2 sticks unsalted butter\n2 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n3 apples, such as Jonathan, Fuji, Gravenstein or Granny Smith, cored and chopped into 1/2-inch dice\n1 pound sweet fennel sausage, casings removed, crumbled",

      "text": "Apple Pay now lets non-profits take donations Posted Google’s self-driving cars are naturals when it comes to three-point turns \nApple announced this morning that its payments service Apple Pay will now support the ability to make donations to non-profits, starting today in the U.S. This includes both Apple Pay on the web, where it can be integrated into websites’ checkout flow, as well as within mobile applications. The changes are rolling out just ahead of the holidays, something participating non-profits hope will have a big impact on their ability to raise funds during this time of increased charitable giving. \nApple previously had a rule that banned iOS apps from collecting funds for charities or fundraisers via Apple Pay. That means means if they collected funds, it would have to take place outside the app, such as through Safari or SMS. Now, they’ll be able to integrate “donate” buttons right in their app and process the transactions through the payments service. \nOn mobile, that means users can use TouchID. Meanwhile, on the web, users click the Apple Pay donate button in Safari, then can confirm their payment via their iPhone or Apple Watch. \nAlready, online stores supporting Apple Pay on the web have seen an increase in checkout conversion rate of up to 2x on mobile, and customers are able to checkout up to 60% faster with Apple Pay, according to figures from Shopify . \nThe reason that the payments system works well is because it allows customers to use their contact and billing information they already have on file, which saves time over having to manually fill out forms at checkout. \nApple Pay today has tens of millions of customers, and is adding one million more per week. The technology is integrated in thousands of iOS apps, and has more recently arrived on the web in Safari. In addition, TouchID support has been added to Apple’s new MacBook Pro, so you can checkout on the web with just a press of your finger. \nApple Pay transactions have also increased by nearly 500% year-over-year, for the September quarter. And more transactions were made in September 2016, than across off of fiscal 2015, the company said. \nIn other words, there are now enough customers on Apple Pay for this launch to have a measurable impact on giving programs. \nA large number of non-profits are launching with Apple Pay, including the following: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St.Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision, and WWF (World Wildlife Federation). \nA few others have plans in the works for supporting Apple Pay in the near future, including American Cancer Society, CARE, DonorsChoose.org, Save the Children, and PBS along with its local stations. \nOne non-profit that’s supporting the new technology, charity:water, explained to us how the increase in mobile traffic played into its interest in mobile giving. \n“Currently, nearly 25% of our donations come from mobile. We’ve seen steady growth in mobile traffic to our site over the past few years, so it’s important we make giving through mobile as easy as possible,” explained Scott Harrison, charity: water founder and CEO. \n“So many people want to give, but complicated and clunky donation systems discourage them. Integrating Apple Pay makes the giving experience incredibly simple and convenient, and we hope it will encourage more people to join our mission and enable us to transform lives within seconds,” he added. \nCharity:water will be integrating Apple Pay across all its giving platforms on desktop and mobile, and will also allow donors to use it when joining the monthly giving program. \nTo help vet non-profits ahead of their integrations with Apple Pay, Apple is working with Benevity , a platform that helps enable workplace and corporate charitable giving programs. The company will launch an online application form for any non-profits that want to integrate Apple Pay in their apps. \nApple Pay’s move to support non-profits is a big challenge to rival digital payment services, like PayPal , which already has close to half a million charities using its platform to take donations. However, Apple Pay support for non-profits is not as broadly available at present, as it’s limited to the Apple ecosystem and the U.S. for the time being.",

      "text": "Home / News / Apple rumoured to unveil curved, bezel-free iPhones next year Apple rumoured to unveil curved, bezel-free iPhones next year November 14, 2016 News , Technology Leave a comment \nNew York: Soon after getting mixed responses for its latest device iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones, Apple is rumoured to release two iPhones that will have curved, bezel-free displays next year. \nAccording to Barclays Research analysts, the 5-inch and 5.8-inch bezel-free iPhones with borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, MacRumors.com reported. \n“Larger and bezel-less iPhone 8 design did not sound 100 per cent locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope,” the report quoted analysts as saying. \nOf the two prospect releases, only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology, “which can be sharper, brighter, and more energy efficient than LCD technology”. \nSamsung and LG, joined by Foxconn-owned Sharp by 2018, are said to be Apple’s primary OLED suppliers. \nAn analyst from KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo had in March said that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone with a curved OLED display and glass casing next year, the research note mentioned. \nAccording to Japanese website Nikkei, the larger-screened iPhone will be a premium model, positioned alongside 4.7-inch and 5-inch iPhones with LCD displays. \nThere are reports that a bezel-free design by Apple will be achieved by removing the iconic Home button on the next iPhone. \nBarclays expects that the screen will extend vertically as well as horizontally. \nIANS",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray The decline in fortunes since Wednesday’s upset victory in the U.S. presidential election by Donald Trump is just a part of the overall clearing out of a “crowded trade” in large-cap tech, writes Morgan Stanley strategist Adam Parker , along with colleagues, in a note to clients today.\nRegarding the drop in tech names in the past several sessions, Parker and company note “ Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) are among the 10 worst performing mega-caps relative to what our model would have expected given broader macro moves.”\nIn part, he writes, this reflects that “mega-cap tech stocks where hedge fund clients were broadly overweight appear to have been viewed as ‘safe’ and are being used as a source of funds for the rotation into financials, health care and industrials, where investors were not positioned.”\nIt’s not just portfolio rotation, though, for Parker continues “we are underweight technology, viewing the crowding as an issue and concerned about the ability of the group to expand margins, an important element of multiple expansion in tech stocks.”\nLater in the note, parker notes the firm prefers biotech names to software specifically, as biotech is “is quite cheap for its underlying growth rate.”",

      "text": "German-English-Translator - Details here Many analysts have predicted, that the iPhone that Apple will release next year will consist of a larger display area than current models, making those bezels smaller than they are on the current models. However, while analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo think, that Apple will fill the entire front with an edge-to-edge display and get rid of the traditional home button, a group of analysts at Barclays Research, who recently also published a research report on Apple's iPad lineup of 2017, think, that Apple will keep the traditional Home Button even on the anniversary iPhone in 2017. They do, however, agree, that the next iPhone will have an increased display area. Instead of 4.7 inch on the current iPhone 7, they expect Apple to integrate a 5 inch display on the smaller model, without increasing the physical size of the device itself. The Plus-version will grow its display area from 5.5 inch to 5.8 inch and will also switch to curved OLED instead of the current LCD panels. Those OLED panels are said to come from Samsung and LG. In 2018, Sharp will be able to contribute with panels of their own once their new OLED-factories are up and running. Apple is expected to ship their next iPhones in September of 2017.

      "title": "‘Suspicious’ China has a pointed message for Donald Trump about Apple and Boeing - MarketWatch",
      "text": "There will be dire consequences should Donald Trump wage a trade war with China, the country’s state-backed Global Times publication warned on Sunday.\n“China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” the editorial read . “A batch of Boeing BA, +0.58% orders will be replaced by Airbus AIR, +2.94% U.S. auto and iPhone AAPL, -3.20% sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted.”\nThis stance is in reaction to Trump’s inflammatory words on the campaign trail about how China is a currency manipulator that continues to “rape our country.” Trump has also talked about a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods, something the editorial cast off as “merely campaign rhetoric.”\nGlobal Times pointed to what happened when a 35% tariff was slapped on Chinese tires shortly after Barack Obama took office.\n“In response, China took retaliatory steps of imposing tariffs on U.S. chicken and automotive products,” the article explained. “Both China and the U.S. suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China.”\nAnd if Trump tries a similar approach to other imports? “China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed,” Global Times warned, adding, however, that it doesn’t expect Trump to be so naive.\n“If Trump wrecks Sino-U.S. trade, a number of U.S. industries will be impaired,” the article said. “Finally, the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president.”\nMore from MarketWatch Second Presidential Debate in Three Minutes S&P 500’s ‘triangle’ chart pattern is warning of a big selloff, analyst says How a Merck cancer breakthrough caused Bristol-Myers’ stock to plunge Related Topics U.S. Economy U.S. Politics Washington, D.C.",

      "title": "How to download tvOS 10.1 beta 3 to your Apple TV",
      "text": "\nInstalling the tvOS 10 beta is more complex than an iOS or macOS beta, but it's also for developers only.\nUpdate November 14, 2016: Apple has just released tvOS 10.1 beta 3 for developers. If you already have a tvOS 10 beta installed, proceed to System > Software Updates and download away. If you've been waiting for beta 3 to get in on tvOS 10.1, keep reading and we'll walk you through the set up!\nApple hasn't announced a public beta for tvOS the way the company has for iOS and macOS. That means until it is released to everyone this fall, it's only available to developers. It also means installing it on the Apple TV (4th generation) is more complicated than a simple download and go. If you're a developer and you're having trouble getting the tvOS beta installed, here's what you need to do.\nUnlike Apple's other operating systems, you can't back up your Apple TV; as such, Apple offers two options for updating tvOS: over the air, which just updates the system; and via USB-C, which restores the device to its factory settings.\nHow to install the tvOS 10.1 beta over-the-air How to install the tvOS 10.1 beta over USB-C How to install the tvOS 10.1 beta over-the-air A note, before we begin: \"Over the air\" is technically a bit of a misnomer, since you have to use a USB-C cable to initially connect your Apple TV to your Mac to install the tvOS configuration profile. That being said, once you've installed the configuration profile, you'll be able to wirelessly update your Apple TV to any subsequent beta versions.\nUpdating over the air only updates the system software; your configurations and apps should remain on your Apple TV as-is.\nOn your Mac, go to developer.apple.com/download . Enter your developer username and password to log in. Click on the blue Download button to the right of tvOS 10 beta configuration profile . Install the Apple Configurator app from the Mac App Store. Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to AC power . Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to your Mac using a USB-C cable. Launch Apple Configurator . Click on Add Profiles to your Apple TV and add the tvOS 10 beta configuration profile you downloaded previously. (Or simply drag and drop the file to the Apple TV icon.) Reboot your Apple TV once the configuration profile is installed. On your Apple TV , click on Settings . Click on System . Click on Software Update . Your Apple TV should now detect tvOS 10.1 and download and install it just like any other update.\nHow to install the tvOS 10.1 beta over USB-C If you prefer to wipe your Apple TV developer unit before updating, you can use the Restore Image option, which connects to your Mac via USB-C.\nOn your Mac, go to developer.apple.com/download . Enter your developer username and password to log in. Click on the blue Download button to the right of tvOS 10 restore image . Click on the blue Download button to the right of Xcode 8 . Install Xcode 8 on your Mac. Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to AC power . Connect your Apple TV (4th generation) to your Mac using a USB-C cable. Launch iTunes . Select your Apple TV when it appears in iTunes . Hold down the Option key and click on Check for Updates . Browse to and click on the tvOS 10.1 beta you downloaded in step 3. Once iTunes has updated your Apple TV, hook it back up to your television and you're good to go.\nHave you got tvOS 10.1 up and running on your Apple TV? Which method did you use and how did it work for you? \nApple TV \ntvOS 10 Review Apple TV Review Apple TV buyers guide Apple TV users guide Apple TV news Apple TV discussion Buy at Apple ",

Morgan ’s Rod Hall today shuffles the deck of his networking equipment names, with Ciena ( CIEN ) still his top pick, but Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and Apple ( AAPL ) both dropping some points in his ranking. Hall puts last week’s upset victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election front and center, noting “the sector underperformed last month with a 0.6% gain vs. the S&P500 up 1.3%.\"\"We note that post election moves have not been helpful,” writes Hall, \"with large tech names generally selling off as overall growth optimism increases.\" Cisco, whose shares Hall rates Neutral, plummet in his rankings from 8th place back in October to 16th place, following \"multiple negative enterprise data points in Q3 reporting.",

      "text": "Blackbaud Speeds the Pace of Giving with Apple Pay Blackbaud offers Apple Pay as a digital checkout solution to provide nonprofits and donors greater choice News provided by Nov 14, 2016, 13:00 ET Share this article CHARLESTON, S.C. , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLKB ), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, announced today it has added Apple Pay® to Blackbaud Merchant Services™ so its nonprofit customers can offer donors an easy, secure and private option for digital checkout, just in time for holiday giving. This news comes in conjunction with Apple's announcement that Apple Pay now supports charitable donations, and now Blackbaud has made Apple Pay available as part of its integrated digital payments solution, which already services tens of millions of users for charitable giving. Blackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud's solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay -- all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud. \"At Blackbaud, we're innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters,\" said Kevin McDearis , chief products officer at Blackbaud. \"This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy—from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we're working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers.\" Many well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \"Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences,\" said Liz Nielsen , senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. \"It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country.\" Nonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result. \"We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay,\" said Michael Osso , president and CEO of Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. \"CCFA has always been on the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\" David Glass , senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, \"Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund's mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work.\" Apple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio. For more information, visit www.blackbaud.com/apple-pay .

      "text": "NEW YORK – Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services _ until now.\nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed up transactions because people don’t have to re-enter card and contact information.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay offer rewards Updated 10:07 am, Monday, November 14, 2016 NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross , United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed up transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information. Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products. Today's Deals",

      "text": "Reddit \nI’m a pretty big fan of Apple’s recently-launched Beats Solo3 Wireless headphones. The on-ear headphones, which we reviewed back in September , have a high upside for convenience, sound and style. Now that the headphones are widely available in stores, Apple has issued a new advertisement to highlight the advantages of the Beats-branded cans…and Amazon might have another pricing mistake on their hands dropping the price by a whopping $80 , something Apple never does with just released products. \nNot only are the Beats Solo3 the first pair of headphones to ship with Apple’s new W1 wireless chip , which allows for seamless pairing and switching between Apple devices, but they feature a whopping 40 hours of battery life between charges. Be sure to read our full Beats Solo3 hands-on review for a first-hand account of my experience. \nI know the Beats brand isn’t necessarily synonymous with quality around audiophile circles, but I feel like these headphones are worth a serious look. They sounded quite pleasant to my ears, and weren’t overly bass-heavy like other headphones in the line. To be clear, there is still a lean toward the low end of the audio spectrum, but it’s far from being egregious. \nNow that the latest iPhone lacks a headphone jack, Apple is pushing its users to go wireless. The company’s own W1-equipped AirPods were supposed to help usher in this initiative, but since they’ve been delayed, it’s up to Beats to pick up the slack. \nThe Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones are one of three Beats-branded headphones to feature Apple’s W1 chip. The $199.99 PowerBeats 3 have already launched and are now available in store , while the budget-friendly $149.95 BeatsX are still listed as coming this fall. Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on reviews \nThe primary downside that I found with the Beats Solo3 Wireless was its plastic construction, and the fact that it still uses micro-USB for charging. We recently reviewed Twelve South’s Fermata headphone charging stand, and it does a good job of making it easy to recharge the Beats Solo3 via the stand’s built in micro-USB cable. \nAs a side note, you can score a pair of the black versions for $80 less (some other colors for $50 less) than the original $299.95 price. Amazon is selling the black Beats Solo 3 Wireless Headphones for just $219.99 with next-day delivery. This will likely be for a limited time and is possibly a pricing mistake like the one they honored with the new MacBook Pros , so you may want to act REALLY fast.",

Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross , United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Drexel Hamilton ’s Brian White today pounds the table for shares of Apple ( AAPL ), and his Buy rating and $185 price target, declaring it’s a “buying opportunity” in the stock on worries President-elect Donald Trump will impose a 45% tariff on goods from China.\nApple shares today are down $2.98, or almost 3%, at $105.45. The stock is down 5% since Tuesday’s close, before Trump’s upset victory was declared.\nCiting an article this morning in the China paper Global Times , which mentioned the iPhone as one of the goods imported to the U.S. that could be caught up in any Trump tariff act, White views it all as “saber rattling” and argues the rhetoric is unrealistic because Apple can’t really make an iPhone in the U.S.: \nManufacturing the iPhone in volume in the U.S. is unrealistic as many consumers would no longer be able to afford to buy an iPhone due to higher manufacturing costs. This would not just disrupt iPhone sales but also all of the industries/companies that have developed around the mobile Internet over the years. Even if the assembly of an iPhone occurred in the U.S., many of the components necessary to manufacture an iPhone are produced in China or elsewhere in Asia, thus shipment into the U.S. would prove costly. Moreover, we believe finding the workers with the willingness and skill set to assemble an iPhone in the U.S. at the volume levels required by Apple would be an insurmountable task. In China, workers generally are young, live in a dorm on the manufacturing campus and work very long hours. Most workers spend a few years on an assembly line and save money before retiring back to their hometown. \nWhite argues Apple could make a gesture in return for an overseas tax holiday :\nThe U.S. government could tie a lower tax rate on the repatriation of overseas cash (Apple has $237.6 billion in cash and 91% overseas) with investments in the U.S. In 2014, Apple proactively began manufacturing the Mac Pro in Austin, Texas (through an EMS provider) with a commitment through 2021; however, this is a low volume product, thus the impact on Apple was negligible. With the proper incentive, Apple could make a symbolic gesture and manufacture select, low volume programs in the U.S.",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nApple seeded a new round of betas today, bringing iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 Sierra, and tvOS 10.1 to Developer Beta 3. The news comes a week after the last one was offered . \nwatchOS 3.1.1 was notably missing from today's set of builds. It's not entirely surprising, as the version numbers would indicate that while iOS, macOS, and tvOS are minor updates, this is a smaller bug fix update without any front-facing features. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple was done with watchOS 3.1.1 betas. \nThe most noticeable change in this week's group of builds is the TV app on tvOS 10.1. It arrived last week on iOS, but it appears that it took an additional week for the Apple TV. \nSo far, there hasn't been much found in iOS 10.2 beta 3. The new TV app should entirely replace Videos, although if you really still want it, you can get it back through the App Store. The Feedback app has returned as well. \nAs far as macOS 10.12.2 Sierra beta 3 goes, that's a bit of a mystery right now. The release notes don't say anything, so all that we really know is that the build number is 16C48b. Tags",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has released macOS 10.12.2 beta 3 for Mac. The new update follows the initial macOS 10.12.2 beta at the end of October , followed by a slightly updated build earlier this month, and macOS 10.12.2 beta 2. Today’s build is available from the Mac App Store. \nAside from being a mouthful of numbers, macOS 10.12.2 includes Unicode 9.0 emoji support, which matches compatibility in beta versions of iOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.1.1. \nmacOS 10.12.2 will be released to everyone in the future (possibly December), and the beta allows developers to test pre-release versions of the software update before it’s released.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple appears to be retiring the built-in Videos app on iOS in favor of the new TV app coming next month . The behavior is introduced with today’s iOS 10.2 beta 3 ; iOS 10.2 beta 2 included both apps separately. Apple could still change this behavior in a future version of iOS 10.2, although there isn’t much need for both apps for most users. \nThe change should only be present for iOS 10.2 users in the United States as Apple’s new TV app won’t be available outside of the US at launch. Videos does include some features like Home Sharing that do not yet appear to be available in TV. \nIt’s also unclear how TV will handle home videos which suggest Videos could stick around in future betas. For now, Videos remains available to re-install from the App Store like Apple’s other built-in apps that can be hidden which may be the answer for users looking for these specific features. \nTo be clear, the new behavior going forward appears to be that Videos will be hidden by default in the United States (and where TV becomes available) with users needing to manually enable it going forward. \nAside from Home Sharing, the new TV app includes features like loading viewing movies and TV shows purchased from the iTunes Store, synced from iTunes, and via iCloud. TV also includes curated movies and TV shows from various services like HBO, Hulu, Starz, Showtime, and The CW. \nApple’s TV app will also work with the upcoming single sign-on feature for jumping to paid video apps from channels like Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, and more. \nApple’s TV app isn’t fully functional just yet, however, as iOS 10.2 is still in beta. Users in the US can find TV on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with iOS 10.2 beta. The new TV app will also be available on the Apple TV next month. \nFor now, Videos is no longer available on iOS in the United States with TV replacing it including in the Settings app. Guides",

      "text": "Taylor Berman   Credit: Stephen Lam/Getty Images \nBack in September, Apple announced that its AirPods, the wireless ear buds the company designed to accompany its new headphone jack-less iPhone 7, would begin shipping sometime in late October. Halfway through November, AirPods still aren’t in stores, and Apple still hasn’t announced a new shipping date. \nOn October 26, around the time the AirPods were supposed to be hitting stores, an Apple rep told Tech Crunch that “we don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” \nAs Pitchfork notes , that was the last official update from Apple, though last week MacRumors reported that a note from investment bank Barclays indicates that the Pods are set to begin production in early December. From MacRumours: \nBarclays said the initial production run will be “fairly small,” totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch. \nIf the Barclays note is true, then the earliest the easily losable $159 cordless headphones could hit stores is just before the holidays, though early January 2017 is more likely.",

Under its old rules, Apple banned iOS apps from accepting funds for charities or fundraisers through Apple Pay, restricting those transactions to Safari or SMS. Now non-profits can integrate Apple Pay into their website’s checkout page on the web, and add it as an option within mobile apps. Mobile users can authorize their payments with Touch ID right away, and even web users can confirm their payment on an iPhone or Apple Watch after pushing a “donate” button in Safari. Starting today, the American Red Cross, Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, and many other charities have begun accepting Apple Pay donations. The full slate of charities currently accepting Apple Pay donations and those working to roll out the payment method soon are listed below. \nCurrently accepting:",

      "text": "  Apple Beats Solo3 Headphones with W1 Chip $80 off This doesn't look like a price mistake either by Abdel Ibrahim November 14, 2016 \nIf you’re still looking for a really good pair of over-ear headphones, and you’re especially attracted to all the features of the W1 chip, the Beats Solo3’s are available on Amazon for $80 less than through Apple. \nDuring Apple’s event in September , where it introduced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the company announced the W1, a new proprietary chip much like the A10 in the iPhone or S2 in the Apple Watch. The aims of the W1 are easy pairing, strong audio, and great battery life to wireless headphones. \nWhile the company touted this chip on the yet-to-be-released AirPods , they also decided to put it in a few other headphones including the BeatsX, an in-ear earbud aimed for exercise, and the Beats Solo3, an on-ear headphone aim at delivering incredible sound. \nSo far, the Beats Solo3’s are the only headphones you can buy with this chip in them and from the sound of it (pun intended), they are living up to the hype. \nWired , for example, called the Solo3’s “nearly flawless” and a recent review from Business Insider said that most people would likely go weeks before needing to recharge. There really isn’t another headphone on the market that you can say this about. \nAt $219 on Amazon (matte black only), a full $80 cheaper than Apple, we think this is a heck of a deal, especially as we get closer to the holidays. If you’re interested in grabbing a pair of these, we suggest you grab them sooner than later.",

Apple had limited this to buying goods and services - until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed up transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.

      "text": "In late 2016, Microsoft and Apple seem to have swapped places. The Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base continue to push the envelope in performance and design while Apple appears to be spinning its wheels. Ebbs and flows in technology and even within companies are expected. It happened to Microsoft, and it may be going on with Apple and their new MacBook Pro line right now.\nFor many people, the MacBook Pros set the bar for laptops. In fact, you could argue that everything Microsoft does in hardware is to outdo Apple regarding quality and design. It's not a coincidence that the Surface line is priced to match Apple's products. Even Microsoft's ads frequently call out Cupertino .\n\nOur friends over at iMore have just reviewed all three of the new Pros including the 13\" without Touch Bar, the 13\" with Touch Bar, and the dream machine 15\" with Touch Bar.\n\nUnless you live under a rock, you likely know that Apple's announcement of these devices was met with mixed responses even from diehard Apple fans. That's what makes iMore's review interesting as our colleagues are knee deep in the Apple ecosystem. ",

The President lacks authority to follow through on many of Trump’s campaign promises — including this one. Currently, a US President can impose a tariff of up to 15 percent for no more than 150 days. The tax can only be extended if the country is ‘in a state of emergency’ — which seems unlikely. \nThe larger issue might be the oversimplification of campaign talking points. \nWhile no one would argue that bringing jobs back to the US is a good thing — it’s rarely that simple. Due to the interconnectedness of the world’s economies, it’s never as easy as pulling the plug. While we may increase jobs domestically, these same jobs could be offset by others imposing the same — or higher — tariffs. \nIn the end, it’s a zero-sum game. \nBut there is hope. When looking to cut ties overseas and bring jobs home, we could stop trading with countries opposed to the restrictions. It’s not without precedent; just ask North Korea.",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Updated 11:17 am, Monday, November 14, 2016 NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. Apple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now. The American Red Cross , United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. Apple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. Separately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. Americans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.   THE TRUMP TRANSITION",

      "text": "Blackbaud Speeds the Pace of Giving with Apple Pay [November 14, 2016] Tweet \nCHARLESTON, S.C. , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, announced today it has added Apple Pay® to Blackbaud Merchant Services™ so its nonprofit customers can offer donors an easy, secure and private option for digital checkout, just in time for holiday giving. \nThis news comes in conjunction with Apple's announcement that Apple Pay now supports charitable donations, and now Blackbaud has made Apple Pay available as part of its integrated digital payments solution, which already services tens of millions of users for charitable giving. \nBlackbaud Merchant Services is an end-to-end payment processing solution designed exclusively for nonprofits. The addition of Apple Pay as a new checkout option within Blackbaud's solution allows nonprofits to offer their donors an easy and secure way to pay -- all within the secure, simple and affordable donation processing system they have come to rely on from Blackbaud. \n\"At Blackbaud, we're innovating to power every moment that helps nonprofits better understand and engage supporters,\" said Kevin McDearis , chief products officer at Blackbaud. \"This also means building solutions that create frictionless, integrated and secure experiences across devices and platforms to support the work of philanthropy—from cultivation, to fundraising, donation processing and more. Integrating Apple Pay into our digital payments solution is a great example of how we're working to help nonprofits provide their donors with a modern, agile checkout experience that mirrors the convenience and mobility they enjoy as consumers.\" \nMany well-known charities using Blackbaud Merchant Services are already live today with Apple Pay, including American Heart Association, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Feeding America, The Nature Conservancy, WNET and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). \n\"Donor behavior is constantly changing and we want to be able to quickly respond to those changes. Apple Pay lets Feeding America offer our donors a checkout experience that is as easy and fast as the best e-commerce experiences,\" said Liz Nielsen , senior vice president of Direct Marketing & Digital Engagement at Feeding America. \"It is critical that we stay on the front-end of mobile technology if we want to continue to grow support for Feeding America and ultimately get more food to more people facing hunger in our country.\" \nNonprofits have signaled that offering Apple Pay as an option for donors will increase conversion rates from mobile and website visitors, simplify the donation process and reduce the information required for donors to give; potentially even increasing donation frequency as a result. \n\"We are excited to be among the first nonprofit organizations to offer the ability to donate with Apple Pay,\" said Michael Osso , president and CEO of Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. \"CCFA has always been n the forefront of technology to ensure a smooth donor experience. Offering fast and convenient technology that enhances our ability to raise crucial funds, especially during the end-of-year giving season, will help us deliver on our mission to improve the lives of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.\" \nDavid Glass , senior director of online marketing for World Wildlife Fund added, \"Giving donors new and simple ways to contribute to World Wildlife Fund's mission to protect the future of nature is critical to our work.\" \nApple Pay is available today for organizations using Blackbaud Merchant Services to process donations in Luminate Online™. In 2017, Blackbaud will expand Apple Pay functionality across the portfolio. \nFor more information, visit www.blackbaud.com/apple-pay . \nAbout Blackbaud Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) is the world's leading cloud software company powering social good.

      "title": "Samsung Buying Harman to Take on Apple's CarPlay - The Mac Observer",
      "text": "| News \nEveryone wants a piece of your car’s dashboard, and Samsung is buying Harman to get its slice of driving experience. The US$8 billion deal will give Samsung a platform for linking our smartphones to our cars, along with a way for the company to compete with Apple’s CarPlay platform. Samsung buying Harman for $80 billion \nHarman is well known for their speakers, but it’s also a big name in the car market. About 65% of the company’s 2016 sales came from its automotive solution, which include security and connected safety, telematics, and embedded infotainment systems. Harman says more than 30 million vehicles are already using its systems. \nBringing Harman into Samsung’s stable means it’ll already have a ready-made solution for competing with Apple’s CarPlay. It also means Samsung will own Harman’s other brands including AKG, Harman Kardon, Infinity, JBL, Bang & Olufsen, Bowers & Wilkins, Lexicon, Mark Levinson, and Reve. \nSamsung Electronics President and Chief Strategy Officer Young Sohn said our cars are the next platform for smart devices. He said in a statement, “The vehicle of tomorrow will be transformed by smart technology and connectivity in the same way that simple feature phones have become sophisticated smart devices over the past decade.” \nThat sounds like exactly the right thing to say considering Apple has CarPlay partnerships with 40 difference car makers and is pushing for more. \nCarPlay is Apple’s in-dash system for linking to our iPhones to play music and videos, show driving directions, answer phone calls, and more—all hands-free. Instead of locking users into an in-dash system for the life of the vehicle, CarPlay users get a new system or new features when they update or upgrade their iPhone. \nThat’s a market Samsung wants in on, and buying Harman outright is much easier than starting from scratch. \nSamsung says Harman fans don’t need to worry about the company disappearing. Harman will continue to operate as an independent company after the buyout wraps up some time in mid-2017. There will, however, be some blending of technologies. Samsung plans to incorporate its tech with Harman’s for consumer and professional audio systems, and Internet connected devices, too. \n“Samsung will gain access to Harman’s 8,000 software designers and engineers who are unlocking the potential of the IoT market,” the company said in a statement. “This collaboration will deliver the next generation of cloud-based consumer and enterprise experiences, as well as end-to-end services for the automotive market through the convergence of design, data and devices.” \nIn other words, Harman will operate as its own company, but Samsung will be a hands-on owner.

      "text": "NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are little changed Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That's cancelling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. Higher bond yields, in turn, are hurting shares of companies that pay big dividends. Energy companies are slipping with the price of oil. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points, or 0.1 per cent , to 18,858 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite sank 11 points, or 0.2 per cent , to 5,226.\nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Those stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas.\nApple gave up $3.01, or 2.8 per cent , to $105.42 while Facebook declined $2.90, or 2.4 per cent , to $116.12 and Microsoft slid $1.18, or 2 per cent , to $57.84. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $16.07, or 2.1 per cent , to $755.68.\nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they've done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation.\nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Goldman Sachs made the biggest gain among Dow stocks as it rose $5.96, or 2.9 per cent , to $209.90 and Bank of America rose 93 cents, or 4.9 per cent , to $19.95. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.64, or 3.4 per cent , to $79.33.\nDOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.06, or 25.2 per cent , to $109.71.\nMENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 per cent , to $36.35.\nDIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.82, or 15.7 per cent , to $13.48 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added 67 cents, or 1 per cent , to $70.37.\nBONDS: Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.22 per cent . Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 per cent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 per cent .\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.21 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0755 from $1.0845.\nENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 58 cents, or 1.3 per cent , to $42.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, or 1.6 per cent , to $44.05 a barrel in London.\nThat pulled energy companies lower. Anadarko Petroleum fell 99 cents, or 1.6 per cent , to $60.05 and Exxon Mobil lost 85 cents, or 1 per cent , to $84.82.\nDIVIDEND PAYERS DIVE: Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Phone and utility companies and household goods makers traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.39, or 4.2 per cent , to $101.32 and Duke Energy lost 87 cents, or 1.2 per cent , to $74.37.\nRead More TRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck.\nOVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 per cent . The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 per cent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 per cent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that's helped the country's exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 per cent .\n____\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\nMarley Jay, The Associated Press",

      "text": "tweet \nApple’s wireless Beats-branded Solo3 Wireless headphones launched not too long ago, and are widely available in retail now, so the advertisements are rolling in. \nApple’s latest ad shows off the Solo3 Wireless headphones in all their wire-free glory, with folks dancing around, free of cords, and (hopefully) listening to music inside those over-the-ear cans. The ad, while obvious in its wire-free promotion, also takes time to show off physical controls on the headphones by answering a phone call. \nThe ad is only about 20 seconds long, and at the tail-end reminds potential buyers that the battery inside the wireless headphones lasts up to 40 hours. It’s also equipped with Apple’s W1 chip, so pairing with your other Apple products should be quick and easy. \nYou can check out the ad below. Like this post? Share it!",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services - until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.  ",

      "text": "Following in the footsteps of Apple and Google, Korean tech giant Samsung is making a bid on the connected car. The company announced that it's acquiring audio and car tech veteran Harman for $8 billion, which will allow Samsung to build its own smart car platform while refining its existing mobile gadgets and home electronics. \nPhoto: Harman \nHarman is perhaps best known for providing cars with infotainment systems -- over 30 million vehicles already use the company's high-tech dashboards. According to a press release , the deal will combine Harman's \"top positions in infotainment, cyber security, over-the-air updates and telematics, with Samsung’s significant expertise and experience in connectivity technologies, including 5G, UX/UI, display technology and security solutions.\"\nMORE: Connected Cars: A Guide to New Vehicle Technology \nThat leads us to believe that Samsung is working on its own connected car platform in the vein of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. Those services let you do things such as use smartphone apps on your car dashboard and call and text friends hands-free, among other features. \nWhile Samsung is clearly making a big push into the connected cars space, this deal will likely have an impact on many of the company's other products. Harman owns a wide range of audio brands including JBL and Harman/Kardon, and the press release notes that these brands will enhance the audio features of Samsung's mobile devices, wearables, displays and VR headsets. \nSamsung will also have access to the 8,000 Harman employees working on Internet of Things devices, which gives the company plenty of resources for refining its smart home products.\nThis potentially exciting deal comes at a bit of an awkward time for Samsung, a company that's working to restore customer goodwill after its faulty Galaxy Note 7 devices (and even a few washing machines ) started exploding in the hands of customers. If shoppers can't trust Samsung's phones not to blow up, they'll probably be a bit hesitant to put a Samsung dashboard in their car. \nSee Also : 10 Best High-Tech Cars on the Road in 2016 \nApple CarPlay vs. Android Auto: Connected Car Face-Off 12 Best Android Apps You're Not Using Here Are the 10 Best Smartphones Available About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services - until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.  ",

      "text": "In the beginning they counted your steps, your distance, and your calorie burn. Then they counted your heartbeats. Some tried their luck at analyzing your sleep quality, with varying degrees of success.\nFitness trackers have been around for a few years now. Sensors have gotten better and cheaper. Algorithms have advanced. But what I’d argue is the most important fitness measurement—at least for aerobic stuff like running—has still not been added.\nLet&apos;s call it \"pain factor,\" the level and duration of physical strain or fatigue you feel while exercising.\nWorkouts come and workouts go. We come to our workouts at various times of the day and week, and with various body conditions—different amounts and quality of sleep, different types and amounts of fuel (food) in the tank, different stress levels. So that workout that seemed like a piece of cake on Monday morning can feel grueling on Thursday afternoon.\nIt’s that level of suffering we should be watching. The difference between someone who’s successful at working out well and consistently, and someone who isn&apos;t, may be in their ability to understand pain level and their capacity for pain—and manage it accordingly.\nYou don’t need a device to tell you when you’re feeling the burn. But a device could put a number on it that’s based on real, measurable factors. \"Pain factor\" is a relative number, meaningful only in its relationship to other pain levels at other times.\nHow It Might Work A pain algorithm would process some simple information that we, and our bodies, provide. It would need to know something about what I’d eaten that day. It might factor in the quality of my sleep the night before. Heart rate relative to the difficulty of the workout would likely be a factor.\nLet’s say we can now look down at our wrist and see a \"pain level\" number from 1 to 10. What could we do with that? How could that help?\nIt could change the way you normally measure the quality of your workout. Instead of looking at basic metrics like pace, duration, or distance, you might begin seeing \"quality\" as the amount of time you maintained a specific activity at a given pain level.\nLet’s say you haven’t worked out in a while and you’ve fallen out of shape. You might reach your pain factor norm well before you finish the normal time or distance of your workout. Time to stop.\nOn the other hand, if you’re having one of those good days when your body seems eager to work out, and you finish your normal workout before hitting your normal pain level, you might choose to tack an extra 10 minutes on to the end of the session.\nIt could serve as a motivation tool. Let’s say you’re a little tired when you start your normal 35-minute run around the park. And five minutes in you’re hurting. If you know you have, in the past, powered through the same run at the same pain level, it might make you think, \"I’ve been here before; I know I can do this\" and keep going.\nOn the same logic, pain (or, rather, too much of it) doesn’t always turn into gain. Many people work out too hard (often driven by guilt about not working out enough) and endure more than a workout’s worth of pain. That can have physical risks, like injuries from trying to lift too much weight when you&apos;re tired.\nThe main risk might be psychological. It’s that high pain level you tend to remember after the fact, not the extra 20 minutes you spent on the treadmill. And that memory of physical—and mental—pain can make it mentally harder to get yourself back in the gym or back on the trail. And consistent workouts with moderate pain always trump infrequent, painful workouts.\nPerhaps the main theme in the evolution of health wearables is their ability to go beyond giving users raw, static data like time and distance, and deliver meaningful, actionable insights that can directly impact performance and health. \"Pain factor\" might be an example of that. The new metric would result from data crunching a set of more basic static and real-time numbers—some provided by sensors, others provided by the user—to generate a meaningful number for the user.\nOf course, even more useful would be a device that knows the meaning of that score so that it could say things like: \"You’ve suffered enough today, Mark. Now hit the showers.\"\nRelated Video: Are There Any Tech Products That Excite You?",

Apple had limited this to buying goods and services \" until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed up transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Posted:   3:  20:07:31     1:  \nNEW YORK (AP) - Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services - until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.  ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are little changed Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That&apos;s canceling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. Higher bond yields, in turn, are hurting shares of companies that pay big dividends. Energy companies are slipping with the price of oil.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,858 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor&apos;s 500 index lost 1 point to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite sank 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,226.\nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Those stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump&apos;s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas.\nApple gave up $3.01, or 2.8 percent, to $105.42 while Facebook declined $2.90, or 2.4 percent, to $116.12 and Microsoft slid $1.18, or 2 percent, to $57.84. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $16.07, or 2.1 percent, to $755.68.\nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they&apos;ve done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation.\nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump&apos;s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Goldman Sachs made the biggest gain among Dow stocks as it rose $5.96, or 2.9 percent, to $209.90 and Bank of America rose 93 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $19.95. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.64, or 3.4 percent, to $79.33.\nDOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.06, or 25.2 percent, to $109.71.\nMENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor&apos;s stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35.\nDIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.82, or 15.7 percent, to $13.48 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it&apos;s too low. Belden stock added 67 cents, or 1 percent, to $70.37.\nBONDS: Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump&apos;s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.22 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans&apos; Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent.\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.21 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0755 from $1.0845.\nENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $44.05 a barrel in London.\nThat pulled energy companies lower. Anadarko Petroleum fell 99 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $60.05 and Exxon Mobil lost 85 cents, or 1 percent, to $84.82.\nDIVIDEND PAYERS DIVE: Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Phone and utility companies and household goods makers traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.39, or 4.2 percent, to $101.32 and Duke Energy lost 87 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.37.\nTRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck.\nOVERSEAS: France&apos;s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany&apos;s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan&apos;s economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that&apos;s helped the country&apos;s exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.\n----\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\n ",

      "text": "Apple Pay expands to charities, Samsung Pay to offer rewards Posted: Updated: \nNEW YORK (AP) - Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits. \nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services - until now. \nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon. \nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods. \nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. \nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.  ",

      "text": "NEW YORK - U.S. stocks are little changed Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That's canceling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. Higher bond yields, in turn, are hurting shares of companies that pay big dividends. Energy companies are slipping with the price of oil. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,858 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite sank 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,226. \nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Those stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. \nApple gave up $3.01, or 2.8 percent, to $105.42 while Facebook declined $2.90, or 2.4 percent, to $116.12 and Microsoft slid $1.18, or 2 percent, to $57.84. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $16.07, or 2.1 percent, to $755.68. \nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they've done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation. \nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Goldman Sachs made the biggest gain among Dow stocks as it rose $5.96, or 2.9 percent, to $209.90 and Bank of America rose 93 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $19.95. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.64, or 3.4 percent, to $79.33. \nDOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.06, or 25.2 percent, to $109.71. \nMENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35. \nDIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.82, or 15.7 percent, to $13.48 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added 67 cents, or 1 percent, to $70.37. \nBONDS: Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. \nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.22 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday.

The euro fell to $1.0755 from $1.0845. \nENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $44.05 a barrel in London. \nThat pulled energy companies lower.

      "text": "show chapters \nApple hurting the Nasdaq\nColin Gillis, Director of Research & Senior Technology Analyst, BGC Financial, L.P., discusses why the stock is down over 11 percent in the last 4 weeks.\nApple hurting the Nasdaq      1 Hour Ago | 02:55 A growing threat of a U.S. trade war with China has only exacerbated existing problems for Apple , according one of the company's biggest critics on Wall Street.\n\"When you focus in on Apple in particular, the concern is that if we have a trade war with China, that Apple is going to suffer — and it will suffer more so than the other multinational tech companies,\" Colin Gillis, senior technology analyst and director of research at BGC Financial, told CNBC's \" Power Lunch \" on Monday. \nShares of Apple have fallen more than 4 percent over the past week, as technology companies like Amazon and Alphabet have also tumbled. After the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, Chinese media warned that any tariffs on Chinese goods would be met with higher prices, especially for iPhone, which is made with parts that are Chinese-made and assembled. Trump has vowed to drive a hard bargain with the Asian superpower.\nThere could be positives in a Trump presidency for Apple, Gillis said. But one factor — a tax holiday for repatriation of Apple's overseas cash — has already been \"factored in\" to the share price by investors, he said. \n\nGillis said that unlike rival Google, Apple has fewer products, and thus fewer opportunities to monetize their users. Plus, Gillis said, Apple faces growing competition from local Chinese smartphone makers. \n\"It's a one-product company,\" Gillis said. \"So does it deserve to trade at a premium? No, it doesn't.\" \nTo be sure, Gillis is in the minority among analysts. At $85 a share, his target price for Apple's stock is by far the lowest of any analyst listed in FactSet. Gillis dropped his price target in July , maintaining a \"sell\" rating despite a 16 percent rise in Apple's shares in the past six months, according to FactSet data.\n\nApple saw revenue fall 30 percent from a year ago in the fourth quarter in Greater China, its third-largest market based on its financial reporting. In the second calendar quarter, Chinese companies Oppo and Vivo saw year-over-year worldwide smartphone shipments increase 136.6 percent and 80.2 percent, respectively, according to IDC.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has said he's still very bullish on China's long-term prospects . CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.\nBut Gillis said that unless Apple can grow beyond its main source of revenue, the iPhone, it's simply \"GoPro on steroids.\" \n\"There are risks embedded in China, both for consumer tastes and government regulation,\" Gillis said.",

      "title": "MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review roundup: This gimmick isn’t for everyone",
      "text": "At the beginning of the month, we rounded up reviews for Apple's 13-inch, Touch Bar-less MacBook Pro . Despite its hefty price and lack of the most intriguing new feature, the reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with most outlets claiming that the MacBook Pro with function keys would be a solid upgrade for anyone that needed to move on from an aging machine.\nThe consensus isn't quite as clear when it comes to the Touch Bar models.\nMUST SEE: Titanfall 2 review: Iron giants\nBelow, we've cobbled together some highlights from 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar reviews from around the internet:\nThe Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern is as critical as anyone of the new MBP. While she prefers the design and the display of the latest model, the additions aren't nearly enough for her to recommend this model over last year's:\n\"So how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out.\"\nRead the full review .\nThe Verge Having already covered the computer itself fairly comprehensively earlier this month, The Verge dedicated most of its review to discussing the Touch Bar:\n\"The good news is that the Touch Bar’s interface is all software. It can be updated and refined and improved. I suspect it’ll take a little while before Apple and third-party developers find the best use for each of their specific apps, but I hope they’ll learn quickly that there’s a fine line between presenting helpful options and overwhelming their users. Apple and developers will also have to decide who the Touch Bar is for: pros or amateurs. Many of us are already familiar with keyboard shortcuts in the apps we’re using, and so far I’ve found that forcing myself to use the Touch Bar tends to slow me down.\"\nRead the full review .\nEngadget Much like the WSJ , Engadget is disappointed in the trade-offs a user has to make when deciding whether or not to upgrade to the latest MacBook Pro model:\n\"I'm one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn't quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year's model. Let me keep my full-size USB ports, and my function keys, and my longer battery life, but stick with this thinner and lighter design. Stick with this improved display, Touch ID sensor, fast disk performance and more robust audio quality. For me, this is both a step forward and a step backward.\"\nRead the full review .\nSlashGear Although many MacBook Pro users have been waiting years for a significant upgrade to the lineup, SlashGear feels like it still might be worth waiting another year for the MBP that will improve on everything Apple introduced in 2016:\n\"I can’t help but imagine a 2017 MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors and several months of developers getting to grips with the potential of Touch ID and the Touch Bar. As it stands today, though, the dongle frustration and the fact that you really need to pay $1799 or more – the entry-level 13-inch misses out too much, in my opinion, to be worth considering – are outweighed by the improvements in graphics, the excellent build quality, and the promise its unique hardware coupled with macOS represents.\"\nRead the full review .\nCNNMoney CNNMoney also has plenty of praise to shower on the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro, but as with virtually every other review, has some reservations as well:\n\"Overall, the latest version of the MacBook Pro is all about the Touch Bar. Is the novel concept reason enough to purchase the new MacBook Pro? No. But it's a sweet bonus to arguably the best performing laptop on the market.\nIf you're debating whether the extra $300 for the Touch Bar and TouchID is worth it, it depends what kind of user you are. Sure, both features are handy, but they're more of a bonus than a necessity. The pricier model will also give you a faster processor and two more Thunderbolt ports (a plus if you need to connect to more displays).\nThen again, if these qualifications aren't appealing and you're not doing a ton of intensive work, such as video or photo editing, you're probably better off with a cheaper MacBook Air.\"\nRead the full review .\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss Watch Dave Chappelle’s hilarious SNL opening monologue tackle all things Trump Watch a Tesla Model S P100D race against a $265,000 McLaren 650S Spider See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

The initial group of supporters includes 19 organizations, such as the American Heart Association , Doctors Without Borders , Feeding America , the International Rescue Committee , UNICEF , and the World Wildlife Fund . Five more will be joining \"soon,\" Apple said, namely the American Cancer Society , CARE , DonorsChoose.org , PBS , and the United Way . Efforts appear to be concentrated on Web-based donations, even though some of the organizations have apps. Web transactions were introduced to Apple Pay in September, alongside iOS 10 and macOS Sierra. It's unknown why Apple wasn't previously supporting non-profit donations, but the company typically claims a small fee from each Apple Pay transaction, which it would presumably want to waive for charities. The company is also likely vetting each entity, considering the risk posed by scam artists. The full list of launch-day organizations includes:",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s new MacBook Pro replaces the function row of keys with a dynamic screen called the Touch Bar, and customers who pre-ordered early are starting to see them ship as soon as today. Apple Stores should also receive inventory to try out this week, but you can test drive how macOS will handle the Touch Bar from your current Mac with a new app called Touché. \nTouché is easy to download and install, can be opened and closed like any other Mac app, and lets you take screenshots of the Touch Bar and whatever it shows. The free utility comes from Daniel Jalkut, the developer behind other Red Sweater Software apps like the blogging app MarsEdit . \nSeveral Apple apps support Touch Bar with the latest version of macOS, and third-party apps like 1Password and plenty of others are also adding Touch Bar support. \nTouché lets you easily see how macOS and specific apps will handle the Touch Bar without requiring a new MacBook Pro to fully visualize it (and easily screenshot apps once you do upgrade). \nSystem Requirements \nTouché requires macOS 10.12.1 or later, but there’s a catch! You must have the very latest 10.12.1, with system support for the Touch Bar. If your 10.12.1 version is specifically 16B2657 , you’re good to go. If not, you can update to the required version here . \nKeyboard Shortcuts \nYou can set keyboard shortcuts for toggling Touché, saving a screen capture to disk, or copying a screen capture to the pasteboard. Explore these options in Touché’s preferences, available from the Touché menu in the menu bar at the top of the screen. \nSupport Touché \nAlthough Touché is free to download, you can show your support for the product in a number of ways: Spread the word to your friends!

Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft had large gains this year and they're not in a hole. Only Apple is the king of laggards. What stock has the biggest sell-off today? Apple, of course. Take a look at the P/E of Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft and those stocks have very healthy P/Es of high 30s and above. Only Apple's P/E looks like it belongs to a company that is ready to go out of business. So, the Megatech trade hits Apple the hardest because Apple has been put in a weakened position by Tim Cook and his quest to flood China with iPhones. That Chinese iPhone strategy hasn't been going all that well lately but now it has really exploded in his face. Less in Tim Cook's face but more in loyal Apple shareholders' faces. Apple, how low can you go? NOVEMBER 14, 2016 2:58 P.M.

Now it's time for chest-thumping and sword-waving from Trump to show he's the big kahuna in the White House. He might as well spit in China's face with his tough-guy rhetoric. I had really hoped America and China would get along, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Time to start making more enemies. Dammit. There will never be any peace in this world. I'd hoped if Clinton had made it into the WH things would continue to move somewhat smoothly but now it looks like there's going to be a constant shouting match between China and America and it's not going to solve anything.

      "text": "Apple’s stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China.\nApple aapl is among several major technology stocks--including Amazon.com amzn , Facebook fb , and Alphabet googl --selling off since Tuesday’s election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefitting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump.\nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, Calif. company’s stock fell 2.5% on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday’s election to almost 5%, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.16% advance.\nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of “tit-for-tat” retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45% tariffs on all imports from China.\nFor more, read: China Threatens to Cut iPhone Sales Over Trump Rhetoric \n“A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,” the op-ed said.\nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets.\nRevenue from China slumped 30% in Apple’s September quarter, worse than the Americas’ 7% decline.\nApple’s China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country’s weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump’s campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term.\n“You just don’t just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,” Morgan said.",

      "text": "Technology Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. Posted 15 Nov 2016 05:10 A man holds Apple smartphone outside an Apple store in Beijing, China, September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Thomas Peter A \nSAN FRANCISCO: Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com , Facebook and Alphabet , selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns US$33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. \n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown) - Reuters",

NEW YORK — Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now.\nThe American Red Cross, United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed up transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, redeemable for gift cards and products.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Market News   4:08pm EST Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO \nSAN FRANCISCO Nov 14 Apple's stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com, Facebook and Alphabet, selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefitting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. \n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown) Next In Market News",

      "text": "Business News  45pm EST Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO \nSAN FRANCISCO Apple's ( AAPL.O ) stock extended recent losses on Monday after a warning that iPhone sales could suffer if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on campaign threats to impose new tariffs on China. \nApple is among several major technology stocks, including Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ), selling off since Tuesday's election as investors shift funds into financial and public works companies seen benefiting from deregulation and infrastructure spending under President-elect Trump. \nIn a continuation of that trend, the Cupertino, California company's stock fell 2.5 percent on Monday, bringing its loss since Tuesday's election to almost 5 percent, compared to the S&P 500's .SPX 1.16 percent advance. \nAdding to concern for Apple investors, an op-ed published in the China government-backed Global Times on Sunday warned of \"tit-for-tat\" retaliation should Trump follow through on a campaign pledge to impose 45-percent tariffs on all imports from China. \n\"A batch of Boeing ( BA.N ) orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted,\" the op-ed said. \nChina has already become a disappointment for Apple, failing to deliver rapid growth that the company hoped would make up for slower iPhone sales in the United States and other mature markets. \nRevenue from China slumped 30 percent in Apple's September quarter, worse than the Americas' 7 percent decline. \nApple's China sales could be hurt by potential trade conflicts as well as the country's weakening currency, said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang by email. He said he believes China iPhone sales fell in October, even after fixing supply issues affecting the iPhone 7 Plus. \nSynovus Trust Company Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan, who owns $33 million worth of Apple shares, warned not to read too much into Trump's campaign trail threats against China, at least in the near term. \n\"You just don't just jump in and start rewriting trade agreements,\" Morgan said. \n(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown) Next In Business News",

      "text": "Apple's solution to the new MacBook Pro 's lack of conventional ports is dongles. A lot of dongles. $250 of dongles, actually. But if you're not a fan of carrying around a bunch of white pieces of floppy plastic, there are other options (apart from buying a different computer, I mean). The most visually appealing is the Arc Hub , a new concept that sticks all the ports you'll ever need into an elegant circular hub. Despite the fact that just looking at it makes Jony Ive's dulcet tones appear inside my head, it's not actually designed by Apple. Instead, it's been conceived by a tiny Californian startup you've probably never heard of. \n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nBest Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss ",
