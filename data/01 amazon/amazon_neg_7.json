      "text": "  Während der gesamte Onlinehandel in China, einen Tag vor dem Singles Day , auf neue Verkaufs- und Umsatzrekorde zusteuert, schmeißt Amazon.de für Deutschland und die Cyber Monday Woche schon mal die Leuchtreklame an. Amazon.de bietet Kunden in der Cyber Monday Woche vom 21. bis einschließlich 28. November 2016 mehr Angebote als je zuvor: Acht Tage lang gibt es über 10.000 Blitzangebote und Angebote des Tages mit bis zu 50 Prozent Rabatt aus nahezu allen Kategorien. Laut Amazon starten zwischen 6:00 und 20:15 Uhr auf www.amazon.de/angebote Blitzangebote im 5-Minuten-Takt. Die Schnäppchen sind nur in begrenzter Anzahl und maximal für 4 Stunden verfügbar und können blitzschnell ausverkauft sein. Vorteil für Prime-Kunden : Die ersten 30 Minuten lang stehen Blitzangebote exklusiv Prime-Mitgliedern zur Verfügung. Zusätzlich gibt es täglich ausgewählte Top-Produkte als Angebote des Tages, die jeweils schon ab Mitternacht für 24 Stunden erhältlich sind. Auch hier gilt: solange der Vorrat reicht. Am Freitag ( Black Friday ) in der Cyber Monday Woche (25.11.) warten auf Kunden noch einmal besonders tolle Angebote. Zum Start jedes Angebots werden auf der Produkt-Detailseite der neue Preis des Produkts und die - soweit verfügbar - unverbindliche Preisempfehlung (UVP) angezeigt. Der Kunde kann das Angebot damit zum vorherigen Amazon-Preis, oder falls vorhanden, auch zur UVP vergleichen und so auf einen Blick checken, wie attraktiv das Angebot ist. Tests",

      "title": "25 awesome and weird things we bought using Amazon Prime",
      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nAmazon\nAmazon is called \"The Everything Store\" for good reason. We use it for everything . Thanks to Amazon Prime , whatever we order, we never have to wait longer than two days for it to arrive at our door. Sometimes our items even show up the same day.\nBut with great purchasing power comes some unusual choices. I asked my Business Insider colleagues to share the best things they’ve bought on a whim using Amazon Prime, and I got some interesting responses.\nSome are practical (hangers), some are nostalgic (a box of Rice Krispies Treats Cereal), some are political (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton chia pets), and some you probably didn't realize you needed (a phone case with room for your credit cards).\nCheck out our favorite Amazon Prime buys below.\nView As: One Page Slides A box of cereal Amazon It turns out my favorite childhood cereal is still available to buy on Amazon. I was so excited, I bought four boxes. Best 2 a.m. purchase ever!\nRice Krispies Treats Rice Cereal, $3.14\nHangers Amazon I know this is probably the most boring answer in the world, but for a shopaholic like me, these are a lifesaver.\nAmazonBasics Velvet Shirt/Dress Hangers (50-Pack), $17.87\nLEGOs Amazon The Lego Simpsons house for me, a crazy Simpsons fan.\nLEGO Simpsons House, $199.95\nA grill Amazon My grill. It ended up coming early (the next day), too!\nWeber Performer Deluxe Charcoal Grill, 22-Inch, $399\nA pizza steel Amazon I bought two pizza steels while at a customer dinner once. Only meant to buy one...but they were both there before I got back to my house the next day.\nThe Original Baking Steel, $89\nA mug Amazon My boyfriend accidentally broke my original \"cow\" mug while washing the dishes. And I kid you not, a replacement was ordered on Amazon within the hour. This mug brings me such joy; I don't even like cows that much.\nBoston Warehouse Udderly Cows Mug, $8.84\nFlavored candy corn Amazon I recently spent around $15 to order apple-flavored candy corn. I was devastated that Dylan's Candy Bar wasn't selling flavored candy corns this year (they had about 20 different kinds last year!), so in my distress I turned to Amazon, and they had so many weird flavors to choose from! Thanks for fueling my candy addiction, Amazon.\nBrach's Apple Mix Candy Corn, $9.55\nA can of SpaghettiOs Amazon I once stole a tin of SpaghettiOs from my girlfriend's flatmate when she was out. I was able to replace the tin on the same day thanks to Amazon Prime!\nSpaghettiOs Meatballs, $1.69\nA 3DS game Amazon I'm a big fan of Amazon Prime. It's really brought out the inner child in me on some products!\nThe Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3DS [Digital Code], $39.99\nA chia pet Amazon These Chia pets — they're just beginning to sprout now!\nChia Hillary Clinton Freedom of Choice Pottery Planter, $19.86\nA streaming stick Amazon In one day , I cancelled my cable service, ordered a Roku streaming stick through Amazon Prime, and my package was waiting at my apartment by the time I got home from the office. I am still in awe of Prime's complimentary same-day shipping. It's like going shopping at a regular store without leaving your desk.\nRoku Streaming Stick (3600R), $48.57\nStraws Amazon I once ordered straws and nothing else.\nIkea Smoothie Straws (100-Pack), $6.35\nA bed frame Amazon I bought an entire bed frame off Amazon Prime Now.\nFor anyone who hasn’t used it, it’s Amazon’s courier service — basically, anything that’s in the local warehouses can be shipped out to you within one or two hours.\nIt’s a pretty mundane product, but you have to hand it to the company for nailing logistics down to the point where you can get a heavy, unwieldy package from Manhattan to Brooklyn for rock-bottom prices. (I tipped, generously.)\nApologies to the poor soul who had to load it onto the van for being that guy.\nZinus 14-Inch SmartBase Platform Bed Frame (Queen), $69\nAn electric toothbrush Amazon I recently bought this toothbrush, and it has changed the way I look at brushing my teeth. It used to feel like a chore, but this takes the work out of it. It also seems really efficient, it's decently priced, has great battery life, and best of all, it runs for two minutes so I can't \"rush\" or underbrush.\nPhilips Sonicare Essence Sonic Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush, $24.97\nSilicone wedding bands Amazon My husband and I are really active and travel a lot, and we're always worried about destroying/losing our wedding rings when we're playing sports/ hiking / swimming / staying in unknown places, so for an anniversary present I bought us both these Qalo rings .\nThey're made of medical-grade silicone and they're super comfortable. Lots of users have switched to silicone rings permanently; I haven't gone that far yet, but I can see myself doing it in the future. Also, a couple started the company, and they do lots of philanthropic work. Cute.\nQALO Silicone Wedding Ring, $19.99\nA speaker system Amazon I picked these up when my Klipsch speakers blew out. Figured they were a budget buy and wouldn't last long. Almost 4 years of daily use later, they still sound great — no issues whatsoever.\nCyber Acoustics 30 Watt Powered Speakers with Subwoofer for PC and Gaming Systems, $42.95\nAn umbrella Amazon This umbrella gets used nearly every weekend during the summer months. I've lost a few of the original stakes, but replacements are cheap.\nSport-Brella Portable All-Weather and Sun Umbrella, $50.45\nA Bluetooth speaker Amazon Originally purchased for a summer vacation on the beach, this little workhorse is now used pretty much every day by my wife.\nMpow Portable Bluetooth Speaker with 1,000 mAh Power Bank, $26.99\nA gaming keyboard Amazon I threw my old keyboard directly in the trash after getting this in the mail.\nSROCKER Rainbow Backlight LED Gaming Keyboard, $25.99\nCheap earbuds Amazon I was looking for some headphones to wear while exercising, but didn't want to shell out for a premium pair — I know I'd either destroy them or lose them. This pair was one of the cheapest I've ever purchased, but they are by far the best.\nThey clip to my shirt to stay put, a wire cinch keeps them from getting tangled on weight-lifting equipment, and they even come with a carrying pouch. When I'm exercising, they stay firmly in my ear, sound halfway decent, and simply will not die.\nI've run in the rain with them, left them outside, and even stepped on them. And they come in some cool colors! Best $18 I've ever spent.\nMEE audio Sport-Fi M6 Noise Isolating In-Ear Headphones, $17.99\nA wallet-phone case Amazon Along with 9,999 other items, I always get my phone cases using Amazon Prime. I'm obsessed with this one Verus makes that can fit 3 credit cards and a $20 in a secret compartment in the back. You can't even tell the compartment is there. People always gasp when I open it up to pay for things. My mom got one for her iPhone, too.\nVerus Damda Slide iPhone 6S Case, $14.99\nAn apple peeler Amazon My apple peeler, corer, slicer...it's genius!\nPrecision Kitchenware Apple Peeler, Corer, and Slicer, $15.99\nProtein bars Amazon Just bought these protein bars. The most filling thing my family has ever eaten!\nMuscle Pharm Combat Crunch Baked Protein Bars (24-Pack), $37.99\nLens wipes Amazon These wipes are great. My sister-in-law used to yell at me for using Windex to clean my glasses; she works in the industry and says that Windex destroys the coating on eye glasses. These wipes on the other hand don't do that. Bonus after I wipe my glasses clean, I will use the wipe to clean my phone.\nZeiss Portable Lens Wipes Pouch (20 Count), $3.69\nSand coasters Amazon I just bought these as stocking stuffers for our beach vacation that begins the day after Christmas. Super excited about them!\nTurtlebacks Sand Coaster Drink Cup Holder (4-Pack), $12.90\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "title": "Judge: Amazon to Reimburse Customers for in-App Buys by Kids - ABC News",
      "text": "Email A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission. The Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices . The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google . All three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password. Seattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims. The judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards. 0 Shares",

      "text": "Amazon just revealed its deals for Black Friday, which apply to its range of Amazon-branded products. There are plenty of discounts, starting with the Kindle Paperwhite on November 20 and then several more beginning on November 24.\nAmazon emailed TechnoBuffalo and said that the products will be available for a limited time, so you’ll want to act while they’re on sale, particularly if these are on any of your holiday shopping lists. Amazon said it’s also going to introduce new sales in the coming weeks. Below is the exact sampling sent over to us from Amazon. I’m sorta bummed there still isn’t a discount on the Kindle Oasis, my favorite eReader to date.\nAmazon Black Friday Deals: Starting November 20 , Kindle Paperwhite will be $20 off – just $99.99 Starting November 24 , Amazon Echo will be $40 off – just $139.99 Starting November 24 , Echo Dot will be $10 off – just $39.99 Starting November 24 , Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote will be $10 off – just $29.99 Starting November 24 , Fire HD 8 will be $30 off – only $59.99 Starting November 24 , Fire tablet will only be only $33.33 I recommend grabbing the Amazon Echo at its steep discount, then adding a few Echo Dots around the house to complement it. Maybe toss in a Fire TV stick just to get Alexa on the TV, too.",

      "text": "News and commentary about the stocks you need to know about today Search Stocks to Watch2 November 10, 2016, 5:27 P.M. ET You’re Fired! Amazon, Apple Sink Nasdaq as Dow Soars 218 Points to New High By Ben Levisohn \nStocks rose for a second day after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory …unless you’re the Nasdaq Composite , which was pulled lower by big losses in Apple ( AAPL ), Facebook ( FB ), and Amazon.com ( AMZN ). Getty Images \nThe S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 2,167.48 today, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 218.19 points, or 1.2%, to 18,807.88. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8% to 5,208.80. For the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it’s a new all-time high . The Nasdaq’s underperformance relative to the Dow was its largest since 2009. \nCapital Economics’ John Higgins tries to explain the stock market’s sudden optimism: \nWhat explains the strength of the US stock market since Donald Trump won the race to the White House? Part of the answer is that investors think he will have more success in implementing his domestic policy agenda in light of the Republicans’ retention of Congress. This can be seen in the relative performance of the major sectors of the S&P 500. \nLeading the charge was the financial sector, which benefited from the possibility of a lighter regulatory touch and from the steepening of the yield curve that resulted from Trump’s plans for substantially looser fiscal policy. \nNot far behind was the health care sector, which welcomed the fact that a clampdown on the prices of medication is now unlikely . \nAnd other notable gainers were the industrial, basic materials and energy sectors , amid hopes of a splurge on infrastructure spending. \nAdmittedly, Wednesday’s moves were broadly in keeping with this year’s trends – three of the sectors mentioned above (energy, industrials and basic materials) have been the best performers so far in 2016. \nBut until the election, these sectors largely benefited from other factors altogether, such as diminished concerns about the health of China’s economy and OPEC’s pledge to limit output. \nAs it happens, we are not convinced that Trump will be able to get a massive fiscal expansion through Congress and will have more to say about this topic on our US Economics service in due course. Nonetheless, some shift towards looser fiscal policy does seem possible. \nNeedless to say, this could have important implications for asset prices, including those of US equities, which picked up on Thursday where they left off on Wednesday in terms of sector developments. \nInstinet’s Frank Cappelleri remains optimistic about large-cap tech: \nIt’s no secret that Large Cap Techs underperformed yesterday and have gotten clocked today President-Elect Trump’s potential stricter policies on immigration, aim to keep more manufacturing within our domestic boarders and anti-trust chatter have been reflected in sharp downturns in Facebook , Amazon.com, Netflix ( NFLX ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Apple and Microsoft ( MSFT ) (to name a few). The collective down-move has been magnified given the historic advances we’ve witnessed in by the likes of the Financial ETF. \nSo, should we be concerned about this? Given Technology’s 18% weighting in the S&P 500, the sector’s continued underperformance certainly could put a wrinkle in the market’s potential run to new highs. Indeed, it could be the beginning of a larger shift, as the Nasdaq’s outperformance since the summer began to fade over the last few weeks. \nBut the Nasdaq’s long term relative line vs. the S&P 500 is still tilted higher… The largest names remain structurally sound for now, as well. Of the names below, the only one to have punctured its uptrend line from February has been Amazon.com. \nThe dust will settle at some point. Will all that capital that has flowed to interest rate sensitive areas (Financials and others) the last few days stay there? Or will the same areas that have outperformed for the last few months (Technology) maintain their leadership? \nNot today they won’t. ",

      "text": "SEATTLE — A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission.\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google.\nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password.\nSeattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims.\nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.",

      "text": "Technology News | Thu Nov 10, 2016 | 8:21pm EST Judge orders Amazon refunds for children's in-app purchases A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in Vienna November 26, 2012. AMAZON REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger By Jonathan Stempel \nA federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\" \nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\" \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Amazon recruiter, a former U.S. Army captain, eager to open door to vets Originally published November 10, 2016 at 5:26 pm Ardine Williams’ military background helps her handle an outsized mission at Amazon: lead efforts to staff up the company’s fast-growing Amazon Web Services operation. Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nArdine Williams, one of the lead recruiters for Amazon.com’s fast-growing cloud computing unit, knows well the technical skills and can-do attitude veterans bring to the table. \nBut she also knows, first hand, how hard it is to make those first steps in the civilian world. \nAs a captain in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during the 1980s, she had done specialized telecommunications work and data analysis. \nBut in her first real foray into the private sector she found herself selling clothes at Gymboree, which as a young mother returning from Kuwait she joined “because they had a great discount in kids clothes.” Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \n“I really felt like I was lost,” Williams, 55, said in an interview. \nNow, after three decades and a successful career in pharmaceuticals and technology, she leads efforts to staff up Amazon Web Services, an Amazon division that has more than 6,000 jobs open worldwide, in the midst of a veritable war for talent among technology titans. \nShe wants to open the door to as many veterans as she can who are a “great fit,” she says, for the company. \nIn a speech last month at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Williams, who is AWS’ vice president for global talent acquisition, told attendants that “you and those you lead have built skills in the military that companies like mine are after.” \n“They find careers at Amazon, and add incredible value,” she said. “Your mission-driven, results-oriented approach is exactly what my team seeks in candidates.” \nAmazon says it has hired more than 10,000 veterans in the past five years, and vows to hire more than 25,000 veterans and military spouses in the next five. If Amazon keeps growing at the pace it’s led in the past few years, there’ll be plenty of space to absorb them, not only in cloud computing, but also in logistics and warehouse operations.. \nThere’s what a company spokeswoman calls a “very active” affinity group of veterans dubbed Amazon Warriors; and there are even a sizable number of recruiters with military backgrounds who make incorporating former service members a priority. \nAbout two dozen of these recruiters met recently at a happy hour in South Lake Union, a monthly event that they have baptized “Commander’s Call,” in honor of the gatherings they saw in service. There they socialize, reinforcing what is a growing community of Amazonians with military experience, and exchange tips on how to help new hires adapt to life in corporate America. For example, some veterans making the transition are confused by health care, 401k options or that they can negotiate a salary, one of the recruiters said. Top priority \nThe company’s pledges come against a backdrop in which many large U.S. businesses have made incorporating veterans a top priority, a policy that has resulted in relatively low unemployment levels for former military. \nExamples abound, from software giants Microsoft and Uber to Starbucks. The coffee behemoth’s CEO, Howard Schultz, even co-authored a book about veterans. \nBut a divide remains between those emerging from the armed forces and their new civilian employers and co-workers, given the small percentage of the U.S. workforce that has any experience in the military. \nA survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that human-resources staffers “often lack sufficient knowledge about military service or the skills acquired during that time,” and that 44 percent of veterans left their first civilian job within the first year, which they often took hurriedly to make ends meet. \nWilliams managed to overcome the difficulty of the transition to military life because, as she puts it, her father goaded her into leaving her retail gig for “a real job.” His advice: Take a job that you know how to perform and take it from there, even if you feel you’re overqualified for it. \nShe found a spot as a technical writer at a pharmaceutical company. That soon opened the door to marketing, venture-capital work, executive roles in mergers and acquisitions, then to the top echelons of Intel’s human-resources department. \nIn 2014, a few months after retiring from the chipmaker, she was lured by AWS to help lead its gargantuan recruiting operations. \n“It’s incredibly difficult,” she said of that first step into a civilian life. “There are jobs in the military that very easily match civilian jobs. There are others who have no translation at all. How do you navigate the first transition is key.” Several initiatives \nAmazon has several initiatives in the works to help with that first move. AWS works with Camo2­Commerce, an organization that seeks to connect veterans transitioning out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord with jobs and career development. \nIn May, the company said it would train, free, 10,000 active-duty service members, as well as veterans and military spouses, in cloud-computing skills through online courses that can lead to certifications. \nThe company also offers a 10-week internship to armed-forces personnel on active duty about to transition out of the service. \nAs Williams puts it, not everyone will be able to luck into a satisfying career path the same way she did. “Times are different now. Helping transitioning service members bridge that gap is important, rather than leaving it to happenstance,” she said. Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or .

Sad.Regardless, have you ever watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and thought, “you know, I’m pretty sure that, grammatically, it’s ‘dwarves'”? If not, good, because apparently it’s actually supposed to be dwarfs unless you’re J.R.R. Tolkien . Who knew?But more to the point, if you’ve ever dreamed of having their fictional life and mining all day for some reason, this is your game. In Saboteur, you play as a team of dwarfs digging tunnels underground in search of gold. However, as you might surmise from the name, you might not all want the same thing…",

Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\"\nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children.\nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\"\nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million.\nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

      "text": "Judge orders Amazon refunds for children's in-app purchases Reuters Photo: \nBy Jonathan Stempel \n(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\" \nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\" \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler) Related Links",

The competition was run as part of the 'Amazon in the Community' programme (Photo: Joel Chant) \nSecond place went to six-year-old Olli for his ‘Fin 100’ drone, which will deliver his favourite foods; egg on toast and pizza, and third place to nine-year-old Nithyan for his ‘First Aid’ delivery drone. \nGillian Beasley, chief executive of Cambridgeshire County Council was one of the competition judges. Second-place winner Olli with his Fin 100’ drone, which will deliver his favourite foods; egg on toast and pizza (Photo: Joel Chant) \nShe said: “The standard of the entries and creativity shown is testament to the imagination of primary school students in the county. \n“It was a fantastic competition to judge, and the selected winning entries showed a real engagement with using science to create. I hope this will act as inspiration for students in the future.” Third-place winner Nithyan, with the design for his 'First Aid’ delivery drone (Photo: Joel Chant) \nAs part of its Amazon in the Community programme, the firm, which is testing drones at its Prime Air facility in Cambridge, invited children across the county to draw or build their own model delivery drone using materials found in their everyday lives. \nWinning entries were chosen for their creativity, application of science and the benefit the drone would bring to society. The three young winners from Monkfield Park Primary School (Photo: Joel Chant) \nLauren Kisser, operations director at Amazon Prime Air, said: “We developed this competition to encourage students and teachers to think about science and drones in a different way.

      "text": "A zoomed illustration image of a man looking at a computer monitor showing the logo of Amazon is seen in Vienna Thomson Reuters\nBy Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout.\nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges.\nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them.\nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\"\nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children.\nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\"\nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million.\nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Reuters | November 11, 2016 The FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nNEW YORK: A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator’s request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday’s order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach “removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.” \nCoughenour called the FTC’s $26.5 million damages request “too high,” agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon’s request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Stocks rose for a second day after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory …unless you’re the Nasdaq Composite , which was pulled lower by big losses in Apple ( AAPL ), Facebook ( FB ), and Amazon.com ( AMZN ).\nGetty Images The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 2,167.48 today, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 218.19 points, or 1.2%, to 18,807.88. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8% to 5,208.80. For the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it’s a new all-time high . The Nasdaq’s underperformance relative to the Dow was its largest since 2009.\nCapital Economics’ John Higgins tries to explain the stock market’s sudden optimism:\nWhat explains the strength of the US stock market since Donald Trump won the race to the White House? Part of the answer is that investors think he will have more success in implementing his domestic policy agenda in light of the Republicans’ retention of Congress. This can be seen in the relative performance of the major sectors of the S&P 500.\nLeading the charge was the financial sector, which benefited from the possibility of a lighter regulatory touch and from the steepening of the yield curve that resulted from Trump’s plans for substantially looser fiscal policy.\nNot far behind was the health care sector, which welcomed the fact that a clampdown on the prices of medication is now unlikely .\nAnd other notable gainers were the industrial, basic materials and energy sectors , amid hopes of a splurge on infrastructure spending.\nAdmittedly, Wednesday’s moves were broadly in keeping with this year’s trends – three of the sectors mentioned above (energy, industrials and basic materials) have been the best performers so far in 2016.\nBut until the election, these sectors largely benefited from other factors altogether, such as diminished concerns about the health of China’s economy and OPEC’s pledge to limit output.\nAs it happens, we are not convinced that Trump will be able to get a massive fiscal expansion through Congress and will have more to say about this topic on our US Economics service in due course. Nonetheless, some shift towards looser fiscal policy does seem possible.\nNeedless to say, this could have important implications for asset prices, including those of US equities, which picked up on Thursday where they left off on Wednesday in terms of sector developments.\nInstinet’s Frank Cappelleri remains optimistic about large-cap tech:\nIt’s no secret that Large Cap Techs underperformed yesterday and have gotten clocked today President-Elect Trump’s potential stricter policies on immigration, aim to keep more manufacturing within our domestic boarders and anti-trust chatter have been reflected in sharp downturns in Facebook , Amazon.com, Netflix ( NFLX ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Apple and Microsoft ( MSFT ) (to name a few). The collective down-move has been magnified given the historic advances we’ve witnessed in by the likes of the Financial ETF.\nSo, should we be concerned about this? Given Technology’s 18% weighting in the S&P 500, the sector’s continued underperformance certainly could put a wrinkle in the market’s potential run to new highs. Indeed, it could be the beginning of a larger shift, as the Nasdaq’s outperformance since the summer began to fade over the last few weeks.\nBut the Nasdaq’s long term relative line vs. the S&P 500 is still tilted higher… The largest names remain structurally sound for now, as well. Of the names below, the only one to have punctured its uptrend line from February has been Amazon.com.\nThe dust will settle at some point. Will all that capital that has flowed to interest rate sensitive areas (Financials and others) the last few days stay there? Or will the same areas that have outperformed for the last few months (Technology) maintain their leadership?\nNot today they won’t.",

      "text": "Tweet Published: 9:40 AM, November 11, 2016 \nA federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\" \nCoughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request \"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\" \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.

      "text": "› Amazon will be offering steep discounts on Kindle, Echo, and Fire products starting on November 20 Amazon will be offering steep discounts on Kindle, Echo, and Fire products starting on November 20 Posted: Tags : Deals - Deals + Amazon - Amazon + Black Friday. What once used to be one single day of shopping madness has blossomed into an entire month's worth of savings, and while all of the deals can sometimes be quite overwhelming, this year's deal season has already offered some pretty great discounts. Amazon's been hard at work since the beginning of December in regards to offering early Black Friday discounts, and the company just announced that they'll be offering a heap of solid deals on their own product lines later on this month. Starting on November 20th, Amazon will be offering their Kindle Paperwhite for $99.99, meaning you'll be looking at a savings of $20. That's not the most mind-blowing deal you're going to find, but if you're in the market for a new e-reader, that certainly is a fair price to pay for one of the best devices like this in the market. However, that's far from all of the deals that will be available. On November 24th, a heap of new deals will be offered, and they include the following - Fire tablet - $33.33 (savings of $16) Fire HD 8 - $59.99 (savings of 30) Echo Dot - $39.99 (savings of $10) Amazon Echo - $139.99 (savings of $40) Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote - $29.99 (savings of $10) If you're looking for stocking stuffers, you've actually got some really solid options here. Being able to snag the Fire tablet and Fire TV Stick with the new Alexa voice remote for around $30 is absolutely crazy, and an Echo Dot for just under $40 is a great purchase too. These may not be blockbuster items, but there certainly is a lot of bang for buck being offered here.",

      "text": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and other technology companies sank on Thursday as Wall Street sold them to pay for infrastructure names that could benefit from potential economic stimulus spending by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Before his unexpected victory in Tuesday’s election, investors had worried about uncertainty that a Trump presidency might create, but traders in the past two days have been looking to business sectors that might stand to benefit.\nAmazon fell 4.7 percent to its lowest level since July, while Alphabet dropped 2.3 percent. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp lost about 2.7 percent each. “I don’t think there’s anything in the new administration that’s going to be negative for tech stocks,” said Michael Yoshikami, head of Destination Wealth Management. “It’s just that other things are more in demand, and so there’s a rotation.”\nIn his acceptance speech, Trump reiterated his commitment to increased infrastructure spending, while striking a conciliatory note and avoiding references to controversial campaign promises.\nThe S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT dropped 2 percent on Thursday and was on track for its steepest daily decline in two months, while the materials index .SPLRCM rose 1.27 percent. The industrial index .SPLRCI jumped 2.1 percent, helped by a 3.8 percent surge in Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). Banks also rallied on expectations that Trump would roll back financial regulation.\nThe technology sector recently traded at about 16.2 times expected earnings, in line with the S&P 500 .SPX, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. The materials sector traded near 15.9 times expected earnings. Thursday’s loss leaves Apple, which is struggling with lackluster iPhones sales, up 1.9 percent in 2016, lagging the S&P 500’s 6 percent rise.\nReuters \nThe post Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft stocks drop following Trump victory appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "Amazon ordered to reimburse parents whose children made unauthorised in-app purchases",
      "text": "A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator’s request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorised charges. Thursday’s order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them.\nCoughenour said this approach “removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.” Coughenour called the FTC’s $26.5 million damages request “too high,” agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorised purchases by children.\nBut the judge rejected Amazon’s request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” Neither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. The FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million.\nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorised charges.\nReuters \nThe post Amazon ordered to reimburse parents whose children made unauthorised in-app purchases appeared first on Tech2 .",

Here’s What Jeff Bezos Has to Say to Donald Trump on His Victory \nAmazon.com amzn CEO Jeff Bezos became the latest tech CEO to respond to Donald Trump’s election victory. \n“Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump” Bezos tweeted Thursday morning. “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.” Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nWhile Trump’s election has inspired panic in a number of Silicon Valley leaders , Bezos’s neutral comments echoed the recent tone struck by leaders such as Salesforce crm CEO Marc Benioff and Facebook’s fb Mark Zuckerberg. Congratulations President Trump. This is what makes America great—our democracy. Now is the time for us to come together as one country. \n— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) November 9, 2016 \nIn the past, Bezos and Trump have not exactly seen eye to eye. Bezos, who owns the Washington Post , has called out Trump’s antagonism toward the media this year, telling an audience at Recode’s Code Conference in May that “the most important office in world should expect to be scrutinized.” \nTrump put the Post on his media blacklist this year, and has said Bezos has “a huge antitrust problem” due to his ownership of both Amazon and the Washington Post .

The stock was down 3.5% mid-day Thursday at $745.20.\nDonald Trump's surprising victory against Hillary Clinton may be causing investors to flash back to Trump's comments in May to Fox News ' Sean Hannity.\nTrump fired shots at Jeff Bezos, claiming that Amazon's founder, president and CEO had a \"huge antitrust problem\" and that Amazon was \"getting away with murder, tax-wise.\"\nThe now president-elect also asserted that Bezos was using The Washington Post as his own political tool. (Bezos bought The Post for $250 million in 2013).\nIn a potential attempt to reach a truce, Bezos tweeted Thursday morning to congratulate Trump.\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Judge Reaches Verdict on Amazon Purchases Made By Kids Without Parents’ Permission \nA federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com amzn to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator’s request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout. \nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday’s order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach “removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.” \nCoughenour called the FTC’s $26.5 million damages request “too high,” agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon’s request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.” \nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. For more on Amazon.com, watch Fortune’s video \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.

      "title": "Amazon drivers 'work illegal hours'",
      "text": "Amazon drivers 'work illegal hours' 11 November 2016 From the section England Image caption Amazon has a delivery depot in Avonmouth, near Bristol \nAmazon delivery drivers regularly work \"illegal\" hours and receive less than the minimum wage, it has been claimed. \nDrivers for agencies contracted by the internet giant told an undercover reporter they were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day. \nSome admitted breaking speed limits to stay on schedule, while others said time was not allowed for toilet breaks. \nAmazon said it was committed to ensuring drivers drive safely and legally, and are \"fairly compensated\". \nA BBC reporter got a job with AHC services, one of many agencies which supplies drivers to the firm's delivery wing Amazon Logistics in the south of England, and which the BBC had heard a lot of complaints about. 'Defecate in bags' \nDuring a two-week stint with AHC at Amazon's Avonmouth depot near Bristol, he said he: Received a fixed rate of £110 per route, or set of deliveries, completed each day Worked more than 11 hours a day - delivery drivers are breaking the law if they exceed this limit Was told by an agency supervisor he \"didn't have to worry about a seatbelt\" because \"the police won't stop\" a delivery driver Had colleagues tell him they had to \"defecate in bags\" and \"urinate in bottles\" because there was no time for toilet breaks Was paid £93.47 for three days' work in his first week, after deductions including optional van hire for a week and insurance - equal to £2.59 per hour Received the equivalent of £4.76 per hour in his second week when he worked four days \nSeveral drivers told him they were paid the equivalent of an hourly rate below the national minimum wage of £7.20, mainly due to working long hours to deliver all the parcels they were assigned. \nSome agency staff complained the system does not allow for traffic jams and does not factor in time for breaks, he said. Image caption Charlie Chikaviro said he had no choice but to break the speed limit \nFormer driver, Charlie Chikaviro, said the pressure to deliver parcels left him with no choice but to speed and drive dangerously. \n\"I had to, the way it was designed. You're going to have to do that,\" he said. \n\"I had a few crashes... but not bad crashes.\" \nCody Cooper, a former supervisor who left AHC services a year ago, said she ordered one driver, who fell asleep at the wheel, to stop driving because she feared he could \"end up killing someone\". \n\"It was coming up to school time and there could [have been] a group of schoolchildren walking along... and he could have steered off,\" she said. \n\"I wasn't willing to live with that.\" \nAmazon Logistics requires agency drivers to be self-employed, and therefore not entitled to the minimum wage or employment rights like sick pay or holiday pay. Image caption The undercover reporter was paid the equivalent of £2.60 per hour for one week's work \nTonia Novitz, professor of labour law at Bristol University, said in her opinion drivers contracted by AHC should not be classed as self-employed, because they do not determine their own routes, days of work or rest periods. \n\"From the evidence I've seen, which suggests [the undercover reporter] would be regarded as a worker or agency worker, he should be getting the national minimum wage,\" she said. \nIn a statement Amazon said: \"As independent contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggestion route or develop their own.\" \nThe company said it expected drivers to be paid a minimum of £12 per hour \"before bonuses, incentives and fuel reimbursements\", and it required independent delivery providers to ensure drivers were fully licensed and insured and obeyed \"all applicable traffic and safety laws\". \nIn the past six months, drivers drove a daily average of 8.5 hours and were on duty for 9.1 hours, it added. \nOxford-based AHC dismissed claims put to them by the BBC as \"historic and based on isolated examples which occurred over a year ago\" and said: \"Since then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working.\" \nThe firm said it took road safety and the welfare of its contracted drivers \"extremely seriously\", and that drivers were free to choose when they worked. \nBBC Inside Out West's undercover report can be seen on BBC One in England at 19:30 BST on Friday 11 November, and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer .",

      "text": "(By Jonathan Stempel, Reuters) – A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator’s request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout.\nU.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as “Pet Shop Story” and “Ice Age Village” on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges.\nThursday’s order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them.\nCoughenour said this approach “removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.”\nCoughenour called the FTC’s $26.5 million damages request “too high,” agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children.\nBut the judge rejected Amazon’s request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would “undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.”\nNeither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple and Google, now part of Alphabet, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million.\nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

With the symphony under lockout, Rodrigo heads to Venice to find inspiration working with an operatic diva. Meanwhile Hailey unsuccessfully tours Europe and begins to question her career as an oboist. \nCheck out the official trailer below! \nIn addition to the forthcoming third season, seasons one and two of 'Mozart in the Jungle' are currently available to Prime Members through Amazon Video. \nOther upcoming Amazon premieres include ' The Man in the High Castle ' season two on December 16.

      "text": "  Amazon Prime Reading Now Available on iPhone and iPad November 10, 2016 By Michael Kozlowski Leave a Comment \nAmazon Prime Reading is a new program where you can read as many books as you want from a revolving pool of titles, you can think of it as a scaled down version of Kindle Unlimited. There are around 1,000 e-books and magazines on the platform and today you can now read them on the Kindle app for the iPad and iPhone . \nPrime benefits are sorely lacking on iOS devices and many users are happy that they can browse all of the Prime Reading enabled titles and read them within the app. All of the e-books you read are totally compatible with Page Flip, Popular Highlights, X-Ray and Goodreads. \nIt is important to note that this app update and Prime Reading in general are only available to US members.

      "text": "To Celebrate Alexa’s Birthday, Amazon Cuts $40 off the Amazon Echo \nThe original NES first launched in America in 1985, then was discontinued in 1995. Today, it’s still regarded as one of the best — and best-selling — video game consoles of all time. (IGN even named the NES, in 2009, as the single greatest video game console , ever.) The new NES Classic Edition is sure to excite nostalgic gamers looking to replay their past flames. And it won’t cost you a fortune. At $60, the new console costs about as much as a new Xbox One or PS4 game. \nThe new NES console comes with an HDMI cable, an AC adapter and an NES Classic Controller. A second controller will cost you $10. These controllers can also be connected to a Wii Remote controller, allowing Wii U or Wii owners to play their Virtual Console NES games with a retro controller. The NES Classic Edition is available on November 11, 2016. For the full list of pre-installed games, see below. \nBalloon Fight",

      "text": "Read Now Why Trump's Win Is Both Good and Bad News for Tech Giants Like Apple and Amazon The President-elect's views on trade, immigration and net neutrality are bound to cause angst in Silicon Valley. But his domestic and offshore tax policies may be well-received. Eric Jhonsa Nov9,20162:40PMEST \nThat there's little love lost between Donald Trump and Silicon Valley is hardly a new revelation . But while a Trump Administration's relationship with the tech elite is bound to be more distant and chillier than a Clinton Administration's would have been, its policies may simply be sub-optimal for the tech sector rather than disastrous -- and with some notable silver linings. \nOn one hand, a lack of the close ties prominent tech execs formed with the Obama Administration, and appeared set to maintain with a Clinton Administration, could cause some problems. Obama, who recently guest-edited an issue of Wired magazine and gave the publication a thoughtful interview on various tech topics, has been willing to lend an ear to Silicon Valley's views on issues such as autonomous driving regulations, encryption keys, artificial intelligence research and STEM education funding. \nTrump, who appears to know much less about tech and briefly called for a boycott of Apple ( AAPL ) in response to the company's unwillingness to help break the encryption on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, probably won't be holding talks with the likes of Tim Cook and Facebook's ( FB ) Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg as frequently. That could be an issue when, say, Google or Apple wants federal rules quickly implemented that make it easier for self-driving cars to hit the road. \nAnd on telecom policy, the return of Republican FCC control could yield a more hands-off approach that works to the benefit of telcos and cable companies. Trump opposes the net neutrality rules set by the FCC last year, which prevent ISPs from blocking or slowing down content from specific service providers, or charging extra to others for access to a \"fast lane.\" A Trump Administration FCC also might not be keen on efforts such as the Commission's recent attempt to open up the set-top market. \nThe FCC will also probably be more willing to sign off on large telecom M&A deals, which many tech companies haven't been keen about. If Sprint ( S ) and T-Mobile ( TMUS ) want to take another shot at merging, the Commission might not get in the way this time. On the other hand, Trump has signaled he's not a fan of AT&T's ( T ) pending acquisition of Time Warner ( TWX ) . Sprint and T-Mobile are trading higher today, while Time Warner is lower. \nApple and Facebook are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "SEATTLE (AP) - A federal judge has laid out rules for how Amazon must reimburse customers whose kids made in-app purchases without permission.\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued the Seattle company in 2014, saying it was too easy for children to spend their parents' money while playing games on mobile devices. The agency settled similar cases against Apple and Google.\nAll three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a password.\nSeattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour found Amazon liable last spring, but he rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million penalty as excessive. Instead, he said Thursday that Amazon should notify affected customers and allow them to make claims.\nThe judge denied Amazon's request to reimburse the customers with Amazon gift cards.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "amazon Judge orders Amazon.com refunds for children's in-app purchases Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. Photo: Reuters \nA federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a US regulator's request for a US$26.5 million (S$37.4 million) lump-sum payout. \nUS District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated US$86 million of unauthorized charges. \nThursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them. \nCoughenour said this approach \"removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers.\" Coughenour called the FTC's US$26.5 million damages request\"too high,\" agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children. \nBut the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would \"undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue.\" Neither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment. \nThe FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least US$32.5 million and Google at least US$19 million. \nAll three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.

      "text": "November 10, 2016 at 2:54 pm November 10, 2016 at 4:25 pm GeekWire Gala tickets on sale now! \nA crowd of Amazon employees reacts while watching co-worker Stephanie Hubley, in black sweater at right, compete on TV during an episode of “Jeopardy” on Thursday in Seattle. (Kurt Schlosser / GeekWire) \nAs an executive assistant at Amazon, Stephanie Hubley’s job involves retaining and compartmentalizing information and answering questions coming at her from a variety of sources and directions. It’s a skill set that suits her strong interest in trivia games — and landed her a spot on “Jeopardy.” \nHubley, who has been at Amazon for about seven months, supports two directors and a vice president in the Kindle Reader group. She has watched the iconic game show since she was a kid, growing up in Tacoma, Wash. Stephanie Hubley, an executive assistant in the Kindle Reader group at Amazon. (Kurt Schlosser / GeekWire) \n“I would actually say that I’m more of a casual ‘Jeopardy’ fan than anything. It’s not like I watch the show religiously,” Hubley said. “Obviously I watched the show growing up and then every now and then when it was on TV, but really it’s because I just kind of like trivia. I did quiz bowl in high school and I do bar trivia now and so I’ve always thought it’s kind of fun.” \nHubley discovered that the show conducts online tests in search of new contestants once a year. So for the past four or five years, the 33-year-old has been trying her hand at the free test in the hopes of attracting the attention of show recruiters. \n“I’ve heard that there can be between 75,000 and 100,000 people that take the test each year and they only have about 4,000 spots for in-person auditions, which is the next step,” Hubley said. “So, sometimes even if you pass you might not hear anything because they all go, I think, into a big bucket, then they just pull out ones at random.” \nThis past summer, she made it to the next level, and was invited to audition in person in Las Vegas. She had taken the online test before she started her new job, but when she got the call to audition, her bosses said, “That’s the coolest thing ever,” and she was told to take whatever days she needed. \nHubley, who now lives in Burien, Wash., flew down to Las Vegas for about 24 hours and took a 50-question test along with about 25 other people. She then played against others in front of contestant coordinators. \nShe was coached about how to project so that one-and-only “Jeopardy” host Alex Trebek would be able to hear her across the studio. And she was told to keep the game going for the sake of “energy.” I kind of just have a general jack-of-all-trades knowledge base. I’m not very specialized in anything, but my brain is just full of random stuff and I kind of do different things every day and I think that kind of ties into me being able to roll with different categories and whatever comes up I can figure out a way to answer it. \n“People get really nervous and kind of closed off and they just want to see if you’re good TV,” Hubley said. \nAfter that audition, she was told her window of eligibility, in which she could get a call to appear on the show, was 18 months. There was also the possibility that she could never be called for one of the show’s few hundred seasonal openings. \n“I left feeling really good about how I did, but I also knew that if nothing came of it I would be OK with that just because I knew it was a numbers game,” Hubley said. “Then, literally 10 days later, they called me for the show. It was crazy. I did not expect something that quickly.” \nShe had five weeks to prepare, DVRing all the episodes of the show she could find, reading stories from former contestants online, playing the game on a website called J! Archive , and answering random trivia questions that her Amazon team members would ping her with during the day. She traveled to Los Angeles for her episode taping at the end of August. \n“My background is so random, I was a humanities major in college, I had a variety of administrative jobs and now I’m an executive assistant,” Hubley said. “I kind of just have a general jack-of-all-trades knowledge base. I’m not very specialized in anything, but my brain is just full of random stuff and I kind of do different things every day and I think that kind of ties into me being able to roll with different categories and whatever comes up I can figure out a way to answer it.” Stephanie Hubley, center, along with “Jeopardy” host Alex Trebek, left, and other contestants. (Screen grab via ABC) The big show \nHubley’s “Jeopardy” episode aired in Seattle on Wednesday night. It was originally scheduled for Tuesday, but a little bit of election coverage dominated the airwaves that night. Stephanie Hubley tells Alex Trebek about how she was once hugged by a sloth. (Screen grab via ABC) \nReturning champ Georjean and fellow competitor Allon were to the left and right of Hubley as the action got underway. \nHer first attempt at an answer came in the “palindromes” category, and when she got it wrong, she was quickly in the hole at -$1,000. \nAfter a commercial break, Trebek approached the contestants for his familiar get-to-know-you chat. Hubley shared a tidbit about a birthday present from her husband, which involved being able to go to an animal sanctuary and “hold and pet and feed a sloth. It was amazing. I lost my mind,” Hubley said as Trebek looked skeptical. “They’re just amazing animals. They just put it right on my lap, I was sitting down and he wrapped his arms around me and kind of dug in his claws just a little bit.” \nBy the end of the first round, Stephanie was at -$200 after getting a couple right and a few wrong. Gerojean was at $1,400 and Allon led with $3,800. The look on Stephanie Hubley’s face when she realized she had won. (Screen grab via ABC) \nWhen the show went to commercial break, Seattle’s ABC affiliate KOMO News broke in with a lengthy report on violence in downtown Seattle in which five people were shot. By the time the report ended and “Jeopardy!” returned, Hubley was in the lead with $7,800. (Apparently, she cleaned up in a category about the city of Cleveland.) \nShe soon went to $9,000 when she correctly answered, in the “cry unk” category, “What is Crunk?” off the clue “It’s a style of Southern rap.” \nA correction from the judges on a previous answer lowered Hubley’s score back to $7,400 and Georjean found her second Daily Double of the night — but she got it wrong. \nHubley missed a couple in the “gone fishing” category — casting! bobber! — and Georjean got the last clue of the round correct to take a slight lead going into Final Jeopardy. The category there was “Commonwealth Countries,” and the clue was, “The constitution of this country came into effect on Feb. 4, 1997 and by 2016, 13 parties were represented in its parliament.” \nNo one answered correctly (South Africa), but Georjean wagered too much money. That means that Stephanie Hubley, with $4,000, is the current “Jeopardy” champion. \n“It was a really, really tough game and unfortunately I didn’t win very much money, but I did win,” Hubley said. “I got more than the other two contestants, which is all that matters.” Alex Trebek congratulates Stephanie Hubley following her win on “Jeopardy.” (Screen grab via ABC) Reaction at Amazon \nHubley said the support from team members at work has been great. At the most recent Amazon all-hands meeting, some employee bios from the company’s in-house website were being highlighted and Hubley’s was among them. CEO Jeff Bezos read the information from the slide himself. \n“In the middle of Key Arena, on this huge screen comes my photo and my little bio about how I’m from the Northwest and I’m going to be on ‘Jeopardy’ soon,” Hubley said. \nShe was sick at the time and missed the event, but team members told her all about it. \n“So I actually wrote him an email because I understand that he responds to those kinds of things,” Hubley said. “I just said, ‘Thank you for the shout out, I really really appreciate it. I’m honored. We are having a watch party in Doppler if you’d like to come in a couple days.’ He wrote back and said, ‘Well, I know you’ve already taped it, but good luck. Just wanted to wish you the best.’ It was so great. I showed all of my team members that, and they were like, ‘Jeff B. knows who you are now, that’s crazy!'” \nHubley printed the email and has it displayed at her desk, she said. The view from the crowd of the giant TV screen showing “Jeopardy” in Amazon’s Doppler tower. (Kurt Schlosser / GeekWire) \nOn Thursday afternoon, in a gathering space in Amazon’s Doppler tower, about 100 employees gathered with Hubley to watch the episode and cheer on their co-worker. \nHer bosses from the Kindle Reader group were in attendance, too. VP Jeff Kunins; Bob Roth, director of engineering; and Mike Torres, director of product management, watched from the grandstand as a giant TV screen dropped down out of the rafters in front of a small food market. \n“I cleared their calendars,” Hubley said of her bosses. “I am an E.A.!” \n“We’ve got a celebrity on the team,” Roth said. “The episode is what, 22 minutes? So it’s not her 15 minutes of fame, she’s getting her 22 minutes.” Stephanie Hubley watches herself on TV during a gathering at Amazon. (Kurt Schlosser / GeekWire) \nHubley welcomed the crowd and the episode started with a cheer when she showed up on the screen. Poor Georjean even got booed for being the returning champ. \nEach time Hubley answered correctly, a cheer went up and people genuinely rooted her on and groaned if she got a question wrong. A few people whispered answers as they played along. The loudest cheer was mixed with laughter after she got the “crunk” question right. \nFolks wandering past the event wondered allowed why so many people were watching “Jeopardy” during work hours and when told an Amazonian was on the screen, they lit up. “Oh, cool!” said one guy. “Go Stephanie!” said another. \nWhen it was all over, a stream of people shook Hubley’s hand and asked her how the whole process works — what happens during commercial breaks, how she studied and whether Trebek is nice in person. \nHer next second episode, as returning champion, doesn’t air until Nov. 23 because “Jeopardy” is airing a teen tournament for the next two weeks. She was not allowed to tell us yet how she does in that match. Stephanie Hubley talks to her fans, including one of her bosses, Bob Roth, in royal blue, after her TV party concluded.

      "text": "0 A new Apple TV is pictured at an Apple Store in Los Angeles, California October 30, 2015. Reuters/Jonathan Alcorn \nAT&T is trying to lure in potential subscribers to sign up for its new DirecTV Now streaming service by offering free Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV devices. The reported free device will depend on the number of months a subscriber is willing to signs up for. \nThe American telecom titan’s plan to give away the streaming devices to subscribers of its new TV streaming service was made public as AT&T’s customer-support documents were inadvertently leaked by the company itself, this according to Variety . \nThe leaked documents state that subscribers who had sign up for at least three months would get a free Apple TV device, while those who commit for just one month would get a free Amazon Fire TV stick. \nThe latest Apple TV model has a US$149 (AU$195) starting price, while the Amazon Fire TV Stick amounts to US$40 (AU$52). The Fire TV stick alone costs more than the service fees that subscribers will have to pay for signing up. DirecTV Now will be launched before the year ends. According to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, the company’s new offering will cost US$35 (AU$46) per month and will include over a hundred channels. \nThe leaked AT&T documents did not provide a complete list of the channels, but some of them may be from networks like Disney, HBO, NBCUniversal, Starz, Discovery, Viacom, Galavision, Univision, Fox and CBS. The current list of channels may change before DirecTV is ultimately launched and certain channels may not be available to some subscribers. \nThe report also described an anomaly regarding DirecTV Now’s scope of service. Certain channels in some markets can only be viewed using PCs and mobile devices. The channels won’t allow access using smart TVs and streaming devices, which is odd since the freebies that AT&T is offering to potential subscribers are exactly those kinds of gadgets. ",

      "text": "Gig economy Amazon drivers admit to speeding due to tight delivery schedule \nStaff contracted to agencies enlisted by Amazon Logistics also claim they are being underpaid due to long hours worked Drivers hired by agencies enlisted by Amazon claim they have to break speed limits to meet schedules. Photograph: Rex Friday 11 November 2016 10.35 GMT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 10.36 GMT Share on Messenger \nAmazon delivery drivers admitted breaking speed limits and said they did not always have time for toilet breaks because of the pressure to stay on schedule, according to a BBC investigation . \nDrivers for agencies contracted to work for the online retailer told an undercover reporter that they were expected to deliver up to 200 parcels a day. \nThe report also claimed some drivers said they were effectively paid less than the minimum wage of £7.20, because of the long hours worked to deliver all their assigned parcels. \nA spokesman for Amazon said: “Over 100 small and medium sized businesses across the UK are providing work opportunities to thousands of people delivering parcels to Amazon customers. We are committed to ensuring that the people contracted by our independent delivery providers are fairly compensated, treated with respect, follow all applicable laws and drive safely.” \nAn undercover BBC reporter took a job with AHC services, one of the agencies which supplies drivers to Amazon Logistics to deliver parcels . The Guardian view on the gig economy: time to get serious about casual work | Editorial Read more \nThe reporter worked for two weeks based at Amazon’s Avonmouth depot in Bristol, and claimed he worked more than 11 hours a day delivering parcels, which was against the law. \n“Our delivery providers are obligated to ensure that drivers do not spend more than 10 hours per day driving,” Amazon’s spokesman said. “As independent contractors of our delivery providers, drivers deliver at their own pace, take breaks at their discretion, and are able to choose the suggested route or develop their own.” \nAmazon said that over the past six months, the average driving time for drivers in the UK was 8.5 hours a day. \nThe reporter also said he was paid £93.47 for three days’ work in his first week, following deductions such as optional van hire for a week, and insurance. That was the equivalent of £2.59 an hour. He received the equivalent of £4.76 an hour in his second week when he worked four days. \nThe BBC said Amazon Logistics required agency drivers to be self-employed, and therefore not entitled to the national min imum wage (for staff under 25) and the national living wage (over 25) or employment rights such as sick pay or holiday pay. \nAmazon said: “Our delivery providers have always been expected to pay more than the national living wage, and we recently clarified with all of our delivery providers that we expect drivers to receive a minimum of £12 per hour before bonuses, incentives and fuel reimbursements.” Uber loses right to classify UK drivers as self-employed Read more \nFormer driver, Charlie Chikaviro, said the pressure to deliver parcels left him with no choice but to drive fast. “I had to, the way it was designed. You’re going to have to do that. I had a few crashes ... but not bad crashes,” he said. \nThe Oxford-based AHC dismissed the BBC claims as “historic and based on isolated examples which occurred over a year ago”. It told the BBC: “Since then we have made changes to the way our checks are carried out and taken a number of steps to improve our ways of working.” \nThe firm also told the BBC it took road safety and the welfare of its contracted drivers seriously and that drivers were free to choose when they worked.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAmazon has been told to start organizing how it’s going to pay back millions of dollars to parents whose kids made in-app purchases on their mobile devices without permission. \nA court in Amazon’s home city of Seattle on Thursday ordered the ecommerce giant to set up a notice-and-claims process early next year to notify eligible parents of the refunds, and to pay them what’s owed, Reuters reported. \nThis issue goes back to 2011 when Amazon began allowing in-app purchases of which the company takes a 30 percent cut. At the time, there were no safeguards in place – for example, password protection for accounts – to stop children from making unauthorized in-app purchases, a situation that led to some parents getting a nasty surprise upon receipt of their credit card bill. \nThe matter eventually came to the attention of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), leading it to file a lawsuit against the online retailer in 2014 . The commission had estimated that of around $86 million generated by in-app purchases in the Amazon app store, a whopping 42 percent had been made without parental consent, though Amazon described the FTC’s figures as “fundamentally flawed.” “Unlimited charges” \n“Amazon’s in-app system allowed children to incur unlimited charges on their parents’ accounts without permission,” the FTC said at the time, adding that “even Amazon’s own employees recognized the serious problem its process created.” But the company insisted it was making refunds where possible and was adding safeguards to its app store software. \nIn April of this year, the court sided with the FTC , saying Amazon’s procedures for informing its customers about in-app charges were “not sufficient.” \nHowever, on Thursday, Seattle U.S. District Judge John Coughenour rejected the FTC’s call for Amazon to pay a $26.5 million penalty, insisting that the company must instead notify eligible parents and ask them to make individual claims. \nRelated: 10 handy Amazon Fire tablet tips and tricks \nIt’s not the first time unauthorized in-app purchases – or the lack of a way to prevent them – have upset the FTC. Following action by the commission, Apple agreed to refund more than $32 million to customers in 2014, while in the same year Google set about paying back $19 million. \nAll three companies have since put in place stricter procedures to make it harder for children to make unauthorized in-app purchases.

      "text": "Last month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said he regretted not taking Donald Trump's candidacy more seriously, warning that some of the then-candidate's rhetoric on the campaign trail \"erodes our democracy around the edges.\" Fast-forward a few weeks and now Trump -- who has been very critical of Bezos -- is the next President and Amazon's stock price is taking a hit.\nIt would appear Bezos has taken notice of his falling stock price (down 5 percent), and on Thursday morning the CEO sent out a congratulatory tweet to the next POTUS. \"Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump,\" Bezos wrote. \"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\"\nWhether Trump will appreciate the congrats from Bezos is anyone's guess, but during the campaign he often criticized the tech billionaire for purchasing the Washington Post, claiming he \"wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it. That's not right. And believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems. They're going to have such problems.\"\nAnother reason for Bezos (and everyone else) to worry: Trump surrogate Omarosa said this week that the campaign keeps a \"list\" of enemies.\nBezos' olive branch follows a similarly innocuous statement from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \"Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US,\" he wrote on LinekedIn. \"The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\"\nPlus, Zara Larsson on Trump's Election: 'It Was Supposed to Be a Joke, It Was Not Supposed to Happen'",
