      "text": "Facebook promises to improve ad metrics   4:29pm File: Facebook has launched a new blog on its website called Metrics FYI, where it will share updates and corrections for its data. Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic \nCALIFORNIA – Two months after Facebook Inc admitted it had inflated the average time it told advertisers that users were watching their video ads, the company is promising better data to give ad buyers a clearer picture of how they are spending their money. \nThe world's biggest online social network on Wednesday launched a new blog on its website called Metrics FYI, where it will share updates and corrections for its data. \n\"We want to ensure our clients trust and believe in the metrics that we are providing,\" Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president of global market solutions told Reuters. \nGetting advertisers to buy more video ads is key to Facebook's continued revenue growth, as they fetch higher rates from advertisers than text or photo-based ads. \nFacebook, along with Alphabet Inc's Google and other large digital companies, has been criticised for a lack of transparency in how it measures the performance of videos. \nParticularly, the lack of a universally agreed method of calculating how much time people are watching online video has been a sore spot for advertisers. \nIn September, Facebook told advertisers that the average time users spent viewing online ads was artificially inflated, because it was only counting videos that were watched for at least three seconds, its benchmark for a \"view.\" \nREAD: Facebook Messenger now features chatbots \nFacebook left out those who watched for less than three seconds, or who did not watch the video at all, which gave advertisers the impression their videos were performing better than they really were. \nSince the admission and ensuing criticism from advertisers, Everson said Facebook has been in contact with clients and ad community trade groups, including the Interactive Advertising Bureau and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). \nFacebook also said on Wednesday it is in the process of forming what it called a 'Measurement Council,' which will include measurement experts from clients and ad agencies. \nOne of Facebook's prominent advertisers, Swiss food and drink company Nestle SA, is already on board, Everson said, and the council should be up and running by early 2017. \nThe ANA, which represents Procter & Gable Co, AT&T Inc and other major advertisers, has called on Facebook to get its metrics accredited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), an independent media measurement audit group. \nWhile Facebook's internal metrics are not accredited by that group, it does use MRC-accredited third-party vendors, such as Nielsen and comScore, to help advertisers verify certain data.

By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \nForliti reported from Minneapolis.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis.

      "text": "Tickets Fri., Nov. 18, 7:00pm \nBut theater people, as with all creative types, have an alternative to the immediately accessible but non-physical realm of the internet: Their work and the spaces where they do it. There were no spontaneous gatherings in the days that followed the election, though. Plays and readings were staged. But considering so many creative people were taken aback by the election, it was curious that so little emphasis was placed on what is theater's yugely greatest potential: cathartic communion in a space filled with real, breathing people. \nIt's not that last weekend's theater events operated in a vacuum. Josh Nicols, who runs an improv group at STAGEStheatre in Fullerton, said that while performers talked backstage Friday night about the election, that didn't manifest in the material onstage, which surprised him. And Eric Eberwein, director of the Orange County Playwrights Alliance and Orange County's biggest champion of original plays, said that staged readings at Theatre Out of plays by local playwrights Erica Bennett and George Bardin Rothman prompted a discussion about \"how the themes of the [plays] felt eerily appropriate . . . the responsibility of ordinary people to do courageous things in uncertain times.\" \nThat's good, but it's still theater confined to performance. All too often, theaters seem satisfied to invite the community into their spaces every weekend, and that's it. Very few actively engage with their community, making their houses feel like a relevant part of it. Two local theater producers are the exception (maybe others, too; if so, let me know): Theatre Out, OC's bastion of LGBT theater, often holds single-night events that aren't about a play, but more about bringing that community together. And Breath of Fire Latina Theater Ensemble has transformed from staging plays to actively soliciting its community to help write and workshop those plays, basically bringing theater to the people rather than the other way around. \nMore theaters need to follow that lead and create a sense that the local playhouse is not only an escape from the daily grind, but also a sanctuary for expression, community, catharsis and, above all else, the real, hard work that is desperately needed in times of turmoil. It's time to, in the 1956 words of Allen Ginsberg, put the queer, artistic shoulder to the American wheel. Or, as Steven Leigh Morris, the impossibly erudite and knowledgeable former theater critic of LA Weekly who now runs stageraw.com , said in the ending of his brilliant essay about the arts in the era of Trump, \"Because when the world seems upside-down and inside-out, when reliable sources are no longer reliable, when reason starts to sound like babble, and babble like reason . . . there are places where actual truth can be told, little halls off back alleys, where poems are read, where songs are sung, where plays are put on. . . . \n\"And this is how the performing arts change the world. And there are small pockets of history when nothing is more important. And we may well be entering one of them.\" \nWord. \nWork while the day is long, brothers and sisters, for the night of death cometh when no man can work.",

      "text": "Filed in: News (Facebook) \nAn Atlanta man was gunned down outside a bar after he joked that he had voted for Donald Trump. \nThe man, Mitchell Mormon Jr. , was on a first date on Saturday at the Church Bar in Atlanta when he got into an altercation with another man. According to the woman he was on a date with, Shaunita Walker, the other man said something disrespectful to her, which prompted Mormon to joke about Trump in the argument. \n— Three-story letters on Atlanta hotel: ‘F*ck Trump’ — \nHowever, Walker doesn’t think that Mormon’s comment was what prompted the shooting , claiming that the shooter was looking for trouble from the outset of their interaction. \nBoth Walker and Mormon were shot and taken to Grady Hospital, where Mormon died of his injuries. \nPolice are still seeking information about the shooting suspect. \n“Please, if anybody know anything, please, this was so senseless,” said Walker. “This was so horrible.” Related Posts",

      "title": "Public Access - Facebook's New Smartphone App Uses Neural Network Technology to Transform Your Photo into a Masterpiece",
      "text": "Share Save \nFacebook has really been upping the ante lately. The Facebook mobile app has introduced new photo features which include a filter that can enable you to turn any of your pictures into a work of art—think Van Gogh, Warhol, or Picasso. The photo filter creates a Cubist style for any of your photos; and not only does it work on pictures, you're also able to turn live video into works of art as well; sort of similar to the Snapchat filters. The coolest part of this app isn't the filter though. It's actually the fact that it uses artificial intelligence—deep neural networks—to recognize facial structures. Neural networks work by learning discrete tasks and then analyzing data to identify faces, translate foreign languages, and recognize verbal commands. Before the execution of this neural network happens, there must be a training stage in the beginning. During the training stage, companies train the artificial intelligence software to translate or recognize images. Facebook can teach a neural network to recognize pictures of certain objects or animals by feeding millions of photos of the subjects to the software—think of it as studying and memorizing material. Training happens on the servers inside the data center, not through your smartphone. The building of this neural network is no simple task because it needs to be able to be executed on a smartphone which holds limited memory and offers limited processing power. This type of neural network technology first began in 2015 by a team of German researchers . However, they were unable to get the technology to operate in real-time. Luckily, Facebook has been able to make the technology work on mobile devices without any delay a little more than a year later. The execution stage happens when someone gives a photo to the neural network, and their task is to be able to recognize the specific object or subject within the photograph. If the neural network is able to recognize the subject or object, then the execution has been a success. With this app, Facebook minimized the neural network complexity that is able to transform your photo into a masterpiece. After the neural network is able to recognize certain objects and subjects, the network is retrained by being fed photos of famous art, then applying the same style to those certain subjects or objects. For this particular app, the network only uses the most important parts of what is learned to transform the photos into works of art. Hussein Mehanna, the creator of the app, has also gone as far as allowing the app to run on the phone itself, instead of just when your phone is online. With this technology, it will enable smartphones to perform a larger variety of tasks while being offline . This is just one of many examples of how we are enhancing technology to handle more complex artificial intelligence tasks; which will lead to tasks being done at a much faster pace while avoiding the need to send data through the wire. Essentially, the apps will be able to bypass the processes of going through data, which can slow down the completion of certain tasks. As companies like Google and Facebook push the boundaries of artificial intelligence use, cellular phone providers will need to begin creating hardware that is compatible with the artificial intelligence which will—in turn—give leverage to create more complex apps that will run with even greater speed and efficiency. Facebook technology officers have already begun talking about business plans with major mobile chip developers to ensure the compatibility between future artificial intelligence software and the mobile phone processors. This type of technology can change the nature of the game. With allowing the app to instantly recognize objects or faces, this can benefit mobile users who are visually impaired. Allowing the devices to accurately recognize the world, it will more accurately increase that reality. The app has already been released in Ireland, and it is due to be released in the United States in the upcoming months. Although the Picasso filter is just a small step forward, it is still recognizable progress as modern technology expands its capabilities. 0 Shares ",

Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez, the officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, in Falcon Heights, Minn., has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. Christian Dobratz via AP, File FILE - In this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence where protesters continue to demonstrate in St. Paul, Minn., against the July 6 shooting death of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. Jim Mone, File AP Photo Ramsey County Attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop. Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop. Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi, second left, walks away from the podium Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, after announcing that officer Jeronimo Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Philando Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. To Choi's left is Don Lewis, special prosecutor in the case and to his right is Richard Dusterhoft, criminal division director at the Ramsey County DA's office. Star Tribune via AP David Joles 1 of 5   ST. PAUL, Minn. \nWhen Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" Lavish Reynolds used Facebook Live to show what happened after her boyfriend, Philando Castile, was shot by a police officer as he was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car.

Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez, the officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, in Falcon Heights, Minn., has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. Christian Dobratz via AP, File FILE - In this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence where protesters continue to demonstrate in St. Paul, Minn., against the July 6 shooting death of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. Jim Mone, File AP Photo Ramsey County Attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop. Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop. Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi, second left, walks away from the podium Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, after announcing that officer Jeronimo Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Philando Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. To Choi's left is Don Lewis, special prosecutor in the case and to his right is Richard Dusterhoft, criminal division director at the Ramsey County DA's office. Star Tribune via AP David Joles 1 of 5 Order Reprint of this Story ST. PAUL, Minn. \nWhen Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective.

Post to Facebook Phil Jackson criticized LeBron and his 'posse' in 2004 This wasn't a new opinion.  //usat.ly/2g0uoIt   Phil Jackson criticized LeBron and his 'posse' in 2004 Andrew Joseph 8:43   \nNew York Knicks President Phil Jackson speaks with the media at Madison Square Garden training center in Tarrytown, New York. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nPhil Jackson's odd criticism of LeBron James and use of the word, \"posse,\" has caused a firestorm in the league . James himself had responded by saying he lost respect for the championship-winning head coach. \nIt wasn't the first time Jackson had used the word in a generalization with James. \nIn his 2004 book, The Last Season , Jackson also used \"posse\" while associating James with a vague criticism. In the excerpt first pointed out by ESPN's Rachel Nichols, Jackson argued against 19-year-old players being in the NBA. \nVia USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick : \n\"Yet as talented as (LeBron James) definitely appears to be, I don't believe any nineteen-year-old should be playing in the NBA. These young men grow so dependent on their posse's, who fetch their cars and their girls, that they can't possibly develop into mature, self-sufficient human beings. One day, I'm convinced, we'll find out the true extent of the psychological damage that's been caused.\" \nJackson responded to the criticism with a cryptic retweet on Wednesday .

      "text": "By Dillon Baker November 16th, 2016 \nFor months leading up to the election, a slow trickle of angst surrounded Facebook’s fake news problem. After the stunning election of Donald Trump last week, that trickle turned into a deluge of anger. \n“ Facebook, in Cross Hairs After Election, Is Said to Question Its Influence ,” wrote The New York Times. “ Donald Trump Won Because of Facebook ,” preached Max Read in New York magazine. And on Wednesday, BuzzFeed News reported: “ Viral Fake Election News Outperformed Real News On Facebook In Final Months Of The US Election .” \nFacebook had already been battling critics who accused it of ignoring its role as a media company. (Both founder Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg repeatedly tell the press “Facebook is a tech company, not a media company.”) Facebook also came under fire earlier in the year for censoring the so-called “Napalm girl” Pulitizer-winning photograph, fired its Trending News team after accusations of bias from conservative pundits, endured a wave of advertiser anger after admitting ( twice ) it had been reporting skewed numbers, and weathered a plethora of stories accusing the platform of creating damaging “filter bubbles” and giving voice to hyper-partisan pages that exploited people’s fears. \nBut an under-the-radar BuzzFeed News report may prove to be most damaging to the company’s reputation. \nThe BuzzFeed news team painstakingly recorded posts from a variety of hyper-partisan Facebook pages (as well as a few controls, such as Politico and ABC News) over a seven-day period. The findings were stunning: While zero percent of mainstream news outlets published something considered “mostly false,” 12.3 percent of right-wing pages and 4.4 percent of left-wing pages published false news. \nDisturbingly, there was a strong correlation between fake news and engagement. Forty-six percent of Freedom Daily’s posts were classified as either misleading or false—and the page recorded by far the highest engagement among the right-wing publishers in the report. \nIn general, BuzzFeed News found that: \n“The mostly true posts typically did not perform as well as ones that were mostly false, were a mixture of true and false, or had no factual content. The more overtly partisan, misleading, or opinion-driven a post was, the more engagement the post would see, according to our data.” \nA separate BuzzFeed News report on Macedonian teenagers who use right-wing Facebook pages as ad-revenue mills revealed perhaps the most disturbing result of all: \n“A post titled “Hillary Clinton In 2013: ‘I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They’re Honest And Can’t Be Bought.'” The post is a week old and has racked up an astounding 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. (To put that into perspective, the New York Times’ exclusive story that revealed Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns generated a little more than 175,000 Facebook interactions in a month.)” The damaging potential of fake news \nIt’s important to note that, from a revenue perspective, Facebook is doing just fine. The company reported massive profits in Q3 and has shown no signs of slowing down. \nBut it’s worth asking if premium advertisers, the kind that Facebook has tried to court with features such as its native video player and Facebook Live, might be turned off by the company’s reputation for fake or otherwise “trashy” content. \nWe’ve already seen that happen with two similar companies: Outbrain and Taboola. The content recommendation platforms once ubiquitous across the web are increasingly being eschewed by major media companies (who either remove the feature altogether or build their own). Why? Because publishers are wary of running the platforms’ notoriously clickbaiting, fake, and scam-filled links against their own content. \nProgrammatic platforms face similar criticism from advertisers for the lack of control. A premium company such as Coca-Cola, for example, likely does not want its ads appearing next to a website known for denying the Holocaust. \nYet on Facebook, that scenario is turning into the norm. Advertiser and publisher content gets placed in the same space as the fake clickbait overtaking News Feeds. A solvable problem? \nFacebook previously made efforts to remove clickbait from its platform. In 2014, the company announced it was cracking down . It did so again this August. \nBut there is little evidence that the algorithmic changes, which rely on a metric similar to “bounce rates” to identify clickbait, have affected the hyper-partisan content mills. As BuzzFeed News found, people don’t view these stories as clickbait. In fact, they’re more engaging than any other kind of news story. \nThis problem sits at the crux of Facebook’s business model: The ultimate goals are building its user base and maximizing time spent on the platform. As a result, the News Feed is built to prioritize engagement, no matter the quality of the content. \nIn other words, fake news and hyper-partisanship is good for Facebook’s business. As tech analyst Ben Thompson wrote , “What is far more damaging—and far more engaging, and thus lucrative for Facebook—is all of us in our own virtual neighborhoods of our own making, liking opinions that tell us we’re right instead of engaging with viewpoints that make us question our assumptions.” \nIt seems that Facebook—or at least a part of the company—has finally decided that fake news needs to be addressed. Though Zuckerberg brushed off the idea that Facebook fake news could have influenced the election, BuzzFeed News reports that a “renegade” group of employees is building a solution —and that hundreds of employees have expressed misgivings about company leadership ignoring the problem. \nFake news is something that Google, despite some cracks in the system , dealt with a long time ago in its search algorithm. Google also announced it is pulling its ad network from fake news sites. Naturally, Facebook also announced a plan to pull its Audience Network ad network from fake news sites. \nBut to really work toward a solution, Facebook should follow Google’s lead and purge fake news from its News Feed as well. If it doesn’t, it risks being pulled into the swamp—and losing advertisers in the process. Image by Unsplash / CC Zero",

Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop.

Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi, second left, walks away from the podium Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, after announcing that officer Jeronimo Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Philando Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. To Choi's left is Don Lewis, special prosecutor in the case and to his right is Richard Dusterhoft, criminal division director at the Ramsey County DA's office. Star Tribune via AP David Joles 1 of 5 Order Reprint of this Story ST. PAUL, Minn. \nWhen Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" Lavish Reynolds used Facebook Live to show what happened after her boyfriend, Philando Castile, was shot by a police officer as he was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car.

      "text": "In a recent announcement, Facebook said that its messenger can now be integrated with Android Auto. With this recent integration, users of the social networking site can now use the platform to hear and reply to messages from friends and acquaintances while driving.\nIn order to use this new feature of Facebook, users only need to have Facebook messenger installed on their android smartphones. This will enable them to use the feature either through Android Auto app or on the car’s dashboard.\nMessenger joined apps like Google Maps, Spotify and its competitors like Android Auto and WhastApp in order to provide road users a safer way to reply to their messages. It allows users to either use their voice to dictate a message or send a canned “I’m driving right now” response, instead of tumbling around with their phones while driving.",

Facebook acquires emotion detection startup FacioMetrics \nElectronics and water go together like, well, electronics and water. But how are you going to talk to your friends when you’re knee deep in snow or plunging down a mountainside on a bike? Bonx to the rescue. \nThe Indiegogo-funded Bonx Grip brings group-chat to the masses. Shipping this month, the $139 device is coming to an extreme-sports fan near you imminently. img_7532 Bonx Grip is bulky, but that's a good thing -- you have to be able to operate the device wearing gloves img_7531 Priced at $139, the Bonx Grip is shipping this month img_7530 Bonx Grip fits securely around the ear to ensure it doesn't fall off even when you're zipping along. Previous Next Exit \nThe problem the company is solving is one most extreme sports fans will have experienced at some point. There’s a group of you being all sporty and sweaty and happy, but keeping in touch is tricky, because you need both your hands to stay alive. Or maybe you’re wearing gloves and your adventurous streak doesn’t extend to frost-bite and hospital visits. \nThe unit is water and shock proof, and the idea is that you stick your phone in a waterproof pouch somewhere in your backpack or in a pocket. The Bonx app, available for iOS and Android , introduces group chat. There are no buttons to press; just speak, and your friends can hear you shout “ watch out for that tree ” or coordinate runs down the mountains.

It is designed to not isolate you from the outside world completely so you can stay aware of your surroundings.\nThe unit features a couple of oversized buttons to make it easy to operate it while wearing gloves, too, which is a nice touch. The buttons control volume and can put you on mute. Handy, for when you prefer not to be overheard as you’re recovering from failing to watch out for the aforementioned tree, perhaps. \nBonx Grip can be used either as a regular bluetooth headset to listen to music or talk on the phone, or in conjunction with the Bonx apps to unlock its group-chatting hands-free superpowers. 0 ",

Khan. (Photo: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY) \nThere’s a reason that phrase “turn on the hate,” an exhortation from a few years back by Stephen Bannon , named by President-elect Donald Trump as his chief White House strategist and senior counselor, is trending on Twitter. \nYes, he wrote it. \nAnd he and others within Trump’s inner circle seem to mean it. For example, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who helped former Arizona State Sen. Russell Pearce write the ugly, unconstitutional, Senate Bill 1070. \nKoback is a member of Trump’s policy transition team. \nHe not only wants to build the wall – still no word on how they get Mexico to pay for it – but he wants to create a registry of Muslims entering the United States . \nKobach’s group is supposedly recommending the reinstatement of a national registry of immigrants and visitors from countries deemed to have extremist organizations. \nAre there any countries that don’t have such organizations? Including our own? It starts with Muslims, but will it end there? \nWhat they’re talking about, ultimately, are Muslims. \nAt least to begin with. Who knows where we’d go from there? \nTrump has not even been inaugurated and already we need to revisit the words of Protestant pastor Martin Niemöller, who warned of acquiescing to the Nazi hate movement. \nPlug the word “Muslim” into Niemöller’s poem: \nFirst they came for the CommunistsAnd I did not speak outBecause I was not a CommunistThen they came for the SocialistsAnd I did not speak outBecause I was not a SocialistThen they came for the trade unionistsAnd I did not speak outBecause I was not a trade unionistThen they came for the JewsAnd I did not speak outBecause I was not a JewThen they came for meAnd there was no one leftTo speak out for me",

      "text": "Officer charged in shooting that was streamed on Facebook  24 PM By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITI, The Associated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said.

Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez, the officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, in Falcon Heights, Minn., has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. (2013 file photograph/The Associated Press) \nST. PAUL, Minn. — When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors.

Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile’s relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n“It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,” she said. “We don’t want any protests to get outrageous.” \nCastile’s shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor’s mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read “No Justice, No Peace” and “Black Lives Matter.” The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n“We haven’t won the war, but we won a battle,” activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun.

      "text": "Walmart reasserts its presence in Beauty; YouTube, Beauty Blogs, Facebook and Instagram are top influencers\nShelton, CT (PRWEB) November 16, 2016\nMillennial and Hispanic women are the heaviest buyers of cosmetics and skincare products in this $25 billion dollar market, TABS Analytics reported today in its Third Annual Beauty Study . Millennial women (ages 18-34) accounted for about 33 percent of the user base for cosmetics and skincare and almost 50 percent of heavy buyers of both categories (defined by the number product types of each category purchased). Over the last three years, there has been a sharp rise in the amount of cosmetics purchased by Hispanic women and they now account for 15 percent of all category buyers, 24 percent of all heavy buyers of cosmetics, and 20 percent of heavy skincare buyers. The skew in purchasing toward high income purchasers continued, but the study showed a dip in purchasing after $99,000 per year in earnings.\n“Millennial and Hispanic women are the clear drivers in the beauty market and account for almost 60 percent of all sales,” said Dr. Kurt Jetta, CEO and founder of TABS Analytics. “The beauty and consumer packaged goods industries need to take note of these buyers, including the changes in the brands they are buying and how they are being influenced.”\nTABS Analytics’ Third Annual Beauty Study was developed to determine what types of beauty products consumers are buying, where those products are purchased, and what social media channels are influencing beauty consumers. One thousand geographically and demographically dispersed female consumers between the ages of 18 and 75 were surveyed for this study in October 2016. The study analyzed the importance of the various shopping channels, including department stores, specialty cosmetic and beauty stores, drug stores and grocery stores. The study also compares Internet and in-home purchases with those of traditional mass-market retailers.\nHere are some key findings from the study:\n YouTube, beauty bloggers, Facebook, and Instagram are top influencers for heavy beauty buyers. The TABS study found that social media was important to 52 percent of heavy buyers of cosmetics in making purchase decisions. This represented a 22 percent jump from 2015 and an 11 percent increase annually over the past 3 years. YouTube drove much of this growth and was the most popular social media popular channel with 35 percent of heavy buyers reporting it was an influential channel for them. Beauty blogs held steady as being important to 29 percent of all heavy buyers. Facebook tied with Instagram in having the second biggest increase in influence among all buyers, and jumped from 17 percent in 2015 to 25 percent in 2016 among heavy buyers. Instagram increased in importance with heavy buyers from 19 percent in 2015 to 22 percent in 2016. One third of consumers also reported that online reviews influence their choices.\n Winners in 2016 tended to be in mass market, with Walmart reasserting its market leading position in Beauty sales. Walmart led all retailers across channels with 17 percent of all sector purchases. Walmart’s results demonstrate that it can be a strong force in cosmetics sales, especially after bringing in mass niche brands to its assortment mix during 2016. Dollar store growth was driven by the channel’s strength in the multi-cultural niche. The big non-mass market winner was the specialty beauty chain Sephora, which increased growth compared to last year primarily because of the increase in the number of stores, both with stand-alone stores and with Sephora within J.C. Penney format stores.\n Target, CVS, Macy’s and Nordstrom slip. Although Target finished second in the mass market channel behind Walmart with 9 percent of all purchases, it declined from 10 percent in 2015. Department stores’ share of purchases slid compared to 2015. Both Macy’s and Nordstrom’s cosmetics shares of purchases were down. This decline reported in the survey is consistent with soft sales reported by these specific retailers in their report filings.\n Online sales bounced back. Online sales reversed their decline from last year and now represent 9 percent of all beauty transactions, and over 10 percent of dollar sales, amounting to approximately $2.5 billion annually. Amazon dominates sales in the channel, outselling cosmetics websites by more than a 2-to-1 ratio.\n Almost fifty percent of retail dollars are in the non-mass market channels, but share is down slightly from 2015. The 2016 decline in share of purchases reported by the TABS study is primarily because of the growth of the mass market channel, driven by Walmart. Specialty beauty stores are responsible for 16 percent of all purchases. Surprisingly, Ulta was flat in 2016 with a 5.5 percent share of purchases after seeing strong growth in 2015. Last year’s 2015 TABS Analytics Study was an early predictor of Ulta quarterly reports showing very strong growth in same store sales.\n Newer brands are gaining in awareness and picking up growth. Although the top brands including Cover Girl, Maybelline, L’Oréal, Revlon, Neutrogena and Clinique maintained their predominance in key awareness, penetration and favorability metrics, a number of newer niche brands are breaking through in consumer popularity. NYX, e.l.f., Milani, Jordana, Black Radiance, Urban Decay and Boots all had double digit growth in awareness compared to last year.\n Category dynamics for skincare are very similar to cosmetics. However, skincare tends to skew more towards mass market compared to cosmetics, with a larger number of mass market brands showing high awareness. Otherwise, the demographic, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics for skincare are consistent with cosmetics. Offering good deals is the top factor in driving consumer outlet preference. Over 50 percent of consumers surveyed consistently state that promotional incentives and deals are important to them and that they like to shop at stores with “good deals.”\n The beauty advisor model is becoming obsolete. In-store beauty advisors are not a driver of preference. The TABS Survey shows that only 15 percent of consumers rated beauty advisors as important in the 2016 survey, down 5 percentage points from 20 percent in 2015.\n“The beauty category has maintained healthy growth in 2016, but that growth decelerated somewhat from our last study,” commented Dr. Jetta. “If these studies tell us anything, it is that there is still an insatiable demand for these younger users to directly engage with the products in terms of active research and trial of new products as well as new brands. Unlike most categories where we tend to see a shakeout of smaller brands, the pie of brands seems to be getting much bigger in beauty.”\nAbout TABS Analytics\nOperating since 1998, TABS Analytics, formerly TABS Group, based in Shelton, Conn., is a technology-enabled analytics firm.

FILE - This Jan. 8, 2013, file photo provided by Christian Dobratz shows St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez outside the city council chambers in St. Anthony, Minn. Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016,... (AP Photo/Jim Mone, File). FILE - In this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence where protesters continue to demonstrate in St. Paul, Minn., against the July 6 shooting d... By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

      "text": "Report: Fake election news outperformed real news on Facebook ahead of the election Dianne de Guzman Published 9:00 pm, Wednesday, November 16, 2016 \nThose heavily circulated fake news stories that were seen on Facebook before Election Day were found to have more engagement on the social media site than stories from reputable news organizations. \nBuzzFeed News looked at the top 20 fake election stories making the rounds on Facebook from Aug. 1 to Nov. 8. It found that the stories generated more than 8.7 million shares, reactions and comments, according to their findings . \nComparatively, the top 20 news stories from sites such as the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times (among others) received a total of only 7.3 million shares, reaction and comments during that same time. \nThe fake news headlines may seem familiar to those who've used Facebook recently. Here are the top 5 headlines, as seen in the data: \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement\" \"WikiLeaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS... Then Drops Another BOMBSHELL! Breaking News\" \"IT'S OVER: Hillary's ISIS Email Just Leaked & It's Worse Than Anyone Could Have Imagined\" \"Just Read the Law: Hillary is Disqualified from Holding Any Federal Office\" \"FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide\" \nThe election headlines from major news outlets were shown to have outperformed election news from fake news sites for most of 2016. There is a shift, however, starting in August, when fake news engagement soared past traditional news outlets. ALSO",

Learn more... \nThu, Nov 17, 2016, 05:28 GMT - UK Markets open in 2 hrs 32 mins Facebook buys facial recognition tech startup AFP – 14 minutes ago View Photo \n\nFacebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) said that it has bought facial recognition startup FacioMetrics, potentially using the technology for photo or video effects to better challenge rival Snapchat. \n\"How people share and communicate is changing and things like masks and other effects allow people to express themselves in fun and creative ways,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in an email reply to an AFP inquiry. \n\"We?re excited to welcome the FacioMetrics team who will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos and build even more engaging sharing experiences on Facebook.\" \nSilicon Valley-based Facebook did not disclose financial terms of the deal to buy FacioMetrics, which was spun out of Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania. \nFacioMetrics was founded in 2015 and specializes in using artificial intelligence to give facial image analysis capabilities to applications that run on smartphones. \nThe technology has potential in a host of applications, including those focused on animation, measuring audience reactions, and virtual or augmented realities, FacioMetrics founder and chief executive Fernando De la Torre said in a release. \n\"We're taking a big step forward by joining the team at Facebook, where we'll be able to advance our work at an incredible scale, reaching people from across the globe,\" De la Torre said. \nUsing FacioMetrics to let users of Facebook, or subsidiaries such as Instagram, have fun with photos or video could be a counter-move to those kinds of features offered in \"filters\" at vanishing message service Snapchat. \nParent company Snap estimates it has more than 100 million users globally of the service for sending videos, images and text messages which vanish after being viewed. Some reports say it generates 10 billion video views per day. \nSince trying unsuccessfully to buy Southern California-based Snapchat several years ago, Facebook has turned to cloning popular features.

To Choi's left is Don Lewis, special prosecutor in the case and to his right is Richard Dusterhoft, criminal division director at the Ramsey County DA's office. (David Joles /Star Tribune via AP) Associated Press By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITI ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. Moments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile's last words were: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" On Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. Prosecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. If convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. Diamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. The fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. Yanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. His attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. Choi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. Kelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" Castile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. About 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. Choi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. He gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. Yanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. Within a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. There was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. Yanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" Squad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. Reynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" ___",

      "text": "Reports of a potential (but secret) IPO by Snapchat yesterday brought out the usual round of dot com bubble comparisons.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising: if the rumours are true, the social messaging app could be valued at as much as $25bn, making it the third-largest IPO ever, after Alibaba and Facebook.\n\nThis, from a company built on teenagers who came for the disappearing pictures feature (and all the NSFW implications of that), but stayed for the filters, which allow users to transform themselves into dogs, or cats, or just people with really, really great skin.\n\nIt was inevitable words like “overvalued” would be bandied about – after all, the same was said of Facebook and Twitter when they went public.\n\n*Read more*: One huge hint that Snapchat's working on a VR device\n\nFacebook has proven the naysayers wrong, with shares more than quadrupling since its IPO. Twitter is another story – having gone through several chief executives and experienced halting user growth since its IPO, shares are currently a little over two-thirds of the $26 at which it first listed.\n\nSo will Snapchat be a Facebook or a Twitter? With stiff competition from the likes of (Facebook-owned – go figure) Instagram , which has all but duplicated its popular Stories feature, the early indications aren’t good.\n\nBut there are also signs of innovation, a trait which has kept Facebook in investors’ good books over the years. Its Discover feature is allowing publishers to reach millennial audiences they had been unable to snare via traditional means – a feature which, if done well, could present a sizeable opportunity.\n\n*Read more*: Google, Facebook and Twitter blasted over failure to tackle extremism\n\nAnd now its parent company, Snap Inc, has launched the almost comically millennial Spectacles. The $130 pair of sunglasses allows the wearer to take a 10-second “Snap” from their own perspective, just by tapping them.\n\nFeeding millennials ’ narcissism was always going to be a money-spinner – but Spectacles’ most appealing quality is their scarcity: no pairs were sent to reviewers, and they are only available from a single yellow Snapbot vending machine, which is popping up in secret locations across the US. Pairs have appeared on Ebay with a Buy it Now value of $2,000. If that’s not proof it can keep users interested, it’s hard to say what is.",

(AP) – The Clay, West Virginia, Town Council has accepted the resignation of Mayor Beverly Whaling over her response to a racist post on Facebook about first lady Michelle Obama. \nThe council accepted Whaling’s resignation Tuesday without voting on the matter and said they plan to move quickly to name a replacement for the remaining three years of her term. \nCouncil member Jason Hubbard issued a brief statement condemning the “horrific” post and said “racial intolerance isn’t what this community is about.” He apologized on behalf of the town to anyone who is offended, including Michelle Obama. \nWhaling earlier apologized for her response to a post made by Clay County Development Corp. director Pamela Ramsey Taylor after Republican Donald Trump’s election as president. Taylor’s post said, “It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I’m tired of seeing a Ape in heels.” \nWhaling responded: “Just made my day Pam.” \nWhaling said earlier she isn’t racist. Taylor hasn’t returned a call seeking comment. Share this: ",

PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. \nMoments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile's last words were: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

      "text": "Nintendo Like us on Facebook \nAt long last, you can finally step inside the fantasy world of The Legend of Zelda . As Kotaku reports, Nintendo has partnered with SCRAP , the company behind Real Escape Game events, for a new IRL puzzle called “The Defenders of the Triforce.\" \nThe interactive game will visit eight U.S. cities to give fans an opportunity to experience the characters (like Link, Zora, and the Kokiri Tribes) and worlds from the classic NES game series. Instead of being locked in a room to escape, fans will have to work together in six-person teams to solve puzzles, collect items, and unlock new rooms to save the Triforce from the evil clutches of Ganondorf—all in 90 minutes. Afterward, fans can take photos of the Nintendo lounge and purchase exclusive Legend of Zelda merchandise like posters, t-shirts, and coins. \n“At Nintendo, we’re always looking for ways to offer new experiences for all of our fans, and expose our characters and franchises to new audiences,” said Doug Bowser, Nintendo of America’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, in a press release . “Partnering with SCRAP allows us to offer a new perspective on this legendary series.” “The Defenders of the Triforce” tour kicks off in San Francisco at the end of January 2017.

By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - When Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

More >> By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. \nMoments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile's last words were: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis, AP reporter Jeff Baenen contributed from St. Paul.

      "text": "‘Dangerous’: Don’t rely on Facebook as your sole source of news, says Edward Snowden By David Big Brother , Corporate Crime , Coverups \n‘Ex-CIA employee turned whistleblower Edward Snowden explained why he thinks it’s very dangerous to rely on Facebook as your only source of news and information while speaking via BeamBot at Fusion’s Real Future Fair conference in Oakland, California. \n“There is a big controversy happening right now, about this election particularly, regarding Facebook. There is this claim – which hasn’t really been proved, substantiated, but it’s getting pretty popular – that Facebook rigged the election because they showed fake news,” Snowden said. \n“If that was true, if that was possible, and Facebook just put on fake news, and we were persuaded [by it], I think that’s actually very sad indictment of our democracy that our voters could be so easily misled,” he added.’",

Shelby County is now examining whether it should create a social media policy.\n\"Anyone in a leadership position at Shelby County government is held at a high standard of behavior, both on and off the job,\" he told CNN's local affiliate WREG.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "title": "Ten Yogic Tips for Processing Grief & Making Change.",
      "text": "“Get up, stand up. Stand up for your rights…don’t give up the fight.” ~ Bob Marley \n~ My Facebook feed is blowing up with outraged, terrified and sorrowful responses to the announcement that Donald J. Trump will be our next President and Commander-in-Chief. \nAccording to one of the most sacred yogic texts, we are currently in a period called Kali Yuga . This period is the darkest of the four ages. But the great thing about Kali Yuga is that it will help us to evolve as a species through facing the darkness ( gu ) and collectively choosing to turn towards the light ( ru ). \nAs I flow between the stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance), I’m also feeling quite optimistic about the avalanche of awesome reform that could be born from this most unfortunate reality. \nI left the U.S. the day of the election and flew to the Sacred Valley of Peru. There, I met up with a friend and fellow yoga teacher for lunch. She is a social worker in New York, and I listened compassionately as she expressed sheer terror of her clients potentially being deported under Trump’s jurisdiction. \nTrump was elected by a country living in deeply-rooted fear. Having an unbalanced root chakra leaves people wanting to latch onto a strong voice to enhance their perceived sense of safety. I could go off about how racism, bigotry, and sexism won—but instead I want to offer tangible ways to move forward. \nI recently went to a yin yoga class at the Yoga Room in Cuzco. The class was so packed that our mats were touching, and students were turned away at the door. About half the class were citizens of the U.S., there to grieve collectively after an emotionally draining day. The teacher, Katherine Narvaez, said something during class that really hit home with me: \n“Don’t allow the darkness of the world to reside in your body.” \nAs I saw my friends posting about post-Trump hangovers, I realized that people really need tangible tools to help them process their grief sustainably. Here are a few simple things we can do: 1. Make a conscious decision to concentrate on your breath when you are feeling disgruntled. Think about breathing in light and exhaling darkness. To make real change we need to balance our outrage with healing vibrations. We can balance our left (feminine) and right (masculine) brains through practicing the pranayama alternate nostril breathing, agni sadhana . 2. Be cautious about where you allow your mind to wander during this trying time in history. Choose to reflect on positive interactions, remaining a positive petunia even in the sea of negativity. 3. Dance ecstatically! Attend an ecstatic dance in your community or just let loose in your room. Free-form movement allows you to be authentic, spontaneous and expressive in a moving meditation. It can serve as a constructive relief from the stress and tension of this election. 4. Meta and mantra meditation have been essential tools for me to dissolve my anger and frustration and transform those feelings into universal loving kindness. Try the mantra, “ Sat cit ananda ” which translated from sanskrit means, “I am an eternal, conscious, blissful being.” Do this 108 times , or until you feel more at ease. 5. Try to incorporate postures where your forehead or third eye is receiving pressure to help dispel illusion and bring about clarity about what you can do to positively contribute to the world (triangle, child’s pose, standing forward fold, seated head to knee). 6. If you are feeling ungrounded , try working on your root or muladhara chakra. This chakra symbolizes your relationship with pacha mama—mother earth. The mantra for this chakra is Lam, and its color is a deep red. Give yourself a foot massage to move consciousness toward your primary connection to the earth. Try earthing, which can be as simple as sitting under a tree with your hands on the ground. 7. Try focusing on what change you want to see. Visualize it, draw it, talk about, journal about it. Once your vision is clear, commit to it and share it with the world to inspire others. 8. Try AcroYoga ! Lifting others up and trusting others to lift you up is a powerful way to build community, communication skills, and strength to keep fighting as a peaceful warrior. 9. Be extra sensitive about the food and substances you choose to put into your body. Wanting to go out and get trashed to forget the whole thing is a totally natural response, but the reality will be the same in the morning—only you will be less ambitious to do anything about it. Eating pure satvic food will help you to be able to think more clearly, and it’s better for the planet. 10. Do something to be a part of the change! Teach a free yoga class outside that starts with a clean-up, organize or take part in a peaceful protest, or volunteer for a non-profit whose values align with yours. \nThe globe needs compassionate beings who are inclusive of all races, genders and religions. It is time to organize—to come together on local, national and global fronts to say we refuse for this to be our reality. \nI refuse to hunker down and just sit gritting my teeth as this level of discrimination plays out before my eyes. \nWe do not have to continue to repeat history. We are standing on the shoulders of giants—Martin Luther King Jr . , Mahatma Gandhi Gi, Cesar Chavez, to name a few. Our water warriors with the Dakota Access Pipeline have been gathering people and restoring our national sense of community activism. \nWe can run with the momentum those activists have built to bring about real sustainable change for ourselves and uture generations. \n~",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nHOLLYWOOD (CBSMiami) – Chef Russ Aaron Simon has a lot of irons on the fire, literally, at American English Kitchen and Bar in Hollywood.\nFrom fresh fish to homemade pasta, sauces and more, Chef Russ is used stocking up and working in busy kitchens.\nFor 16 years he worked with celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck in his iconic Beverly Hills restaurant Spago, among others.\n“Wolfgang was a mentor of mine. I was one of many chefs he depended on to help him execute all the different menus in his restaurants,” said Chef Russ.\nBut this Hollywood, Florida native dropped the bright lights of Hollywood, California for a place in his hometown.\n“I always wanted to come back and come home and after many years working for Wolfgang, I figured the time is now,” he said.\nThe result is an inviting space right off Harrison Street, with a name that plays off the many styles of food the menu reflects.\n“When you think about billiards, ‘English’ is when you put a spin on the ball. So American English is my spin on not just American food, but different types of cuisine,” Chef Russ said.\nCBS4’s Lisa Petrillo began the tasting with chef’s wild boar ragù with fettuccine.\n“It’s not as gamey as one would think. It’s actually quite mild and we finish that with a Pecorino Romano cheese and wild mushrooms and pork belly and pancetta.\n“When he told me wild boar fettuccine, I’ll admit I was nervous. I had nothing to be nervous about there’s so much flavor. The pasta is cooked perfectly and the taste of the wild boar is beautiful actually,” Petrillo said after tasting.\nNext, pan roasted snapper with Thai coconut sauce served with a ragù of carrots, eggplant and leeks with pea shoots on top.\n“The fish is so tender and fresh. Then the flavors with the veggies underneath and the sear on the outside makes it a perfect texture. It’s a special fish,” Petrillo said.\nAnd finally, potato beignets made with russet potatoes, bacon, scallions and white cheddar cheese.\n“When I think of beignets, I think of a New Orleans dessert,” said Petrillo. “But, this is on the savory side. This is so light and fluffy. It’s a perfect appetizer or side dish.”\nAmerican English Kitchen and Bar is open five days a week, Tuesday through Saturday dinner only.\nFor more info, visit: americanenglishkitchenandbar.com ",

By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. \nMoments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile's last words were: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop. Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, is scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" \n___ \nForliti reported from Minneapolis.

By KYLE POTTER and AMY FORLITIAssociated Press \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. \nMoments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile's last words were: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop. Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, is scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun.

If Google, Facebook, and YouTube have their way, anyone reporting information outside the party line will be considered “fake,” and they’ll work hard to starve out the bloggers, vloggers, and citizen journalists who are providing an alternative point of view.

Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez, the officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, in Falcon Heights, Minn., has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. Christian Dobratz via AP, File FILE - In this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence where protesters continue to demonstrate in St. Paul, Minn., against the July 6 shooting death of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. Jim Mone, File AP Photo Ramsey County Attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop. Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi announces that Minnesota police officer Jeronimo Yanez will face three charges in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6 traffic stop. Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. Star Tribune via AP David Joles Ramsey County attorney John Choi, second left, walks away from the podium Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, after announcing that officer Jeronimo Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing of Philando Castile, a black man whose girlfriend streamed the gruesome aftermath of the fatal shooting live on Facebook. To Choi's left is Don Lewis, special prosecutor in the case and to his right is Richard Dusterhoft, criminal division director at the Ramsey County DA's office. Star Tribune via AP David Joles 1 of 5 Order Reprint of this Story ST. PAUL, Minn. \nWhen Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it, according to prosecutors. Moments later, the officer fired on the motorist, and a bleeding Castile uttered his last words: \"I wasn't reaching for it.\" \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n\"No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would've used deadly force under these circumstances,\" Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez's unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown's death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile's relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n\"It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,\" she said. \"We don't want any protests to get outrageous.\" \nCastile's shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor's mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read \"No Justice, No Peace\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n\"We haven't won the war, but we won a battle,\" activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted \"Don't pull it out\" as Castile insisted he wasn't, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez's partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile's weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n\"His dying words were in protest that he wasn't reaching for his gun,\" Choi said. \"There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.\" \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi's decision. \n\"Without my recording,\" she said, \"we wouldn't be here today.\" Lavish Reynolds used Facebook Live to show what happened after her boyfriend, Philando Castile, was shot by a police officer as he was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car.

      "text": "by IWB · November 17, 2016 \nIn the wake of one of the most tumultuous election cycles in recent memory, many people are criticizing social media outlets – namely Facebook – for not doing enough to weed out obviously fake news articles that could have potentially impacted people’s votes. This is a claim that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been quick to dismiss , but many remain skeptical. \nBut one of the biggest newsmakers in the past several years, Edward Snowden, says fake news isn’t necessarily the issue here. \nSpeaking at Fusion’s Real Future Fair via a BeamBot from Russia, the former CIA employee turned whistleblower said the fact that fake news is available on Facebook isn’t so much of a problem, but the bigger issue is that Facebook is the only news source for many people. \n“There seems to be no alternative to the larger services. Because of this network effect, because the first mover advantage. When you get a Google or a Facebook or Twitter in place, they never seem to leave,” Snowden said, pointing to a lack of competition as a cause for the problem. \nIt’s even more troublesome when you consider that the majority of people share and comment on stories shared on social media sites like Facebook without actually reading them. If people consumed news from multiple sources, he argued, it would be much easier to tell the fake from the real. In other words, stop relying on Facebook for your news. \n\nWe already see the results with them banning “fake news”. \nAuthor and activitist Brittney Pettibone joins Margaret Howell and Joe Biggs to talk about her shadow ban on Twitter for speaking out about WikiLeak’s bombshells. \nThe Mainstream media is a cult. A cult that according to Gallup “Americans’ trust and confidence in the mass media “to report the news fully, accurately and fairly” has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year.” \nGenerally, cult leaders like Jim Jones or Marshall Applewhite of Heavens Gate manipulated their gullible followers to their dooms by controlling the initiates ability to utilize critical individual thought. Starkly at odds with the freedoms guaranteed to all Americans by the Constitution. \nFurthermore, any semblance of journalistic integrity existing in mainstream media has long been hijacked by the CIA’s creeping propaganda infiltration of the media since Operation Mockingbird in the 1950’s morphed into the raging mind control operation inhabiting the idiot box today. A monstrosity fully unchained after propaganda was essentially legalized in 2013. \nAnd now that Cult would have us all believe that Trump’s pick for a Senior Counselor position is a white nationalist. Breitbart’s Steve Bannon the man fronting an organization that the corporacratic criminals in DC feared enough to allegedly cause its namesake and founder, Andrew Breitbart, to reach an early demise. A publication with its finger squarely on the pulse of the nation’s dysfunctional criminal government is suddenly reduced to a neo nazi zine by the sycophantic new world order press? 1 views Previous story Obama: “Obamacare is “less than your cellphone bill”– Who Pays $1500 a Month on a CELLPHONE … That is even with a HIGH Deductible. – What PLANET are you living on? \nFollow: It only takes a few moments to share an article, but the person on the other end who reads it might have his life changed forever Subscribe to our newsletter Please wait...

      "text": "MOSCOW — Russia's state internet watchdog added social network LinkedIn to its official blacklist on Thursday. \nAll of the country's internet providers are obliged to enact the ban, Roskomnadzor said on its website. \nHowever, LinkedIn appeared accessible from NBC News' office in Moscow on Thursday afternoon. A LinkedIn logo. ROBERT GALBRAITH / Reuters, file \nThe social network aimed at job seekers and recruiters ran afoul of a 2015 Russian law requiring all personal data of Russians to be stored on servers inside the country. \nInternet giants Google, Facebook and Twitter are also liable. None have voiced any plans to move servers to Russia, but have faced no repercussions from the Russian government so far. \nLinkedIn was sued by Roskomnadzor for its failure to comply earlier this year, and lost the case and the appeal in Moscow last week. \nA spokesman for the watchdog had earlier said that LinkedIn was punished for alleged leaks of user data, Russian media reported. \nInformation about 120 million LinkedIn user accounts was stolen in 2012, the attack reportedly blamed on Russian hackers. \nLinkedIn has not publicly commented on the issue, but has requested a meeting with Roskomnadzor, watchdog spokesman Vadim Ampelonsky told TASS state news agency last week. \nLinkedIn says it has 460 million users, including 6 million in Russia. \nRussia was ranked 52nd out of 65 countries and ranked \"non-free\" in the 2016 Freedom on the Net report by the Freedom House rights watchdog.

Hill Montessori school shows a sign in support of Philando Castile at a rally in St. Paul, Minn., Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016. Jeronimo Yanez, a Minnesota police officer who shot Castile, was charged Wednesday with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile's girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook.

      "title": "Facebook banned this woman’s post because it had a picture of a bra — again!",
      "text": "Japleen Pasricha was banned from sharing a post that had bra as an image/ Twitter: Japleen Pasricha On November 7, Japleen Pasricha, founder of Feminism In India, was blocked from sharing an article titled “I Was Ashamed At My Breasts: On Bras and Breasts”, which had the picture of a bra. Facebook showed her the message: “You recently posted something that violates Facebook policies”. And guess what, it’s not the first time Facebook has blocked a post because it had bra or breasts in it.\nPasricha, in a blog, wrote that she has faced this thrice before and her relationship with Facebook hasn’t been great. The first time it happened was when she tried to post picture of a bare-chested African woman on a motorbike, the second was when she tried to post a poem titled ‘breasts’ with an image of breasts and the third was when she tried to share the iconic picture of women who protested against AFSPA and Indian Army in Manipur in 2004.\n“One could still understand a ban on pornography (although, even that’s debatable), however, by imposing a blanket ban on women’s nipples Facebook is basically saying that women’s bodies are inherently sexual, for the pleasure of cis heterosexual men and can only be seen through the male gaze,” she wrote.\nRecently drew flak for censoring a Vietnam war photo which it later restored. Espen Egil Hansen, the editor in chief of Aftenposten, a Norwegian daily newspaper, wrote an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg in which he clearly said, “I am writing this letter to inform you that I shall not comply with your requirement to remove a documentary photography from the Vietnam war made by Nick Ut.”\nFacebook, in its comeback had this to say, “An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our community standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time.”\nPasricha, however, has not received an apology and might not also. “However, not all people receive a statement and public apology from Facebook (certainly not me) who just want to post consensual and affirming pictures and/or artowork of our bodies,” she wrote.\nThis is what I received from @facebook – my 4th or 5th suspension or as @adishigupta calls it ‘bad student in the class’ @FeminismInIndia pic.twitter.com/01ay4bUqZY\n— Japleen Pasricha (@japna_p) November 7, 2016\nHave something to add to the story?

Look at yourself.3. Give yourself an honest review and realize that there is no reason in the world that an attractive lady from the Philippines wants to be your friend.4. Return to the computer and delete the friend request.5. Continue looking at lawnmowers, motorcycles and jacked up trucks thatare for sale in your region of the country.6. Realize that you just saved yourself from showing the world what no one really needs to see, and a whole lot of cash. Actually pretty funny.",

      "title": "When Fake News Becomes the News: Google and Facebook Are Taking on Fake News",
      "text": "Once upon a time you could count on the sun rising in the east and then setting in the west. Up was up and down was down. The good guys always won and you could count on accurate news that was vetted by an editorial staff, nowadays not so much! The zany headlines of my youth were reserved for the National Enquirer, The Daily Mail, and News of The World.\nIt’s been said that traditional news outlets are going the way of the dinosaur. To this point, it’s well documented that millennials get their news from their favorite social media platforms – http://bit.ly/2fZNYEJ . It is much easier to grab today’s headlines from a mobile devices while waiting for an Uber, a train, or stuck at a stoplight, than to pick-up a newspaper or watch the evening news.\nThis at-a-glance skimming makes it harder to discern what is actually real news and what is fake news, leaving everyone more susceptible to believing fake news is gospel. And, the result of this is many so-called experts worry that millennials views can be very narrow in focus or heavily influenced because of this practice, especially for complex issues. It’s been argued that many in the U.K. experienced this with their Brexit vote – leading many voters to openly wonder about a redo after the fact.\nWe of course had a US version of that last week during the election. By gathering quick hitting news from social channels, it is harder to differentiate which stories are fake amongst those articles that have been researched, edited, and verified for accuracy. Social channels have become so filled with fake news that many people relay inaccurate information that they use to base their decision on to others, there by creating a domino affect. Now, there have been many calls from lawmakers to clamp down on fake news generated on popular websites such as Google and Facebook as they feel voters were influenced by fake news stories popping up in their feeds – http://bit.ly/2fWpZpL . Earlier this week, first Google and then Facebook announced that they would not allow fake news sites to use the tech giants’ advertising services, which provide lucrative revenue for widely-shared web traffic.\nThough daunting, the fight against fake news is a welcome effort, Since the tech giants sites are used by hundreds of millions of people a day, the world’s largest internet companies have a responsibility to protect users from misinformation as best they can. More proof that this issue is so rampant, Jessica Roy, of the Los Angeles Times, wrote a story on Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, who has created a google doc where you can track which sites are generating fake news content – http://lat.ms/2fX74K5 . For those of us who make our living working with the media on real stories on our client’s behalf, this is useful tool. Now instead of defending oneself from unwarranted and made up news articles, we can focus on providing newsworthy content to credible news organizations.\nWith life’s important issues it’s critical that you conduct your own research, visit sites covering both sides of a story, especially with politics. Talk with your friends, co-workers, and others to get the full story. And, always consider the source … If something is too good to be true it probably is. Now I am off to research flying pigs, because everyone knows that’s a real thing.\n",

(Photo: NithidPhoto/Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nGifts to employees or customers are a traditional way to spread cheer and thanks to people important to your business during the holiday season, but the IRS says certain types of gifts are taxable. Make sure you follow the rules and avoid a Grinch-like spoiler later. \nGifts to employees The good news is all gifts and awards to employees are deductible expenses for employers. Some gifts, however, are treated as taxable income to the employee. \nFor example, all cash or gift cards redeemable for cash are taxable to the employee, even when given as a holiday gift. Likewise, monetary prizes, including achievement awards and non-monetary bonuses (like vacation trips awarded for meeting sales goals), are taxable compensation — not just for income taxes but also for FICA, so withholding applies. \n• On the other hand, non-cash gifts of minimal value, such as a holiday turkey, mostly are not taxable for employees if they are under $75 per year. • Gifts worth more than $75 are taxable. • Gifts awarded for length of service or safety achievement are not taxable as long as they are not cash, gift certificates or points redeemable for merchandise. The tax-free value is, however, limited to $1,600 for all awards to one employee in a year. \nGifts to customers Many companies also give gifts to highly valued customers during this time of year. The IRS is less generous about giving companies a break on these gifts and limits how much a business can deduct to $25 in gifts per person per year. This $25 limit applies whether the gift is given directly to an individual customer or indirectly to the company but intended for individuals. \nGiving a gift to a customer’s family does not get around the limit. Those gifts are treated as though they were given to the customer and are subject to the total limit for the customer. Similarly, gifts from different members of a partnership to one person are treated as though they all are coming from one source and the total deduction is limited to $25. \nA bit of good news: Incidental costs, such as engraving, packaging, insurance and mailing generally do not count against the $25 limit. \nThis story is provided and presented by LBMC .

      "text": "By John Hilton InsuranceNewsNet \nDALLAS -- Targeted emails and Facebook advertising are two ways social media marketing can reach today's audience successfully. \nThose methods work for Justin Blase. Director of digital strategy at Insurance Forums, Blase said he has generated more than 15,000 leads so far this year. \nBlase led a session Wednesday at the National Association of Independent Life Brokerage Agencies (NAILBA) annual conference in Dallas. One thing that is abundantly clear in 2016, Blase said, is you must conduct marketing through social media. \nTo back up his assertion, he rattled off a batch of fresh statistics: Americans spend 5.6 hours per day on digital media, up from 3.2 hours in 2010. Facebook alone takes up 22 percent of the time all Americans spend on mobile devices. \nEmail blasts are a great way to get a message out, Blase said, but too often they are not done correctly. Crafting an enticing subject line and writing copy that generates curiosity can make or break an email blast. \n\"It's not easy being an email marketer and getting someone to open that email, read it and take action,\" he said. \nIn the email message, it is important to limit calls to action to one or maybe two things, Blase said. Don't bombard the reader with three or four options. \nThe average age of insurance agents is 57, Blase said. The good news is eight in 10 agents are using social media. However, what a 57-year-old person considers interesting and funny might not resonate with a younger audience, he added. \nWhen it comes to Facebook advertising, Blase said the results are worth it. Facebook has 15 different ads to choose from and you can try many different things and stick with what works, he said. And Facebook allows you to target by job title, employer name or even specific interests. \nIf all else fails, Blase said, spy on your competitors. You can get ideas and intel from seeing what your competitors are doing, for example, whether they are running the same advertising for an extended period. \n\"If you're running an ad for 329 days, it had better be working,\" Blase said. \"Otherwise, you've lost a lot of money.\" \nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Editor John Hilton has covered business and other beats in more than 20 years of daily journalism.

      "text": "iStock Like us on Facebook \nThe 21st century may not involve flying cars just yet, but there are still plenty of technological advances in the machine world that can make your life easier right now. Here are 10 tasks that robots can take over from you: 1. PLAYING WITH YOUR KIDS \nYou probably shouldn’t leave your children with a robot babysitter and jet off to the movies, but today’s robots can still benefit your little ones. Therapy robots are already used in classrooms to help kids with autism learn social skills, but they’re also used to help kids who aren’t on the spectrum learn art and other subjects. Other personal assistant robots currently in use in China can help your toddlers re-read their favorite book for the 100th time. Through a tablet, you can check in on your 3- to 8-year-old kids with a baby-cam feature, or let the robot answer yet another “why?” question. In Japan, robots will help address the country’s childcare shortage, assisting human daycare providers in monitoring and entertaining young charges by 2018. 2. GOING TO THAT ALL-STAFF MEETING \nWorking remotely doesn’t need to mean being totally absent from the office anymore. Telepresence robots can let you wander the corporate halls as if you were really there, not sitting at home hundreds or thousands of miles away. Essentially tablets on wheels, these robots take video conferencing mobile, allowing you to drop by a colleague’s office or hang around the water cooler if you really want to. 3. TENDING YOUR GARDEN \nIf you don’t have a naturally green thumb, robots can help. One open-source farming robot due out in February 2017 can do everything but harvest your vegetables: it plants seeds, waters them on a schedule, monitors their growth, and destroys weeds. You just log into the video game-like app and arrange your plants in the desired configuration, and the robot does the rest. On a smaller scale, smart sprinkler systems can monitor weather and soil conditions to figure out just how much water each of the plants in your yard need at any given time, and distribute it accordingly. One cloud-connected sprinkler system claims to lower garden water consumption by up to 90 percent. 4. TURNING ON THE LIGHTS \nDomestic robots are more useful than ever before thanks to smart home technology. Smart home hubs allow you to set specific schedules for when your lights turn on and off, so you don’t have to worry about coming home to a dark house or accidentally leaving the kitchen light on after you go to bed. These hubs can connect to the various different smart home products you use, like thermostats, smoke alarms, or sound systems, so you can use just one app to schedule your thermostat to turn down the temperature and your security system to activate automatically around the time you leave for work. A few of the newer hubs are voice activated, so you can just ask your home robot to turn the lights on or lock the door. 5. ORDERING PIZZA—AND MORE \nThe pizza industry may be the first to succumb to our robot overlords. In Singapore, one major credit card company has plans to install a robot in a pizza chain to help customers order their meal, due out by the end of this year. A Silicon Valley pizza startup is taking it even further, using robots to make its pies. Since April, the pizza ‘bots have been doing everything from spreading sauce to popping pizzas in the oven. And of course, you can ask your voice-operated smart home hub to order you your favorite pizza. 6. CARRYING YOUR GROCERIES \nIn 2017, a popular (among mall cops, at least) personal vehicle manufacturer will come out with a robot butler that’s part hoverboard, part assistant. It’s got facial recognition, speech recognition, autonomous navigation, and more. It can follow you around the house, or you can ride it around the yard. And unlike smaller personal robots, it can carry things for you, ferrying your grocery bag to the kitchen. The developer version of the ‘bot came out this year, so there will likely be a whole set of apps ready by the time the consumer version launches. 7. KEEPING YOU COMPANY \nLoneliness isn’t just a social problem; it’s a public health issue. Social isolation has been found to be just as risky as smoking or obesity when it comes to your health. However, building a community isn’t easy. For people who can’t get out of the house easily, there are robots, like interactive dogs, cats, and seals that make noise and respond to touch much like real animals would. Other robots specifically designed for older adults who live alone can detect falls, remind users of appointments, and connect to video-chat programs and social media. 8. COOKING DINNER \nOne robotics company is the in the midst of developing a robotic cook that can cook with the flair of a celebrity chef, reproducing the dexterity and skill of human cooks. A consumer version is due out in 2017, and will come with touchscreen controls and a glass enclosure that will protect your kitchen from any stray splashes from the cooking process. 9. KEEPING YOU COOL \nOffices are notoriously hard to keep at a comfortable temperature, but soon, a little robot might act as your personal climate control. Several university research teams are competing to develop a personal air conditioner that can follow a person around and connect to a wearable devices that tells the ‘bot if they are uncomfortably warm or cold. The robot will then adjust its heating or cooling mechanisms accordingly, preventing users from needing to turn up the heat or AC building-wide. 10. KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR HEALTH \nHealth robots can keep you feeling your best, even if you’re not great at remembering your medications. One pill-dispensing robot scheduled to debut in summer 2017 can hook up to your activity trackers and even re-order your vitamins and medications when you’re about to run out. You can ask the cute pill-bot health questions and set it up to recognize the faces of you and the other members of your family. \nIs your to-do list a mile long? Let Neato’s line of WiFi-enabled robot vacuums take care of your messy floors. Using the app, you can tell Neato when it’s time to clean, and its powerful suction and corner-friendly D-shape do the rest. Visit Neato Robotics to learn more. November 17, 2016 - 4:00am",

      "text": "2016 6 hours ago \nLike many Californians, Dex Torricke-Barton is unhappy about the outcome of the US presidential election. While he’s enjoyed a successful career in corporate communications working for Google, Facebook, and most recently SpaceX, he’s also kept in mind the struggles of his late father—a Burmese refugee. \nNow, he’s quitting his job to help address the “social divides” that he feels contributed to the election result. On Nov. 16 he announced on Facebook he was leaving SpaceX to “work on causes focused exclusively on social change.” He wrote: \nAs an immigrant and the son of a refugee, and as someone dedicated to advancing the interests of humanity, I don’t want to watch while the world slips backwards… From what I see, the world is becoming a less open and less compassionate place… More than 65 million people are refugees, more than at any point in history… Nationalist movements are ascending across Europe. Brexit, a British tragedy, is in danger of becoming a general European failure. Here in the United States, my home for the last eight years, Tuesday’s election result is yet another huge setback. \nPart of the problem, as he sees it, is the US’s growing social divides, and attendant lack of empathy and understanding, “between coastal elites and communities left behind by globalization, between those who seek greater diversity and those who are fearful of it, between the ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in a changing world.” \nTo address such gaps Torricke-Barton said that he would work with existing organizations, and that he was also starting a project with a group of Silicon Valley innovators. He didn’t provide specifics, but, not surprisingly for someone with his background, he hinted it would involve technology, which “can play a key role in connecting communities.” \nBefore the election, Torricke-Barton made a plea on Medium to voters to back Hillary Clinton, arguing that “America’s future can be driven by compassion for the world, or a retreat behind walls.” Vote for humanity. My personal essay on what's at stake tomorrow. #Imwithher https://t.co/GDE5YpEEDm \n— Dex Torricke-Barton (@DexBarton) November 7, 2016 \nHe recalled how his father as a child hid in ditches from Japanese soldiers during World War II, and how today children from Syria and elsewhere also face perilous and often deadly circumstances. \nHe criticized Trump’s outlook on the world: \nIf you believe in the ‘America First’ policies of Donald Trump, then there is much more to lose from the world than there is to gain. We have everything we need right here. Those who seek America’s help are principally scroungers who’ve ripped us off, menaces who threaten our communities or at least someone else’s problem. Internationalism is a dirty word. \n“We are seeing increasingly harsh social divisions emerging in the United States and in Europe, and I believe this poses a really fundamental threat to the future of our society,” Torricke-Barton told Fortune . “I didn’t see how I could stay on the sidelines.” \nA rash of racist attacks broke out in the US after Trump’s victory. \nIn his announcement, Torricke-Barton also said he would write a book about “how technology is transforming societies from the Rust Belt to Brexit Britain, rural India to Sub-Saharan Africa… To build a world of greater freedom, justice and prosperity, we need to hear the voices of more people from more communities.” Read full story ",

      "text": "Digital Journalism How Often Do Top Publishers Post On Facebook? \nHow often should publishers be posting on Facebook? We look at the posting frequency of ten top publishers’ main Facebook pages, and look at the content formats that they tend to get more space. \nHow many Facebook posts is too many? \nMany publishers wonder whether posting too often could adversely affect their visibility in news feeds. On the other hand, not posting enough can reduce engagement rates, and could cause missed opportunities around popular content. There’s also the consideration that the content needs to be different and appealing to different parts of the audience in order to achieve maximum reach and engagement. \nSo, how often are social publishing leaders posting on their pages, and what does the content output look like? \nUsing NewsWhip Analytics, we looked at the posting frequency on the top ten most engaged sites’ main Facebook pages over 24 hours on November 1. \n\nRemember that here we were looking exclusively at the main Facebook pages of each of these publishers. So on November 1, the Daily Mail’s main Facebook page posted 99 times to their page, followed by Goal.com, with 72 total posts. \nBeyond the top publishers, there’s a lot of discrepancy in posting frequency amongst these pages. BuzzFeed posted just 28 times to its vast audience on the day in question, with Fox News just slightly ahead, with 32 posts. Most of these publishers have worked to split their distribution out using multiple Facebook pages, each targeting a particular topic or subject, rather than presenting general content. \nIt’s interesting to note that not every piece of content produced by the website is posted to the main Facebook page. Each of these publishers use their main page as a strategic way of amplifying the content that’s most likely to do well on Facebook. For instance, the Huffington Post published 664 English language articles on the date in question, and only 37 of those ended up being linked to from the main Facebook page that day. Of the links that they did post, there was a lively mix of opinion pieces, news, and upbeat features. \nOne more thing to remember is that these numbers refer specifically to larger publishers producing large volumes of original content, rather than smaller pages, for whom a less frequent posting schedule is more suitable. \nNext, we looked at how the posts broke down by content format. We split out the posts from the top ten pages by post format, to see if the pages were posting more of a particular type of content. Here’s what that post breakdown looked like for the ten pages over 24 hours: \n\nHere we see that link posts (which include Instant Articles) make up the vast bulk of posts for the majority of pages. Links to owned web properties remain the number one most popular post format for publishers, who look to drive traffic to their own websites. \nThe Daily Mail is a notable exception, posting 51 videos, out of a total of 99 posts. \nIt’s also interesting to note the relative lack of image posts from the pages we surveyed. Of the ten pages, only ESPN and Goal.com, two sports publishers, were the only two pages to make use of the format. Our research has shown that image posts get higher average engagement rates than link posts. \n",

      "text": "November 17th is National Unfriend Day.\nNational Unfriend Day is a day where it’s perfectly acceptable to go down your list and delete your Facebook friends you don’t know, clog up your newsfeed, send you creepy messages or whom you no longer speak to.\nCan you relate… to the Five Stages of Facebook Deletion Grief?\n1. Denial and Isolation \nIt’s a mistake. Right? Should you point it out to him/her, and be re-friended immediately?\n2. Anger \nHe/she did delete you! Doesn’t he/she realize how important it is to keep up the illusion that we’re still friends — if not for us, then for all the friends we share? Do I need to send out some kind of mass email alerting people to our breakup?\n3. Bargaining \nPlease Universe, undo this deletion. I promise not to ever share anything snarky again. I’ll like everything on her Facebook page. I’ll even like her comments and the comments on her comments. I’ll put cute emoticons on her Timeline showing how worthy I am to be her Facebook friend.\n4. Depression \nNobody likes me. I have no friends. Out of the nearly 700 Facebook friends I have, not one of them would bail me out of jail — though I would never be in jail. Is there a Facebook jail?\n5. Acceptance \nI’m happy not to see endless images from her amazing, perfect life or read more fake comments from her. I don’t have to pretend anymore that I’m someone I’m not to avoid her Judge-Judying me. The truth is, I don’t feel grief that she deleted me — I feel relieved.\nNow our relationship status is no longer complicated; it’s nonexistent and that feels fantastic.",

      "text": "  Natalie Woods bought an antigay family dinner in an act of \"going high.\" Facebook \nWhen a Texas woman heard a family a table over at a restaurant near her home talking about their “disgust” with their “liberal” nephew for coming out as gay, she decided to surprise them by paying for their meal. \nNot because she approved of their antigay sentiments, but rather because she was inspired by the now famous words of Michelle Obama at the 2016 Democratic National Convention : “When they go low, we go high.” \nNatalie Woods was at Snuffer’s Restaurant & Bar, in Addison, Texas on Nov. 11, when the incident occurred, works with an LGBTQ civil rights organization in Denton after a stint with the   , the Dallas News reports. \nWoods wrote a message on their receipt so they would know why she had made the gesture. \n“Happy Holidays from the very gay, very liberal table sitting next to you. Jesus made me this way,” she wrote, signing off with a heart and a p.s. reading, “Be accepting of your family.” \nYou know that “Happy Holidays” alone probably rankled them. \nWoods shared a picture of the receipt with her message written across it and it quickly began to go viral. \nShe told The Huffington Post that experiences like this one show that when it comes to LGBTQ rights “that fight is long [from] over.” \n“It’s time myself and the people of this country defend each other, defend minorities, defend people of all races and religions,” Woods said. “Sometimes it starts with small acts of love, sometimes it’s protesting in the streets, voting, lobbying, or running for a local office.” \nShe hopes others will take inspiration from her story and “continue the message of love.”",

Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez, the officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, 2016, in Falcon Heights, Minn., has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. (Christian Dobratz via AP, File) Related Coverage Milwaukee police chief was surprised by violence after fatal shooting \nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Prosecutors say that when Philando Castile was pulled over in July, he calmly told the officer he had a gun and was licensed to carry it. FILE – In this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor’s residence where protesters continue to demonstrate in St. Paul, Minn., against the July 6 shooting death of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn. Prosecutors announced Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016, that Yanez has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the killing. (AP Photo/Jim Mone, File) \nMoments later, the officer fired shots, and a bleeding Castile’s last words were: “I wasn’t reaching for it.” \nOn Wednesday, that officer was charged with second-degree manslaughter following an investigation by prosecutors, who concluded that Jeronimo Yanez was wrong to use his weapon in the traffic stop, which was seen by millions after Castile’s girlfriend streamed his final gruesome moments live on Facebook. \n“No reasonable officer, knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time, would’ve used deadly force under these circumstances,” Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said. \nProsecutors believe Castile never tried to pull his handgun from his pocket, and Yanez’s unreasonable fear did not justify the shooting, Choi said. \nIf convicted, the officer could face up to 10 years in prison. \nDiamond Reynolds was sitting next to her boyfriend in the car. She said he was shot repeatedly as he reached for his ID after telling Yanez about the weapon and the gun permit. \nThe fatal shootings of black men and boys by police officers have come under heightened scrutiny since the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. No charges were filed against the officer in that case, but Brown’s death led to calls nationwide for officers to be held criminally responsible. \nYanez, who worked in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, was scheduled to make his first court appearance Friday. \nHis attorney, Tom Kelly, has said Yanez, who is Latino, was reacting to the presence of a gun. Kelly has also said that one reason Yanez made the stop was because he thought Castile looked like a possible match for an armed robbery suspect. \nChoi said Wednesday that Castile was not a suspect in that robbery. Castile’s relatives have said they believe the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker was racially profiled. \nKelly did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment Wednesday. Castile’s mother, Valerie Castile, said her family was pleased with the charge. \n“It is necessary for everyone to understand that we want peace,” she said. “We don’t want any protests to get outrageous.” \nCastile’s shooting prompted numerous protests, including a demonstration outside the governor’s mansion that went on for weeks and one protest that shut down Interstate 94 in St. Paul for hours. The interstate protest resulted in about 50 arrests and injuries to more than 20 officers who were hit with cement chunks, bottles, rocks and other objects. \nAbout 100 protesters gathered early Wednesday evening outside the JJ Hill Montessori School in St. Paul where Castile was a longtime cafeteria worker. Some carried signs that read “No Justice, No Peace” and “Black Lives Matter.” The group said they would continue to advocate for justice until the case is resolved. \n“We haven’t won the war, but we won a battle,” activist Loretta VanPelt told the crowd. \nChoi resisted pressure to turn the case over to a special prosecutor, but he added one to his team to get an outside perspective. He said Wednesday that he reviewed the case himself instead of sending it to a grand jury in the interest of transparency. \nHe gave a detailed account of the shooting, describing a routine traffic stop that turned frantic after Castile told the officer he was carrying a gun. He was not required to do so by law. \nYanez had his hand on his holster before Castile could finish his sentence and repeatedly shouted “Don’t pull it out” as Castile insisted he wasn’t, Choi said. \nWithin a minute of the initial stop, Yanez unholstered his gun and fired seven shots at Castile. \nThere was no sign Castile reached for a gun or posed any threat, Choi said. \nYanez’s partner at the scene did not take out his own gun. Castile’s weapon was later found deep in a front pocket of his shorts, with a loaded magazine but no bullet in the chamber. \n“His dying words were in protest that he wasn’t reaching for his gun,” Choi said. “There simply was no objective threat posed to officer Yanez.” \nSquad car video captured the entire event, including audio and subsequent conversations Yanez had with other officers, Choi said. Prosecutors have no plans to release the video at this time because it is evidence in the case against Yanez. \nReynolds and her attorney recalled how quickly she pulled out her phone and began streaming, saying the video was a factor in Choi’s decision. \n“Without my recording,” she said, “we wouldn’t be here today.” ",

      "text": "Simone Biles Opens Up About Being Body Shamed By a Coach By Facebook PHOTO: Getty Images \nSimone Biles is a four-time Olympic gold medalist—and basically, an American hero—but even she has had low points in her storied career as a gymnast. Biles just got real about one of the tougher moments she endured as an athlete: When a coach criticized her weight at a meet. \nBiles opens up about being body shamed in her new book, Courages to Soar: A Body in Motion, A Life in Balance , and in an appearance on the Today Show , Hoda Kotb brought up the incident, which occurred in 2013 at a competition in which Biles wasn't performing as well as she'd hoped. \n\"You overheard a coach say, 'You know why she crashed? Because she’s too fat—that’s why. How does she expect to compete like that?'\" Kotb said, quoting Biles' words in her book. \nBiles said that after hearing the comment, she needed to take a moment to herself. \"I dismissed myself from the floor so nobody could see me, and I walked to the back behind the curtains and I was crying,\" she said. \nBut Biles being Biles, she managed to turn things around and use the experience as motivation to keep working toward her goals. \n\"Martha [Karolyi, USA gymnastics national team coordinator] pulled me back on the floor, and she gave me a little bit of a pep talk and was like, 'See, you can’t train like this and let the results show,'\" Biles said. \"So I went back to the gym and I did as told. Her pep talk kind of gave me a little bit of an up rather than a down...it felt good to hear her because I was terrified she was going to be upset with me.\" \nBiles later told People that all of her Final Five Olympic teammates have endured similar instances of body shaming, but they're all living proof that women of unique body types have the ability to be the best in their sport. \n\"It's hard growing up in a sport where you compete with very little clothing on your body and everyone is staring at [your body] no matter how good you are,\" she said. \"No matter how good you are at the sport, people will always say you don’t look good enough .\" \nBut leave it Biles to rise above the haters and love the body she has. Of course, we'd expect nothing less from the woman whose words to live by are: \"I'd rather regret the risk that didn’t work out than the chances I didn't take at all.\"",

She was working on a project in class at Virginia State University when she was told by a professor that she had to do more with her idea. \nTwo years later, Eastman is almost done creating a movie that portrays an actual incident post-Revolutionary War, including a slave uprising that happened in Dinwiddie back in 1781. \n\"The name of the film is 'Insurrection,'\" said Eastman said. \nInsurrection means a violent uprising against an authority or government, which you will see in this movie, among other twists and turns. \n\"It is a film about survival,\" Eastman said. \"You will see some people doing bad things because that was required in order to survive. It is a film that shows every white person in the south and many white people were helping the slaves and were against slavery all together.\" \nEastman has cast mostly area residents including many Petersburg students and a Caroline man named Greg Divers who has appeared in films and TV shows such as Netflix’s \"House of Cards.\" Tony Rotherham, a British actor, flew to America to participate too. \n\"It's going to take people through a whole range of emotions,\" said Rotherham. \"I mean we've got some comedy in there and some real dark stuff in there as well.\" \nThe actors film almost every weekend. They hope the film will be released in the fall of 2017 at Virginia State University, where the original idea was sparked. \nEastman says she received a $7,000 stipend, but the majority of this film she paid for out of pocket. \nFor more information on the film, click here to visit their Facebook page. \nCopyright 2016 WWBT NBC12 .

After Child Protective Services showed up at the school to investigate allegations of a romantic relationship, she terminated the pregnancy.\nVera is the daughter of a former Houston police officer, Jaime Vera . \nAccording to the Texas Observer, her father was fired by the police department in 2011 after a 13-year career dotted with infractions – from sexually assaulting a fellow female officer to sexual harassment to paying off mechanics to pass the inspection of his car.\nJ.T.  is currently in foster care, ABC-13 reported.\nA pre-sentence investigation hearing is scheduled for January.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram",

      "text": "The other day on Facebook, a friend wrote a post reminding everyone that we can’t change minds with vitriol. If we want to change minds, we have to change the way we dialogue about issues we care about.\nHere’s how I responded: \nI’m not sure anyone is even trying to change minds. People on both sides are just using social media for their own personal pressure valves. \nThey want their pain and rage validated and social media makes that easier.\nThis crisis isn’t about not knowing how to talk. It’s about not knowing how to cope with fear, anxiety, rage, and grief.\nMany are blaming social media for the negativity, divisive messaging, hate spreading and fear mongering. Of course, these are all things that are found in social media but that isn’t the problem we’re trying to solve.\nPeople are raging. People are grieving. \nAmericans on both sides are being attacked. Yes, they are using social media to point fingers, name call, and end friendships but social media is only the mechanism, not the problem.\nThe real problem that no one is talking about is how to cope when you’re scared, raging, and grieving. \nThat’s the discussion we need to be having. Unless we set personal boundaries with how we are using, participating in, and absorbing social media, it will only fuel our rage and sorrow.\nSome people are not ready to calm down. \nThis is the other thing that I wanted to say to my friend. Some people don’t want to be calm. They only feel heard when they yell. By raging, they believe in their core that they are putting themselves in some semblance of control. They are doing something about the thing that is causing them so much pain and strife.\nThey are advocating, educating, and informing. They are refusing to stay down.\nSome people really will find peace and a sense of belonging and community by rallying with like- minded people on social media.\nIf you are finding a way through your rage and grief with this public processing, keep doing it. Keep taking care of yourself and doing what feels better. If you find your respite on social media, don’t try to change that.\nYou get to make that choice.\nEvery social media site has unblocking and unfollow features. Use them. \nIf social media isn’t helping you heal, it’s time to step away.\nIf it’s not working for you, that’s ok and understandable but you can’t expect other people to change.\nI hate asking an already traumatized person to do more but unfortunately, that is what’s necessary here.\nIf social media is only fueling and expanding your upset, it might be time to step away. \nIf you’re stuck in grief, fear, and sadness, it is highly unlikely that social media is your friend right now. You will only be further triggered. It’s time to take a step back.\nSocial media is not intended to be an outlet or coping resource for grief and trauma. \nThat’s why it isn’t working for you.\nReach out to a safe person who shares your worries and concerns and work on connecting with them in real life. Have a cup of coffee, chat on the phone, Facetime. Connect with people that care about your and care about your well-being. Drink plenty of water. I almost nauseate myself offering that advice but it’s true. Your system is literally and physically depressed. It’s being taxed by the weight of the world on your mind. Water hydrates you and will help your body function more optimally. Look for the entertainment that offers respite -an old favorite movie, your favorite song, a good book, an activity or hobby you enjoy. Work on getting your body out of fight or flight mode. Social media has a way of keeping us amped and our adrenaline is constantly on standby. In order to back down and away from that, it’s important that you secure your sense of safety in your physical environment. Give yourself permission to do whatever you need to do to feel safe. Be aware of re-traumatization. My clients who’ve suffered abuse, rape, molestation, bullying, or other forms of abuse are feeling greatly triggered. Some understand why but others are feeling like they took a gigantic step backwards. Recognize that even though something isn’t physically happening to you right now, you are being brought back to the emotional place of trauma. That is real. Respect it and take good care of yourself. ____\nPut time limits on new information . Not knowing can almost be scarier than knowing too much. It makes you feel out of control. Choose reliable and dependable sources for your news and schedule two twenty minute blocks in your day to check the news. Make sure one of those times is more than two hours before bedtime. Pay attention to the content and quality of your texting exchanges. If your text messaging represents your Facebook feed, you might need to back off and limit your participation with people who don’t build you up or make you stronger. Don’t be afraid or hesitant to seek professional help . My phone has been ringing off the hook for the past week and the precipitating factor has been the election. Don’t minimize your upset. Recognize it and take care of it. Set boundaries with people in your real life about how often or when you discuss distressing topics. Protect yourself from needless trauma. ____\nFind a healthy way to take control. Raging at the internet might feel helpful and like you are informing people and creating change and that is sometimes true. Often, though, it is not. Decide what your role is going to be in all of this. Withdrawing yourself completely and not doing anything is an acceptable answer. All of these complicated intense feelings create energy inside of you. It’s there and unavoidable. You can use energy to release some of that energy. You don’t have to do anything crazy or intense if that’s not your thing. A quick walk could do you some good. Use your words or images. Talk, journal, use an audio recorder, or escape into your art. Not everything needs to be problem solved. Some things just need to be expressed. Limit all of the ways you take yourself back to the scene of the crime. Any exposure that is going to amp you up again needs to be planned and monitored. You can’t avoid the news for four years but you can avoid looking for it, seeking it out, and involving yourself when it’s in front of you. ____\nGive yourself time. The election prompted this post but trauma is trauma. When a trauma happens, it is normal to have a reaction and for it to take some time to settle in and find your new normal or peace. Be patient with yourself. Look for the good. It’s normal when you are in pain to seek people and messages that resonate with pain. However, healing pain, working through grief, and calming rage is easier when you learn to hold both—the darkness and the light. Right now, it feels like the darkness is all around you. Look for the light, the helpers, the healers, and things that make you feel bigger instead of smaller. Have a re-entry plan. If you decide to go back to social media, go back with a plan. Tailor your feeds so you only see messages that support your healing, block people who don’t offer you light, put time limits on yourself, and always check in with yourself about whether or not social media participation is healing or hurting. Regulate accordingly.  \nSocial media isn’t the real problem. \nThe real problem is more complicated. People are in agony. They are hurting, frightened, and scared. That’s real and it needs to be respected and attended to. No viral post is capable of doing that kind of heavy lifting.\nNeed help finding your way toward healing?

      "text": "‘It was a good day’: Facebook’s Carolyn Everson on metric miscalculation & transparency By Doug Zanger - 17 November 2016 15:38pm Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions \nFor most people, a day like the one Facebook had yesterday could be considered rough. After revealing that more metrics were miscalculated, on the heels of August’s revelation that the company had been overstating video views, one could be excused for not being in good humor. However, Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, doesn’t see it that way. \n“Believe it or not, it was a good day, from my perspective,” said Everson. “I think what we demonstrated was a level of commitment and rigor that I was really proud of. I am the first one to say I do not like mistakes. We had one in August. That was, in my view, something we looked at as a learning opportunity. What could we have done better? The answer is not, ‘never make a mistake again,’ because that's just not realistic. Consumer behavior keeps changing. We have new products. What is really important is to learn when you do make mistakes.” \nIt stands to reason that Everson would approach the situation this way as candor is one of her calling cards. On the stages of Advertising Week back in September, Everson put that particular measurement elephant in the room, addressing the news that the company had been overstating video views . \n“I think the lesson learned for all of us at Facebook, and perhaps in the industry, is that what we should have done a month ago is we should have just made it public that we had found this error, and that we had made the correction, and not just called our clients and agencies,” Everson said at the time. \nIt’s easy to armchair quarterback not being in the thick of the action. Yes, the current state of affairs is not ideal for Facebook and companies and platforms certainly need to be held accountable, especially with advertising dollars. But yesterday, Facebook, and especially Everson, moved quickly and publicly to assuage concerns, announcing the formation of a “Measurement Council,” continued third-party verification and a metrics FYI blog post, offering up more clarity and communication on metrics and reporting. \nThough to some it seemed like a case of backpedalling or scrambling, the company, according to Everson, had much of what was announced moving forward long ago. \n“Some of what we announced had been in the works way earlier than August. Third-party verification — that started in the fall of 2015 when we launched with Moat, and we've been launching subsequent partners on video,” noted Everson. “(Yesterday) we announced Display, but we were committed to third-party verification a year ago. The measurement counsel was even in the works prior to August.” \nTwo words that seem to crop up in times like this are “confidence” and “trust.” Yesterday, Everson spent the day speaking with ad industry association and agency leaders, Facebook’s client counsel members and more. Overall, the feedback was generally positive, but she is not unrealistic on what’s ahead. \n“Of course I'm going to continue to evolve and improve. By no means am I resting on my word and saying, ‘Okay, I got a lot of positive feedback. Great. Check the box, we're done.’ Absolutely not. In my view we're never done,” said Everson. \nThe Facebook Measurement Council is one piece of the proverbial bridge between brands, agencies and the platform that has support from the likes of founding members Nestlé and Unilever. The former, in fact, appears to be deepening their ties to the platform as they ramp up their own aggressive e-commerce approach . \n“As a partner who works with Facebook a great deal, we’re really encouraged by this move – it underscores their commitment to transparency and third party measurement,” said Pete Blackshaw, Nestlé global head of digital & social media. “Across all online channels, we deeply value third party ad verification.” \nAdded Keith Weed, Unilever’s CMO, “We welcome Facebook’s move to create better standards in this fast-developing digital media industry, and these steps reinforce their commitment to this. At Unilever, we continue to encourage the entire industry to move towards greater transparency and more robust measurement. There is still much to be done, particularly in the areas of viewability and third party verification.” \nOne particularly vocal critic, Sir Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive , continues his rally cry for more third-party measurement saying that, in the case of Facebook, “Clearly it’s an example where the player and referees cannot be the same person or where you cannot mark your own homework.” \n“I agree with Martin that the player and the referee should be two different people,” said Everson. “Martin and I have been in contact. I don't disagree with him, and that's why we're committed to third-party verification. I think we had more work to do prior to the announcement today because it had only covered video. At the end of the day, I appreciate Martin, and frankly, any feedback we get from our most important clients and agencies. That's what makes our business better. Our client counsel has been giving feedback to myself and our engineering team and our measurement team for literally almost six years.” \nThe fact is, digital and technology will always be highly-complex, continually morphing targets of advertising success and derision. For every great “digital advertising performance\" story, there will likely always be counterweights questioning said performance. Additionally, the “traditionalists” could potentially emerge with an argument dispelling the power of digital. \n“Traditional media that's been around for, call it 70 plus years, has established metrics. The medium hasn't evolved as dramatically,” said Everson. “It’s certainly not as complex as the digital and mobile landscape. What I would say is I would go back to where is the consumer? That is the most important thing that drives client's business growth. The CMO has literally one word that they are maniacal about: growth. That's what I do day in and day out — is partner and advise CMOs. If I am the CMO I want to be where consumers are spending a significant amount of their time. There is no doubt that with 25% of consumer time in a mobile environment, this is an area where marketers need to be.” \n\"We are all dealing in a very complex world of multiple data streams and technology. Facebook wants and needs to create better standards and reinforce that commitment to produce better business outcomes for marketers,” said Bill Koenigsberg, President, CEO & Founder, Horizon Media. “This is a great model for transparency and can only serve to build better measurement solutions. They are listening to client needs always striving to do better and we applaud them for that.” \nFor her part, Everson acknowledges that time, combined with focused effort, is critical and that she and her team are in it for the long haul. \n“Is it completely clear on all of the measurements and how we should look at everything across different publishers? No. But is it evolving, is there a commitment to getting it right? Absolutely. It's going to take time,” said Everson. “I think that's the new world we're living in, and we're going to have to be comfortable that the rate of change is significant. What’s key is that I hold myself personally accountable and my team as well — and ask if we have the right moral compass in how we’re leading our business? If that moral compass is focused on driving business outcomes for clients, being as accurate as possible, as transparent as possible, and committed to real strong and ongoing communication, that's what's going to move this forward. It's not going to be ‘ta-da,’ one day we have it all figured out.” \nThis article is about: North America , Facebook , Sir Martin Sorrell , Keith Weed , Unilever , Nestle , Carolyn Everson , Advertising , Digital Advertising , Social Media , Digital , Technology Doug Zanger \nI am the North America editor for The Drum.

Remember the Ice Bucket Challenge? Imagine your friends doing live videos of dumping ice water on themselves to raise money for ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. \nFacebook made the announcements in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new \"social good\" team, aimed at creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them.

      "title": "The tech community’s civic responsibility to babysit Facebook",
      "text": "writing about product, UX, and tech 11 mins ago The tech community’s civic responsibility to babysit Facebook Since the election last Tuesday, many Americans have responded by protesting, volunteering, calling their representatives, and donating to civil rights organizations. For people in tech, let me add one more to that list: it is the tech community’s civic responsibility to monitor Facebook , as long as they continue to be a relevant and politically-influential company. Based on Mark Zuckerberg’s tepid response to the company’s role in the election, it’s clear they are either blind to how powerful their product has become, or have no incentive to care. There’s been plenty written about the topic, but at a high level: Facebook has gotten heat for allowing fake news to circulate heavily. Buzzfeed reported that fake news outperformed real news in the final three months of election season. 17 of the 20 top performing fake stories “were overtly pro-Donald Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton.” As a whole, they have over 160 million daily active users in the US, and 44% of people get their news from Facebook . Facebook has no shortage of money and resources, with $17 billion of advertising revenue coming in last year and over 14,000 employees to allocate as they wish. Of course, it’s a difficult problem to solve, but that’s why it’s important for us to continue the conversation and get Facebook to better recognize they have something to fix. There are a few groups of people who will be key: Facebook employees : it was encouraging to hear that several concerned and passionate Facebook employees are secretly meeting to find solutions to pitch to management (as awful as it is that they had to do it secretly). Tech journalists : they’ve done a tremendous job this past week on the topic. While it will be tempting for them to go back to reporting about funding rounds and Apple dongles, I hope that tech journalists will continue to put pressure on Facebook (and Google, Twitter, etc) to do good in the coming months and years. The rest of us : as users of Facebook, friends of Facebook employees, and readers of tech journalism, we’ll need to keep our eyes open and speak up. If nothing gets fixed, we should do what we can to spread the word about the platform and accept that the Facebook experiment has failed . Out of all the big tech companies, Facebook is the most well-positioned to connect people and bring truth and clarity into people’s understanding of the world. The problem is that nobody can say with certainty that Facebook will take care of the problem on their own. They’re getting way too much engagement and advertising money to care. Finally, it’s true that there’s no way to definitively know how much of an impact Facebook had on getting Donald Trump into office. But either way, we should put pressure on Facebook to align themselves with their own mission statement: Facebook’s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what’s going on in the world , and to share and express what matters to them. Citizens, government officials, and the media will have enough on their hands for the next four years in dealing with the Trump administration. My hope is that all of us in the tech community will do what we can to keep Facebook in check.",

      "text": "Do I Have to Argue with Buttheads on Facebook? Illustration by Liza Corsillo Twitter It’s Do I Have To? Practical advice for skeptical adults. \nFacebook: the tense Thanksgiving dinner of the Internet. You grew up with a lot of these kids, they’ve seen your bad haircuts, you’ve got shared history. Someone posts something universally appealing—sweet potato with caramelized pecans, a funny dog being funny—and you’re all like HAHHAAH, LOVE IT, together. Then, there was last week, and you’re like: WHO ARE YOU, HOW DO I KNOW YOU, HOW ARE WE RELATED ? \nI’m going to be honest with you straight up, I have a Facebook, but I don’t use Facebook. It’s like this peculiar bottle of rum someone gave me, like four years ago: it’s old, I never really wanted it anyway, I’m too unbothered to throw it away, and I don’t think about it unless someone else is like, let’s open up that thing . Correspondents I know who are actively reporting from the trenches of Facebook, say that people are unfriending each other right and left and getting sinus headaches about a man named Chipper, who was once simply a castmate from a high school production of Kiss Me Kate and is now—according to this particular Facebook correspondent—an integral enabler of a geopolitical criminal. The field reports follow a similar structure: I was mad! They got mad about that! Now I’m even more mad! Now they are unreasonably mad! Now we are no longer acquainted. It’s enough to make me want to open my rum. \nAdvice from someone wiser than I about Facebook: “Don’t unfriend, criticism and the other side keeps you sharp.” Creep and know thy enemy. \nThe past few years of posting links and provoking comments did not really have the intended results. Your earnest citation and workshopped response did not result in a healthy and curious population devoted to facts and truth, which in turn bolstered, gloriously-funded Internet journalism. Wish it had. \nSo, what should you do? I was reading, as one does, about organization and social movements. Marshall Ganz writes about being an influential leader among peers and talks about “house-meetings” as a super effective way to organize small groups within an existent social network. It relies on exchanges deepening through stronger ties. This happens when \"commitment to a shared future and the consequences of a shared past transform an exchange in a relationship.\" People you know gather, build trust, and share information. \nFacebook seems like it's big house meeting. It’s not. It's lots of house meetings. I think people have been very confused about which house meetings they are invited to. They see that a meeting is being held and they just barge into someone else’s house to talk about why they’re right. It’s not surprising that this makes people feel protective or resistant. When confronted with someone running into your house telling you you’re wrong, of course you want them to leave rather than listen. And Facebook makes it super easy to just delete, mute, and block. Now everyone’s boarded up their windows and is yelling from inside this scary splintered mess. \nLocation is everything. You know what’s also everything? Choosing the right tools. Facebook, it seems, wasn’t a tool that was well-deployed this last time around. Ganz also writes about the story of David and Goliath as a model (that’s the one where the naked statue beats a more skilled warrior by using rocks). If your enemy is really good with a weapon, you need to find a different weapon. It’s not going to work if you think you’ll just suddenly improve and get better at the existent weapon. Find different resources and leverage them. \nSo, don’t argue on Facebook. This goes against so many of my instincts! My impulse is that if you see something terrible, you should stand up against it. My impulse is that if you make a point, you should engage with people who disagree with it. But, it just doesn’t seem like anyone has changed anyone's mind on Facebook ever. You can plant seeds at your own house meeting and make your own house meeting welcoming and bright, but you can’t march into someone else’s. I don’t want to encourage silence. Just think about putting your opinions in the most strategic places. \nIf you find yourself in a Facebook fight, or if you find yourself wanting to pick one, ask them to take it offline. I know! I know, I know, that’s literally the worst. Sure. That’s maybe the point. If someone doesn’t want to show up about their opinion in person, maybe they will question something about their protective, self-interested, insular view point. Also by taking it offline, I am not making a euphemism for taking it outside. (I would love it if no one punched anyone ever again.) I know talking to people you disagree with can feel horrible. I, myself, have attended Thanksgivings. I’m going to one next week actually and I would love you to wish me luck and a bounty of fried vegetables and juicy poultry. I, in turn, wish that your Facebook feed be populated with good videos of dogs you know and productive conversation. \nAre you skeptical about whether you have to do something?

      "title": "Forget Fake News: This Is Facebook's Numbers-Related Real Problem",
      "text": "Markets Today Forget Fake News: This Is Facebook's Numbers-Related Real Problem The social-media company has come under fire for allowing faux information on its feeds. But another, little-noticed challenge is brewing. Shubhankar Adhikari Nov17,20162:38PMEST \nIn the wake of last week's U.S. elections, social-media giant Facebook ( FB ) has found itself in the midst of a firestorm, and its stock has been feeling the burn . \nFacebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . See how Cramer rates the stock here . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB ? Learn more now . \nAlthough a growing number of Americans have been turning to Facebook to get their daily news fix, a lot of the so-called news stories posted and propagated by the site's users aren't true. \nIn fact, many people are saying that President-elect Donald Trump's surprising win is in part due to the fake news stories posted on Facebook. \nAlthough a lot of the material published on Facebook is either biased or incorrect, it must be remembered that the site isn't The New York Times. Accuracy and fact-checking are neither Facebook's strengths nor requirements. \nInstead, there is a larger, more worrisome challenge facing Facebook and its investors: The company is having difficulty accurately reporting its metrics. \nOn Wednesday, the company admitted to ignoring several faults in how it has reported its metrics to advertisers and partners. \nAnd this wasn't the first time. \nFacebook reportedly discovered three months ago that its report quantifying video viewership hours on its site was also incorrect. \nNow Facebook has said that it overstated how long users spent reading its \"Instant Articles\" and the kind of traction that business pages received on Facebook.

      "text": "Fake News on Facebook? In Foreign Elections, That’s Not New. By PAUL MOZUR and MARK SCOTT NOV. 17, 2016 Continue reading the main story Photo An Internet cafe in Manila. The Philippines is one of Facebook’s fastest-growing markets. Credit Jay Directo/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images HONG KONG — Facebook rumors force a well-known politician to publish proof of his heritage. Fake images show a prominent female leader in a hangman’s noose. A politician’s aide decries violent crime with a Facebook photo of a girl’s corpse — an image that turns out to come from another country. Another day on social media for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump? Think again. Those incidents took place in Indonesia and the Philippines, where social media’s outsize place in politics is widely acknowledged, even as that role is coming under sharper criticism in the United States. Well before last week’s American election threw Facebook’s status as a digital-era news source into the spotlight, leaders, advocacy groups and minorities worldwide have contended with an onslaught of online misinformation and abuse that have had real-world political repercussions. And for years, the social network did little to clamp down on the false news. Now Facebook, Google and others have begun to take steps to curb the trend, but some outside the United States say the move is too late. “They should have done this way earlier,” said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in the Philippines, one of Facebook’s fastest-growing markets. “We already saw the warning signs of this years ago.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The impact of Facebook and other social media platforms on international elections is difficult to quantify. But Facebook’s global reach — roughly a quarter of the world’s population now has an account — is difficult to deny, political experts and academics say. Some governments are pushing back, sometimes with undemocratic consequences. In Germany, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, has said she is considering plans to force social networks to make public how they rank news online. Some African countries have banned the use of Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter before elections. Indonesia’s government has closed sites that it says promote fake news, though experts say some portals were also targeted for political reasons. Facebook said on Thursday that the social network was a place for people to stay informed and that what people saw in their news feed was overwhelmingly authentic. The Silicon Valley company previously denied that it failed to deal with misinformation and said it continues to monitor the social network so that it meets existing standards. “I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way — I think is a pretty crazy idea,” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, told a tech conference days after the American presidential election. “Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.” Facebook’s power is often stronger overseas than it is in the United States. In many developing countries with populations new to both democracy and social media, experts said, fake stories can be more widely believed. And in some of these countries, Facebook even offers free smartphone data connections to basic public online services, some news sites and Facebook itself — but limits access to broader sources that could help debunk fake news. One such place is the Philippines, where a spokesman for its populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, shared on Facebook an image of a corpse of a young girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer. Fact checkers later revealed that the photo had come from Brazil. Despite the debunking, proponents of Mr. Duterte’s bloody crackdown on reported drug dealers and addicts still cite the image in his defense, according to political analysts. Tens of thousands of Philippine Facebook users also recently shared a story claiming that NASA had voted Mr. Duterte “the best president in the solar system.” While many commenters on the Facebook post took it as a joke, some appeared to take it seriously. And an image of Leila de Lima, a local lawmaker and a critic of Mr. Duterte, depicted her facing a hangman’s noose . “Facebook hasn’t led to empowerment of the average citizen, but empowerment of professional propagandists, fringe elements and conspiracy theorists,” said Mr. Heydarian, the Philippines political analyst. “Voices that were lurking in the shadows are now at the center of the public discourse.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In Indonesia, where Facebook is so popular that some people confuse it with the broader internet, the service has considerable sway. When Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, was running for office in 2014, he was accused through social media of being a Chinese Christian and a communist — severe criticism in the deeply Islamic country. The Indonesian politician released his marriage certificate to prove he wasn’t Chinese and made a pilgrimage to Mecca just before voting. “The fake news had a very big impact in our campaign,” said Tubagus Ramadhan, who helped Mr. Widodo run his social media campaign during the election. The online misinformation has not been limited to elections. In Colombia, Facebook users widely shared a crudely altered photo of a pop singer, Juanes, wearing a T-shirt suggesting he opposed a peace deal with the country’s largest rebel group. On Twitter, Juanes denied it. Colombia’s voters narrowly rejected the deal in a referendum last month. Si tú me conocieras bien, sabrías que jamás apoyaría algo como esto. Esta imagen es un montaje descarado. pic.twitter.com/BYUooR1vhS — JUANES (@juanes) July 26, 2016 While Facebook has won plaudits for allowing people in disaster zones to tell friends and families they are safe, it has also been a conduit for dangerous rumors in those situations. At the height of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, a false message widely distributed in Sierra Leone on Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the social network, said bathing in hot water with salt would cure and prevent the spread of the virus. Even in long-established democracies like Germany, Spain and Italy, false news reports and hate speech on social media have whipped up grass-roots populist movements, which have often targeted the recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees, to garner wider electoral support. Now, many European politicians are questioning what role social media has had in deciding what voters can and cannot see. They also have forced social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google to sign up for voluntary — so far — standards to police hate speech online. In Germany, Ms. Merkel’s push to require American social network companies to publish how they rank news is intended to give voters greater control over what they read online. \nAdvertisement “Algorithms must be more transparent,” Ms. Merkel has said, “so that interested citizens are also aware of what actually happens with their own media behavior and that of others.” Other politicians, often in more recently established democracies, are going a step further. In some African countries, including Chad and Uganda, officials cite uncorroborated security threats and fears that false results could be shared online as reasons for shutting down social media ahead of elections. Christian Echle, director of the Sub-Sahara Africa media program at Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, a German political foundation, said such actions were heavy-handed and that social media had played a role in helping voters — many located far from urban centers — to gain access to much-needed information and interact with political candidates. But, he added, a growing amount of news shared through social media was either false or biased, making it difficult for people in these often fledgling democracies to know which news outlets to trust. “There’s a big, big threat — that social media will deepen existing gaps in these societies,” said Mr. Echle, who is based in Johannesburg. “People are still learning how to use social media, so many can easily fall for hoaxes.” \nPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong and Mark Scott from London.",

      "text": "United States Senator from California. On Facebook at: http://facebook.com/senatorfeinstein 2 days ago Stopping Sex Trafficking Sex trafficking is a $100 billion industry worldwide. Victims, many of whom are as young as 11-, 12- and 13-years old, face unspeakable horrors. They are abused mentally and physically, forced to take drugs, forbidden from going out in public and even denied food and water. California is a top destination state for sex-trafficking victims and our big cities are major hubs for moving girls throughout the state and around the world. That’s why combating sex-trafficking is one of my top priorities. We’ve recently taken significant steps forward to combat this heinous crime at the local, state and federal levels, and it’s important to take stock of the progress we’ve made and the work that remains. Last year, Congress passed the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act  — a major piece of legislation that garnered unanimous support in the Senate. Working with Republican colleagues, I was able to include two important provisions to encourage the prosecution of buyers to decrease demand and stop the advertising of juvenile victims on the Internet. Addressing these two areas is key to reducing sex trafficking. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, reports of child sex trafficking have increased eight-fold in just the past five years. High demand and the proliferation of Internet advertisements are the main reasons. With just a few clicks, buyers are anonymously connected to victims. These trafficking ads are incredibly profitable — generating millions of dollars for websites like Backpage.com and others. The first provision I drafted with Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) would help ensure buyers are held accountable for their actions and prosecuted. It makes buyers criminally liable for purchasing sex from trafficking victims, expands reporting on trafficking prosecutions and requires training for law enforcement officials on how to target and prosecute buyers. The second provision I put together with Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) makes it a crime for a person, including the owner of a website, to knowingly advertise a commercial sex act with a minor. Website owners would be much less likely to turn a blind eye to trafficking ads if they could be prosecuted for them. Since the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was signed into law, I’ve pushed the Justice Department to use these new legal tools and will continue to do so. The U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles — Eileen Decker — has shown real leadership in this area, prosecuting several buyers in the past year. One buyer — a 59-year-old man — was sentenced to nearly five years in prison. He lied to federal investigators about his conduct with a 16-year-old girl he met, and later advertised, on Backpage.com. Another area where we’ve seen progress is increased coordination between local, state and federal law enforcement. Three weeks ago, there was a nationwide operation led by the FBI to arrest buyers and traffickers and rescue victims — Operation Cross Country. That operation was very successful in the Bay Area. Nearly 40 local law enforcement organizations and victims’ service providers participated. Six underage victims and three adult victims were rescued. Fourteen traffickers and 83 buyers were arrested. Law enforcement collaboration also led to the recent arrest of Carl Ferrer, the CEO of Backpage.com, for various state felony offenses. The charges stem from Ferrer’s participation in profiting off the selling of young girls for sex on Backpage. California Attorney General Kamala Harris deserves a lot of credit for bringing these charges. In addition, Mr. Ferrer obstructed a Senate investigation into his company’s practices, opting to not comply with subpoena requests. It’s also encouraging that San Francisco is taking steps to increase penalties for buyers. The San Francisco Police Department is considering changing its protocols so all buyers arrested for purchasing sex will be booked in jail, rather than given citations at the scene. Citations are unlikely to deter these individuals from purchasing sex again, perpetuating the sky-high demand for victims. This policy change would bring San Francisco in line with Alameda County, which, under the leadership of District Attorney Nancy O’Malley, has cracked down on demand and helped survivors. I’ve worked with Nancy and Catholic Charities of the East Bay to address one of the biggest gaps in helping victims get their lives back: safe and stable housing. Without a roof over their heads, victims are much more likely to return to their traffickers. A safe house for child victims of sex trafficking, Claire’s House, will open in 2017. It will have around a dozen beds — there aren’t currently any beds reserved for trafficking victims in San Francisco or the East Bay. Survivors helped design the home to ensure it meets girls’ needs. They have also provided guidance on everything from program curricula to safety measures. Empowering survivors to help make progress on this issue is so important. Lastly, more must be done for trafficking victims abroad. For example, Yazidi women in Syria and Iraq have been subjected to unspeakable sexual violence by ISIL. It has been reported that ISIL uses a variety of Internet websites and apps to advertise these women — just like traffickers in the United States. That’s why I am working on legislation to ensure ISIL terrorists can’t use social media platforms to sell girls for sex. The bottom line is that thousands of young women are being sold every day for sex in the United States and around the world, and we have an obligation to end trafficking here and everywhere. ",

      "text": "11/17/16 03:28 pm EST . \nPeople who got their election news on Facebook might have been looking at more fake stories than real ones. \nBuzzFeed News concluded that the fake clickbait headlines hooked users more often than real headlines, after analyzing the last three months of campaign coverage. The report compared fake news from hoax sites and hyper-partisan blogs to legitimate new articles from 19 major news outlets, including the New York Times, Fox News and even CBS News, reports CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan. \nYou might have seen an article with the headline blaring “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President” on your Facebook feed in September. \nYou might have even shared the article or just clicked “like” or “wow” or made a comment. The problem is the story was false, joining the ranks of other fake, highly shared or liked articles, with headlines like “WikiLeaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS,” or “Hillary is Disqualified from Holding Any Federal Office.” \nBuzzFeed News said during the last three months of the presidential campaign, of the top 20 fake election-related articles on Facebook, all but three were all anti-Clinton or pro-Trump. And Facebook users engaged with them using a share, a like or a comment more than 8.7 million times. \nBut they engaged with the top 20 election-related stories from legitimate news outlets – both pro and con for each candidate – fewer than 7.4 million times.While campaigning for Hillary Clinton the day before the election, President Obama criticized how false information can spread on the social network.“As long as it’s on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it’s on social media, people start believing it. And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense,” the president said.According to Pew Research, 66 percent of Facebook users said they get news from the site. But at a tech conference last Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the issue. Zuckerberg dismissed the issue.“I think the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said.Zuckerberg said.But in a post a few days later, he acknowledged Facebook has begun to look into ways for the online community to flag hoaxes and fake news. \nStill, platforms like Facebook and Google could face legal hurdles in addressing the problem.“There’s legislation in this country that says if you are a platform, you are not liable for what people publish on you,” said Nick Thompson, editor of NewYorker.com. “However, if you start to edit what people publish on your platform, then your legal obligations increase.” \nAccording to experts, it’s difficult to filter out fake news in real time. But Facebook and Google have each announced new plans to prevent fake stories from spreading by restricting advertising with websites that spread fake content. \n© 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Police departments are again warning the public about the “Secret Sister” gift exchange scam. The scam is making the rounds on Facebook.\nIt was a problem one year ago .\nThe scam begins with a Facebook post asking you to buy a gift of $10 or more. You’re asked to add your name to a list. In exchange, the scam promises, you’ll receive 36 gifts.\nUniversity of South Florida mass communications instructor Kelli Burns knows all about the secret sister gift exchange. “I’ve seen it on Facebook. A couple of my friends are participating,” Burns said last year.\n“This is a typical pyramid scheme. We’re just seeing this on Facebook this time instead of the old way of using letters, and Facebook allows it to spread a lot faster,” she added.\nThe biggest problem with the post is it’s illegal. United States Post Office regulations are very clear about pyramid schemes, and these gifts are being sent through the mail.\nIt’s also problematic because your personal information is posted on Facebook. “It’s against Facebook’s terms of agreement. So there’s the potential that Facebook, if they got wind of this, could block your account,” Burns said.\n ",

      "text": "Why do we tremble, what do we fear? Share on Facebook #gobacktoafrica Racist graffiti found at a Minnesota high school, November 11, 2016 (YouTube) I recall my father reassuring his six-year-old son soon after the Holocaust that unlike European Jewry, that we will have advance warning. He believed that the first target of a turn towards racial cleansing in the United States would be the “schwartzes.” America’s blacks would be the Jew’s “canary in the mine.” Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Whether or not I found that convincing as a child I have long since understood that the Shoah was unexceptional against the backdrop of two thousand years of marginal Jewish survival in the Diaspora. Regardless whether it is American Muslims, Afro-Americans or whatever the composition of the racist-nativist list for future elimination, the Jews will certainly be on that list. In his 2014 Rosh Hashana greeting to an audience of Jews in government and the media Vice President Joe Biden was prescient in warning, “You understand in your bones that no matter how… deeply involved you are in the United States… there is really only one absolute guarantee, and that’s the state of Israel.” As do Jews in the United States today, so did Jews in Germany before 1938 describe that county “exceptional.” It may have taken this election to convince those among us who failed to accept the vice presidents warning that the Diaspora was, is and will remain dangerous for Jews, including us here in America. We cannot know the heart of Donald Trump regarding Jews. Certainly his feelings towards Israel appear to reflect the positive sentiment of a large segment of his evangelical base. But regarding Jews in the United States the Trump campaign has proven a magnet for Christian Identity and white supremacist groups from the Ku Klux Klan to the American Nazi Party. Trump chose as campaign manager Stephen Bannon, CEO of Brightbart News. Brightbart has taken on the role of media outlet for racist and nativist groups in the United States. And Bannon’s name was today floated as Trump’s choice for White House chief of staff, doorkeeper to the president in the White House. (Instead Trump named Bannon “chief strategist and senior counselor to the president”). While the Jews “canary in the mine” may not yet have died, clearly the atmosphere in the mine is increasingly toxic. Relevant to your professional network?

      "text": "  BARBARA ORTUTAY - Associated   \nNEW YORK (AP) - Facebook is offering new tools for charity fundraising, for marking yourself safe during a crisis and for helping others - or asking for help - after a natural disaster. \nThe social network made the announcements Thursday in New York at its Social Good Forum, a first-of-its-kind event it hopes to repeat in coming years. The company has dozens of engineers who work on its relatively new “social good” team creating tools for users to help their friends or the world around them. \n“The philosophy of everything we do at Facebook is that our community can teach us what we need to do,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video played at the event. “And our job is to learn as quickly as we can and keep on getting better and better.” \nUSER POWER? \nA tool called “safety check” lets Facebook users mark themselves safe during a crisis, whether that’s a natural disaster, bombing or something else. Once someone marks themselves safe, their friends are automatically notified that they have been accounted for. \nAt first, Facebook activated the tool in areas where disaster struck. Now, Facebook says it will stop its own activations, handing it off to users instead. How? When a lot of people are posting about an incident (stuff like “was that an earthquake?”), they might get a notification to let friends know they are OK, using safety check. If they do, they can invite other friends to do the same, and so on. \nDISASTER AID \nBeginning early next year, a tool called “community help” will let users offer and receive shelter, food or other types of help during crises. People have already been doing this on Facebook and Twitter, using hashtags such as #PorteOuverte (open door) after last year’s attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. \nBut it was often difficult to pair up. The new feature aims to streamline this. People will be able to select categories to get or offer help with, such as food and water, transportation, baby items or shelter. Once they do, they can use Facebook Messenger to arrange the details. \nCHARITY HELP \nFacebook started letting charities raise money directly through its platform over the summer. At the time, users could choose from 100 U.S. nonprofits. Now, that number is 750,000 and growing. People can also add donation buttons to their Facebook Live videos to raise money - but only for actual charities, not a dream vacation. \n ",

(Photo: David Bonfriend) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW THIS WEEK: “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” “Bleed For This,” “The Edge of Seventeen,” “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” “Moonlight,” “Sand Storm,” “The Take (Bastille Day)” \nThe Accountant \nR, 128 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence. \nBen Affleck, Anna Kendrick. An analyst in the Treasury Department is blackmailed into tracking down a number-cruncher for the underworld and eventually uncovers a solitary CPA with high-functioning autism who happens to be a very good shot. Flashback-heavy action pic directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Jane Got A Gun”), who knows a thing or two about making slick entertainment. The top-shelf supporting cast includes J.K. Simmons, Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow, Jean Smart and Jon Bernthal. (B) \nAMC 20 : 10:15, 3:45, 9:15 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:50 \nAlmost Christmas \nPG-13, 112 minutes. Profanity, mild violence, sexual humor, drug use . \nDanny Glover, Gabrielle Union. Bickering, grown siblings spend a long holiday week with their widower dad, who is hiding his plans for selling the family home in Alabama, in this rather predictable ensemble comedy-drama. At times it plays like a warm-fuzzy flick from the Hallmark Channel. But the cast is very game and there a few solid laughs served up with the inevitable burnt casserole. With JB Smoove, Jessie Usher, Kimberly Elise, Mo’Nique, Nicole Ari Parker, Keri Hilson and Omar Epps. Produced by FAMU alum Will Packer. (B-) \nAMC 20: 10:45 a.m., noon, 1:30, 2:45, 4:15, 5:30, 7, 8:15, 9:15, 11, 11:45 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:25, 3:25, 7:25, 10:20 \nArrival \nPG-13, 116 minutes. Profanity, scary special effects . \nAmy Adams, Jeremy Renner. A linguistics professor, who is still grieving over her dead daughter, is called in by the military to translate the language spoken by aliens who’ve landed some very big spaceships on Earth. The clock is running while the Chinese threaten to attack the outerspace visitors. Well-acted but very pretentious sci-fi snoozer directed by Denis Villeneuve (“Sicario”). With Forest Whitaker and Michael Stuhlbarg. (C+) \nAMC 20 : 10 a.m., 10:45 a.m., 12:45, 1:45, 3:45, 4:45, 6:45, 7:45, 9:45, 10:45 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:40, 3:40, 7:20, 10:10 \nBilly Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk \nR, 110 minutes. Profanity, was violence, sexual content, drug use. \nJoe Alwyn, Kristen Stewart. In 2004, a decorated hero returns to Texas from the war in Iraq to do a victory lap during a Dallas Cowboys football game when he is overcome with combat flashbacks. Directed by Ang Lee (“Brokeback Mountain,” “The Ice Storm”). With Chris Tucker, Vin Diesel, Tim Blake Nelson, Kellie Pickler and Steve Martin. Opened Friday. \nAMC 20: 11 a.m., 4:30, 10, 1:45, 7:15 \nBleed For This \nR, 116 minutes. Profanity, scary car crash, sexual content, nudity. \nMiles Teller, Aaron Eckhart.

Profanity, violence, suggestive humor, scary stuff, drug use . \nTyler Perry, Cassi Davis. An outspoken, no-nonsense matriarch is called in to keep an eye on her 17-year-old niece, who is determined to sneak away to a frat party on Halloween, and spends the night battling clowns and zombies. Horror-comedy written and sloppily directed by Perry, who also plays three roles. It’s a stupid-fun romp if you can ignore the preachy moral message that Perry hammers home. (B-) \nAMC 20 : 11:15 a.m., 2, 4:45, 7:30, 10:15 \nGovernor’s Square : 3:55, 10:30 \nDeepwater Horizon \nPG-13, 107 minutes. Profanity, violence, disturbing images, rumbling drill pipe. \nMark Wahlberg, Kate Hudson. In April 2010, as the mega-corporation BP pushes its employees to work faster on an iffy oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, a compromised drill pipe explodes and the crew members fight for their lives in the inferno. Director Peter Berg (“The Rundown,” “Hancock”) takes a hyper-realistic, grunt’s-eye view of an epic environmental disaster. With Kurt Russell, Kate Hudson, Trace Adkins, Gina Rodriguez and John Malkovich (trying out an over-boiled Cajun accent). (B-) \nMovies 8: 12:05, 2:25, 4:40, 7:15, 9:35 \nDoctor Strange \nPG-13, 115 minutes. Intense violence, vertigo-inducing special effects . \nBenedict Cumberbatch, Rachel McAdams. After a car crash causes severe nerve damage in his hands, a brilliant and arrogant neurosurgeon heads to the Far East seeking a cure and ends up as a superhero. Marvel Comics-based action pic directed by Scott Derrickson (“The Exorcism of Emily Rose”), who decided to mix the usual Marvel malarkey and overkill with all the special effects from “Inception.” With Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen (playing the evil villain, natch), Benedict Wong and Tilda Swinton. (C+) \nAMC 20 : 10:15 a.m., 11:30 a.m., noon, 2:15, 3, 3:45, 5, 6, 8, 9, 9:45, 11 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:45, 3:35, 6:55, 9:50 \nThe Edge of Seventeen \nR, 102 minutes. Profanity, frank sexual content, teen drinking. \nHailee Steinfeld, Hayden Szeto. An awkward junior in high school feels hurt and left out when her older brother begins dating her best friend. Coming-of-age comedy directed by Kelly Fremon Craig (“Post Grad”), who is obviously trying adapt the John Hughes (“Sixteen Candles”) vibe for contemporary times. With Woody Harrelson, Kyra Sedgwick and Blake Jenner. Opened Friday. \nAMC 20 : 11:45 a.m., 2:15, 5, 7:30, 10 \nGovernor’s Square : 1:15, 4:05, 7:15, 10 \nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them \nPG-13, 132 minutes. Action violence, scary special effects . \nEddie Redmayne, Colin Farrell. An egg-head wizard named Newt Scamander, who was expelled from Hogwarts School, arrives in New York City during 1926 with a magical satchel packed with strange creatures in this J.K.

Profanity, extreme violence, war gore galore, intense situation, racial slurs, bullying, smoking. \nAndrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn. An Army medic, a practicing Seventh-day Adventist who refuses to carry a rifle into combat, saves more than 70 comrades during the heat of battle on Okinawa during World War II. Based on a true story. Directed by Mel Gibson (“Braveheart,” “The Passion of the Christ,” “Apocalypto”), whose obsession with guts, blood and gore borders on a mental condition. Still, the story is a powerful one and Vaughn provides some much-needed comic relief as a drill sergeant. With Rachel Griffiths, Hugo Weaving, Teresa Palmer and Sam Worthington. (B+) \nAMC 20 : 11:15 a.m., 2:30, 5:45, 9 \nGovernor’s Square : 12:35, 3:50, 7:05, 10:05 \nHell or High Water \nR, 102 minutes.

After a mother’s death leaves the finance guys in charge of the family property, two grown brothers go on a bank-robbing spree across West Texas and it’s up to a time-tested lawman to bring them to justice in this flawlessly executed crime drama. With Jeff Bridges, who hands in his best acting role to date, Margaret Bowman and Amber Midthunder. Directed by David Mackenzie (“Starred Up”) who delivers what may be the best movie of the year. Don’t miss this one. (A) \nMovies 8 : 9:25 \nIsland of Lemurs: Madagascar 3D \nG, 40 minutes. Destructive humans with matches . \nAcademy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman narrates this story about the lemurs’ ancient past (they arrived on their island home more than 60 million years ago when the last of the dinosaurs were still around) and their uncertain future (the folks who live on Madagascar keep burning down the rain forests for farm land). But who can resist the wide-eyed, bouncy primates who look like they are dancing when they are running? Younger kids will eat it up. (B+) \nIMAX : 10 a.m. \nJack Reacher: Never Go Back \nPG-13, 118 minutes. Profanity, extreme violence, an ecstatic amount of fiery explosions. \nTom Cruise, Cobie Smulders. There are cover-ups and corrupt officers galore when a former military hero is falsely accused of murder, so he starts killing for real in this over-the-top, popcorn-munching action pic.

A by-the-rules principal and a new student, who is determined to break every rule in the code of conduct handbook, butt heads in many creative ways.

Second feature by writer-director and Florida State film school alum Barry Jenkins (“Medicine for Melancholy”). With André Holland and Janelle Monáe. \nAMC 20: 11:45 a.m., 2:30, 5:15, 8, 10:45 \nSand Storm \nNot rated, 87 minutes. Profanity, violence, smoking. \nLamis Ammar, Ruba Blal-Asfour. The modern world and the traditional ways collide during a family wedding in a Bedouin village in the Negev Desert when an 18-year-old daughter admits to her angry mom that she is in love with a classmate from another tribe. An authentic-feeling family drama that riffs on themes Shakespeare would recognize and admire. Written and directed by Elite Zexer, an Israeli filmmaker making her feature debut. Subtitled.

Violence, bathroom humor, issues of abandonment, scary snake . \nVoices of Louis C.K., Kevin Hart. Two talking dogs, who only speak when their owner is out of ear shot, must put aside their differences when they are attacked by alley cats, snatched by a dog-catcher and then whisked off into the sewers with a revolutionary rabbit who is at war with domestication. Despite all the commotion and overly busy plot leaps, it’s a rather ho-hum outing that squanders plenty of good chances. It longs for a bit of Pixar-style wit and magic. Also featuring the voices of Eric Stonestreet, Adam Sandler, Albert Brooks, Hannibal Buress, Lake Bell, Louis C.K., Steve Coogan, Dana Carvery and Laraine Newman. Co-directed by Chris Renaud (”Despicable Me”). (C) \nMovies 8 : 12:10, 2:30, 4:45, 6:55, 9:10 \nSuicide Squad \nPG-13, 130 minutes. Profanity, manic violence, rude humor, disturbing images, scary special effects. \nJared Leto, Margot Robbie. The government recruits infamous villains such as The Joker, Harley Quinn and Deadshot to go on a deadly mission to slaughter zombie-like creatures and fight a mysterious what-not. In the wake of the truly subversive “Deadpool,” this anti-superhero flick rings false. With Will Smith, Ben Affleck, Viola Davis, Common, Jesse Eisenberg, Tom Hardy, Adam Beach and Jai Courtney. Directed by David Ayer (“Fury,” “End of Watch”), whose hyperactive editing style and jumbled storytelling makes for a dull roar. (C) \nMovies 8: 12:15, 3, 6:50, 9:30 \nSully \nPG-13, 96 minutes. Profanity, intense situations, scary special effects. \nTom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart.

With Laura Linney, Katie Couric and Michael Rapaport. Directed by Clint Eastwood (“Bird,” “Unforgiven”), who is really more interested in a character study of the haunted pilot than making a disaster flick. (B) \nMovies 8 : 11:50 a.m., 2:10, 4:30, 7, 9:15 \nThe Take (Bastille Day) \nR, 92 minutes. Profanity, violence, car crashes, explosions galore, nudity . \nIdris Elba, Richard Madden.
