      "text": "Google’s “Live Cases” debuted on the Nexus 5X and 6P , since expanding to the Pixel and Pixel XL . To date, we’ve seen three main options for these customizable cases ─ photos, places, and artwork . However, it seems Verizon has jumped the gun a bit, showing us two new Live Cases that have yet to be announced. \nThese two new cases, “Earth” and “Trends,” are listed on Verizon’s website, each in two variants and both available for the 5-inch Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. \nThe “Earth” case shows satellite photos of portions of the planets, specifically a desert and the ocean. If the imagery looks familiar, you probably recognize it from last year’s Nexus smartphones where both images were pre-loaded as wallpapers. \nOn the other hand, the “Trends” case brings a simple gradient which is, at least in my opinion, pretty bland. The gray option goes from white to black, top to bottom. The orange option goes from a light orange tone to an almost hot pink color. \nJust like Google’s already available options, these cases offer light protection to the entire device while also offering a customizable button on the back which can perform a user-defined action such as toggling the flashlight. The case also sets the wallpaper on your device to match the case. \nVerizon lists these new cases as “coming soon,” but provides no further information. Pricing will likely fall at the same $40 that Google’s cases land at, and we also don’t know if these will show up on the Google Store, they very well could be exclusive to Verizon. Guides",

      "text": "0 new competition / options for Cricket prepaid It looks like Verizon prepaid is now offering a $50 plan with 5GB un-throttled LTE data, throttled to 128kbps beyond that, wifi hotspot included, data carryover to next month, and international messaging to 200 countries. They also have a 10gb for $70 plan with same features as well. http://www.verizon.com/about/news/ve...ven-more-value That makes these options fairly competitive compared to the Cricket plans for single lines... especially since it's full LTE data, and mobile hot spot is included, as well as VoLTE and wifi calling for the Verizon prepaid lines too. Hopefully this will cause Cricket to get VoLTE / wifi calling, and other features soon as well. Gotta love new competition and options! I think we should see a more competitive black friday offering from the MVNOs to try to woo customers, and we should win as customers.",

America's largest carrier just introduced two new prepaid data tiers, which are a great way to woo back some of the price-sensitive crowd. Don't get us wrong, it's still Big Red, so they aren't going crazy with discounts, but in addition to the current 3 GB for $45 and 6 GB for $60 options, Verizon is now offering 5 GB and 10 GB tiers, with perks: 5 GB for $50 — Unlimited talk and text in the U.S., Carryover Data with on-time payment, Mobile Hotspot, Always-On Data (128 kbps throttling after the high-speed allowance) and International Messaging to 200+ countries; 10 GB for $70 — Includes the same features, plus unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada. Not cheap, but considering there is no credit check and no contract, plus perks like LTE tethering and carryover data, it's a good deal, especially if you have your own device, or need some midrange burner to get you through a period. The new plans go live and in action starting November 13, that is why you won't be able to see them on Verizon's website just yet.",

      "title": "Verizon updates BlackBerry Priv to Android 6.0 Marshmallow",
      "text": "Reddit \nWhile the BlackBerry Passport may have been the company’s most popular smartphone by way of eccentricity, the Priv is arguably it’s most contentious because of how it represented the company’s full embrace of the Android platform. Still, it has had its fans, especially with its sliding keyboard, and BlackBerry hasn’t forgotten them, and neither has Verizon. Now months after rival AT&T did so, Verizon is finally pushing Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the BlackBerry Priv, along with some special features of its own. \nBy its lonesome self, Android Marshmallow already brings a suite of interesting new features and optimizations. Most prominent among those is the battery-saving Doze feature as well as fine-grained controls over app permissions. Now on Tap also makes its public debut here, but it’s a short-lived feature that will eventually be replaced by Google Assistant. Someday. \nOn its side, BlackBerry brings a host of new features together with the update. Like being able to swipe on the physical keyboard to type, just like you would on the virtual keyboard. There are updates to apps like Camera and the Home Screen as well as improved security via the DTEK app. \nFrom Verizon, the update includes support for Wi-Fi calling. This particular feature is useful in situations where you don’t have cellular coverage but are connected to a strong and stable Wi-Fi network. Verizon promises no extra charges to existing plans and that calling US numbers are free, even if you’re calling from outside the US. \nThe update is already rolling out to Verizon subscribers. BlackBerry Priv owners should ensure that they’re on a stable Wi-Fi connection and that their batteries are fully charged before starting the upgrade process. Backups are, of course, recommended. Once the update is done, users can head over to the Advanced Calling options in the Settings app to enable HD Voice and Wi-Fi Calling.",

      "text": "11/08/16 AT 6:49 AM Close \nVerizon introduced two new prepaid plans Monday, and starting Nov. 13, customers can choose from the 5GB and 10GB plans. \n“People who choose Verizon’s prepaid service already enjoy the best value in the industry,” Rob Miller, vice president for consumer pricing at Verizon, said in the official press release . “The introduction of these new plans now gives you even more data to enjoy all that the next gen network has to offer.” \nThe 5GB plan for $50 a month comes with unlimited voice calls and text messages within the U.S., always-on data that carries over to the next month and free international messaging to more than 200 countries. Related Stories Comcast To Launch Cellular Service In Mid-2017 \nThe 10GB plan for $70 a month comes with the same features as the 5GB plan, but other than double the data, the extra $20 also gives you unlimited calls to Mexico and Canada. \nVerizon’s existing prepaid plans include a 6GB plan for $60 per month and a 3GB plan for $45 per month, both of which come with AutoPay and a $30 per month Wi-Fi only option. All of the company’s prepaid plans will be available for recently launched phones such as iPhone 7, Google Pixel and Moto Z. \nThe company is trying to win customers back after a negative third quarter in 2016 , during which it lost 36,000 subscribers, leading to a revenue hit of 6.7 percent.

      "text": "  09:00 AM EST Digi LTE Routers Certified for Verizon's Private Network Traffic Management Solution \nMINNETONKA, Minn. , Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Digi International®, ( NASDAQ: DGII , www.digi.com ), a leading global provider of machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services, today announced that multiple models of its Digi TransPort® product line have been certified to operate with Verizon's 4G LTE Private Network Traffic Management solution, having achieved technical acceptance from Verizon's Solutions Lab. \nVerizon Private Network Traffic Management (PNTM) is an enhancement to the 4G LTE Private Network that provides a premium and differentiated network experience. It allows organizations to create IP traffic preferences for business-critical applications and to achieve more predictable application performance during times of peak network demand. \n\"With this certification, we're offering a powerful, pre-certified, enterprise-grade LTE router that takes advantage of all the benefits of the Verizon Private Network Traffic Management Solution,\" said Joel Young , chief technology officer, Digi International. \"Together, organizations that rely on mission-critical communications in both business and government can achieve the benefit of priority access.\" \nPrivate Network Traffic Management relies on three core LTE network pillars to provide more predictable application performance during heavy network utilization: traffic priority (a support structure on how packets are treated within the 4G LTE Private Network), admission priority (a framework to allocate and retain network resources during heavy network utilization) and access priority (provides the network mechanism to allocate radio resources to a subscriber during heavy network utilization). In order to receive certification, Verizon requires that the 4G LTE device be capable of performing Private Network Traffic Management functionality only on the LTE access technology, should support network-initiated Quality-of-Service (QoS) for both default and dedicated bearer using the 3GPP standard and should route IP packets to the dedicated bearer based on TFT information provided by the Verizon Wireless network. \nDigi TransPort enterprise LTE routers that have been certified include the WR21, WR31, WR44, WR44R, and WR44RR. Digi TransPort routers are rugged, versatile enterprise LTE routers built for critical applications operating in harsh environments and feature advanced security and monitoring and the intelligence to operate on nearly any 3G or 4G LTE network in the world. Designed for critical infrastructure environments, Digi TransPort routers address industries that manage a large number of remote assets installed in challenging environments where onsite visits are infrequent or impractical. In addition, by supporting global HSPA+ and 4G LTE networks, the Digi TransPort product line provides customers the flexibility to future-proof their router installation as wireless network requirements evolve. \nFor more information on Digi TransPort visit http://www.digi.com/products/digi-transport . \nAbout Digi International Digi International ( NASDAQ: DGII ) is a leading global provider of business and mission-critical machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services.

      "text": "svenska Digi LTE Routers Certified for Verizon's Private Network Traffic Management Solution Digi TransPort® Routers Fully Certified for Verizon's Solution Optimized for Quality of Service for 4G LTE Private Network Subscribers  00   MINNETONKA, Minn. , Nov. 8,   Digi International®, (NASDAQ: DGII, www.digi.com ), a leading global provider of machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services, today announced that multiple models of its Digi TransPort® product line have been certified to operate with Verizon's 4G LTE Private Network Traffic Management solution, having achieved technical acceptance from Verizon's Solutions Lab. Verizon Private Network Traffic Management (PNTM) is an enhancement to the 4G LTE Private Network that provides a premium and differentiated network experience. It allows organizations to create IP traffic preferences for business-critical applications and to achieve more predictable application performance during times of peak network demand. \"With this certification, we're offering a powerful, pre-certified, enterprise-grade LTE router that takes advantage of all the benefits of the Verizon Private Network Traffic Management Solution,\" said Joel Young , chief technology officer, Digi International. \"Together, organizations that rely on mission-critical communications in both business and government can achieve the benefit of priority access.\" Private Network Traffic Management relies on three core LTE network pillars to provide more predictable application performance during heavy network utilization: traffic priority (a support structure on how packets are treated within the 4G LTE Private Network), admission priority (a framework to allocate and retain network resources during heavy network utilization) and access priority (provides the network mechanism to allocate radio resources to a subscriber during heavy network utilization). In order to receive certification, Verizon requires that the 4G LTE device be capable of performing Private Network Traffic Management functionality only on the LTE access technology, should support network-initiated Quality-of-Service (QoS) for both default and dedicated bearer using the 3GPP standard and should route IP packets to the dedicated bearer based on TFT information provided by the Verizon Wireless network. Digi TransPort enterprise LTE routers that have been certified include the WR21, WR31, WR44, WR44R, and WR44RR. Digi TransPort routers are rugged, versatile enterprise LTE routers built for critical applications operating in harsh environments and feature advanced security and monitoring and the intelligence to operate on nearly any 3G or 4G LTE network in the world. Designed for critical infrastructure environments, Digi TransPort routers address industries that manage a large number of remote assets installed in challenging environments where onsite visits are infrequent or impractical. In addition, by supporting global HSPA+ and 4G LTE networks, the Digi TransPort product line provides customers the flexibility to future-proof their router installation as wireless network requirements evolve.

      "text": "Verizon is making a few changes to its prepaid plans in an attempt to compete with its rivals. Most notably, the company is adding two new plans to its prepaid offerings, one that gives customers 5GB of data and another that offers 10GB.\nThe new plans will be available starting November 13, and they’ll cost $50 for the 5GB plan and $70 for the 10GB plan. Both include many of the same features, but the more expensive plan offers unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada.\nRelated: Verizon finally pushes Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the BlackBerry Priv\nOf course, these plans aren’t the only ones available from Verizon, which also offers 6GB of data for $60 per month, as well as 3GB for $45 per month. There’s also a $30 per month Wi-Fi-only option.\n“People who choose Verizon’s prepaid service already enjoy the best value in the industry,” said Verizon vice president of consumer pricing for Verizon. “The introduction of these new plans now gives you even more data to enjoy all that the next-gen network has to offer.”\nConsumers are increasingly turning to prepaid options over postpaid plans because it gives them a lot more flexibility to change plans or switch to another carrier if they so choose. While at one time you would have had to buy a phone outright to use on a prepaid plan, these days most carriers offer phone financing — so while you may not be locked into a contract with the company, you will have to pay off your phone before you can leave the carrier.\nYou can also use a range of different handsets with Verizon’s prepaid plans, as long as they’re compatible with Verizon’s network. Those include the new Google Pixel, and the Moto Z, both of which were exclusive to Verizon when they were launched.\nVerizon withdraws the lightest of its monthly prepaid plans Family is where the heart/discounts are, thanks to new AT&T prepaid plans Should you upgrade to T-Mobile’s One or One Plus plans?

      "title": "Verizon Moves In on WeWork Territory",
      "text": "Verizon Moves In on WeWork Territory November 08, 2016, 09:02:  By Peter Grant \nWatch out WeWork Cos. -- here comes Verizon Communications Inc. \nThe telecommunications giant, an offshoot of the original Ma Bell with roots dating back almost 140 years, is trying to tap into the technology startup world by embracing \"co-working,\" a real-estate strategy that is all the rage among young people. \nThe New York facility is being run as a business with Grind, an operator of co-working spaces similar to WeWork, the leader in the business. \nLaunched in 2010, WeWork now has facilities in more than 30 cities in a dozen countries. Its co-working model: Lease long-term office space, update it with hip furnishings and communal perks like espresso and beer, and rent out the space to individuals and small companies not yet ready to sign big property leases. \nThe customers like the opportunities for networking and collaboration -- and WeWork earns money on the markup between the space it leases and the space it rents out. \nVerizon's main goal isn't about profit, but rather to connect to the startup and tech worlds by leasing surplus space it owns to entrepreneurs and small businesses. Verizon wants to stay \"engaged in the [tech] community to see what's going on,\" said John Vazquez, the company's head of real estate. \"It's about creativity that we get to advise and mentor.\" \nVerizon isn't the only old-economy company exploring the potential of the latest trend in office space. On Chicago's north side, Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm Insurance is operating a 4,000-square-foot facility that offers co-working space free as well as financial coaching and classes on such subjects as entrepreneurship and retirement planning. \nSome big corporations like General Electric Co. and KPMG LLP have taken WeWork space to expose workers to what could be a more creative and inspiring work environment than their nine-to-five offices. \nAt the same time, some big tech companies are offering free co-working spaces as places to promote their products to startups and tech companies. For example, Amazon.com Inc. has opened free facilities in New York, San Francisco and Munich primarily to promote Amazon Web Services, the tech giant's cloud-computing business. \nThe so-called AWS Pop-up Loft in New York has a terrace with a ping-pong table and provides free candy, cereal and drinks. Amazon employees staff the facilities, give classes and provide visitors advice on its Web Services product. No purchases are necessary. \nLikewise, a facility named \"Cadillac House\" opened on the ground floor of the car company's new global headquarters in New York earlier this year that includes free co-working space as well as a coffee shop, art exhibitions and other displays. On a recent Wednesday afternoon, it was packed with mostly young people working on laptops, meeting or checking out an art exhibit that features a welding robot similar to those on auto assembly lines coded to draw portraits of visitors. \nThese facilities -- both the ones that charge and the ones that are free -- in part are a response to the changing workforce as more young people work for startups or start companies of their own. \n\"They're going to come here and put in their ear buds, but all of a sudden they're getting a sense of community they don't have when they're sitting at home on their couch,\" said Brett Myers, program director of State Farm's project which is named \"Next Door.\" \nOther telecommunications companies besides Verizon are exploring how to use co-working to stay on the vanguard of new technology. AT&T Inc. has an effort named \"Foundry\" that has rolled out six locations for startups and tech developers that are limited to people collaborating with AT&T on new products and services. \nSprint Corp. is doing something similar with its Sprint Accelerator program in a 20,000-square-foot space in Kansas City's trendy Crossroads neighborhood. The company has invited entrepreneurs to apply to participate in 90-day programs focusing on one topic, like mobile health care. \nThe idea is partly to develop new products, but also to help Sprint cultivate a more innovative culture and be more tuned into potentially \"disruptive\" new businesses, according to Kevin McGinnis, a Sprint vice president. \n\"There are a lot of smart people who are trying to figure out how to disrupt my industry,\" Mr. McGinnis said. \"I need to be closer to them.\" \nVerizon's downtown Manhattan facility is often visited by executives in the company's Verizon Ventures program who offer seminars, mentoring and explanations of the company's products and services. But the company takes a low-key sales approach, Mr. Vazquez said. \"It's not that the heavy hand of Verizon is there.\" \nMr. Vazquez pointed out that Verizon's co-working program benefits from the company's enormous holdings of real estate, much of it from the old Ma Bell days. Many industrial-style properties that used to hold equipment are located in parts of cities popular with tech businesses, making them perfect for co-working. \n\"It's a pretty cool juxtaposition of what was and what is,\" he said. \nWrite to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com  160902ET  ",

      "text": "BlackBerry PRIV software update now ready from Verizon Wireless By 0 \nVerizon recently made an announcement that another series of update is ready for the BlackBerry PRIV. It’s no longer the only Android-powered smartphone as the DTEK50 and DTEK60 have been announced already but the device remains to be its premium flagship Android model. The company has always been regular in releasing software updates. It’s the only group who keeps its promises that’s why it’s still high in reliability and privacy. \nMake sure you are connected to a WiFi network or to mobile Internet via Verizon’s network. Battery must also be full to start the download and installation. This version of the software specifically is the AAH376. This brings enhancements to your current Android 6.0 Marshmallow BlackBerry Priv including better app permissions and battery-smart functions. \nWiFi calling is also now available. You don’t need to pay extra just so you can use your number to receive and make calls even when outside the United States–specifically when you’re in Mexico. Just activate the WiFi Calling feature by going to the Settings> Advanced Calling > Activate Advanced Calling. There are also some updates for the Now on Tap, Runtime Permissions, Google Settings, and Blackberry Keyboard. \nWith the improved keyboard prediction engine, you can have a faster and better typing experience, let the device learn words with numbers, write emails more easily with name suggestions, and swipe across keys to enter new words on the keyboard.",

      "text": "BlackBerry Priv owners rejoice! BlackBerry has finally launched an Android 6.0 Marshmallow update for the Priv, set to roll out starting now. Carrier versions of the device will start getting the update May 3. More The Priv, BlackBerry’s first real stab at an Android-based phone, was updated to Android 6.0 Marshmallow way back in April, but it’s only now that Verizon is rolling out the update to its customers.\nThe original update was already a little overdue — in fact, the Priv launched a month after Android 6.0 Marshmallow was released. It took six months for customers to get a taste of Marshmallow on their BlackBerries, but only if they had GSM unlocked phones. T-Mobile and AT&T customers got the update in June and July, respectively. And now, four months later, Verizon has finally joined the party.\nRelated: BlackBerry CEO addresses story that Canadian police have its global encryption key\nUnfortunately, the Priv is one of not-too-many devices running Android 6.0. As of April 4, only 4.6 percent of Android devices were equipped with Marshmallow, highlighting how fragmented the Android ecosystem really is.\nSix months is quite a long time to push out an update, especially considering the fact that the Priv is BlackBerry’s only Android phone. HTC and Samsung flagships got an update for Marshmallow back in January or February, and some of LG’s phones got the update as far back as October.\nOf course, that doesn’t mean BlackBerry hasn’t been doing anything — the company has been doing great on Google’s security update program, which involves updating devices on a monthly basis to patch any security issues that might exist in the software. This is despite the fact that the Priv is running an older version of Android.\nMarshmallow brings a number of great features to the Priv, including user-controllable permissions, something that was ironically not present in the original Priv considering the fact that ‘Priv’ stands for privacy.\nThe update itself certainly took its sweet time being rolled out, and this may be one area in which T-Mobile reigned supreme over its competitors.\nArticle originally published in April. Updated on 11-07-2016 by Lulu Chang: Added news that Verizon has finally rolled out Marshmallow update.\nBlackBerry's DTEK60 is a security-focused smartphone for businesses, govenment Disappointing sales may spur Blackberry's exit from smartphone hardware market FEMA’s newly updated app helps you keep first responders in the loop",

      "text": "Tweet Share MINNETONKA, Minn., Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Digi International®, (NASDAQ: DGII, www.digi.com ), a leading global provider of machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services, today announced that multiple models of its Digi TransPort® product line have been certified to operate with Verizon's 4G LTE Private Network Traffic Management solution, having achieved technical acceptance from Verizon's Solutions Lab. Digi International logo More Verizon Private Network Traffic Management (PNTM) is an enhancement to the 4G LTE Private Network that provides a premium and differentiated network experience. It allows organizations to create IP traffic preferences for business-critical applications and to achieve more predictable application performance during times of peak network demand. \"With this certification, we're offering a powerful, pre-certified, enterprise-grade LTE router that takes advantage of all the benefits of the Verizon Private Network Traffic Management Solution,\" said Joel Young, chief technology officer, Digi International. \"Together, organizations that rely on mission-critical communications in both business and government can achieve the benefit of priority access.\" Private Network Traffic Management relies on three core LTE network pillars to provide more predictable application performance during heavy network utilization: traffic priority (a support structure on how packets are treated within the 4G LTE Private Network), admission priority (a framework to allocate and retain network resources during heavy network utilization) and access priority (provides the network mechanism to allocate radio resources to a subscriber during heavy network utilization). In order to receive certification, Verizon requires that the 4G LTE device be capable of performing Private Network Traffic Management functionality only on the LTE access technology, should support network-initiated Quality-of-Service (QoS) for both default and dedicated bearer using the 3GPP standard and should route IP packets to the dedicated bearer based on TFT information provided by the Verizon Wireless network. Digi TransPort enterprise LTE routers that have been certified include the WR21, WR31, WR44, WR44R, and WR44RR. Digi TransPort routers are rugged, versatile enterprise LTE routers built for critical applications operating in harsh environments and feature advanced security and monitoring and the intelligence to operate on nearly any 3G or 4G LTE network in the world. Designed for critical infrastructure environments, Digi TransPort routers address industries that manage a large number of remote assets installed in challenging environments where onsite visits are infrequent or impractical. In addition, by supporting global HSPA+ and 4G LTE networks, the Digi TransPort product line provides customers the flexibility to future-proof their router installation as wireless network requirements evolve.

      "text": "Verizon brings new 5GB, 10GB prepaid plans By 0 \nThe more options that people have with their carrier plans, the better. And Verizon has continued to expand their prepaid line by adding two more options for those who would prefer to not be tied to any long-term contracts, but would still like the benefits that subscribers can enjoy. By November 13, you can choose to have a 5GB plan for $50 a month or the 10GB plan for $70 a month. Data is probably the most important thing that mobile users are looking for now, along with value for money of course. \nThe 5GB prepaid plan brings you, aside from the 5GB of data, unlimited talk and text within the US plus international messaging to more than 200 countries. You also get carryover data if you do not get to use up all your data and if you pay on time. You can also use your device as a mobile hotspot and you can keep it Always On but at 128 kbps, it may affect the quality of streaming audio and video. \nMeanwhile, the 10GB plan will of course have the same features as the 5GB one, but with the addition of unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada. So if you have loved ones or business contacts over there, then this will be a good prepaid plan to have. And at just $20 more expensive, you get double the data. So if you usually consume more than 5GB a month, then this is something you should consider. \nVerizon’s other prepaid plans are the 6GB ($60) and 3GB ($45 autopay and $30 WiFi only) per month plans. All of these prepaid options come with HD Voice, video calls, calls over WiFi, 6-way calling and surfing while calling. You also get the option to get a smartphone, including Google Pixel and Motorola Moto Z, but of course you’d have to pay for it the full amount.",

      "text": "Verizon is adding a few new options for those interested in its prepaid plans -- a 5GB option and a 10GB option, which will cost $50 and $70 respectively. The plans should address growing interest in prepaid offerings. More Verizon is making a few changes to its prepaid plans in an attempt to compete with its rivals. Most notably, the company is adding two new plans to its prepaid offerings, one that gives customers 5GB of data and another that offers 10GB.\nThe new plans will be available starting November 13, and they’ll cost $50 for the 5GB plan and $70 for the 10GB plan. Both include many of the same features, but the more expensive plan offers unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada.\nRelated: Verizon finally pushes Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the BlackBerry Priv\nOf course, these plans aren’t the only ones available from Verizon, which also offers 6GB of data for $60 per month, as well as 3GB for $45 per month. There’s also a $30 per month Wi-Fi-only option.\n“People who choose Verizon’s prepaid service already enjoy the best value in the industry,” said Verizon vice president of consumer pricing for Verizon. “The introduction of these new plans now gives you even more data to enjoy all that the next-gen network has to offer.”\nConsumers are increasingly turning to prepaid options over postpaid plans because it gives them a lot more flexibility to change plans or switch to another carrier if they so choose. While at one time you would have had to buy a phone outright to use on a prepaid plan, these days most carriers offer phone financing — so while you may not be locked into a contract with the company, you will have to pay off your phone before you can leave the carrier.\nYou can also use a range of different handsets with Verizon’s prepaid plans, as long as they’re compatible with Verizon’s network. Those include the new Google Pixel, and the Moto Z, both of which were exclusive to Verizon when they were launched.\nVerizon withdraws the lightest of its monthly prepaid plans Family is where the heart/discounts are, thanks to new AT&T prepaid plans Should you upgrade to T-Mobile’s One or One Plus plans?

The smartphone comes with a pretty handy hardware specs sheet, even by 2016 standards, so it’s by no means a bad buy. The device, unfortunately, will be locked to work with Verizon Wireless in the U.S., so non-Verizon customers will miss out here. \nThe Galaxy S5 comes with a 5.1-inch 1080p Super AMOLED   a 2-  2GB of RAM, 16GB   a quad-core Snapdragon 801 SoC, Android 4.4 KitKat (upgradable to Marshmallow), and a 2,800 mAh battery. The handset is water/dust resistant as well, thanks to the IP67 certification on board. This makes it a very appealing offering for $120. Make sure you head over to the eBay link below for more details on the deal. \nThe handset is available in Black and White color variants as of now.",

Today, the carrier revealed that two new plans will be available starting next week, on November 13th. The cheapest option includes 5GB of rollover data, unlimited talk and text in the US, mobile hotspot and international texting for $50 per month. If that's not enough for you, $70 gets you everything mentioned above plus unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada, as well as double the data (10GB). \nOf course, these are a complement to the prepaid plan Verizon announced in May, which comes with 6GB of data for $60 monthly for customers enrolled in auto-pay. Now you just need to figure out which one meets your needs. \n*Verizon has acquired AOL, Engadget's parent company.

      "text": " Digi International\nDigi TransPort® Routers Fully Certified for Verizon's Solution Optimized for Quality of Service for 4G LTE Private Network Subscribers\nMINNETONKA, Minn. Digi International®, (NASDAQ: DGII, www.digi.com ), a leading global provider of machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services, today announced that multiple models of its Digi TransPort® product line have been certified to operate with Verizon's 4G LTE Private Network Traffic Management solution, having achieved technical acceptance from Verizon's Solutions Lab.\nVerizon Private Network Traffic Management (PNTM) is an enhancement to the 4G LTE Private Network that provides a premium and differentiated network experience. It allows organizations to create IP traffic preferences for business-critical applications and to achieve more predictable application performance during times of peak network demand.\n\"With this certification, we're offering a powerful, pre-certified, enterprise-grade LTE router that takes advantage of all the benefits of the Verizon Private Network Traffic Management Solution,\" said Joel Young , chief technology officer, Digi International. \"Together, organizations that rely on mission-critical communications in both business and government can achieve the benefit of priority access.\"\nPrivate Network Traffic Management relies on three core LTE network pillars to provide more predictable application performance during heavy network utilization: traffic priority (a support structure on how packets are treated within the 4G LTE Private Network), admission priority (a framework to allocate and retain network resources during heavy network utilization) and access priority (provides the network mechanism to allocate radio resources to a subscriber during heavy network utilization). In order to receive certification, Verizon requires that the 4G LTE device be capable of performing Private Network Traffic Management functionality only on the LTE access technology, should support network-initiated Quality-of-Service (QoS) for both default and dedicated bearer using the 3GPP standard and should route IP packets to the dedicated bearer based on TFT information provided by the Verizon Wireless network.\nDigi TransPort enterprise LTE routers that have been certified include the WR21, WR31, WR44, WR44R, and WR44RR. Digi TransPort routers are rugged, versatile enterprise LTE routers built for critical applications operating in harsh environments and feature advanced security and monitoring and the intelligence to operate on nearly any 3G or 4G LTE network in the world. Designed for critical infrastructure environments, Digi TransPort routers address industries that manage a large number of remote assets installed in challenging environments where onsite visits are infrequent or impractical. In addition, by supporting global HSPA+ and 4G LTE networks, the Digi TransPort product line provides customers the flexibility to future-proof their router installation as wireless network requirements evolve.\nFor more information on Digi TransPort visit http://www.digi.com/products/digi-transport .\nAbout Digi International\nDigi International (NASDAQ: DGII) is a leading global provider of business and mission-critical machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity products and services. We help our customers create next-generation connected products and deploy and manage critical communications infrastructures in demanding environments with high levels of security, relentless reliability and bulletproof performance.

      "text": "As the biggest wireless provider in the U.S., Verizon isn't under pressure to offer the kinds of enticements other carriers use to lure in new subscribers. Instead, Big Red has decided that larger buckets of data, coupled with its extensive coverage will be enough to get you to sign up for its service. \nStill, you have some options when shopping for a Verizon wireless plan, whether you're looking for individual coverage or for a plan that covers your entire family. Verizon has also expanded its prepaid offerings, so no matter what kind of plan you're looking for, your available options have changed. Here's a quick guide to what Verizon offers, including our picks for the best plans for families and individuals. \nBest Family Plan The best choice for families on Verizon is only available for a limited time. Verizon created a special 12GB plan for $80 a month. On top of that, Verizon adds another 2GB per line, meaning a family of four effectively gets a shared data pool of 20GB each month. Factor in Verizon’s $20 access fee for each device, and that family pays $160 under this limited-time plan. \nShould that plan disappear, you’ve still got Verizon’s 16GB shared data plan, which comes with unlimited talk and text, plus the extra 2GB per line. The plan costs $90 a month. After access fees for a family of four, that comes to $170 a month \nMORE: How Verizon's Plans Compare to Other Carriers\n\nThe 16GB XL plan has other benefits. Verizon also lets you make unlimited calls to Mexico and Canada and use your data plan while traveling in those countries at no extra cost if you have an XL plan. Subscribers with smaller plans need to pay a fee to use the benefits. \nVerizon — Best Family Plan Shop Plans \nOther Options: Because Verizon offers the same tiered plans to both families and individuals, the only other option that makes sense for families with more than two lines would be the carrier's 24GB XXL plan, which costs $110 a month. Access fees for each device bring that to $190 for a family of four. As with the 16GB plan, the 24GB plan enjoys free calls to Canada and Mexico. \nIf your family plan only needs to cover two devices, you could consider Verizon's 8GB plan for $70 a month. Factor in the $20 monthly access fees for each device, and a two-person family would pay $110 for that plan. As long as it’s available, though, you could also opt for the 12GB plan and its extra 2GB of data per line. That means you’re getting 16GB for $120 a month, access fees for two lines included. \nBest Individual Plan With the average smartphone user consuming between 2 and 3GB of data each month, Verizon's 4GB plan will meet the needs of most people. The plan costs $50 a month, plus Verizon's monthly access fee of $20, for a total of $70. \nVerizon — Best Individual Plan Shop Plans \nOther Options: Individuals have the same plan options as families. Users who think a 4GB cap will cramp their style should consider the 8GB plan, which costs $90 a month after you add in the access fee. If you don't need a lot of data, Verizon's lowest cost option gives you 2GB of data for $55 a month, access fee included. \nVerizon is the only carrier to not offer an unlimited data plan to new subscribers. (For AT&T, unlimited data is only available if you combine your cellphone coverage with AT&T's DirecTV or U-Verse TV service.) If you need unlimited data, you either need to pick one of Verizon's high-limit plans or consider a different carrier. \nBest Prepaid Plan If you want a prepaid option that still takes advantage of Verizon's strong network, the carrier does offer prepaid plans . And Verizon recently doubled the number of options, even if its plans aren't priced aggressively to compete with prepaid carriers. \nMORE: What Are the Best Prepaid Plans? \n\nYou can get a 2GB prepaid plan for $45 a month or 5GB plan for $60. But make automatic payments, and you boost the size of either plan by 1GB. If you make a lot of calls to Canada or Mexico, the $60 plan has some appeal, with unlimited talk and text to those two countries. (The $45 plan only offers unlimited texting to Canada and Mexico.) If you only anticipating using data when you've got a Wi-Fi connection, Verizon's $30 prepaid plan offers talk and text only.\n\nVerizon's latest prepaid options include a $50-per-month option that offers 5GB of data, and you can carry over unused data to the next month and take advantage of international messaging to more than 200 countries. The $70 10GB prepaid plan offers those same benefits, plus unlimited calling to Canada and Mexico.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Verizon Before committing to a Verizon plan, here are a few other things to consider about Big Red. \n* Verizon’s biggest selling point is its network. Catch a Verizon ad on TV, and the wireless carrier will likely be touting the performance of its 4G LTE network. Based on independent testing, Verizon has good reason to crow: Network testing firm RootMetrics has named Verizon as the best-performing wireless network for six consecutive reports (though rival T-Mobile takes issue with RootMetrics’ methodology.) In our own testing in six cities, Verizon finished on top for 4G speed . \n* Verizon has phased out overage fees. Earlier this year, the carrier introduced what it called Safety Mode for its 16GB and 24GB plans. Go over your data allotment, and instead of racking up charges, Verzion would simply slow your data speed down to 2G for the rest of your billing cycle. Now the carrier has extended Safety Mode to its smaller data plans, which used to have to pay extra for the feature. \n* You can now roll over data. Verizon has changed its tune on carryover data, now allowing you to take the remaining data from one month and use it in the next. Verizon’s approach is identical to AT&T’s where rollover data is only good in the following month. (T-Mobile lets Simple Choice plan subscribers bank unused data for up to 12 months, though that carrier is shifting to unlimited plans only starting in September.) \n\n* Verizon has stopped selling subsidized phones. If you haven't bought a smartphone in a while, you might not realize that Verizon has gotten out of the two-year contract business where you would buy a phone at a subsidized price in exchange for a two-year service agreement. That means when you buy a smartphone from Verizon, you either pay for it upfront or agree to buy it in monthly installments. (Verizon doesn't offer leasing agreements either.) That's at least pushed Verizon to simplify its access fee down to a single $20 monthly charge, instead of fees of varying amounts depending on whether you have a subsidized phone or not. \n* Verizon lets you take your plan with you when traveling. The carrier's TravelPass program lets you use your normal plan, including your allotted data, when you travel outside the U.S. TravelPass costs $2 a day per line when you travel in Mexico or Canada (though as noted above, XL and XXL plan subscribers get that benefit for free) . the daily charge is $10 in 65 other countries. If you're planning a longer trip or travel outside of the countries covered by TravelPass , Verizon also offers monthly international travel plans and pay-as-you-go pricing. \n* Verizon offers a few extras. Football fans will appreciate the fact that NFL Mobile comes with Verizon's plans, allowing you to watch local and primetime games on your smartphone. (That will come out of your monthly data allotment if you stream games over Verizon's network.) Verizon Cloud provides cloud storage to subscribers for syncing data and content across devices. You get 5GB of storage for free, with the ability to add more storage starting at 25GB for $3 a month. \n\nBest Phone Carriers: Where Verizon Ranks Verizon's Unlimited Plan Cost Goes Up: Here's What You Can Do The Best (and Worst) Cellphone Carrier Customer Support About the author Philip Michaels @PhilipMichaels Philip Michaels is a senior editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "140 West Street and the co-working space Grind\nFrom the New York website : Would you like to buy a co-working desk with that cable package? Telecommunications firm Verizon opened its first shared office space at 140 West Street in Manhattan earlier this year and plans to open similar spaces in Boston, Washington D.C. and London. \nUnlike WeWork, which has to rent office space from landlords, Verizon actually owns plenty of office buildings in neighborhoods popular with yuppies. At 140 West Street, for example, Verizon owns the lower 10 floors ( it sold the top portion to developer Ben Shaoul , who is converting them into condos).\nDoes that mean WeWork has to worry about a serious corporate rival emerging? Probably not. Verizon — which has been negotiating to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion — sees its co-working venture mainly as a neat way to use excess space and get “engaged in the [tech] community to see what’s going on,” according to John Vazquez, the firm’s head of real estate. And it isn’t even managing the space — co-working provider Grind is taking care of that, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nStill, Verizon’s example shows that major corporations are becoming more comfortable with the concept of co-working. Firms like KPMG and Microsoft have bought WeWork memberships for their employees. Meanwhile, Amazon offers free co-working spaces to promote its cloud-computing products. Earlier this year, Cadillac opened a co-working space in the ground floor of its Manhattan headquarters. The space also includes a coffee shop and art exhibits.\nTelecom firm Sprint opened a tech accelerator in Kansas City. “There are a lot of smart people who are trying to figure out how to disrupt my industry,” Sprint’s vice president Kevin McGinnis told the Journal. “I need to be closer to them.” [WSJ] — Konrad Putzier \n",

      "text": "COMMENTS Paul R. Giunta/Getty Images Umphrey's McGee perform on stage at Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre at Encore Park on Sept. 16, 2016 in Alpharetta, GA.Â \nFor years, the Indiana-based prog-jam band Umphrey’s McGee has earned a reputation not just as one of the most musically dexterous groups in the virtuoso-driven jam scene, but as one of the best cover bands on the planet. During their live shows, they nail songs by everyone from Radiohead to Funkadelic , sticking their landings with precision. \nBut on Halloween eight years ago, the band took their cover game even further and played a number of mashups, including the first one they ever worked through -- a blend of Michael Jackson ’s “Thriller” and Pink Floyd ’s “Another Brick in the Wall Pt. II” -- and started working these musical mixes, long a staple of DJs like Z-Trip , into their live shows. Now, with the imminent release of their new album Zonkey , on Nov. 11, the band has studio-fied these often-disparate concoctions with an album exclusively composed of mashup covers; including a couple of quotes from their originals thrown in for good measure. \n“The idea initially was to do something with 'Thriller,' because it was Halloween,” guitarist and singer Brendan Bayliss told Billboard during a break from the band’s ceaseless touring schedule. “I think we did it in the key of D, and we were just vamping around with it. Once you start playing the 'Another Brick in the Wall' [hook], if you start just riffing on it, it just fit really easy. We have a policy that, before we say no to an idea, we should try it and listen to it first. Sometimes, like for that one, someone's playing Pink Floyd and I'll start singing Michael Jackson over it and then we'll try and figure out, 'Do we do a verse? Do we do a chorus? Is it even working?'\" \nThough that first mashup didn’t make the cut for the new album, plenty of others did, ranging from natural-when-you-think-about-it ideas -- “Can’t Rock My Dream Face,” for instance, merges Michael Jackson-loving The Weeknd ’s “I Can’t Feel My Face” with “Rock With You” (although along the way the band also finds their way into Fleetwood Mac ’s “Dreams”) -- to total bizzaro picks (“Frankie Zombie,” which blends White Zombie , Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Pink Floyd.) \nSometimes, the choices come organically. “When you start singing [ Bob Marley ’s] 'Exodus' over [ The Talking Heads ’] 'Life During Wartime,' it's the same key, same tempo, so that makes it look easy,” Bayliss says. \nOthers -- like “Frankie Zombie” -- take a bit more work. “I'm sure Rob Zombie never really envisioned his ['Thunder Kiss '65] chorus over 'Relax,'\" Bayliss says. \"That one actually came out just because I thought it'd be funny. It actually turned out pretty rocking. Those were the same key, same tempo and that was another idea where it was just like, 'Okay, you start playing that riff and I'll start singing Frankie Goes to Hollywood.' I can tell really quickly by the band’s reactions whether or not they're going to go for it. Everyone just started laughing.” \nThough every track has been played live at least once, bringing the mashup idea to the studio allowed Bayliss and his band mates the opportunity to bring back some song picks that had been retired, for a myriad of reasons. “Vocally, trying to sing Michael Jackson live -- it’s very difficult,” Bayliss laughs. “Especially being a white guy from the midwest.” \nThrough each of the picks, Umphrey’s prides themselves on nailing the intricacies of the originals -- and though that sometimes means aping Frank Zappa licks, it can also require some studio trickery. “When we were learning [Radiohead’s 'The National Anthem'], [guitarist] Jake [ Cinninger ] was trying to get the atmospheric droning stuff. To make those sounds, he had to do seven or eight guitar tracks.” \nOther times, though, it just takes a bit of research. “We were dissecting [ Beastie Boys ' 'Sabotage,' which is mixed with Ted Nugent ’s 'Stranglehold'] to do in the studio. I was like, ‘I think all he’s doing is Clash -style downstroke power chords [on one chord],\" Bayliss says. \"It was so easy that I went on YouTube and tried to find them playing on Letterman or something, just to verify that’s what they were doing. Yep: it is.” \nCheck the full track listing for Zonkey with each mashup's original songs right here .",

      "text": "Valerie Richardson \nYou can now get the # Verizon # GalaxyNote5 for just $329.99 on eBay . The smartphone is last year’s Note flagship and incidentally the only Note flagship you can buy in the market following the early demise of the Galaxy Note 7. Keeping this in mind, there’s still some demand for this 2015 flagship. The seller is offering the handset in a 32GB configuration. \nThe Galaxy Note 5 comes with a 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display, a 16-  5-  the octa-core Exynos 7420 SoC, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of non-expandable storage, Android 5.1 Lollipop (upgradable to Marshmallow), and a 3,000 mAh battery. Unfortunately, the seller is only offering the Galaxy Note 5 here in a Sapphire Black variant, so there aren’t a lot of options to choose from. \nBut if that’s not much of a caveat for you, be sure to check out the smartphone from the eBay link below.",

      "text": "The more options that people have with their carrier plans, the better. And Verizon has continued to expand their prepaid line by adding two more options for those who would prefer to not be tied to any long-term contracts, but would still like the benefits that subscribers can enjoy. By November 13, you can choose to have a 5GB plan for $50 a month or the 10GB plan for $70 a month. Data is probably the most important thing that mobile users are looking for now, along with value for money of course.\nThe 5GB prepaid plan brings you, aside from the 5GB of data, unlimited talk and text within the US plus international messaging to more than 200 countries. You also get carryover data if you do not get to use up all your data and if you pay on time. You can also use your device as a mobile hotspot and you can keep it Always On but at 128 kbps, it may affect the quality of streaming audio and video.\nMeanwhile, the 10GB plan will of course have the same features as the 5GB one, but with the addition of unlimited calling to Mexico and Canada. So if you have loved ones or business contacts over there, then this will be a good prepaid plan to have. And at just $20 more expensive, you get double the data. So if you usually consume more than 5GB a month, then this is something you should consider.\nVerizon’s other prepaid plans are the 6GB ($60) and 3GB ($45 autopay and $30 WiFi only) per month plans. All of these prepaid options come with HD Voice, video calls, calls over WiFi, 6-way calling and surfing while calling. You also get the option to get a smartphone, including Google Pixel and Motorola Moto Z, but of course you’d have to pay for it the full amount.\nSOURCE: Verizon",

Twitter \nThe state-by-state results of the presidential election are coming in, and let's just say, we're all a little bit freaking out as we see which candidate wins which state as the night goes on. We are watching the map of the United States go red and blue to signify the political fate of our nation. Understandably, people who don't want Hillary Clinton to win are hoping against an all-blue map, while those who don't want Donald Trump to win are rooting against an all-red map ... which is exactly why Verizon promoting this ad of a COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY RED UNITED STATES OF AMERICA has a lot of people less than happy.",

      "text": "Verizon's Harvard Business Review study outlines CIO struggles with digital disruption Study finds digital disruption for enterprises leads to an increase in 'hybrid IT' environments News provided by Nov 09, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article BASKING RIDGE, N.J. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Enterprises today are employing \"hybrid IT\" as they struggle to keep up with digital transformation, according to the just released Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report \" Hybrid IT Takes Center Stage \". Sponsored by Verizon Enterprise Solutions, the report survey of 310 business and IT executives worldwide and found that most say their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in business today while working to ensure the complexity of their IT systems do not jeopardize performance, agility or security. In fact, 63 percent of respondents indicated they are pursuing a hybrid IT approach to keep up with their existing infrastructure that consists of a mix of private clouds, public clouds and legacy data centers – either on-premises or managed by service providers. To enable hybrid IT, the report singles out the need for a secure, high-performance network architecture that can deliver the kind of security, flexibility and responsiveness required to stitch all these systems together. \"The vast majority of CIOs and line of business owners are working within the constraints of legacy apps, networks and investments,\" said Chris Yousey , vice president of managed services for Verizon Enterprise Solutions. \"And while the move to hybrid IT is about protecting their investments, it's really more about improving performance, availability and above all, agility in today's business climate.\" The realization of the cloud environment In fact, the majority of CIOs – 59 percent – say that their organizations' use of cloud computing has improved their marketplace competiveness. Top challenges preventing organizations from employing more cloud solutions are security (35 percent); integration with other systems (32 percent) and integrating multiple clouds (25 percent). According to Carl Lehmann , research manager in charge of enterprise architecture, integration and business process management for the 451 Group, \"Everyone is talking about digital transformation in the enterprise, improving the customer experience and adopting new business models to respond to disruption from established rivals and new entrants. And hybrid IT is how you do that.\" Survey respondents indicated the technology-related benefits of cloud include: flexibility (77 percent); faster implementation (66 percent); ease of deployment (58 percent); increased reliability (28 percent) and better functionality (26 percent). The business benefits attributed to cloud -- increased application availability, enhanced business continuity, lower total cost of ownership, and ease of collaboration -- continue to be drivers for cloud deployments. What's next for enterprises? Many companies recognize that outsourcing infrastructure management will help them keep pace with technological change and allow them to become more responsive to the needs of their business. In addition, respondents from the survey indicated that outsourcing more infrastructure management would improve the following: Ability to stay on top of technology change: 72 percent Responsiveness to business demands: 67 percent Speed to resolve problems: 57 percent User experience: 57 percent Access to required skills: 57 percent Reliable control of costs: 56 percent Management control systems integration: 51 percent The report concluded that today the majority of companies struggle with hybrid IT. While some enterprises have had isolated success, repeatable, reliable and consistent hybrid IT approach remains the exception rather than the rule. \"We believe hybrid IT is the right model for many organizations as they transform digitally,\" said Verizon's Yousey. \"This approach helps meet the business demand to support and accelerate innovation while enabling the IT function to plan for the future. It also helps reduce the risks associated with the complexity inherent in most systems today.\" Verizon Enterprise Solutions helps clients improve customer experience, drive growth and business performance and manage risk.

      "text": "Verizon's Harvard Business Review study outlines CIO struggles with digital disruption Study finds digital disruption for enterprises leads to an increase in 'hybrid IT' environments News provided by Nov 09, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article BASKING RIDGE, N.J. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Enterprises today are employing \"hybrid IT\" as they struggle to keep up with digital transformation, according to the just released Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report \" Hybrid IT Takes Center Stage \". Sponsored by Verizon Enterprise Solutions, the report survey of 310 business and IT executives worldwide and found that most say their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in business today while working to ensure the complexity of their IT systems do not jeopardize performance, agility or security. In fact, 63 percent of respondents indicated they are pursuing a hybrid IT approach to keep up with their existing infrastructure that consists of a mix of private clouds, public clouds and legacy data centers – either on-premises or managed by service providers. To enable hybrid IT, the report singles out the need for a secure, high-performance network architecture that can deliver the kind of security, flexibility and responsiveness required to stitch all these systems together. \"The vast majority of CIOs and line of business owners are working within the constraints of legacy apps, networks and investments,\" said Chris Yousey , vice president of managed services for Verizon Enterprise Solutions. \"And while the move to hybrid IT is about protecting their investments, it's really more about improving performance, availability and above all, agility in today's business climate.\" The realization of the cloud environment In fact, the majority of CIOs – 59 percent – say that their organizations' use of cloud computing has improved their marketplace competiveness. Top challenges preventing organizations from employing more cloud solutions are security (35 percent); integration with other systems (32 percent) and integrating multiple clouds (25 percent). According to Carl Lehmann , research manager in charge of enterprise architecture, integration and business process management for the 451 Group, \"Everyone is talking about digital transformation in the enterprise, improving the customer experience and adopting new business models to respond to disruption from established rivals and new entrants. And hybrid IT is how you do that.\" Survey respondents indicated the technology-related benefits of cloud include: flexibility (77 percent); faster implementation (66 percent); ease of deployment (58 percent); increased reliability (28 percent) and better functionality (26 percent). The business benefits attributed to cloud -- increased application availability, enhanced business continuity, lower total cost of ownership, and ease of collaboration -- continue to be drivers for cloud deployments. What's next for enterprises? Many companies recognize that outsourcing infrastructure management will help them keep pace with technological change and allow them to become more responsive to the needs of their business. In addition, respondents from the survey indicated that outsourcing more infrastructure management would improve the following: Ability to stay on top of technology change: 72 percent Responsiveness to business demands: 67 percent Speed to resolve problems: 57 percent User experience: 57 percent Access to required skills: 57 percent Reliable control of costs: 56 percent Management control systems integration: 51 percent The report concluded that today the majority of companies struggle with hybrid IT. While some enterprises have had isolated success, repeatable, reliable and consistent hybrid IT approach remains the exception rather than the rule. \"We believe hybrid IT is the right model for many organizations as they transform digitally,\" said Verizon's Yousey. \"This approach helps meet the business demand to support and accelerate innovation while enabling the IT function to plan for the future. It also helps reduce the risks associated with the complexity inherent in most systems today.\" Verizon Enterprise Solutions helps clients improve customer experience, drive growth and business performance and manage risk.

      "text": "Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider \nI've recently noticed that some of my phone calls have sounded noticeably clearer and better than usual, as if they were FaceTime Audio or Skype Audio calls.\nThat's because some of my calls are being made using my carrier's LTE data network, and even WiFi networks, rather than the conventional network that's usually used for standard phone calls. It's a feature that's generally known as \"VoLTE,\" which stands for voice-over-LTE, but some carriers like AT&T and Verizon call it \"HD Voice.\" \nI say  some  phone calls   above because VoLTE, or HD Voice, is not a consistent, standard feature yet, despite the fact that AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile started rolling out VoLTE services in 2014.\nAT&T and Verizon leading the way I've personally noticed these sharper, clearer calls because my carrier, AT&T, has been working with Verizon to be compatible with each other for VoLTE calls. That means some people with VoLTE-compatible smartphones in AT&T and Verizon's VoLTE coverage areas can enjoy better phone calls.\nAt the time of writing, AT&T told me that the efforts to make AT&T and Verizon fully compatible with each other for VoLTE calls is still incomplete, and work will continue into 2017. So, I guess I'm one of the lucky ones to experience AT&T and Verizon's interoperability in its early stages.\nT-Mobile is lagging behind a little T-Mobile customers, on the other hand, can only make VoLTE phone calls with other T-Mobile customers, at least for now. The company has said that it's working on interoperability with other carriers, but it's not in effect yet.\nSo, in essence, I have a much higher chance of making a high-quality VoLTE phone call because I have VoLTE access to AT&T and Verizon customers.\nYou can get high-quality phone calls regardless You can make high-quality phone calls without having to worry about what carrier you're on and all the requirements for VoLTE if you change your calling habits.\nI likened VoLTE phone call quality to that of FaceTime Audio or Skype Audio, and you can use those apps, as well as a number of other apps like Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts, to make high-quality phone calls. To make calls with those apps, you simply need to make sure that the person you're calling is using the same app.\nIt's about time that phone call quality gets an upgrade. It's a pretty start contrast when you have an incredibly powerful phone that can take amazing pictures and run great apps but makes poor quality phone calls.\nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n",

I know it's locked down to Verizon for 12 months, but is it possible to either activate it with a Verizon MVNO such as Boom Mobile, or pop in a Verizon MVNO sim card and use it that way? Really good deal for a backup phone on Verizon if it can be used this way. Thanks in advance.",

      "title": "Verizon's Harvard Business Review study outlines CIO struggles with digital disruption",
      "text": " Verizon\nStudy finds digital disruption for enterprises leads to an increase in 'hybrid IT' environments\nBASKING RIDGE, N.J. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Enterprises today are employing \"hybrid IT\" as they struggle to keep up with digital transformation, according to the just released Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report \" Hybrid IT Takes Center Stage \".\nSponsored by Verizon Enterprise Solutions, the report survey of 310 business and IT executives worldwide and found that most say their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in business today while working to ensure the complexity of their IT systems do not jeopardize performance, agility or security.\nIn fact, 63 percent of respondents indicated they are pursuing a hybrid IT approach to keep up with their existing infrastructure that consists of a mix of private clouds, public clouds and legacy data centers – either on-premises or managed by service providers.\nTo enable hybrid IT, the report singles out the need for a secure, high-performance network architecture that can deliver the kind of security, flexibility and responsiveness required to stitch all these systems together.\n\"The vast majority of CIOs and line of business owners are working within the constraints of legacy apps, networks and investments,\" said Chris Yousey , vice president of managed services for Verizon Enterprise Solutions. \"And while the move to hybrid IT is about protecting their investments, it's really more about improving performance, availability and above all, agility in today's business climate.\"\nThe realization of the cloud environment\nIn fact, the majority of CIOs – 59 percent – say that their organizations' use of cloud computing has improved their marketplace competiveness.\nTop challenges preventing organizations from employing more cloud solutions are security (35 percent); integration with other systems (32 percent) and integrating multiple clouds (25 percent).\nAccording to Carl Lehmann , research manager in charge of enterprise architecture, integration and business process management for the 451 Group, \"Everyone is talking about digital transformation in the enterprise, improving the customer experience and adopting new business models to respond to disruption from established rivals and new entrants. And hybrid IT is how you do that.\"\nSurvey respondents indicated the technology-related benefits of cloud include: flexibility (77 percent); faster implementation (66 percent); ease of deployment (58 percent); increased reliability (28 percent) and better functionality (26 percent).\nThe business benefits attributed to cloud -- increased application availability, enhanced business continuity, lower total cost of ownership, and ease of collaboration -- continue to be drivers for cloud deployments.\nWhat's next for enterprises?\nMany companies recognize that outsourcing infrastructure management will help them keep pace with technological change and allow them to become more responsive to the needs of their business.\nIn addition, respondents from the survey indicated that outsourcing more infrastructure management would improve the following:\nAbility to stay on top of technology change: 72 percent Responsiveness to business demands: 67 percent Speed to resolve problems: 57 percent User experience: 57 percent Access to required skills: 57 percent Reliable control of costs: 56 percent Management control systems integration: 51 percent The report concluded that today the majority of companies struggle with hybrid IT. While some enterprises have had isolated success, repeatable, reliable and consistent hybrid IT approach remains the exception rather than the rule.\n\"We believe hybrid IT is the right model for many organizations as they transform digitally,\" said Verizon's Yousey. \"This approach helps meet the business demand to support and accelerate innovation while enabling the IT function to plan for the future. It also helps reduce the risks associated with the complexity inherent in most systems today.\"\nVerizon Enterprise Solutions helps clients improve customer experience, drive growth and business performance and manage risk.

      "text": " Verizon\nStudy finds digital disruption for enterprises leads to an increase in 'hybrid IT' environments\nBASKING RIDGE, N.J. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Enterprises today are employing \"hybrid IT\" as they struggle to keep up with digital transformation, according to the just released Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report \" Hybrid IT Takes Center Stage \".\nSponsored by Verizon Enterprise Solutions, the report survey of 310 business and IT executives worldwide and found that most say their organizations are struggling to keep up with the pace of change in business today while working to ensure the complexity of their IT systems do not jeopardize performance, agility or security.\nIn fact, 63 percent of respondents indicated they are pursuing a hybrid IT approach to keep up with their existing infrastructure that consists of a mix of private clouds, public clouds and legacy data centers – either on-premises or managed by service providers.\nTo enable hybrid IT, the report singles out the need for a secure, high-performance network architecture that can deliver the kind of security, flexibility and responsiveness required to stitch all these systems together.\n\"The vast majority of CIOs and line of business owners are working within the constraints of legacy apps, networks and investments,\" said Chris Yousey , vice president of managed services for Verizon Enterprise Solutions. \"And while the move to hybrid IT is about protecting their investments, it's really more about improving performance, availability and above all, agility in today's business climate.\"\nThe realization of the cloud environment\nIn fact, the majority of CIOs – 59 percent – say that their organizations' use of cloud computing has improved their marketplace competiveness.\nTop challenges preventing organizations from employing more cloud solutions are security (35 percent); integration with other systems (32 percent) and integrating multiple clouds (25 percent).\nAccording to Carl Lehmann , research manager in charge of enterprise architecture, integration and business process management for the 451 Group, \"Everyone is talking about digital transformation in the enterprise, improving the customer experience and adopting new business models to respond to disruption from established rivals and new entrants. And hybrid IT is how you do that.\"\nSurvey respondents indicated the technology-related benefits of cloud include: flexibility (77 percent); faster implementation (66 percent); ease of deployment (58 percent); increased reliability (28 percent) and better functionality (26 percent).\nThe business benefits attributed to cloud -- increased application availability, enhanced business continuity, lower total cost of ownership, and ease of collaboration -- continue to be drivers for cloud deployments.\nWhat's next for enterprises?\nMany companies recognize that outsourcing infrastructure management will help them keep pace with technological change and allow them to become more responsive to the needs of their business.\nIn addition, respondents from the survey indicated that outsourcing more infrastructure management would improve the following:\nAbility to stay on top of technology change: 72 percent Responsiveness to business demands: 67 percent Speed to resolve problems: 57 percent User experience: 57 percent Access to required skills: 57 percent Reliable control of costs: 56 percent Management control systems integration: 51 percent The report concluded that today the majority of companies struggle with hybrid IT. While some enterprises have had isolated success, repeatable, reliable and consistent hybrid IT approach remains the exception rather than the rule.\n\"We believe hybrid IT is the right model for many organizations as they transform digitally,\" said Verizon's Yousey. \"This approach helps meet the business demand to support and accelerate innovation while enabling the IT function to plan for the future. It also helps reduce the risks associated with the complexity inherent in most systems today.\"\nVerizon Enterprise Solutions helps clients improve customer experience, drive growth and business performance and manage risk.

      "text": "Related Articles to 'Marketing Lesson from the Election' Verizon Invites the Channel Once More Research Firms Missed Again on UC A Big Shift Coming to Telecom The Telecom Long Tails Marketing Lesson from the Election \n\\nA couple of marketing lessons from the campaign. (Non-political). \\n\n\\nIf your Brand is broken, run a Branding campaign not a negative campaign. \\n\n\\nWhen your brand is broken -- maybe your uptime is three eights instead of nines or maybe your customer service is notoriously awful - the buyer doesn't have trust in you. You need Trust for being to buy. \\n\n\\nLook at how Ma and Pa Bell (Verizon and AT&T)have been re-branding away from telecom. Meanwhile, CenturyLink, Windstream and Frontier have been struggling to find their brand, their message, their future. \\n\n\\nEarthLink had struggles growing beyond a dial-up ISP. They tried so much stuff: DSL, cable resell, MVNO, Muni wi-fi, VoIP, fiber, etc. - before finding their groove in Retail. \\n\n\\nFUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) will get you so far, but the best brands in the DNC ran on hope, change and issues. Take a lesson from people doing it better than you. Learn from your rivals what resonates with your buyers. \\n\\n\n\\nI look at the independent candidates who took 9% of the total vote. They remind me of the 1195 other Hosted VoIP/UCaaS providers in the US. You say you are in the running, but are you even campaigning? Are you doing ANY effective marketing, advertising, PR? Chances are: notsomuch. \\n\n\\nTo look at Broadsoft as a candidate that thought it should have won - and quite frankly has disappointed. Of the top UCaaS providers - RC, 8x8, thinkingphones/Fuze, Star2Star, West, Broadview, Mitel, Jive, CoreDial, Cisco and Microsoft - none of them are using Broadsoft. That has to be disheartening. To some extent that is like the Democratic candidates for House and Senate that lost. The party leader didn't help them win; the big name, carrier grade softswitch didn't help the 400+ UCaaS players win either. (You could argue that a few are doing well, like Vonage Business, Nextiva, Evolve IP and Comcast. Yet mainly the Top 25 are anything but BSFT. Isn't that interesting?)\\n \\n ",

      "title": "Verizon Introduces 2 New Prepaid Data Plans: 5 GB For $50 A Month, 10 GB For $70",
      "text": "Verizon is offering two new data plans beginning Nov. 13. For $50 a month, users can get 5 GB of data and 10 GB if you're willing to shell out a little bit more at $70. ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement Verizon is set to launch more prepaid offerings soon, just almost a month after it announced PopData , a new piecemeal subscription service that charges users per half an hour or a full hour of unlimited data. Big Red is introducing two new prepaid data plans, the first of which gives you 5 GB of data for $50 a month and the second comes with 10 GB of data for $70. Verizon's New Data Plans The two new data plans will be available beginning Nov. 13, according to Verizon. The cheapest option, apart from offering 5 GB of data, will also come with unlimited calls and messaging in the United States. The $50 data plan also includes carryover data with on-time payment, Verizon's always-on data , mobile hotspot and international messaging to more than 200 countries. For the more expensive $70 data plan, users will get the same features included in the lower tier plan along with unlimited calls to neighboring countries Mexico or Canada. The plan might be the more attractive end of the pair, giving double the amount of data for just $20 more than the original price. Verizon's two new plans come as an added alternative to one of the company's existing prepaid offerings , which include 6 GB of data for $60 per month and 3 GB of data for $45 per month. Both of these plans come with AutoPay and a Wi-Fi only option for $30 per month. Each option nets a user HD quality calls, calls over Wi-Fi and more. To go along with the new data plans, Verizon is also throwing a hefty list of smartphones users can choose from. More than two dozen models are available, including iOS and Android devices such as the iPhone SE, Pixel and Pixel XL. When Will A True Unlimited Data Plan Come? Despite expanding its prepaid lineup, the unwillingness of Verizon and other rival networks to offer a simple monthly unlimited plan still leaves many people scratching their heads. In fact, Big Red isn't too keen on the idea , even going so far as to push out previous users pulling more than 100 GB of data off Verizon's previous unlimited subscriptions, threatening to make them pay $450 if users continue the habit. \nPlans like PopData and these two new offerings aren't exactly what users need, given that 5 GB or even 10 GB is starkly insufficient in today's internet-enabled culture. But both, along with the company's other data plans, offer a passable middle ground as we wait for an honest-to-goodness monthly unlimited plan that doesn't break the bank. © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "title": "Google Pixel and Pixel XL Deals",
      "text": "The new Pixel and Pixel XL are finally here and readily available from Verizon or Google. Two premium flagship smartphones with tons of impressive features. They’re also pretty expensive. With that in mind below is a continuously updated list of the best Pixel deals available. Not to mention plenty of Black Friday deals are coming soon.\nOn October 4th Google revealed these phones after months of rumors and speculation. They have a lot to offer, beautiful screens, one of the best cameras and run the latest Android 7.1 Nougat. Users can buy one today from the Google Play Store, Verizon or even Best Buy. If you do, make sure to take advantage of the deals we’ve found.\nAdvertisement\nRead: Google Pixel XL Review: A New Type of Android\nTake a peek at our review above, then read on for more details. The smaller 5-inch Google Pixel starts at $649. Then the bigger 5.5-inch Pixel XL is $769. Pricing that matches some of the high-end competition like Apple. It’s not the low prices many are accustomed to. As a result buyers will be looking for deals or discounts. That’s exactly what we have for you below.\nAdvertisement\nGoogle’s new phones bring a lot to the table. Taking everything users loved about Nexus phones and refining it into an entire new experience. From a premium all-metal design, the latest and greatest hardware and more. Pixel is the first phone to run a Snapdragon 821 processor for improved performance. They have plenty of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. Google even claims it has the best smartphone camera on the planet. That’s a bold claim. Not to mention a refined Android experience with the Google Assistant.\nAdvertisement\nOne thing to consider is these phones are still fairly new, so actual discounts won’t surface for a while. There are deals to be found though. We can expect Pixel deals during the holidays and Verizon Black Friday deals recently leaked with good news for Pixel buyers. For now though, this is what’s available.\nT-Mobile Pixel Deal Google’s Pixel is unlocked and has support for almost every major carrier in the United States and around the globe. Meaning one bought from the Google Store will work on AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, MetroPCS and regions around the globe. Even the Verizon model works with any and all carriers.\nIt’s being advertised as exclusively on Verizon, but that just isn’t the case. Everyone needs to be aware of that. In fact, this week T-Mobile confirmed the Pixel works everywhere, including their network. And to convince buyers to switch, they’ll pay for half of the phone. It’s called Free Your Pixel.\nAdvertisement\nBuy a Google Pixel anywhere that it’s available and bring it to T-Mobile, and the carrier will pay for half of the phone. Up to $325 to be exact. Savings won’t be 50% on the Pixel XL, as it retails for $769.\nWhether you’re already with T-Mobile or use another carrier simply bring a Pixel to a nearby store. Then join a new T-Mobile One plan and get half off Google’s greatest phone. This is one of the best deals around, and will be for the foreseeable future.\nBest Buy Google Pixel Deal The biggest deal we’ve seen so far came from Best Buy, which was sort of expected. They typically offer big incentives to get users in their stores rather than going to carriers.\nBest Buy gave those who ordered the new Google Pixel or XL a $100 gift card and a free Google Chromecast. As long as it gets activated on Verizon Wireless, and not another carrier. This deal has since expired, but a new Verizon deal is detailed below.\nAdvertisement\nThat $100 can go towards cases, covers, screen protectors, accessories and more. It’s also worth noting it’s an older model, not the new Chromecast Ultra Google just announced. Still, it’s a free gift simply for going to Best Buy that’s typically $35. A perfect companion for the Pixel.\nThe bigger XL is completely sold out right now from Google, Verizon and Best Buy. So wait a little longer, or get the smaller variant.\nVerizon Pixel Deal Considering the only carrier in the United States that will offer Google’s new phone is Verizon, they are the only one with deals. Honestly we didn’t expect to see any discounts, with them having exclusive access to the phone, but we received some.\nFirst off, and what everyone should know, is you can get these phones for 20% off from Verizon. That may not sound like much, but 20% off an $800 phone is a lot of savings.\nAdvertisement\nUsing the discount code “SAVE20” on Verizon’s website will get buyers the Pixel for as low as $520, or the 128GB Pixel XL drops from $870 to $690. This is a good way to save some money, according to Droid-Life .\nThose who buy the Google Pixel or XL from Verizon Wireless will also get a free Google Daydream View VR headset when it’s released. That is a $79 value, and essentially matches Samsung’s free Gear VR deal with the Galaxy S7. Verizon will also give buyers up to $300 towards it with any 4G LTE smartphone trade-in. Making it much cheaper.\nIt’s worth noting Google’s own Daydream VR has a remote control, a better design, and could potentially be a better virtual reality experience. It also works seamlessly with Google’s new phone. So this is a great opportunity to try both without spending the extra $80.\nMore details on the free Daydream View and how to redeem it can be found here .\nAlternatively, Verizon’s Black Friday deals recently leaked . One ad suggests Verizon will be offering $400 off of the Google Pixel. That’s a screaming good deal. Savings can also be found on the Galaxy S7 or Moto Z DROID.\nOther Options Once we see more deals, discounts or savings we’ll be sure to update this post with additional information and links. Buying it direct from Google also awards users a free DayDream View VR headset.\nRead: 13 Exciting Official Pixel & Pixel XL Accessories\nAnother option for potential buyers is to simply use Google’s financing option . A 24-month cheap payment plan. Spending $769 for the Pixel XL is a lot of money, and spending over $900 after tax for the 128GB is a big price to pay. As a result Google is offering financing options starting at $27 a month.\nWe’ll continue to monitor for new and exciting deals or discounts, and update as more become available. Stay tuned for more savings in the coming weeks.\n8 Best Google Pixel Screen Protectors Zagg InvisibleShield Glass for Pixel XL 1 / 8 Zagg is one of the pioneers when it comes to screen protectors. Being one of the first years ago to offer durable and safe protection for our phones. However, this isn't just a typical film. This is a ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass screen protector that is made of hardened and strengthened glass just like what comes on the phone.\nMeaning it's extremely resistant to scratches and damage just like the device, and will act as a second layer for the Pixel. If for whatever reason it gets a scratch, chip or crack, remove it and the phone is as good as new. Reviews suggest it doesn't cover the entire screen, which is by design as the glass has a slight curve. Still, reviews aren't favorable and Zagg is working on a v2 of the product. Consider other options for now.\nBuy it Now from Verizon for $39.99\n1 / 8",

So this doesn't necessarily mean Yahoo sees Verizon undermining the deal due to the security breach as an immediate risk. Still, it's interesting that Yahoo's mentioned this possibility for the first time in public. \nMeanwhile, Yahoo reiterated that the security breach didn't have any \"material adverse impact\" on the company, although it hinted it could  cost the company more in the near future, as it faces at least 23 lawsuits related to the data breach .  \n\"We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we c ontinue to work towards integration with Verizon,\" Yahoo's representative told us in a statement. \nIn September, Yahoo announced   that at least 500 million user account credentials had been stolen from it in late 2014.

      "text": "0 Verizon HD voice minimum requited LTE bandwidth Is there a recommended minimum uplink bandwidth to ensure that people are hearing me clearly when speaking on using HD voice on Verizon's LTE network? I'm in Manhattan where signals might be strong enough (> -98 dBm Band 4), but backhaul is weak (0.45 Mbits/sec upload) and I'm worried that I people may not be hearing me correctly. I realize that Verizon is using an AMR-WB codec at I believe 12.4 kbits/sec. I've read on this forum somewhere that there should be two times this bandwidth for quality speech. So would 25-37kbits/per second be sufficient? I'm using an iPhone 7+ but the voice quality is very important to me. A second question I have is that isn't Verzion guaranteeing a minimum DL/UL of 8 Mbits/4 Mbits per second? I couldn't find any documentation. TIA",

      "text": "Timeline: The rise and fall of Yahoo Verizon might rescind its $4.8 billion offer to buy Yahoo, in part because of the damage resulting from the colossal hack of Yahoo customers, the technology company said Wednesday. Yahoo ( YHOO , Tech30 ) said there's \"no assurance\" that Verizon will actually go through with the deal, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe filing also revealed that it's \"facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies\" over the hack -- and these could result in \"potential fines.\" \nVerizon defended the deal in late October at a Wall Street Journal Digital Conference, arguing that it \"absolutely\" still makes sense. \nVerizon offered to buy Yahoo's core internet assets in July. But two months later, Yahoo shocked its potential buyer with news that \"at least 500 million\" Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014 -- one of the largest consumer hacks ever. Yahoo alerted the public a couple of days later. \nYahoo has since been hit with 23 consumer class action lawsuits over the hack, according to the company. Hackers were able to steal a list of customer names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, security questions and encoded versions of passwords. \nRelated: Verizon exec on Yahoo deal: 'We have to be careful' \nVerizon ( VZA ) now \"may seek to terminate the stock purchase agreement or renegotiate the terms of the sale\" because of the \"security incident,\" Yahoo warned investors in Wednesday's filing. \nYahoo stressed in its filing Wednesday that the hack is not having a \"material adverse impact\" on its business. \n\"We are confident in Yahoo's value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon,\" a Yahoo spokesperson told CNNMoney. \nThe tech company's stock value didn't immediately shift on the news. \nYahoo blames a government for hacking into its computer network saying that its attacker was \"a state-sponsored actor.\" \nYahoo has struggled under the leadership of Marissa Meyer . Under Mayer's direction, Yahoo has acquired dozens of startups -- and spent lavishly on hiring celebrity journalists. But its bets haven't paid off. One of its most notable assets, the social network Tumblr, has struggled for years to make a profit. \nVerizon declined to comment. \n  8:11 PM ET",

      "text": "Nine years after canceling an account with Verizon, a Maryland woman got a collection notice for more than $11,000. Sina Coates said she contacted Verizon nine years ago to cancel her home service. But in September, she got a past due bill from Verizon for $11,196.56. “I nearly fainted!” she said. “I nearly passed out and got on the phone right away, called Verizon customer service and said, ‘What is this?’ Verizon was stumped, too, Coates said. “After a while she put me on hold for a long time, came back about 15 minutes later, and she said, ‘I don't know quite what to do but I'm going to submit this to claims and you'll hear back from us in 30 days,’” Coates said. She didn’t, so she contacted NBC4 Responds, which contacted Verizon. “Her service was not disconnected at the time of her request due to an internal system error,” Verizon said. “We take full responsibility for the error and apologize for the inconvenience.” Days later, Coates also got a call. “A lady from corporate did contact me, and she was very cordial, very nice,” Coates said. “She did tell me that she's going to take care of this.” Coates said the balance was credited to her account. Whenever closing out an account, make sure the company sends confirmation that it is in fact closed, otherwise you could be facing a big surprise years later.

The new device should replace the Ellipsis 8 launched in late 2014, and will likely become Verizon's fourth Ellipsis-branded tablet (since the carrier also released the Ellipsis 10.1 and Ellipsis 7 ). Thanks to images revealed today by Evan Blass, we can see that the Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD appears to be thinner and a bit more stylish than its predecessor. The tablet has LTE connectivity, seems to be running Android Marshmallow, and comes in (at least) two color variants: midnight blue and arctic grey. Right now, there are no other details about the device. The old Ellipsis 8 is currently sold by Verizon for $49.99 with a 2-year contract, or $249.99 outright. The Ellipsis 8 HD will probably be offered for similar prices. We don't know exactly when the new tablet will be available to buy, but it should happen pretty soon. Interested?

      "text": "Yahoo warns Verizon might kill $4.8 billion deal Company's stock value didn't shift on the news UPDATED 11:35 PM EST Nov 09, 2016 From Yahoo! via CNN Newsource Photos From Yahoo! via CNN Newsource \nVerizon might rescind its $4.8 billion offer to buy Yahoo, in part because of the damage resulting from the colossal hack of Yahoo customers, the technology company said Wednesday. Global markets drop as U.S. election... \nYahoo said there's \"no assurance\" that Verizon will actually go through with the deal, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe filing also revealed that it's \"facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies\" over the hack -- and these could result in \"potential fines.\" \nVerizon defended the deal in late October at a Wall Street Journal Digital Conference, arguing that it \"absolutely\" still makes sense. \nVerizon offered to buy Yahoo's core internet assets in July.

Related Content Global markets drop as U.S. election results shock investors \nYahoo said there's \"no assurance\" that Verizon will actually go through with the deal, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe filing also revealed that it's \"facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies\" over the hack -- and these could result in \"potential fines.\" \nVerizon defended the deal in late October at a Wall Street Journal Digital Conference, arguing that it \"absolutely\" still makes sense. \nVerizon offered to buy Yahoo's core internet assets in July. But two months later, Yahoo shocked its potential buyer with news that \"at least 500 million\" Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014 -- one of the largest consumer hacks ever.

      "text": "0 \nFor a couple of years now , Verizon has sold its own family of Android tablets under the Ellipsis name . Now it looks like that Ellipsis family will soon gain a new member. \nImages that show the Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD have made their way online. Shared by Evan Blass, the renders give us a look at the front, back, and sides of the Ellipsis 8 HD in both Midnight Blue and Arctic Gray color options. Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD in midnight blue (top) and arctic grey (bottom) pic.twitter.com/DlMIOlevSv \n— Evan Blass (@evleaks) November 10, 2016 \nThere aren’t any spec details for the Ellipsis 8 HD quite yet, but we can see that the device has front and rear cameras as well as 4G LTE connectivity. \nPast Ellipsis devices have teetered between the low-end and mid-range, and so it’s possible that this Ellipsis 8 HD will be do the same. Based on these leaked images, the Ellipsis 8 HD won’t be the best-looking Android tablet on the market, but it could be an affordable way to get a cellular-enabled tablet on Verizon’s network.

      "text": "Verizon might rescind its $4.8 billion offer to buy Yahoo, in part because of the damage resulting from the colossal hack of Yahoo customers, the technology company said Wednesday.\nYahoo said there’s “no assurance” that Verizon will actually go through with the deal, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe filing also revealed that it’s “facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies” over the hack — and these could result in “potential fines.”\nVerizon defended the deal in late October at a Wall Street Journal Digital Conference, arguing that it “absolutely” still makes sense.\nVerizon offered to buy Yahoo’s core internet assets in July. But two months later, Yahoo shocked its potential buyer with news that “at least 500 million” Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014 — one of the largest consumer hacks ever. Yahoo alerted the public a couple of days later.\nYahoo has since been hit with 23 consumer class action lawsuits over the hack, according to the company. Hackers were able to steal a list of customer names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, security questions and encoded versions of passwords.\nVerizon now “may seek to terminate the stock purchase agreement or renegotiate the terms of the sale” because of the “security incident,” Yahoo warned investors in Wednesday’s filing.\nYahoo stressed in its filing Wednesday that the hack is not having a “material adverse impact” on its business.\n“We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon,” a Yahoo spokesperson told CNNMoney.\nThe tech company’s stock value didn’t immediately shift on the news.\nYahoo blames a government for hacking into its computer network saying that its attacker was “a state-sponsored actor.”\nYahoo has struggled under the leadership of Marissa Meyer. Under Mayer’s direction, Yahoo has acquired dozens of startups — and spent lavishly on hiring celebrity journalists. But its bets haven’t paid off. One of its most notable assets, the social network Tumblr, has struggled for years to make a profit.\nVerizon declined to comment.\n37.774929 -122.419416 ",

      "text": "Email \nVerizon might rescind its $4.8 billion offer to buy Yahoo, in part because of the damage resulting from the colossal hack of Yahoo customers, the technology company said Wednesday. \nYahoo said there’s “no assurance” that Verizon will actually go through with the deal, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe filing also revealed that it’s “facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies” over the hack — and these could result in “potential fines.” \nVerizon defended the deal in late October at a Wall Street Journal Digital Conference, arguing that it “absolutely” still makes sense. \nVerizon offered to buy Yahoo’s core internet assets in July. But two months later, Yahoo shocked its potential buyer with news that “at least 500 million” Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014 — one of the largest consumer hacks ever. Yahoo alerted the public a couple of days later. \nYahoo has since been hit with 23 consumer class action lawsuits over the hack, according to the company. Hackers were able to steal a list of customer names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, security questions and encoded versions of passwords. \nVerizon now “may seek to terminate the stock purchase agreement or renegotiate the terms of the sale” because of the “security incident,” Yahoo warned investors in Wednesday’s filing. \nYahoo stressed in its filing Wednesday that the hack is not having a “material adverse impact” on its business. \n“We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon,” a Yahoo spokesperson told CNNMoney. \nThe tech company’s stock value didn’t immediately shift on the news. \nYahoo blames a government for hacking into its computer network saying that its attacker was “a state-sponsored actor.” \nYahoo has struggled under the leadership of Marissa Meyer. Under Mayer’s direction, Yahoo has acquired dozens of startups — and spent lavishly on hiring celebrity journalists. But its bets haven’t paid off. One of its most notable assets, the social network Tumblr, has struggled for years to make a profit. \nVerizon declined to comment.",

      "text": "by Karl Bode Thursday Nov 10 2016 08:30 EST \nAfter losing ground to cheaper prepaid competitors for the last several years, Verizon continues to beef up its own prepaid offerings -- this week unveiling new 5 and 10 GB options. Verizon recently proclaimed it lost 36,000 net customers last quarter, but managed to add 83,000 prepaid users -- thanks in large part to Verizon's decision to finally stop neglecting the segment. \nAccording to a Verizon announcement , the company is offering two new options: • 5GB plan: $50 a month gets you unlimited talk and text in the U.S., carryover data when you pay on time, mobile hotspot capabilities and international messaging to over 200 countries.\n• 10GB plan: $70 gets you all of the above, and also adds on unlimited calling to Canada and Mexico. \nThe new options comes on the heels of Verizon killing off two of its cheaper prepaid options , including a $30 smartphone plan that included unlimited voice and text but no data, and a $15 feature phone plan that included unlimited \"mobile web\" and 300 minutes or texts. \nThe company also recently unveiled a new prepaid \"PopData\" service that offers users unlimited LTE data service in either 30 minute ($2) or an hour ($3). These newest tiers will be made available starting this Sunday, November 13.",

      "text": "  \nYahoo has for the first time admitted that staff knew about the data breach two years before it was confirmed publicly, and that the incident could affect the $4.83bn sale deal with Verizon.   Your exclusive guide to CIO trends \nA collection of our most popular articles for IT leaders from the first few months of 2016, including: - Corporate giants recruit digitally-minded outsiders to drive transformation - Analytics platforms to drive strategy in 2016 - Next generation: The changing role of IT leaders.   \nThe internet firm confirmed the breach that is believed to have affected at least 500 million user accounts on 22 September 2016, claiming it first discovered the breach in August 2016, a month after the deal with Verizon. \nBut now, in a US Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) filing , Yahoo has admitted that some staff knew that a state-sponsored hacker had accessed its network shortly after an attack in 2014. \n“An Independent Committee of the Board, advised by independent counsel and a forensic expert, is investigating, among other things, the scope of knowledge [about the breach] in the company in 2014 and thereafter,” the company said in its filing. \n“In addition, the forensic experts are currently investigating certain evidence and activity that indicates an intruder, believed to be the same state-sponsored actor responsible for the security incident, created cookies that could have enabled such intruders to bypass the need for a password to access certain users’ accounts or account information.” \nThe Yahoo breach is believed to be the biggest publicly reported breach of its type to date, overtaking the previous record of just more than 359 million user details exposed in a 2008 breach at MySpace. \nConfirmation of the breach by Yahoo led to market speculation about whether the news would scupper the deal with Verizon or at least result in a call by the telecoms group for a reduction in price. \nAlthough Yahoo has consistently maintained that it is confident in the company’s value and is working towards integration with Verizon, the SEC filing indicates that the company admits that in a worst-case scenario, the breach could affect the acquisition deal. \nThe risks and uncertainties around the pending Verizon listed in the SEC filing include that: “Verizon may assert, or threaten to assert, rights or claims with respect to the stock purchase agreement as a result of facts relating to the security incident, and may seek to terminate the stock purchase agreement or renegotiate the terms of the sale transaction on that basis.” \nCommentators said while this does not necessarily mean Yahoo sees this as an immediate risk, it is interesting that Yahoo has now mentioned the possibility for the first time. Full cost still unknown \nYahoo also admitted that the full cost of the breach is still not clear. While the company said the breach cost only $1m in the third quarter of 2016 and that the incident “did not have a material adverse impact” on the quarter, it said it had subsequently incurred expenses related to remedial actions. \nThe company said it also expects to continue to incur investigatory, legal and other expenses associated with the breach. Yahoo said it will recognise and include these expenses as part of operating expenses as they are incurred, adding that the company does not have cyber security liability insurance. \nThe filing also recognises that Yahoo may also incur costs related to the 23 putative consumer-class action lawsuits that have been filed against the company in US and foreign courts. \nThe SEC filing has laid bare the true cost of cyber attacks, said Neil Fraser, UK manager at communications firm ViaSat . \n“The real risk doesn’t necessarily come from loss of intellectual property, or damage to business operations, but rather the ongoing harm to the organisation’s reputation. The cost might not be immediately apparent, but over time – or if the business is in a sensitive period – it could easily reach billions of dollars,” he said. \nThe stakes are so high, said Fraser, that organisations need to treat cyber attacks not only as a threat, but as an inevitability. \n“Whether an attacker is a state, state sponsored, a criminal enterprise or a single individual looking to boost their reputation, they can cause irreparable damage. In this case, an attacker who was looking to sell the stolen data for $1,800 could easily have cost Yahoo a million times that amount,” he said. Yahoo still ‘not taken action’ needed \nTo reduce these consequences, Fraser said organisations need to look at a number of issues, both technical and organisational. \n“Clearly this includes the security technology in use – from firewalls to antivirus to encryption of both the networks being used, but also the actual data so that any data that is stolen is essentially worthless,” he said. \nA study by Venafi Labs revealed that, by September 2016, Yahoo had still not taken the necessary action to ensure users are not exposed and that the hackers do not still have access to their systems and encrypted communications. \nThe researchers found Yahoo was still using MD5 cryptographic hashing function for many of its digital certificates , noting that this algorithm had been known to be vulnerable for several years and suffered from many serious and well-documented vulnerabilities. \nAlex Kaplunov, vice-president of engineering for Venafi, said major breaches such as the one suffered by Yahoo were often accompanied by relatively weak cryptographic controls. \nIn addition to security controls, Fraser said organisations also need to look at the training workers are given, and ensure they not only know how to reduce the risk of a successful attack, but how to react. \n“This includes isolating and identifying the origin, taking stock of what has been stolen or affected and making sure those who have been put at risk are notified and protected as soon as possible,” he said. \nIn conclusion, Fraser said Yahoo’s decision not to share information about the breach earlier may prove to be costly in the long run. \n“For whatever reason, it seems Yahoo has deliberately delayed sharing critical information. It is this which will have the greatest effect not only on customer trust, but ultimately its reputation,” he said. \nThe UK’s privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) is investigating the breach to understand the impact on UK citizens. \nAnnouncing the move in September 2016, information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said the number of people affected by the breach is “staggering” and demonstrates just how severe the consequences of a security hack can be. \n“There is a sobering and important message here for companies that acquire and handle personal data. People’s personal information must be securely protected under lock and key – and that key must be impossible for hackers to find,” she said.

The rise in high-profile security breaches has led to an increasingly worried UK public, calling for 24-hour monitoring of sensitive information . Considering that a data breach could happen to any company at any time , a plan of action is the best tactic.  Zine",

      "text": "{ 0 comments } \nThis just in from Verizon : \nAs part of their collaboration with the highly anticipated film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” Verizon invites consumers to view Rogue One™: Recon – A Star Wars™ 360 created by Lucasfilm’s ILMxLAB. The in-store content is a short, immersive 360 experience available exclusively at 1,400 Verizon stores across the country on Samsung Gear VR Headsets starting today, Thursday, Nov. 10, until Sunday, Nov. 13. \nAs an everyday X-wing pilot flying for the Rebellion, fans will be immersed in the vastness of space with only their R2 unit and wingman by their side. To avoid any spoilers, we can only say that the surprise ending is made for the big screen. It will be released widely on Verizon’s Facebook page Nov. 14. \nIn addition, the latest VR headset from Google – the Daydream View (available for sale online and in Verizon stores starting Nov. 10) – offers an opportunity to experience an interactive game/trailer for “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” (an upcoming movie based on the world of Harry Potter, out Nov. 18). \nI’m really looking forward to going to see “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” next week. I’ve been looking forward to it for a long time! \nIf you end up checking out these in-store demos, let me know what you think. Share this story",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — Verizon might rescind its $4.8 billion offer to buy Yahoo, in part because of the damage resulting from the colossal hack of Yahoo customers, the technology company said Wednesday. \nYahoo said there’s “no assurance” that Verizon will actually go through with the deal, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nThe filing also revealed that it’s “facing investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies” over the hack — and these could result in “potential fines.” \nVerizon defended the deal in late October at a Wall Street Journal Digital Conference, arguing that it “absolutely” still makes sense. \nVerizon offered to buy Yahoo’s core internet assets in July. But two months later, Yahoo shocked its potential buyer with news that “at least 500 million” Yahoo user accounts had been stolen by a hacker in 2014 — one of the largest consumer hacks ever. Yahoo alerted the public a couple of days later. \nYahoo has since been hit with 23 consumer class action lawsuits over the hack, according to the company. Hackers were able to steal a list of customer names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, security questions and encoded versions of passwords. \nVerizon now “may seek to terminate the stock purchase agreement or renegotiate the terms of the sale” because of the “security incident,” Yahoo warned investors in Wednesday’s filing. \nYahoo stressed in its filing Wednesday that the hack is not having a “material adverse impact” on its business. \n“We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon,” a Yahoo spokesperson told CNNMoney. \nThe tech company’s stock value didn’t immediately shift on the news. \nYahoo blames a government for hacking into its computer network saying that its attacker was “a state-sponsored actor.” \nYahoo has struggled under the leadership of Marissa Meyer. Under Mayer’s direction, Yahoo has acquired dozens of startups — and spent lavishly on hiring celebrity journalists. But its bets haven’t paid off. One of its most notable assets, the social network Tumblr, has struggled for years to make a profit. \nVerizon declined to comment. ",

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. \nThe information in this report is provided \"as is\" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

The slate is available for purchase starting today in Midnight Blue and Arctic Grey colors for $249.99 or for $10.41 per month for 24 months on device payment. The Ellipsis 8 HD leaked earlier today, but we didn't know when exactly Verizon will make it available for purchase. Well, it looks like Verizon customers didn't have to wait too long, as the slate has already been listed on the carrier's website.In case you're wondering what the Ellipsis 8 HD has to offer for the price you pay, here are a few highlights as per Verizon's announcement.First of all, the Ellipsis 8 HD will ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow onboard. An Android 7.0 Nougat update would be great, but it hasn't been confirmed yet.Instead, we know the tablet is powered by a decent octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor , coupled with 3GB RAM and 16GB of internal memory (expandable up to 128GB via microSD card).The HD version of the older Ellipsis 8 sports an 8-inch display that supports full HD (1080p) resolution. There's also an 8-megapixel camera on the back with f/2.0 lens, while in the front the tablet features a 5-megapixel selfie camera.Verizon's tablet accommodates a pretty generous 5,100 mAh battery under the hood, which can't be removed though, but should offer up to 14.5 hours usage time or up to 14 days of standby time. It's also XLTE ready. Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD Popular galleries",

      "text": " 14 AM EST Fitch to Rate Verizon Owner Trust 2016-2; Issues Presale Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Verizon Owner Trust 2016-2 (VZOT 2016-2): \nFitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Verizon Owner Trust 2016-2 (VZOT 2016-2): \n--$1,200,000,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; \n--$100,000,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable; \n--$100,000,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable. \nKEY RATING DRIVERS \nReceivable Quality: The VZOT 2016-2 trust pool consists of 100% DPPs with 24-month original terms that are originated and serviced by subsidiaries of Verizon Communications Inc. The statistical pool exhibits a weighted average FICO score of 709 and a weighted average remaining term of 24 months. Of the statistical pool, Fitch considers 31% to be subprime and, as part of the worst case pool, this can grow to more than 40%. New receivables meeting the eligibility requirements will be purchased into the trust for two years or until an amortization event occurs. \nFitch assigned a base case default rate of 4.0% for the statistical pool and 4.5% and 5.0% for the two worst case portfolios it analyzed. We applied a stress multiple of 6.0x at the 'AAAsf' stress level, reflecting mainly the two-year revolving period; the use of proxy data as limited data history was available for the DPPs; and the view that customer payment behavior on the DPPs could be negatively affected by a Verizon insolvency. \nVerizon Rating Dependency: While not directly linked, the ratings of the notes face greater exposure than other consumer loan transactions to the credit profile and market position of Verizon Communications Inc. (currently rated 'A-/F2'/Outlook Stable), whose subsidiaries act as originators, the servicer and network operator. In Fitch's view, this can take the form of (1) indirect exposure through customers changing their payment behavior in the event of a Verizon insolvency and (2) directly through the risk of device payment upgrade contract remittances not being made to the trust following Verizon's insolvency. \nFor these reasons, a downgrade of Verizon Communications Inc. could affect Fitch's credit ratings of the notes. While a limited downgrade of Verizon is unlikely to result in a downgrade of the senior notes, a multi-notch downgrade - particularly to speculative grade - will increase the likelihood of a downgrade of the senior notes below 'AAAsf'. However, there is no automatic credit linkage, as other factors such as (1) the strengths of Verizon's network, (2) a reduced revolving period, (3) lower than assumed direct exposure through the upgrade program (also considering the additional credit enhancement [CE] to cover any such risk, which is 6% at closing) and (4) the available CE if already increased during the amortization phase could lessen the rating impact in the future. \nStrong Servicing Capabilities: Cellco Partnership, as servicer of the VZOT 2016-2 pool receivables, has a long track record of servicing consumer cell phone contracts. Due to this factor and Verizon's position as the largest wireless service provider in the U.S., Fitch considers Verizon's servicing operations of cell phone contracts to be a strength compared to its peers. \nCRITERIA VARIATIONS \nDue to the importance of the delinquency trigger in the transaction's structure, Fitch distinctively modelled 61+ day delinquencies, rather than solely the assets that ultimately default. Use of such criteria variation impacts the ratings by at most one notch, and only in certain modelling scenarios. \nRATING SENSITIVITIES \nUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or charge-offs on customer accounts could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of CE and remaining loss coverage levels available to the investments. Decreased CE may make certain ratings on the investments susceptible to potential negative rating actions, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. \nFitch conducts sensitivity analysis by stressing a transaction's initial base case charge-off assumption by an additional 25% and additional 50%, and examining the rating implications. The increases of the base case charge-offs are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected deterioration of a transaction's performance. \nDuring the sensitivity analysis, Fitch examines the magnitude of the multiplier compression by projecting the expected cash flows and loss coverage levels over the life of investments under higher than the initial base case charge-off assumptions. Fitch models cash flows with the revised charge-off estimates while holding constant all other modelling assumptions. \nUnder the 25% stress, the senior notes would likely be downgraded, while remaining high investment grade. The ratings on the class B would fall to 'Asf' and the C notes would migrate to 'A-sf'. Under the 50% stress, the class A would be downgraded to 'Asf', while the subordinate notes would both fall to 'A-sf.' \nUSE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 \nFitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing certain information with respect to 1,100 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis.

      "text": "Verizon \nRemember the Verizon Ellipsis tablet? No? That’s okay, most of us don’t either. It was one of the cheaper carrier-enabled tablets that Verizon pushed out a few years ago. Not a particularly nice tablet, but it was an affordable option for someone that wanted a connected tablet to add to their plan. \nThe original Ellipsis had to do well enough to warrant a sequel, and it looks like we’re going to see an Ellipsis 8 HD soon. Press images of the tablet in midnight blue and arctic gray have leaked, showing off a tablet with a pretty significant design change compared to the original. \nAs you can see compared to the first Ellipsis tablet, it’s much more squared off and much cleaner. In fact, I don’t see a single Verizon logo anywhere on the Ellipsis HD, which is a drastic improvement from the ugly branding on the chin of the original. \nNo word yet on specs, pricing, or availability, but don’t expect anything to compete on the high end. It’s more than likely going to be another decent budget tablet as an option for Verizon customers, and if you’re in the market for that kind of thing you should definitely be happy about getting another option. There’s not much to pick from right now. About the Author: Jared Peters \nBorn in southern Alabama, Jared spends his working time selling phones and his spare time writing about them.
