      "text": "Online Communities Fuel 28 Percent YoY Growth, 84 Percent Rise in Discussion Traffic for Microsoft User Groups\nWashington, D.C. (PRWEB) November 29, 2016\nHigher Logic today announced that Dynamic Communities , the administrative organization behind a number of Microsoft software user groups, has seen faster growth and higher retention as a result of implementing the Higher Logic online community platform to drive increasing communication and engagement among its user group members.\nDynamic Communities is the administrative organization behind professional software user groups such as the Dynamics AX User Group (AXUG), the Dynamics GP User Group (GPUG), the Dynamics CRM User Group (CRMUG), the Dynamics NAV User Group (NAVUG), and more. More than 95,000 members participate in Dynamic Communities-managed user groups.\n“Thanks to Higher Logic, we are delivering greater value to our members every day,” said Michelle Lowry, director of community and member engagement at Dynamic Communities. “Meanwhile, we are able to continue to grow our communities at a rapid pace without having to constantly grow our team. This is an excellent return on investment.”\nDynamic Communities recognized the need to foster communication and engagement among its association members and turned to Higher Logic to enable members to reach out to one another, engage in discussions, and provide feedback to communications from site administrators. Higher Logic offered an intuitive, easy-to-use community discussion board, vital management capabilities, and fixed pricing so costs would not increase as more members or staff accessed the system.\nAfter launching Higher Logic for one user group, CRMUG, Dynamic Communities quickly launched communities for AXUG, GPUG, and NAVUG. Across these four user groups, their Higher Logic-powered communities delivered 28 percent year-over-year growth and an 84 percent rise in discussion traffic. By leaving some of the discussion boards open to the public, search engines like Google and Bing can crawl them, leading to an amazing increase of 1,319 percent in site visits across all the user groups – without any investment in SEO.\n“Like hundreds of other organizations, Dynamic Communities has discovered that our cloud-based online community solution offers an extraordinary opportunity to foster communication and engagement,” said Higher Logic CEO Rob Wenger. “Our platform also provides a significant strategic advantage for the community host through a simple management interface, automation rules, and a range of capabilities administrators can use to enable members to help themselves.”\nRead the entire case study, “ Dynamic Communities Spurs Engagement and Conversation for Microsoft User Groups. ”\nAbout Higher Logic\nHigher Logic is an industry leader in cloud-based community platforms. Organizations worldwide use Higher Logic to bring people all together, by giving their community a home where they can interact, share ideas, answer questions and stay connected. Our goal is to help your organization with deeper engagement and meaningful interactions for your members, customers and prospects.

      "text": "Clip Layer Allows you to Grab Snippets From Anywhere   Alexander Maxham \nMicrosoft Garage has been on a roll in recent months, putting out some really interesting apps onto the Google Play Store for everyone to use. The latest creation from the Microsoft Garage is Clip Layer. Just as you’d expect from the name, Clip Layer allows you to clip snippets from different apps, web pages and anywhere else, on your Android smartphone to share with someone, or just simply store on your device. \nIt’s pretty simple, the app launches over any screen (it’ll need that permission granted in Settings > Accessibility), and this allows you to select, copy and do whatever you’d like with the snippets you care about. Clip Layer allows you to copy that snippet to the clipboard, and add it to things like Todoist, Wunderlist and other apps. Of course, it can also be sent through emails, shared on social media websites and so much more. It does use the native Android sharing protocol, so you are able to share it through any of the apps installed on your smartphone. \nThe app was developed by Steve Won, who also released Hub Keyboard through Microsoft Garage already. He found it difficult to select some objects in certain apps, as some apps have blocked the ability to select things. In the instance that you want to select a picture, and download it, or share it elsewhere, he wasn’t able to do so easily. That’s where Clip Layer came into play. As Won states in the announcement on Microsoft’s website, “apps being silo’d is a common problem, as there is no standard way to share or pull information across apps”. He also noted that there are more and more apps coming into app stores like the Google Play Store these days, but they all have the same issue, in regards to sharing information, and this is due to the fact that apps are “designed to work independent of each other.” \nClip Layer, like Microsoft Garage’s other Android apps, is available on the Google Play Store completely free. There are no in-app purchases at all here. It’s also a fairly small app, weighing in at just under 7MB in size.",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) ( NYSE: PFE – Free Report ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) ( NASDAQ: MSFT – Free Report ), Priceline ( NASDAQ: PCLN – Free Report ), Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ) ( NASDAQ: EXPE – Free Report ) and United Continental ( NYSE: UAL – Free Report ).

Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog: Top Research Reports for Today Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Pfizer ( NYSE: PFE – Free Report ), Microsoft ( NASDAQ: MSFT – Free Report ) and Priceline ( NASDAQ: PCLN – Free Report ). Pfizer ’s shares have been showing some weakness recently. Pfizer’s third quarter results missed expectations for both sales and earnings. But the analyst emphasizes that Pfizer is strengthening its product portfolio as well as pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals. The Sep 2016 acquisition of Medivation has strengthened Pfizer’s cancer franchise. Meanwhile, new products like Ibrance should do well and drive revenues. However, headwinds remain in the form of genericization, pricing pressure and rising competition, which will continue to hamper top-line growth. (You can read the full research report on Pfizer here . ) Microsoft ’s shares have gained more than 8% this year. Microsoft reported impressive first-quarter 2017 results driven by strong cloud growth. The analyst likes its continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products. Additionally, the expansion of Microsoft HoloLens in 6 new markets will improve the company's position in the augmented and virtual reality space. Further, the anticipated completion of the LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD ) acquisition will boost Microsoft's presence in the social media market. However, execution and foreign exchange risks remain despite its cloud focus. (You can read the full research report on Microsoft here. ) Priceline shares have surged, increasing by more than 19% year-to-date. Priceline reported strong third quarter results. Both agency and merchant businesses showed strong momentum. The analyst likes Priceline’s strong position in international markets, good execution, prudent marketing strategy and strong financial position. The secular growth trend in the online travel booking market and growth opportunities in the domestic market are other positives. At the same time, weaker ADRs, macro headwinds, increasing advertising spend and occupancy tax-related litigation remain overhangs.

      "text": "By Cage Appleby Neowin LLC · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft Garage is back at it again with a brand new app for Android. This time around, the Garage team have launched a new app called \"Clip Layer\" that aims to improve Android's copy-paste abilities. \nAs the name may suggest, Clip Layer allows you to copy text or information from different apps, web pages, and other sources on your Android smartphone to share or paste elsewhere on your device. \nIt's a simplistic app that may prove convenient to users who need to snip information they may care about but were previously unable to do so. For example, hashtag hoarders using Instagram may find Clip Layer useful to copy and tags directly from other users' posts into their own content. Clip Layer can also save clipped content to Wunderlist, enabling access from other devices. \nThe app was crafted by Steve Won, a senior designer with Microsoft's Office team, who was also behind the Hub Keyboard for iOS and Android . He noticed a couple of problems copying text from within apps and wanted to offer a simpler way to do so. Won also noted that there has been a flood of new apps being brought into the Google Play Store contributing to the dilemma regarding to sharing information between apps. \nYou can download Clip Layer from the Google Play Store . To read more about the project, head over to Microsoft Blogs.",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version California Schools \nSACRAMENTO—More than 8,000 California public schools and districts are eligible to share $11.9 million in the latest round of Education Technology K–12 Voucher Program funding, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson announced today. Funds are available through a 2003 antitrust settlement agreement between Microsoft Corporation and California consumers and businesses. \nThe list of eligible and potentially eligible schools and districts is available on the California Department of Education K-12 Voucher Program: Funding Web page. Today’s announcement is the fifth distribution of the Microsoft settlement funds. The first four distributions, in 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2015, totaled more than $470 million. \n“These funds have improved our students’ education by allowing California to wire our classrooms, modernize instruction, successfully give online tests to 3.1 million students, and make progress in closing the digital divide,” Torlakson said. “I encourage all eligible schools and districts to apply for these technology funds.” \nUnder the terms of the settlement, these funds are to be used to assist K–12 districts to acquire and support education technology that improves teaching and student achievement. \nSeveral factors make schools eligible for these funds: If they were previously eligible for the Education Technology K–12 Voucher Program , which provides money to schools and districts to purchase qualified education technology, including computer hardware and software, and provide training in the use of technology in the classroom. All public K–12 schools, county offices of education, direct-funded charter schools, and State Special Schools in which at least 40 percent of the certified 2015–16 enrollment qualified for free or reduced price meals through the National School Lunch Program. All public high schools in California that serve students from public elementary, middle, and junior high schools in California in which at least 40 percent of the certified 2015–16 enrollment qualified for free or reduced price meals through the National School Lunch Program. \nAn education technology plan is no longer required for eligibility. However, schools and districts are strongly encouraged to develop and use technology plans. An online Technology Plan Builder \nis freely available to all K–12 schools.

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 17 screenshots Visualize simple to complex sets of data, organize them and generate professional-looking reports that can be shared via the Power BI platform Microsoft Power BI Desktop is a powerful data analytics and reporting tool designed as a companion desktop application for Microsoft’s Power BI service. It features interactive data visualization tools and data querying capabilities that work together to assist you in creating comprehensive, professional-looking reports that can be shared with business partners and customers. A plethora of sources to import data from With a look that resembles other Microsoft-signed apps in the Office suite, Power BI Desktop provides one-click access to the available data importing and visualization tools, alongside a generous multi-page workspace where elements and objects can be moved around using simple drag and drop actions. The range of data sources Power BI Desktop supports is more than enough to meet the requirements of the most demanding users, covering Excel workbooks, CSV, XML or text documents, simple folders, databases (SQL Server, Access, Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Microsoft Azure), Sharepoint, Active Directory, Microsoft Exchange, Hadoop, Google Analytics, Salesforce, Github, cloud services, and the list does not end here, as you can also enter data manually by creating new tables. In other words, Power BI Desktop is extremely versatile when it comes to connecting to your data. Create compelling and rich visual representations Designed as an advanced reporting tool, Power BI Desktop enables you to generate visual representations of complex data, which are much more easy to understand compared to raw tables. It comprises an assortment of graph and chart types, including maps, cards, and gauges. And if that is not enough, you can import additional custom visualizations. Power BI Desktop provides one-click access to chart elements (axis data, legend, colors, values, filters, reference lines, labels, and so on), allowing full customization of the resulting report. You can choose which fields to include in a chart and which to ignore, and enrich your pages with text boxes, images or shapes. Data sets are in a similar way to database tables which allows you to configure relationships between fields. Powerful reporting tool aimed at business users With a modern-looking interface and accessible options, Microsoft Power BI Desktop offers an advanced reporting tool that can handle large data sets from various sources, combining them into a single comprehensive report that can be shared via the Power BI platform or exported to Pyramid Server. Unfortunately, reports cannot be saved in any other format. The desktop edition does not require signing in to a business Power BI account unless the user intends to publish the generated reports. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Internet Explorer 9 or later Memory (RAM): At least 1 GB available, 1.5 GB or more recommended. Display: At least 1440x900 or 1600x900 (16:9) recommended. Lower resolutions such as 1024x768 or 1280x800 are not recommended, as certain controls (such as closing the startup screen) display beyond those resolutions. CPU: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster x86- or x64-bit processor recommended. Office 365 user ID and password LIMITATIONS IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION A business account and a Office 365 user ID and password are required to publish reports.

      "text": "report malware 22 screenshots A powerful operating system released by Microsoft in an attempt to provide users with a unified interface for all their devices, such as computers, tablets or smartphones Microsoft has always been in a continuous quest to designing and releasing software solutions that can be enjoyed by all types of users, while in more recent years they also tried a new approach: that of creating the same GUI for multiple devices. Windows 10 is meant to continue this trend, as it provides various enhancements over the previous operating systems with the purpose to make the whole experience more intuitive no matter if it runs on computers, tablets or smartphones. Windows 8-inspired looks, yet with multiple discrete tweaks Those who are familiarized with Windows 8 will surely recognize some of the interface elements, such as the squared corners of the windows. Users who are accustomed to Windows 8.1 are bound to notice the Start button in the lower left corner; nonetheless, one of the greatest achievements of Windows 10 is that it features a fully-functional Start Menu, whereas the menu that was available in Windows 8.1 can still be accessed by right-clicking the Start button. The Modern apps are still available, yet they run in windowed mode, so just like Windows 8.1, it allows users to minimize them to the taskbar and close them using the traditional X button from the upper right corner. Multiple desktops and snap enhancements to increase performance Another innovation of Windows 10 are the so-called multiple desktops that can help users reduce the clutter on their screen. In other words, users can open several apps for work projects, then create a clean desktop where different programs can be launched - this way, although all the apps are running the in background, they are neatly grouped and you can switch between the desktops with ease. Moreover, Windows 10 also features snap enhancements that can help users snap up to 4 windows to their screen, while keeping all of them visible. It goes without saying that if only 3 programs are required, they can still be snapped to one’s liking or using the layout suggested by the OS. Restore the Start Menu and enjoy many additional tweaks All in all, Windows 10 is meant to provide users with the Start Menu they missed when Windows 8 was released, so that they can search for local apps and files just like they did in Windows 7 , yet offering them results from the Internet as well. The other enhancements are meant to make the OS run smoothly on multiple types of devices and to improve overall performance in a subtle way (for instance, the Modern Photos app is no longer just an image viewer since it also comes with editing functions). For some editions, the official ISO download links have been removed, but you can still download ESD files that allow you to upgrade to Windows 10. If you want to get the corresponding ISO, you only need to follow these steps: - download the ESD package that matches your current 7 or 8.1 edition and language - download ESD ToolKit and unpack it, then move the downloaded ESD to the same folder where ESD ToolKit was unzipped - run ESDToolKit_gui.bat, then follow the provided steps You can find more details in this article . SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver Display: 800x600 LIMITATIONS IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION 30 days trial New in Windows 10 1607 Build 14931 Insider Preview: We have fixed these two issues with KB3195841 we has also been released to Windows Update: FIXED: While using Narrator and Groove Music, if you navigate to the progress bar while a song is playing then Narrator will continually speak the progress of the song e.g. update with the current time of the progress bar every second. The result is you will be unable to listen to the song or hear any other control you navigate to. FIXED: For keyboard users, using tab to navigate the Settings app will not work in this build. The arrow keys should work as a temporary workaround.",

Play a game on any mode (I have experienced this on play now, hut online and draft modes), select NHL94 or Hybrid controls and recreate above scenario. What happens when the bug occurs?

      "title": "Surface Studio iFixit teardown: ARM CPU, upgradable hard drive",
      "text": "Reddit \nSome of the very buyers of Microsoft ‘s new Surface Studio all-in-one PC will be receiving their orders soon, and the teardown experts at iFixit were among the first to get their hands on one. They wasted little time in diving beyond that 28-inch touchscreen display in their effort to rate the device’s repairability. Like most compact PCs and laptops these days, most components are locked in place, preventing any kind of repairs/modifications by users, but iFixit still came away with a few surprises. \nThe first is that while the Surface Studio uses Intel’s x86 architecture, it also makes use of an ARM chip to power the PixelSense display. Also comforting to know is that screen can be replaced if it’s damaged, but it certainly won’t come cheap. \nAs far as being upgradable, Microsoft seems to have done all it can to prevent users from adding newer components down the line. The RAM, CPU, and GPU are all soldered to the motherboard, so the configuration you pay for when ordering is what you’ll be stuck with for some time. That’s something those considering the $3,000 “lower-end” model, which tops out at 8GB of RAM, should consider. \nFortunately, that doesn’t apply to the hybrid storage, which combines a SSD with a traditional hard drive. Because this is stored in the base of the PC, users can replace it without needing to mess with the display. While the Surface Studio ships with a total of 64GB of storage, there’s no reason that couldn’t be increased to 128GB. \nIn the end, iFixit gave Microsoft’s newest desktop computer a repairability score of 5 out of 10. While this may seem low, it’s actually a better rating than the company’s other Surface devices, and it matches the repairability score given to Apple’s 5K iMac teardown.",

      "text": "(This article was first published on Revolutions , and kindly contributed to R-bloggers) \nIf you're already familiar with R, but struggling with out-of-memory or performance problems when attempting to analyze large data sets, you might want to check out this new EdX course, Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R Server , presented by my colleague Seth Mottaghinejad . In the course, you'll learn how to build models using the RevoScaleR package, and deploy those models to production environments like Spark and SQL Server. The course is self-paced with videos, tutorials and tests, and is free to audit.\n\n(By the way, if you don't already know R, you might want to check out the courses Introduction to R for Data Science and Programming in R for Data Science first.)\nThe RevoScaleR package isn't available on CRAN: it's included with Microsoft R Server and Microsoft R Client. You can download and use Microsoft R Client for free, which provides an installation of R with the RevoScaleR library built in and loaded when you start the session. An R IDE is also recommended: you can use R Tools for Visual Studio or RStudio .\nThe course is open now, and you can get started at EdX at the link below.\nEdX: Analyzing Big Data with Microsoft R Server \n\nTo leave a comment for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: Revolutions .

By Alex Osborn \nAn open beta for Gigantic will launch for Xbox One and Windows 10 on December 8, Perfect World Entertainment has announced. \nThe free-to-play MOBA will release as part of Microsoft’s Game Preview Program in both North America and Europe. Gigantic offers cross-platform play, allowing those on Xbox One and PC to play together. \nThe open beta will feature a total of three maps and six characters from a 16-charater roster that will rotate on a weekly basis. Players will be able to customize their hero's style of play through character skill trees, as they work alongside their team members to claim points around the map in an effort to control the field. In order to defeat the opposition, the team of heroes must overtake the enemy's Guardian. \nA closed beta test will kick off this coming Thursday, December 1 at 9am PT and run until Sunday, December 4 at 11:59pm PT. The game is also set to release on Arc (PC Windows) at some point after the open beta, on a date that has yet to be announced. \nFor more on Motiga's free-to-play MOBA, check out IGN's hands-on impressions of Gigantic . \nAlex Osborn is a freelance writer for IGN.

      "text": "Intellitec Solutions, based in Wilmington, DE, will host their thirteenth annual Microsoft Dynamics SL User Group on December 1st at the University & Whist club in Wilmington, DE. The success of past sessions, combined with the keen interest in seeing the future direction of Microsoft Dynamics SL, is expected to drive attendance to more than 50 clients. “End of the year can be a difficult time for a number of our clients, whether it is closing the books, or planning for the future”, said Rick Sommer, President of Intellitec Solutions. “For this reason in particular, we have always found our year end user group quite popular.”\nThe agenda will feature important topics for Microsoft Dynamics SL. Among the highlights will be a look at Dynamics SL2015 CU2, and what clients should be aware of regarding the differences between On Premise, Hosted, SaaS and Azure as it relates to Dynamics SL. There will also be information on new reporting tools, Tips & Tricks and several other training topics. The ever popular presentation on how to close the books properly in Dynamics SL will help round out the day.\nIn addition to the presentations, there will be time for clients to interact with other users of Microsoft Dynamics, and a chance to meet one on one with Intellitec staff.

      "text": "November 30, 2016 0 Microsoft has pushed Windows 10 Mobile Build 14393.479 (10.0.14393.479) to Insiders in Release Preview Ring. We last reported about sightings of this build on BuildFeed. Though two newer Windows 10 Builds Build 14393.555 and Build 14393.571 were also seen on BuildFeed. Microsoft has pushed Build 14393.479 to Insiders for testing and feedback. For the next Windows 10 Mobile CU build release, non-insiders may have to however wait till December 6. It will be interesting to see which one of these three builds makes the cut or will it be an even newer build. The changelog for this build is not known yet but we will update this article when we come to know about the changelog. Thanks Matheus for the tip. Cheers Related ",

      "text": "Igor Bonifacic \nNovember 29, 2016 4:19pm \nWhile Microsoft’s Surface Studio may have started shipping to U.S. customers, Canadian consumers will have to wait into 2017 to get their hands on Redmond’s latest Windows PC. In the meantime, if Surface Studio is something that interests you, iFixit’s latest teardown takes a look inside the machine. \nFirst, the bad news: like with Apple’s new Touch Bar MacBook Pro , Surface Studio’s main components are almost impossible to replace or upgrade. The CPU, GPU and RAM are all soldered to the computer’s main motherboard. \nNow for the good news: Surface Studio features one M.2 solid state drive and a larger SATA hard drive, both of which users can easily access and replace with off the shelf components, allowing them to upgrade their storage in the future. \nFor Canadians consumers, the main takeaway here is to consider how much RAM they need carefully. While the models with 16GB and 32GB of RAM are more expensive, short of buying an entirely new computer, there’s no easy way to upgrade to add RAM after buying one of these machines. \nWorst case scenario here is that someone spends $3000 to buy a Surface Studio and starts to feel their computer is inadequate after only one to two years. \nAfter completing its teardown, iFixit awarded Microsoft’s newest computer a five out of 10 repairability score. \nImages courtesy of iFixit . Source iFixit ChrisPollard77 \nThe good news is you only have to buy the amount of RAM you want. m.2 and 2.5″ SSDs are fairly cheap and easy upgrades down the road. Even 8GB of ram is perfectly usable, even in memory hungry graphics programs (less so with video editors, yes) like Photoshop. That’s where running a pair of SSDs will make a huge difference. Nice that an m.2 SSD can be paired up with the standard size SATA drives. Jason \nAt least Microsoft knows people may want to swap or upgrade components unlike some fruit based company mwahahahaha",

      "title": "Windows 10 Anniversary Update declared Current Branch for Business",
      "text": "Microsoft announced yesterday that it has declared the newest feature version of its Windows 10 operating system, the Anniversary Update edition or Windows 10 version 1607, the Current Branch for Business.\nTo fully understand what this means, you need to know the terminology that Microsoft uses when it comes to Windows 10 servicing .\nAny new feature upgrade that Microsoft releases finds its way to the Current Branch (CB) immediately. The bulk of home users are running systems with that servicing option, but it is available to all versions of Windows 10.\nBusinesses and Enterprises can configure individual computer systems to be part of Current Branch to receive these upgrades early, for instance for testing purposes.\n\nWindows 10 Pro and higher may be set to the Current Branch for Business (CBB) servicing option. This delays upgrades for about four months before they are made available to these systems.\nAll that is required for that is to check the \"defer feature updates\" option in one of two ways:\nUse Windows-I to open the Settings app. Navigate to Update & Security. Click on \"Advanced options\". Check \"Defer feature updates\". \nYou may set the option using the Group Policy Editor as well:\nTap on the Windows-key, type gpedit.msc and hit the Enter-key. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Defer Windows Updates. Double-click on \"Select when Feature Updates are received\". Set to \"enabled\", and switch from \"Current Branch\" to \"Current Branch for Business\" on the window that opens.  \nThe declaration pushes the Windows 10's Anniversary Update to Current Branch for Business systems.\nA third branch, called Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) is a special Enterprise edition in which upgrades can be deferred for at least ten years.\nMichael Niehaus announced the change on the Windows for IT Pros blog .\nToday I am pleased to announce that Windows 10 1607, also known as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, has been declared as Current Branch for Business (CBB) and is ready for deployment. This is an important milestone and signifies that this version has been validated by customers, OEMs and partners giving organizations the confidence to further accelerate deployments at scale.\nTo reach this milestone, we have addressed nearly a thousand items of feedback from all types of customers, including enterprises performing pilot deployments. With hundreds of millions of devices already running the CBB version 14393.447 installed by KB 3200970 or any later update, as indicated in the Windows 10 Release Info page, organizations can be assured Windows 10 1607 is fully ready for them.\nNow You : Do you install Windows updates or upgrades directly?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Windows 10 Anniversary Update declared Current Branch for Business appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft's New Clip Layer Android App Lets You Copy Any Text to Screen The app is available exclusively for Android users It has been made by the Microsoft Garage Team It can copy any text on your smartphone screen \nMicrosoft's Garage Team has launched a new app for Android users called Clip Layer. The app essentially allows you to copy text from any screen - including ones that don't allow selection - and paste it in any third-party app of your choice. \nThe Microsoft Clip Layer app is 1.64MB in size and is available via Google Play . It works similar to Universal Copy, but seems simpler to use. On installing Clip Layer, it takes over as your assist trigger, which means long pressing your Home Button will now trigger the app and not 'Now On Tap' as is the case on many Android smartphones. If that is not too much of a loss, then Clip Layer is a useful app to have on your smartphone. \nOn triggering Microsoft's new Clip Layer app, the entire text on the screen is read and is enabled for copying. The user can select the different text areas it wants to copy on the screen and then select the 'T' button on the top right edge to see what they have selected. This selected text can then be copied to the clipboard, and then pasted to friends on any IM app, shared on Facebook, or saved as a snippet for later use. It's worth noting that Pixel users will lose their ability to trigger Google Assistant by long pressing the Home Button, if they decide to activate Clip Layer on their smartphones.",

      "text": "Microsoft announced today that it had updated its Skype for Business app on iOS. The update brings the usual performance improvements and tweaks, but the important change is Microsoft’s use of Apple’s Call Kit, which lets users answer Skype for Business calls directly from the lockscreen.\nYes, answering calls from the lockscreen is something new for iOS users and was only introduced to developers after the launch of iOS via Call Kit. In its blog post , Microsoft has detailed how it has taken advantage of this new feature.\n\nIndeed it makes for a more native calling experience on iOS, which in the case of Skype for Business lets users seamlessly use their personal smartphone as a business phone. Skype for Business calls will appear as regular calls along with the caller’s name on the lockscreen. Another handy feature is one tap access to the Skype for Business app via the calling interface.\n\nAdditionally users will also get access to built-in IT and user controls. This allows users to not receive Skype for Business calls on the lockscreen if the situation demands for the same. IT admins can disable this integration for their users through a policy, and app users can also control it in the settings.\nThe post Microsoft’s Skype for Business iOS app updated: Gets lockscreen calls and more appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Downloads \n11.1 k Microsoft Remote Desktop is an official application from Microsoft that, as its name would suggest, lets you control your PC directly from your Android device. To do so, you only need to configure the device and associate it with the PC you want to control. Microsoft Remote Desktop is optimized for use with Windows 8, and its tiled interface works much better with a tactile screen than the classic Windows desktop (XP, Vista, 7). This means the app is especially recommended for users of this operating system. The audio and video streaming quality you get on your mobile device, depending on your Internet connection, is excellent. Also, you get a totally secure connection thanks to the Network Layer Authentication technology that works to protect your privacy. Network Layer Authentication is a very complete tool that makes controlling your Windows PC remotely on your Android device easy. Also, all the tactile features from Windows 8 make its use that much faster on a mobile device. Opinions about Microsoft Remote Desktop No opinions about Microsoft Remote Desktop . Be the first!

      "text": "Pinterest \nMicrosoft has announced a new feature for its PowerPoint desktop app on Windows: collaborative editing. A feature that was previously only possible using PowerPoint Online. As it suggests, this feature allows people with jobs to edit their PowerPoint presentations in together in real-time. \nIt seems that collaborative editing for PowerPoint on Windows is similar to that of Word. It’s worth noting, however, that this new update is currently only made available for folks who are a part of the Office Insider program. Microsoft has not mentioned when the feature will be made available for users outside the program – but it shouldn’t be too long. \nIn addition to the exciting collaborative editing feature for PowerPoint on Windows, Microsoft has also introduced a new feature that allows folks on Android and iOS to know when someone is trying to gain access to their ‘shared’ Word, PowerPoint and Excel files. Unfortunately, this feature is, again, only currently available for Android users in the Office Insider program. iOS folks will be receiving similar updates sometime in December. \nIt seems that Microsoft is starting to push towards implementing the collaborative editing feature on more Office apps soon, given how Google Docs is currently offering the same feature across most of its productivity apps.",

      "text": "Sign up for our weekly news updates by entering your email: Advertisement Microsoft Surface Phone May Sport Snapdragon 835 Processor With Better Performance [VIDEO] Microsoft Surface Phone is now rumoured to have Snapdragon 835 Processor alongside Quick Charging 4.0 By Soutrik Das , EnStars on Nov 30, 2016 02:04 AM EST Microsoft's upcoming Surface Phone is reported to have Snapdragon 835 Processor alongside two variants of 6GB and 4GB RAM. (Photo : Getty Images/David Ramos) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has been known for its enormous creations in technology. Though it has reached to superlative heights with its Computing devices, but it has not been able to spell the magic that much with its smartphone segment. However, Microsoft is trying to boom its mobile section up as well with its upcoming sensation Microsoft Surface Phone. \nAccording to IBT , the smartphone is supposed to be equipped with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor which saw the lights of the day on November 17 this year. The CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella has showcased his hopes with Surface Phone to achieve a better position in the Smartphone market. \nAs per another report by Nokia Power User , the phone will come with two variants, the primary one will sport 4GB of RAM space whereas the secondary version will come with 6GB RAM. They are also said to support Quick charging 4.0. The version with 6GB RAM will also be able to run x86 apps in Continuum. \nThe upcoming surface phone is reported to be powered by Windows 10 Mobile Operating System but it is still not clear whether or not it will get to see the update of Redstone 3 when the OS upgrade releases. The system attributes will be running on 64-bit, as per the rumours. \nThe phone is also said to feature a shiny 5.5 QHD display. With the new processor, the phone is said to have a 40% extra power safety capability. Besides all these, Microsoft is also planning to implement the 3-in-1 form factor as a major highlight of the Surface phone. \nPreviously, it was thought that Microsoft would release the surface smartphone by the end of this year. But with the revealing of Surface Studio in October, it seems that there are pretty rare chances of Surface Phone to be unveiled anytime before 2017. It is now thought that the smartphone will be unveiled by the first half of next year. © 2016 Enstarz, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

      "text": "100% FREE report malware 8 screenshots Enhanced distribution for the R statistical analysis software that aims to improve the user experience and the environment performance Microsoft R Open (formerly Revolution R Open) is an improved distribution of the R statistical analysis language that aims to bring enhancements regarding performance. Microsoft R Open contains the R software, and additional tools, scripts and packages designed to elevate the user experience. Worth mentioning are the multi-threaded math libraries, the default CRAN repository, and the Reproducible R Toolkit that enables you to both share code and reproduce the outcome of a certain project. Effortlessly deploy the R workspace on your Mac Microsoft R Open comes with an installer package that automatically installs the R statistical languages and all required dependencies. Once launched, the Microsoft R Open user interface reflects the R console design, so you should be able to find your way around in no time. Since R is the industry standard when it comes to manipulating statistical data and other scientific information, the community has developed numerous add-ons that can be installed free of charge. On the Microsoft R Open website you get to browse the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) for new add-ons, read a small description for each entry, and find installation instructions. Microsoft R Open is fully compatible with all those packages. Enhanced performance thanks to the multi-threaded math libraries By default, the R software is designed to work with a single thread at a time, regardless if your machine has multiple cores that can deal with the processing. Microsoft R Open integrates multi-threaded math libraries aimed to address this situation. As a result, tasks get done a faster. Moreover, Microsoft R Open enables you to replicate the same results by creating a snapshot for the CRAN repository at installation. The snapshot is updated with each new Microsoft R Open release, which means that between updates you will use the same CRAN packages. Microsoft R Open also uses the checkpoint technology to help you find the exact versions of packages that produced a certain result. This way, Microsoft R Open ensures that you have the possibility to reproduce a particular outcome. New in Microsoft R Open (formerly Revolution R Open) 3.3.0: Highlights: Based on the R-3.3.0 engine Uses the 2016-06-01 static MRAN snapshot as the CRAN mirror",

      "text": "New York : Four leading India-born chief executive officers (CEOs) including Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Mastercard’s Ajay Banga who delivered big in taking their companies ahead have featured in Fortune’s Businessperson of the Year list topped by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. \nNadella has been ranked fifth among 50 global corporate heads by Fortune Magazine in its annual ‘Businessperson of the Year’ compilation, followed by CEO of Milwaukee-based maker of water heaters A O Smith Ajita Rajendra on the 34th spot, HDFC Bank’s Managing Director Aditya Puri on the 36th position and Banga on 40th. \nZuckerberg took home the annual honour of Businessperson of the Year, with Fortune saying his success rests on three pillars of “his unique ability to look into the future, his otherworldly consistency, and the business discipline he has nurtured in an industry quite often enamored with bright, shiny objects”. The 2016 list includes “star executives with wildly varying styles and approaches, but one thing in common: They deliver, big-time,” Fortune said. \nFortune said since Nadella took charge in early 2014, Microsoft has been engineering a “stunning” turnaround. “He has taken a company focused on personal computing but showing promise in its enterprise and cloud-computing businesses, and turned that equation on its head,” it said. Fortune quoted former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer as saying that Nadella is a “great leader” for the technology giant. Ballmer said Nadella “has done a great job improving perceptions of the company in ways that can advance its agenda—with developers, industry participants, and investors”. \nThe US publication said Rajendra, in his four years as CEO of the maker of water heaters, has kept the company boiling hot, doubling profits and nearly tripling the company’s stock price with strong growth in North America and China. Under Puri, who has led HDFC for two decades, Fortune said there has been nothing boring about its growth, from a pipsqueak with $40 million in revenues to one of India’s largest banks with $5.6 billion. \nA regular on lists of the most powerful and influential business persons, Banga has been described as one of the “apostles” of a post-cash world who has been “aggressive” in expanding Mastercard overseas. The list of 50 business tycoons also includes Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, 2, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, 4, Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma, 10, Apple CEO Tim Cook, 11, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, 15 and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, 29.

      "text": "Youtube Microsoft Garage launches Clip Layer app to provide easy sharing across Android \nMicrosoft Garage team is back this time with another app that applies a universal overlay over any screen making it quick and easy to select the information. Named as Clip Layer, the app lets you copy text anywhere from your screen including a web page and other places even if there is no way to copy. \nTo trigger the Clip Layer, you need to press and hold the home key, meaning you will lose the “Ok Google” option. Once triggered, tap the field you want to copy and tap the text button in the upper right corner to see what you have selected, then copy it to the clipboard, add to Wunderlist to access across different devices, email it, or share it to any other app installed on your phone. \nUnlike the universal copy option, this app proves to be simple and effective. You can download it here \nThe app was designed by Steve Won, a senior designer with Microsoft’s Office team. This is Won’s second app after the Hub Keyboard, which uses an Android keyboard to show a clipboard, pull contact info, get document links from the cloud, translate, show web results and allow rephrasing of sentences through a thesaurus. \nSteve Won, a senior designer with Microsoft’s Office team and creator of Clip Layer, said: \nLike a lot of people, my phone is the center of my life. I like to share what I’ve seen, and I noticed a couple of problems unique to consuming on a smartphone.",

This new feature for PowerPoint was made available in MS Word in 2015 itself, before which it was present in the MS Office Online. Microsoft is essentially backing up its promise made last year, of announcing the real-time collaborative editing feature on all of its desktop applications. \nMS Office corporate vice president Kirk Koenigsbauer said in a blog post, “We are excited to announce that real-time co-authoring is now available in PowerPoint on Windows desktops, allowing you to see what others are typing as it happens on a given slide.” This feature is similar to Google Sheets, Docs and Slides. This new co-authoring feature is already available on PowerPoint on Windows, for subscribers of Office 365 and members of the Office Insider program. Additionally, the feature is present for users of PowerPoint Mobile on Windows tablets. \nMicrosoft announced that it has included the notifications feature for particular activities in MS Powerpoint, Word and Excel on Windows and Android Mobile for members of the Office Insider program, while it will be available for iOS users in some time. In the next few months, even commercial users will get to receive mobile notifications. \n‘Shared With Me’ is a new section added to PowerPoint, Word and Excel for Windows, Macs, iOS and Android for Office 365 users. This section will help subscribers to locate the files which others recently shared with them, and do so quickly. It remains to be seen whether Microsoft, with its new ‘Office’, will be able to take on Google who is also very strong in this collaborative editing feature.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio Teardown Reveals Upgrade Woes With Soldered CPU, RAM, and GPU The 1TB storage can be upgraded easily RAM, CPU and GPU are soldered to the logic board Some display components are also difficult to replace \nMicrosoft has begun shipping the all-in-one Surface Studio, and iFixit soon had a unit for performing a teardown. The teardown of the AIO desktop is now live and reveals that the SSD and HDD drives are easily replaceable. However, the GPU, RAM, and CPU are all soldered to the logic board rendering them non-upgradeable. \nJust to recap, the Surface Studio desktop was launched in October and it comes with a tilt-friendly 28-inch display that lets you adjust the screen, so much so that it sits parallel to the table-top for ease in writing and drawing purposes. It also comes with Pen support for precision in artwork, and is priced starting at $2,999 (roughly Rs. 2,00,450 before taxes and duties) with base configurations of Intel Core i5 processor, NVIDIA graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. \n( Also see: Everything You Need to Know About the Microsoft Surface Studio Desktop ) The iFixit teardown, as mentioned above, reveals that Microsoft does not let you upgrade the RAM, CPU, or graphics processor if you wish to do so in the future. So it's either best to save up for the 16GB or 32GB RAM models, or forever hold your peace with the base 8GB model. The 16GB model with Core i7 chipset is priced at $3,499 (roughly Rs. 2,39,500 before taxes and duties), while the 32GB RAM model with Core i7 CPU is priced at $4,199 (roughly Rs. 287,500 before taxes and duties).\nThe teardown reveals that the 2.5-inch hard drive/SSD and M.2 SSD slots for storage are both situated at the base of the motherboard. They can easily be changed without disintegrating the display. This means that the 1TB storage can be upgraded whenever the user prefers to do so, without any hiccups. \nInterestingly, there is also an ARM chip housed behind the display of this Intel-powered PC. The chip is present to power Microsoft's PixelSense display, notes The Verge's Tom Warren. iFixit has given the Surface Studio a repairability score of 5 out of 10 because a few components like the buttons, front sensors, and speakers that are embedded in the display are difficult to replace if they happen to fail.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has joined The Starbucks Foundation, the Schultz Family Foundation and many others to support the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place. They are raising more than $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children.\nFollowing a nearly 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year , families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing, funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children.\nRead more about this campaign here .",

      "text": "0 0 \nSo far, we have been meagerly acknowledged about Microsoft’s plans for its Surface line. The most recent piece of information on the internet about the Surface series, insinuates that Microsoft is all set for releasing a Surface pro 5 and Surface Pro handset altogether in 2017 , tied with the launch of Windows 10 Redstone 3 – or so they say. Microsoft is yet to comment on the authenticity of the news. \nRecently, we have come across with the supposed specs of the possible Surface phone , along with speculation that Microsoft might be working on releasing at least two Surface Phone variants rather than one (though some websites point towards three); a 4 GB RAM model along with a 6 GB one. Here’s a brief overview of their common features, via NokiaPowerUser; a Snapdragon 835 processor and support for Quick charging 4.0 support for continuum (6GB model only) Quad HD (1440 x 2560 pixels) displays of around 5.5-inches several laptop accessories including a detachable keyboard and a stylus pen \nThough the information is not concrete solid, consumers can’t help but get eager about the possible successor of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 which has been out for over a year now. \nThere are several other takes on the specifications of the Surface Phone on various other sites, implying the addition of an OLED screen and something armed with fingerprint security. Moreover, it is said that Microsoft could bring x86 emulation to Windows 10 ARM64 devices with Redstone 3 next fall. \nSeems like Microsoft might be done with their Lumia series, but they are certainly not ready to give up on their smartphone manufacturing line. \nLooking at facts, Microsoft currently has somewhere around 1 percent of the mobile market, so another attempt at smartphone business wouldn’t really hurt, of course, if they somehow get it perfect this time. A successful smartphone release from the company would definitely provide some consolation to the Windows phone devotees, after suffering the loss of their beloved Lumia phones.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Clip Layer for Android allows you to copy/paste content from any app Microsoft Garage unleashes a new Android app \nNot so long ago Microsoft launched its iconic Windows game, Solitaire on Android and iOS. Now the company has unleashed another application in a bid to expand its colonization of Android. \nThe new application comes from Microsoft’s Garage lab – a project lab that lets Microsoft employees work on diverse projects. Like today’s app which is called Clip Layer . \nThere are many places in Android which don’t allow for the copy/pasting of text. Clip Layer aims to solve this issue and more, by allowing people to save relevant content from any app. \nWhen activated, the app will add a universal overlay over any application. After which users simply tap on the fields they want to copy. To see what was selected, users should tap the text button located in the upper right, then copy it into the clipboard and share it with others. The clipped content can be saved to Wunderlist as well, thus making it accessible from other devices too. \nThe app was created by Steve Won, senior designer for Microsoft’s popular Office suite, who became frustrated with the inability to copy and paste content from certain Android apps . He also noticed that even though some apps did allow it, the process was not intuitive at all. So he set out to change that. \nWon is no stranger to the experimental Garage division, as he previously worked to create the Hub Keyboard app which uses an Android keyboard to display things like clipboards, contact info, document links and much more. \nWith Clip Layer, Won hopes to solve the problem of content sharing from within an app which doesn’t offer such an option, initially. Won is also curious about people’s habits, what they do with the information? Do they email it or share it on social media? \nMicrosoft’s Garage hub recently celebrated 2 years of experimenting with new ideas and concepts. The division has previously released Android apps like Sprightly, Trip Tracker and Color Binoculars.",

      "text": "4 Hours Ago | 03:06 \nMicrosoft's acquisition of LinkedIn this year wasn't the first approach made by the U.S. technology giant to buy the firm, one of the professional networking site's founders told CNBC on Tuesday, who revealed he is \"sad\" about the deal. \nSpeaking to CNBC at the Slush technology conference in Helsinki, Finland, Konstantin Guericke said Microsoft had approached the company before he left in 2006. The Redmond-based firm said that if LinkedIn ever wanted to sell, the two parties should talk. \n\"Microsoft since the early days had a standing offer to our VCs (venture capitalists), saying look, if you want to sell the company talk to us, so it's not a surprise that Microsoft ended up doing the deal,\" Guericke told CNBC in a TV interview. \nBut the entrepreneur, along with other co-founders including current chairman Reid Hoffman, felt that the site still had a long way to grow at the time and didn't see the need to sell out. Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto | Getty Images \n“They (Microsoft) have always had a sort of line out. It was always difficult because we could see our business growing and so we always had a pretty high valuation in mind because we could see … how the company was going to evolve for the next few years, so there was always a high premium attached that didn’t really make sense for an acquirer to do,” Guericke said. \nGoogle and recruitment website Monster also made bids for the company. LinkedIn eventually went public in 2011, and earlier this year Microsoft reached a deal to buy the professional networking site for $26.2 billion. \nGuericke said he was “sad” about the LinkedIn acquisition and would have liked to see the technology company stay public, but that selling to Microsoft “makes sense”. ‘Make or break’ for Microsoft CEO \nThe LinkedIn deal was Microsoft's biggest acquisition to date, dwarfing the $7.2 billion it spent to buy Nokia's handset business in 2014. But the Nokia acquisition was a failure, resulting in write-offs exceeding $8 billion in total, as well as the axing of thousands of jobs. \nGuericke said that the LinkedIn acquisition would work well only if Microsoft granted independence to the management team. \nThe co-founder didn't fear a repeat of the Nokia situation. \n\"I think it's very different situation. Nokia was not exactly thriving at the time when this happened. LinkedIn was thriving and it's kind of a career make-or-break for the Microsoft CEO (Satya Nadella) so I think it'll be handled differently, partly because of the lesson of Nokia,\" Guericke told CNBC.",

      "text": "  \nContent consumption is moving from computers to smartphones. People now read and share article over phones. However, copying text, links, or images is quite a hit or miss affair on Android. It sometimes just doesn't work. To get rid of this problem, Microsoft Garage has released an called Clip Layer. It lets you easily snip and share almost anything that appears on an Android screen.According to Steve Won, creator of Clip Layer, and a senior designer with Microsoft’s Office team, he found it hard on some apps to select anything, and even if there was a way to do that, it was often times cumbersome. He noticed it was a common problem across apps, and it became the starting point for this project. The Garage, is Microsoft's lab where experimental apps and projects go public.Won isn't new to the Android scene as he already has popular Hub keyboard app under his name. He says, “It’s always smoother the second time around. Your first startup gets you ready for the second one. The first time around, besides product development, all this stuff was new to me – like the release checklist. I was a lot more anxious. This time around, at least I had a better idea of the entire picture. I had peace of mind, knowing what to expect and how to plan for everything.”",

      "text": "Pinterest \nWhat’s it like to pit your skills against some of the best Excel power users in the country? We stopped by Microsoft Malaysia’s HQ in KL recently to witness the grand finals of the Malaysian leg of the Excel Championships, and never have we felt more out of place on an assignment. \nIt may not be as glamourous or exciting as the swanky e-sports tournaments that are the rage among Malaysian youths today, but the Excel Championships is a unique tournament in its own right. Competitions like these aren’t uncommon in some parts of the world, so it was interesting to see Microsoft Malaysia making an effort – albeit a very small scale one – into introducing this in the country. \nAfter online qualifiers held the weeks before, Microsoft invited the finalists from different parts of the country for the grand finals in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. There, the finalists not only had to contend with the tough challenges set for them, but also a 40-minute timer to complete the tasks. \nThe winner walked away with a brand new Surface Pro 4, as well as the honour of being the Malaysian representative at the 2017 Global Excel Championships – the winner of that tournament will receive an all inclusive visit to Microsoft’s HQ in Redmond, Washington and meet the Excel product team for a very geeky conversation about Excel.",

      "text": "There is a ton of information we come across in applications, but not all of them natively support a share feature or allow users to copy content from the screen. This is where Microsoft Clip Layer steps in to help. It replaces the default assist app on your Android smartphone with the Clip Layer app, and automatically identifies snippets on the screen. These snippets can be copied, shared, saved to Wunderlist or emailed.\nThe Tasks menu of Clip Layer\nBy default, the Google app is the assist application on Android. This can be pulled up with a long press of the home button, to search for whatever is on the screen at that point of time. Users will have to go to settings to replace the default app, and choose between the convenience of Google Search, and Clip Layer from Microsoft.\nSelecting Clip Layer as the default assist app.\nMicrosoft automatically identifies snippets based on what is on the screen. There is a black block drawn around each snippet, which can be selected to execute further actions on. One of the uses of Clip Layer is that it does not require users to drag and select text on the screen. The blocks of text are automatically identified, and the entire text can be selected on one tap. Multiple snippets can be selected at a time. The T button on the top right shows the copied content.\nMicrosoft Clip Layer identifying snippets on the Narendra Modi App, BookMyShow and the Tech2 website. Identifying snippets is a hit and miss affair.\nIf a block of text extends beyond the screenshot area, the copied text still contains all the text in the block, even from the portions extending beyond the current screen. We tried out Clip Layer in a number of different applications. At times, it identifies snippets perfectly, but fails horribly at other times, with a multitude of overlapping snippets. Clip Layer working perfectly is very much a hit and miss affair. Games is one of the places where Clip Layer would have been most useful, but it is less likely to work in games.\nClip Layer is less likely to work in games.\nClip Layer is a project developed at Microsoft Garage, a platform to push out experimental side projects of Microsoft employees. Clip Layer was created by Steve Won, a Senior Designer at the Microsoft Office team. Won said, “Like a lot of people, my phone is the center of my life. I like to share what I’ve seen and I noticed a couple of problems unique to consuming on a smartphone.” This is the second app Won has released through Microsoft Garage, the first being the hub keyboard .\nMicrosoft Clip Layer is free and available on the Play Store. The application is meant only for Android devices.\nThe post Clip Layer by Microsoft is an easy way to snip and share content from any Android screen appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "A security researcher discovered a new issue in Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system that allows attackers to gain access to BitLocker encrypted data.\nA post on the Win-Fu blog highlights the method. Basically, what the method does is exploit a troubleshooting feature that is enabled during the upgrade process.\nThere is a small but CRAZY bug in the way the \"Feature Update\" (previously known as \"Upgrade\") is installed. The installation of a new build is done by reimaging the machine and the image installed by a small version of Windows called Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment).\nThis has a feature for troubleshooting that allows you to press SHIFT+F10 to get a Command Prompt. This sadly allows for access to the hard disk as during the upgrade Microsoft disables BitLocker.\nIf you press Shift-F10, you open a command prompt window which lets you access the storage devices of the operating system.\nSince BitLocker protection is disabled during upgrades, it means that anyone exploiting the issue gets access to all files that are usually encrypted by BitLocker.\nBitLocker bypass on Windows 10 through upgrades \nThe method works currently when updating the original Windows 10 release build to the November update version 1511 or the Anniversary update version 1607. Furthermore, it works on any new Insider Build that Microsoft puts out, at least for the time being.\nThe main issue, as noted by Sami Laiho, the researcher who disclosed the issue, is that anyone with local access to the machine may exploit the issue. Administrative access is not required, and so is not special software, settings or hardware on the Windows device.\nSince this is a local issue, it is clear that the issue won't be exploited in the wild. Anyone with local access to a Windows machine on the other hand may exploit the issue. If it is a user, Windows 10 may be configured to accept Windows Insider updates if not prevented by a system administrator.\nCompanies therefore should disallow the switching on of Windows Insider builds for machines running Windows 10.\nThis is done in the following way:\nTap on the Windows-key, type regedit.exe and hit the Enter-key. Navigate to the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\WindowsSelfHost\\UI\\Visibilit y Right-click Visibility, and select New > Dword (32-bit) Value. Name it HideInsiderPage . Double-click on the new preference and set its value to 1. You can undo the change at any time by deleting the key, or by setting it to 0.\nCompanies may also want to disallow unattended upgrades (not updates necessarily) on Windows 10 machines to prevent the issue from being exploited.\nClosing Words The disclosed security issue is problematic for BitLocker protected devices that run Windows 10. The main issue here is of course the revealing of protected files during upgrade processes.\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post BitLocker bypass on Windows 10 through upgrades appeared first on gHacks Technology News .",

      "text": "News \nWhile not as fully featured as Microsoft Word, the Google Docs Android app is good for quick and easy document editing, if you use the Docs cloud storage. Google's adding one feature in the version 1.6.442.22: GIF insertion into documents. \nSadly, this doesn't seem to be live in the Docs update that was released yesterday. But it seems like the way this will work will be through the 'Insert' menu on the app bar at the top. GIFs will be searchable, much like in other apps, and then can be added to a document. The only picture we have of the feature at the moment is below. Sadly, this isn't a GIF. But it's a got two cats in it, so it's all good. \nAs we don't have the APK yet, there's nothing more really to say at this point. Once it hits APK Mirror - or is rolled out via a server-side update - we'll let you know. If you are seeing this feature in your Docs app, let us know in the comments. Until then, the latest Docs update, from November 29, is available on Google Play, or APK Mirror .",

      "text": "3 EA: Old Console Cycles Were “Painful;” Sony and Microsoft’s Micro-Upgrades “Great” for Everyone \nAt the Nasdaq 35th Investor Program Conference in London, Electronic Arts Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen talked about the mid-generation console refresh by Sony Interactive Entertainment and Microsoft. \nJorgensen mentioned that in previous console cycles investors always tried to identify the peak earning period, because moving from a generation to the next involved huge expenses to upgrade. Consoles were also very customized, with Xbox and PlayStation being very different and built on customized chipsets, and they were very difficult to program for early on. \nAt the same time, there was no compatibility between cycles, so people simply stopped buying games for the older consoles. According to Jorgensen, it was a “painful cycle.” \nAt the end of the last cycle, things were a bit different from Electronic Arts. They were down to two engines, and updating only two was a lot cheaper than 25, the company was controlling costs a lot better, and hardware was more standardized. Yet, software was not compatible across generation. \nToday, both Microsoft and Sony are starting to do micro-upgrades more often, allowing compatibility of games across those upgrades, making it look a lot more like a traditional PC market versus specialized console market. Jorgensen thinks this is “great for the industry, great for their [Sony and Microsoft’s] production, great for software costs, and great for the consumers.” \nThat said, Jorgensen believes that we’ll still see consoles getting more and more powerful, so the older software “just won’t be fun to play,” but “the whole notion that investors had of the cycle is gone away.” \nSony Interactive Entertainment just launched the upgraded PlayStation 4 Pro on November 10th, following a form-factor refresh of the standard PS4 with the CUH-2000 model. On the other hand, Microsoft released a smaller and slightly improved unit with the Xbox One S, and plans to release the much more powerful “Project Scorpio” next year. More from DualShockers",

      "text": "You are at: Home » Technology » Man Using VR Headset In Microsoft Store Falls Off Fake Cliff And Hits Real Floor Man Using VR Headset In Microsoft Store Falls Off Fake Cliff And Hits Real Floor Technology Man Falls Off Virtual Cliff And Hits Real Floor While Using VR Headset \nWith the evolution in technology, Virtual Reality (VR) is now become the latest trend and a full-fledged entertainment option. It can simulate the environment of the games or app in VR Glasses such as Google Cardboard, Oculus Rift, Virtual Boy, etc. While it is an altogether different experience playing games using VR, sometimes such experiences can result in a fall too (literally!!!). \nGeorge Takei, Facebook’s resident sharer of stuff that makes us laugh, posted a video credited to the video feed Jukin Media in which an unnamed user is seen trying out an Oculus headset inside a Microsoft store. However, sometime later, while climbing up a virtual mountain, the man has an unexpected fall not only in-game but also in real life. The video has been viewed 8.5 million times. \nOn checking the video, one can see that the man is playing a game in which he is climbing some virtual cliff or mountain. He then looks down to see how high up he is and as he’s reaching to climb higher, the man falls face first to the real-world floor. \nHowever, the most funniest part of the video is what’s happening in the background. When the man falls, a Microsoft employee contains her laughter long enough to ask the man if he’s OK, which he says he is as he gets back to his feet. Also, you can notice two men in blue shirts (Microsoft employees at the rear-right of the video screen, who get up to gauge what happened before they disappear behind the counter again.",

      "text": "A teardown of Microsoft's Surface Studio gives an inside look at the hardware. Image: Microsoft \nTaking apart Microsoft's new Surface Studio shows that some elements -- like the storage -- can be upgraded, but others -- including RAM, CPU and GPU -- are soldered in place, according to the teardown by iFixit . \nMicrosoft's all-in-one desktop system is aimed at designers , and Microsoft surely hopes to lure away some creatives who have until now been mostly Apple customers: the Surface Studio can either be used upright like a standard PC, or pushed flat to operate like a drafting table. \nThe Surface Studio, torn-down. Image: iFixit \nThe new PC is definitely not cheap (it starts at $2,999), but it comes with a pretty serious set of specs. These include a 28-inch adjustable PixelSense Display with 4,500-by-3,000-pixel resolution and \"a whole sensor array worthy of the Federation, including: facial recognition sign-in camera with IR projector (probably), 5MP camera, and two microphones,\" said iFixit. \nThe repair guide company gave the all-in-one device a rating of five out of ten for its ease of repair. The base of the Surface Studio is easy to open and home to several modular components -- including the standard SATA hard drive and M.2 SSD, which can be replaced without disassembling the display. \n\"It seems there is indeed a complete storage upgrade path for your $3,000-4,000 desktop machine. As there should be,\" said iFixit. \nThe entire display assembly can be replaced as a piece \"without dismantling the display or the base.\" iFixit added: \"It looks like a simple display replacement is one of the easiest jobs on the Studio. Good news for any folks prone to being a little hamfisted with their Surface Dial.\" \nHowever, iFixit found that the RAM, CPU, and GPU are soldered to the board and cannot be upgraded. \"You may want to think twice about that 8GB configuration,\" it warned. \niFixit also noted that a few of the components embedded in the display -- buttons, front sensors, and speakers, for example -- will be difficult to replace if they fail.

      "text": "Microsoft Corporation: 85 Million Reasons to Love MSFT Stock By Gaurav S. Iyer, IFC   Insulation for MSFT Stock \nOver the last two years, a Silicon Valley startup named Slack took aim at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The little firm wanted to topple Microsoft stock (MSFT) by invading its home territory, the office space. \nBut my guess is that their plan will backfire. \nFor those who’ve never heard of Slack, it is a messaging app that connects workers in different locales. Unlike “Whatsapp” or “Facebook Messenger,” this messaging app is configured for work. I know it sounds like a boring and trivial concept, but most Silicon Valley startups swear by Slack. \nSlack’s sales have more than tripled in the last year. The company hauls in an estimated $140.0 million of annual revenue and it has 4 million paying users. But more importantly, venture capital funds think it is the next big thing. \nThey are tripping over themselves to invest in Slack. A $200.0 million investment this past April brought the company’s total valuation to $3.8 billion. It’s the “Cinderella” of startups. (Source: “ Microsoft Takes Aim at Slack With New Messaging Service ,” Fortune , November 2, 2016.) \nThat being said, I’m not convinced it can take down Microsoft stock. You know why? Because Microsoft recently unveiled their own version of Slack, called “Microsoft Teams.” The name isn’t quite as catchy, but it will be included with the “Office 365” suite. \nAnd here’s the kicker: Microsoft already has 85 million paying customers who use Office 365 software. \nEight-five million. All of those subscribers will now have access to a Slack-like service, except they won’t have to pay extra. The new feature will come as part of their existing Microsoft subscription. \nAny way you look at it, this is bad news for Slack. Just consider the option that 85 million people will face. They already cough up money to Microsoft for “Outlook,”“Word,”“Excel,”“PowerPoint,”“Publisher,” and a whole host of other programs. \nSlack comes along and tries to win them over. Some of them might be tempted. After all, they’ve heard that Slack can increase productivity and connect remote workers to the ongoing office dialogue. \nThey are on the verge of signing up, but then… \n…they find out Microsoft has a free version. No extra fees, no mess. The two products are identical, save for two things. One, Microsoft Teams will integrate with the rest of Office 365. And two, Microsoft Teams is free for existing users. I keep hammering on that point because it is devastating for Slack. \nIn consumer markets, it is possible for a paid product to flourish despite there being a free alternative available. People are whimsical and swayed by how they feel. They would rather pay $90.00 for a designer t-shirt than accept a free, unmarked shirt. It’s illogical, but it happens. \nHowever, that kind of irrational behavior isn’t as common in business. The most efficient solution usually wins, because there are hidden costs to extravagance. This is why Microsoft Word and Excel are not standalone products. They were packaged for efficiency. \nMSFT stock has been built on a long line of these boring, but essential, products. Almost every business on the planet uses them, so it’s going to take a lot more than a tiny messaging app to unseat the king of the office space. \nEditor’s Note: Hi, Gaurav S. Iyer   Confidential.

      "text": "Microsoft Band 2 \nIt seemed inevitable that Microsoft would create a Surface Phone — not an official name — after it acquired Nokia. In fact, there was talk long before that too , but Microsoft has often denied those rumors and stuck with producing new Lumia phones. However, rumors and leaks regarding such a device have continued, suggesting it’s something the company may still be considering. Here’s everything we think we know about Microsoft’s Surface Phone project. Microsoft may wait until late 2017 to release Surface Phone \nAfter the Surface Phone failed to make an appearance at Microsoft’s 2016 BUILD conference , two reports from Windows Central quoting sources close to the matter, said Microsoft could wait until early 2017 to release the new device. The site’s late April report states April 2017 is the current target for the new smartphone. The first report said that instead of one Surface Phone, Microsoft could release three models. Early plans for the Surface Phone release allegedly suggest that there will be a consumer model, a business model, and an “enthusiast” model, or a high-spec version for tech geeks. Details about possible specs for the devices or what the difference will be between the three models have yet to be released. \nThe rumored timing of the Surface Phone has recently been pushed out to late 2017 . This follows statements by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in November 2016 that provides a tiny bit of clarification to Microsoft’s official position on smartphones. Specifically, Nadella indicated that Microsoft does not want to simply compete with the industry leaders with a “me-too” device but rather wants to focus its efforts and develop the “ultimate” mobile devices. If one reads between the lines, it would seem that the Surface Phone will be a high-end smartphone that’s possibly aimed at providing very specific value to the business market, serving as a halo device for Microsoft’s long-term mobile strategy, or some combination of both.

The secret lies in the Office 365 storage architecture, which is fundamentally different than the out-of-the-box SharePoint architecture. SharePoint administrators are painfully aware of the inherent storage and file limitations of SQL Server and SharePoint. These limitations force SharePoint to conform to small content databases and exclude large files. Attendees of this webinar will learn how Microsoft improved on the SharePoint storage architecture to deliver Office 365 for today's business and organizational needs. The topics covered will include: How Microsoft changed the SharePoint storage architecture to deliver superior performance How externalization enabled Microsoft to avoid the limitations most administrators have struggled with for years How IT can deliver the same architecture to the organization's on-premises SharePoint The full range of benefits that can be enjoyed by leveraging this next generation SharePoint architecture \nPresented By: Paul LaPorte, Director of Product Marketing, Metalogix \nWhere: Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport (San Francisco, CA) Metalogix Booth: 400 Why Attend: SPTechCon offers more than 80 classes and panel sessions -- presented by the most knowledgeable instructors working in SharePoint today -- to help attendees improve their skills and broaden their knowledge of Microsoft's collaboration and productivity software. \"Debunking the Hybrid SharePoint Infrastructure Dilemma\" (Thursday, December 8 at 11:15 a.m.) Presented By: Adam Levithan, Metalogix Director of Product Management and Microsoft MVP Learn More & Register for a Metalogix Demo: http://bit.ly/2gipQNn \nWebinar: \"Free Office 365 Migration Explained by SharePoint's Bill Baer\" When: Tuesday, December 6, 2016 at 11:00 a.m. ET Why Attend: Microsoft FastTrack now provides free SharePoint on-premises to Office 365 migration; how can one take advantage?

The day includes practical how-to sessions for absorbing frequent Office 365/SharePoint innovation updates. Specifically, sessions will look at how to better cope with rapid change at the organizational level and at the individual level, as well as how to take advantage of new capabilities for change management, workflow, content management, social spaces, mobile initiatives and information governance. \nEvent: \"Future of Your Digital Workplace in the Microsoft Cloud\" When: Wednesday, December 14, 2016 at 4:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. ET Where: Portal Solutions (Bethesda, MD) Why Attend: Attend this workshop to learn about and experience collaborating in the modern digital workplace.

One can migrate directly to Office 365 from any on-premises version of SharePoint. But watch out, there are obstacles to avoid. This webinar will address the key elements needed to plan, execute and manage a successful migration.

      "text": "Unity 5.5 Launches, Bringing Support for Microsoft Holographic Checkout the latest improvements for the popular development engine.   \nWith videogame development engines such as Epic Games’ Unreal Engine and Unity Technologies’ Unity playing an important role in the continued expansion or virtual reality (VR), VRFocus closely follows the latest improvements of the engines. Today Unity has received its latest major update, v5.5, bringing with it a slew of new features and improvements. \nEarlier this month the company revealed details of what to expect during its Unite 2016 conference in California. With today’s release of Unity 5.5 the biggest addition comes for Microsoft Holographic – essentially fully supporting HoloLens. Unity’s blog post states : “Support for Microsoft Holographic is now shipping with Unity 5.5. We also improved the workflow by bringing Holographic Emulation right into the Unity Editor. Developers creating applications for HoloLens will be able to prototype, debug, and iterate on design directly from the Unity Editor without needing to build and deploy to an actual HoloLens device.” \nThe update also adds – among other things – a new particle system, line renderer components, improved Animation Window, a new Splash Screen tool and an experimental tool called Look Dev. \nThere are far too many details to list here, but VRFocus has rounded up all the VR and mixed reality (MR) improvements below for a quick look over. For all the latest Unity updates,   . \nFeatures: VR: HoloLens support graduated from the Technical Preview! VR: In-Editor holographic emulation VR: Oculus Touch Controllers and Oculus Remote now present themselves as standard joysticks. VR: OpenVR controllers now present themselves as standard joysticks. \nImprovements: VR: GUI elements now work with single-pass stereo rendering VR: UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalRotation() and UnityEngine.VR.InputTracking.GetLocalPosition() can now be used to query the position and orientation of Oculus Touch and HTC Vive controllers. VR: Updated the native plug-in support for VR devices. Plug-ins in user projects override native VR plugins when used. \nAPI Changes: HoloLens: Removed the preview mode parameter from PhotoCapture.StartPhotoModeAsync. HoloLens: Spatial mapping component API changes: The “Custom Render Setting” property is now “Render State”. The “Custom Material” render setting is now “Visualization”. “Custom Material” is now “Visual Material”. “volume” property is now “volumeType”. “sphereRadiusMeters” is now “sphereRadius”. “lod” is now “lodType”. \nFixes: VR: Fixed crash when VR Support is enabled but no actual device drivers could be loaded. VR: Fixed rendering issues when using the Global Fog standard asset in VR. (815914) VR: Graphics.DrawTexture places image at incorrect screen location when VR enabled. (696245) VR: Using Deferred Rendering + MSAA + Blur Image Effect, renders black screen. (713551)  ",

      "text": "\nBELLEVUE, Wash. — Microsoft is holding its annual shareholders meeting here this morning, and it’s notable in part because of who won’t be here: co-founder and board member Bill Gates, and former CEO Steve Ballmer, the company’s largest individual shareholder.\nBoth are said to have prior commitments, so don’t read too much into it, but it’s the latest indication that this venerable tech company has entered a new era under CEO Satya Nadella.\nAnother indication: the 12 percent increase in the company’s share price over the past year. Microsoft is trading today above $60 a share, compared to less than $55 a share at this point last year. Nadella has been pushing the company further into cloud computing and artificial intelligence , and striking new partnerships and deals across the industry.\nMicrosoft Graphic The biggest of those deals is the company’s pending $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, currently under European regulatory review , which is likely to be one of the topics here today. There are also two Surface Studio desktop PCs on the stage, hinting at demos to come.\nThe agenda for the meeting this year is straightforward, with the standard election of directors and only one shareholder proposal, for “shareholder proxy access enhancement,” which the company has recommended a vote against.\nMicrosoft’s annual meeting is slated to start at 8 a.m. Pacific time. Watch a webcast on the company’s site , and check back with GeekWire for updates as the meeting unfolds.",

      "text": "Microsoft takes the pain out of copying on Android with Clip Layer Microsoft's Garage team offers another Android tool aimed at making our lives easier. Staff Writer, Greenbot | Nov 30, 2016 7:59 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset \nNo matter how big or powerful our phones get they all seem to have the same problem: copying text is a pain. From the tiny little handles to the menu that may or may not pop up, nothing about it is fun or easy, and with each passing release of Android it never seems to get any better. \nMicrosoft’s Garage, the enterprising team that brought us Hub Keyboard and Arrow Launcher , has built a better text trap. Called Clip Layer , it’s less an app and more of an assistant dedicated to snipping bits of text you want to move and share. In fact, to get it to work you’ll need to kick Google’s Assistant out of its prime location (which may pose a problem for Pixel owners, but the rest of us probably won’t miss it). \nAfter downloading Microsoft's Clip Layer, head over to Settings to install it. Open the Apps menu, tap the gear icon in top right, then Assist & voice input, Assist app, and change the default from Google App to Clip Layer. \nMicrosoft's Clip Layer in action. \nThen you’ll only need to long-press the home button when you find a bit of text you want to store. Clip Layer will then scan the screen and place boxes around the various blocks of text it sees, whether or not it’s something that can normally be copied. Select the one you want (you can check its accuracy by tapping the T in the upper right corner) and choose whether you want to copy, share or save it to Wunderlist. Since Clip Layer isn’t a true clipboard manager, it’s most useful in the moment—and there were times during my brief testing when it missed the mark pretty bad—but it’s definitely a cool spin on the usual clunky method. \nWhy this matters: Clip Layer is a perfect example of why we love Android so much. It’s not just that Microsoft has created a better way to copy text; if it wasn’t accessible in such an easy way Clip Layer wouldn’t be nearly as useful. Even though it might not be perfect, the ability to make and implement an outside-the-box tool like this is one of Android’s greatest strengths.

      "text": "November 30, 2016 Microsoft R Open 3.3.2 now available \nMicrosoft R Open 3.3.2 , Microsoft's enhanced distribution of open source R, is now available for download for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This update upgrades the R language engine to version 3.3.2, adds new bundled packages and updates others, and upgrades the Intel Math Kernel Libraries. \nThe updated R 3.3.2 engine includes some performance improvements (particularly in calculation of eigenvalues ), better handling of date axes in graphics, and improved documentation for the methods package. ( See here for a complete list of fixes .) There are no user-visible changes in the language itself, which means that scripts and packages should work without changes from MRO 3.3.1. \nThis update to MRO comes bundled with some additional packages , notably jsonlite (for fast processing of JSON-formatted data), png (to support reading and writing of PNG images), R6 (allowing the creation of classes with reference semantice), and curl (for connecting to web-based data sources). The checkpoint and deployrRserve packages have also been updated. \nThe MKL libraries, which provide high-performance matrix and vector calculations to MRO, have also been updated. (This fixes some issues with matrix multiplication and arima that were reported.) \nFor reproducibility , installing packages with MRO 3.3.2 will by default get you package versions as of November 1, 2016. Many packages have been updated or released since MRO 3.3.1. (See here for some highlights of new packages .) As always, if you want to use newer versions of CRAN packages (or access older versions, for reproducibility), just use the checkpoint function to access the CRAN Time Machine . \nMRO is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. This release adds support for two new platforms: MacOS Sierra (10.12) and Ubuntu 16.04. \nWe hope you find Microsoft R Open useful, and if you have any comments or questions please visit the Microsoft R Open forum . To download Microsoft R Open (it's free!), simply follow the link below.",

      "text": "No matter how big or powerful our phones get they all seem to have the same problem: copying text is a pain. From the tiny little handles to the menu that may or may not pop up, nothing about it is fun or easy, and with each passing release of Android it never seems to get any better.\n\nMicrosoft’s Garage, the enterprising team that brought us Hub Keyboard and Arrow Launcher, has built a better text trap. Called Clip Layer, it’s less an app and more of an assistant dedicated to snipping bits of text you want to move and share. In fact, to get it to work you’ll need to kick Google’s Assistant out of its prime location (which may pose a problem for Pixel owners, but the rest of us probably won’t miss it).\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Microsoft annoints Windows 10 Anniversary Update as 'Current Branch for Business'",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft anoints Windows 10 Anniversary Update as 'Current Branch for Business' Microsoft has designated the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, initially released in early August, as ready for business users to deploy en masse. | Topic: Windows 10 \nFour months after releasing to mainstream users the Windows 10 Anniversary Update , Microsoft has declared that release of Windows 10 to be ready for businesses for widescale deployment. \nOn November 29, Microsoft officially declared Windows 10 Anniversary Update to have achieved Current Branch for Business (CBB) status . As company officials stated in a blog post, designating a Windows 10 feature release as CBB \"signifies that this version has been validated by customers, OEMs, and partners giving organizations the confidence to further accelerate deployments at scale.\" \nUsers can proactively download the CBB bits now. In January 2017, Microsoft will make the updated Windows 10 Anniversary CBB update available via Windows Update. For PCs managed by WSUS or Configuration Manager, the updated bits still need to be deployed, and the IT admin can choose when, officials said. \nWhen Microsoft decided to roll out regular feature updates to Windows 10, officials created a new, rolling servicing strategy. The majority of consumers and some business users are on the Current Branch (CB), meaning they get new feature updates like the Anniversary Update the earliest that they're available for their hardware. \nCBB users typically have about a four month period from the time Microsoft initially releases a new Windows 10 feature update and the date that it's christened as a CBB release that's been tested by CB customers and others and patched and updated during that period. And Windows 10 Enterprise customers also have the option of keeping some of their machines on the Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB). Microsoft officials recently said that the company won't support \"general purpose\" Surface Pro and Surface Books that are on LTSB . \nAs Microsoft officials noted in the comments section of yesterday's blog post, Microsoft will service and support two CBB releases at all times. The November 2015 Windows 10 release (build 1511) also has been designated as a CBB release . \nBecause of Microsoft's decision to support and service only two CBB releases simultaneously, Windows 10 1507 -- the initial Windows 10 release delivered in July 2015 -- won't be getting patches and updates much longer. After March 2017, Microsoft won't be patching Windows 10 1507 . And some time around the middle of 2017 or possibly slightly later, Windows 10 1511 (the November 2015 Windows 10 feature update) won't be patched any longer. \nFor more details about Microsoft's Windows 10 servicing strategy, check out this TechNet article .

      "text": "\nQuantum computing is poised to drive a profound leap in computing if companies like Microsoft successfully build practical quantum computers.\nThe advancements it may bring will be akin to the differences between modern PCs and the abacus.\nMicrosoft wants to build a platform of quantum tools integrated into its products and services ecosystem, and they're not the only one pursuing such endeavors. Considering the profound privacy, economic, governmental, defense, and artificial intelligence implications of quantum computing, who will be responsible for monitoring the ethics of its use?\nPlaying with fire? \nThe promise of quantum computing rests in the power of quantum bits, or qubits. These microscopic particles that, via superposition, can exist as both a 1 and 0 simultaneously can do twice the calculations as a regular bit; which exists as either a 1 or a 0 and is processed sequentially.\nSilicon processors are approaching the physical limit of how small we can make the transistors we cram inside them; Microsoft and others are investing in developing quantum computers to address this and the world's most challenging problems.\n",

It’s an all-in-one computer with a touchscreen to make it function more like a giant tablet, and even packs a supplementary ARM processor typically found in mobile devices. Yet despite its modernity, Microsoft still managed to include a nod to the PC’s tradition of DIY upgrades, as recently discovered by iFixit. \n\nNot everything can be swapped out—a sad new tradition in the world of PCs. In fact, almost nothing can. But when iFixit ripped apart the Surface Studio in its latest teardown the site discovered the Studio’s onboard storage drives—both the traditional hard drive and the m.2 SSD—were replaceable.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "0 0 \nPioneer News Group is a company that operates 23 newspapers in Montana, Idaho, Utah, Oregon and Washington and has teamed up with Microsoft in order to provide its subscribers free Windows 10 tablets. \nWhoever signs up for a $15/month, one-year digital subscription with participating newspapers will get a free Windows 10 tablet with the subscription on it. In addition, users will also get the option to have the Sunday newspaper delivered to their homes. \nAs expected, the Windows 10 Tablet comes pre-installed with uReporter which is available for Windows , iOS and Android devices. Keep in mind this application not only allows you to read the news, but also update your own news. \nEric Johnston, Pioneer’s Chief Operating Officer, claims that “people still look to the newspaper for information, and it’s still valued”. It is good to know that Johnston has been involved in journalism since he became a reporter in yhr eighth grade for his school newspaper that was published with an IBM Selectric typewriter. He added that “if we can keep readers engaged, that’s part of the battle of keeping the newspaper a vibrant piece of the community, whether it’s in print or not.” \nEric Johnston met a few executives from Microsoft while playing golf back in 2014 and after a few discussions, the American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington started helping Pioneer to connect with Posh Technologies, a company that knows how to build mobile applications for news organizations. Soon enough, Posh built the uReporter application for Windows by using the Microsoft’s Universal Windows Platform. \nWould you pay a fee of $15 per month for an entire year digital subscription with participating newspapers in order to get a free Windows 10 Tablet? \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",
