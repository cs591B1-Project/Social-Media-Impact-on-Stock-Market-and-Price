      "text": "Tweet \nNetflix’s Christmas treats have started early with the announcement of the new Disney title to be released on Netflix and probably the biggest release so far in the recent Marvel catalogue. Captain America: Civil War will be coming to Netflix in the United States on December 25th, 2016. \nAnnounced in the official coming to Netflix in December 2016 list, Captain America was included amongst lots of other movies and new TV series, but at this point at least, it does seem to be the biggest title to look forward to in December. The other big movies include The Angry Birds Movie and Beverly Hills Cop. \nCaptain America: Civil War released in the United States on May 6th and once again smashed box-office expectations and was possibly the biggest Marvel production ever. The latest Captain America, which makes his movie count up to three, sees our Avengers well and truly split down the middle. Tensions arise when Bucky, Captain America’s childhood friend, is being hunted down for his crimes. This eventually turns into a massive brawl at an airport which is one of the most impressive fight scenes in movie history. Why is Captain America: Civil War coming to Netflix? \nFor those of you who are wondering why we’re getting Captain America released on Netflix so early then we’ve got some good news for you. In 2014, Netflix struck a deal with Disney that would bring its theatrical new releases to Netflix around six months after they are in the cinemas. The deal started producing the goods back in September with the release of The Finest Hours. We’ve since seen Zootopia and The Jungle Book added to Netflix. \nGiven Disneys massive library and subsidiaries, which now includes Marvel and Lucasfilm , meant that we’d be getting each new Marvel movie. Starting with Captain America in December and we’ll be seeing Doctor Strange arrive sometime in 2017. \nWe’re super psyched to see Captain America come to Netflix and what more could you ask for at Christmas.

      "text": "Tim Karan 2 hours ago \nYou've got enough to search for this holiday season. The last thing you'll want to do when you get back from searching for presents and parking spaces is to search for something good to watch. So we're giving you the gift that will keep on giving (well, for 31 days): a comprehensive list of all the new movies and TV shows coming to your favorite streaming site in December. The lineup on Netflix is headlined by the premiere of Captain America: Civil War (which is basically prerequisite viewing if you're planning to catch the upcoming Spider-Man and Black Panther solo movies). Other additions include The Angry Birds Movie , the Leonard Nimoy documentary For the Love of Spock , and a ton of Netflix Originals including the sci-fi action flick Spectral . Meanwhile, Amazon Prime will have the first season of Syfy's The Expanse along with the second season of its own dystopian thriller The Man in the High Castle . And HBO Now will kick off the month with the action-comedy Keanu and a massive batch of older favorites like The Green Mile before some big premieres closer to Christmas like the Coen brothers' star-studded comedy Hail, Caesar! and Jeff Nichols' cult favorite Midnight Special . Check out the full list below. (If you'd like to give us anything in return, just share it with your friends.) Netflix",

      "text": "Trent Moore @trentlmoore 9 hours ago \nAcclaimed comedian Dave Chappelle is making one heck of a comeback, and now he's locked up a deal with Netflix to drop a whole lot of fresh comedy goodness. Variety reports Chappelle has signed an agreement with Netflix to release three comedy specials in 2017, to be produced by Chappelle and director Stan Lathan and include an original stand-up special, plus two never-before-seen shows from Chappelle's \"personal vault\" of material. The performances were filmed at the Hollywood Palladium and Austin City Limits, and mark Chappelle's first concert special releases in 12 years. Netflix plans to release the specials simultaneously in 2017. No exact date has been announced as of yet. \"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's vice-president of original documentary and comedy, in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Chappelle was a cultural force and one of the biggest names in comedy when his Comedy Central series aired from 2003-2006. After the series wrapped, he took a break from stand-up for the next few years, returning to the scene around 2013, and has since maintained a sporadic live performance schedule. In 2014, the comedian hosted 10 consecutive sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall; his most recent return to the limelight came earlier this month, when Chappelle hosted Saturday Night Live on November 12 with an episode that saw him revive a few of his beloved characters from Chappelle's Show . Chappelle certainly still has a mind for pointed, hard-hitting comedy, and it'll be great to see him back on the small screen. The Netflix deal is also an interesting peak into how the comedy business has changed since Chappelle's Show was on the air a decade ago. In the mid-2000s, a cable show was the pinnacle for a comedian to break through. Now? Netflix specials are one of the hottest tickets around, and you don't even have to worry about commercial breaks or censors. Are you glad to see Chappelle making a comeback? Recommended",

      "text": "Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed\nx Share\nPresident-elect Donald Trump shares a specific agenda for his first 100 days in office in a newly uploaded video to his transition team's Facebook page.\nIn this May 15, 2014 file photo, protesters hold a rally at the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) in Washington, DC to support \"net neutrality.\" The top US telecom regulator FCC announced February 4, 2015 he would propose to regulate the Internet as a public utility, as part of a renewed effort to enforce \"net neutrality\" rules. Federal Communications Commission chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled the plan which aims to prevent Internet providers from playing favorites or blocking some services or allowing others to pay for \"fast lanes.\" The new proposal comes a year after a federal court struck down the FCC neutrality rules, saying it lacked the authority because Internet providers were not \"common carriers\" under US telecom law. The plan, which is expected to unleash a fresh legal and political battle, aims to resolve the impasse by reclassifying Internet service providers as regulated entities under the 1934 Telecommunications Act. AFP PHOTO / Karen BLEIER / FILESKAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images ORG XMIT: US plan w ORIG FILE ID: 537437406 (Photo: Karen Bleier, AFP/Getty Images)\nThe days could be numbered for Net neutrality under the Trump Administration.\nNet neutrality rules, passed in February 2015 by the Federal Communications Commission and supported by Netlix, Google and other big websites, prevent Internet service providers (ISPs) from blocking and slowing the transmission of content. The contentious issue triggered lawsuits from the ISPs and drew an unprecedented outpouring of public comments.\nWhile Net neutrality wasn't a constant topic for President-Elect Donald Trump as a candidate, he has been an opponent of the regulations, calling the FCC's adoption \"a power grab\" by President Obama in a 2014 tweet.\nAnd the President-Elect's latest appointments suggest he'll try to bolster that view, supported by telecommunication companies like Verizon and others, by reversing the rules. Jeffrey Eisenach, who joined Trump's transition team in October, and Mark Jamison, a former lobbyist for Sprint, were named Monday as a member of the \"Agency Landing\" team focusing on the FCC.\nBoth advisers opposed Net neutrality in the past. Net neutrality \"is not about protecting consumers from rapacious Internet Service Providers ... Net neutrality is crony capitalism pure and simple – an effort by one group of private interests to enrich itself at the expense of another group by using the power of the state,\" wrote Eisenach in a 2014 article on the web site of the American Enterprise Institute , a free enterprise think tank where Eisenach was a visiting scholar from 2012 to 2016.\nObama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014 A recent New York Times article noted that some of Eisenach's work at the think-tank on FCC issues were supported by Verizon and the GSMA , a wireless trade group of which AT&T and Verizon are members.\nEisenach, who is currently the managing director and co-chair of the communications, media, and Internet practice at NERA Economic Consulting, declined comment on the administration's plans.\nJamison has also taken swings at the Obama Adminstration's net neutrality stance. The FCC has pursued \"unilateral approach\" on Net neutrality and other rulemaking procedures that \"forces industry and consumers to incur unnecessary litigation costs and to operate in an uncertain environment,\" Jamison said a co-written editorial last year. Now the director of the Public Utility Research Center at University of Florida, Jamison also declined comment.\nNetflix vs AT&T\nThe issue of Net neutrality has divided telecom and tech companies for years, with Netflix, Google, Twitter and other household tech names backing the agency's need for such authority to prevent ISPs from promoting their own content over that of other outlets.\nTelecommunications giants such as AT&T and Verizon have countered, saying the agency used outdated authority given to public utilties that is more heavy-handed than needed to oversee the Internet. Their fight has gone to the courts, with Verizon successfully having the FCC's 2010 rules tossed out with its court challenge in 2014; AT&T and others are appealing a federal court's decision upholding the current rules.\nSupporters of a less hands-on FCC see good signs. \"l do think the appointment of Eisenach and Jamison is an indication that President-elect Trump is serious about achieving communications policy reform, including curtailing the reach of the agency's net neutrality and privacy orders and the set-top box proposal were it to be adopted,\" said Randolph May, president of the Free State Foundation , a free market think-tank.\nIn a Washington Times editorial Monday, May said that \"it’s undeniable that the Obama administration’s FCC has been on a regulatory binge, adopting a number of major overly burdensome and unduly costly new rules, despite the lack of evidence of market failure or consumer harm.\"\nUSA TODAY\nFCC approves new net neutrality rules\nHow could Net neutrality be overturned? Congress could enact new legislation that removes the FCC's oversight of the Internet service providers as \"common carriers\" and the Net itself as a public utility. The FCC based its new rules on authority from Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\"Republicans in both Congress and the FCC have expressed their antipathy towards Title II regulation,\" said research firm MoffettNathanson in a note to investors after the election. \"A Congressional roll-back of Title II was never a serious option in a Democratic Administration: President Obama made clear that he stood ready with a veto. With the risk of a veto now gone, a legislative remedy now not only looks possible, but likely.\"\nBeyond that, analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson said last week in a subsequent note, \"It is likely ... that virtually every major FCC rule making of the past four years will be undone.\"\nRecord comments\nHowever, Net neutrality rules are very popular and drew a record number of comments at the FCC — more than 4 million, notes Chris Lewis, vice president at Public Knowledge, a consumer tech advocacy group. Perhaps the Trump Administration will offer a counterproposal, he says, because many Congressional Republicans were in favor of an open Internet but against the FCC’s Net neutrality proposal.\n\"We think we have very good rules and we want to defend them,\" Lewis said, \"and if folks want to eliminate these very important consumer protections that are wildly popular across ideological lines, the question is how are they going to protect an open Internet if they eliminate these rules?\"\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider\n98 CONNECT TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 17 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fOU5x8",

Deadline reports that the Mascots star will play the schemer, played by Jonathan Harris and Gary Oldman in the previous incarnations. Posey joins Molly Parker (Maureen Robinson), Toby Stephens (John Robinson), Maxwell Jenkins (Will Robinson) and Taylor Russell (Judy Robinson) in the Netflix reboot. \nThe new series is a reimagining of the original show and is created by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold, Last Witch Hunter ). Zack Estrin ( Prison Break ) is serving as showrunner for the film which will center around the Robinson family, who are forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, the new Lost in Space is officially described as being “a survival story for the ages.” \nThe ten-episode first season will debut in 2018.",

The way I see it is that they have to compete with piracy. The easiest method wins. Cost is too low of a factor in the same plain field but since you do not need anything for piracy it is the easiest way for 4K content.This is how steam got so popular.",

The character was male in the original series, with Jonathan Harris playing Dr. Zachary Smith. \nThe ten-episode series sees Toby Stephens ( Black Sails ) as expedition leader John Robinson, with Molly Parker ( House of Cards ) as his wife Maureen and Maxwell Jenkins ( Sense8 ) and Taylor Russell ( Falling Skies ) as children Will and Judy. The reboot has been written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold ), with Zack Estrin ( Prison Break ) serving as showrunner and Neil Marshall ( Dog Soldiers ) set to direct several episodes. \nLook for Lost in Space to hit Netflix in 2018.

      "text": "netflix k streaming windows microsoft edge kaby lake requirement More Although Netflix has yet to make an official announcement, Windows Blog editor-in-chief Mollie Ruiz-Hopper said on Monday that Windows 10 customers can now stream content from the popular online media provider at a 3,840 × 2,160 (4K) resolution. This is an exclusive Microsoft Edge feature for Netflix subscribers on a Windows 10 PC or 2-in-1 device.\nRuiz-Hopper couldn’t make this announcement without a little Google Chrome bashing, of course. According to the post, Windows 10 laptop and 2-in-1 owners streaming Netflix through Microsoft Edge will have the ability to watch “at least” one more episode of Gilmore Girls on a single battery charge than if they were streaming the same content through Google’s browser. Ouch.\nMore: What’s new on Netflix and what’s leaving in December 2016\nHowever, there’s a catch outside the Microsoft Edge and display requirements for enjoying Netflix in 4K. Ruiz-Hopper points out that the Windows 10 device must have a seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” processor from Intel, which isn’t even revealing its new desktop CPU lineup until the end of the year. Because of this limit, there are only a handful of Windows 10 devices that quality, such as the Lenovo Yoga 910.\nMicrosoft actually provides a list of devices that support 4K content here , but some of these don’t have a seventh-generation processor, but rather the previous “Skylake” generation of chips instead. Thus, the device may be able to handle 4K video playback, but not necessarily a 4K stream from Netflix. We can’t find an actual list of specs to go by, but Ruiz-Hopper’s blog does specifically list Intel’s seventh-generation CPUs as a 4K Netflix requirement.\nCustomers currently looking for a new Windows 10 laptop or 2-in-1 device may want to check out Microsoft’s huge online sale starting at 12 a.m. ET on Thanksgiving Day — Thursday, November 24. Unfortunately, the Windows 10 PCs Microsoft has on sale are based on sixth-generation Intel processors: there’s no Kaby Lake in sight. Thus, consumers wanting a device right now that’s packed with a seventh-generation CPU should hunt one down with the Core i7-7Y75 or the Core i7-7500U, and a display capable of a 3,840 × 2,160 resolution on top of that.\nMore: Where to find the best 4K content right now\nThose who are thinking about subscribing to Netflix and streaming its contents in 4K should take a peek at Netflix’s internet service provider (ISP) speed index for October 2016 . The report provides a diagram showing which ISP delivers Netflix streams the fastest across the world, displaying the numbers for five different ISP types: Fiber, Cable, DSL, Satellite, and Wireless.\nHere in the United States, Bright House ranked as the No. 1 cable-based internet provider in October with an average speed of 3.66 megabits per second (Mbps). Following that service provider was Optimum (3.65Mbps), Cox (3.60Mbps), Comcast (3.57Mbps), Charter (3.54Mbps), Time Warner Cable (3.54Mbps), Mediacom (3.47Mbps), and Suddenlink (3.41Mbps).\nOutside the cable market, Verizon’s fiber-based FiOS service not only topped its specific category, but the entire ISP chart for October with 3.69Mbps followed by AT&T’s U-verse (3.46Mbps) and Frontier (2.94Mbps). The DSL version of Frontier ruled the DSL chart for October with AT&T, Windstream, Verizon, and CenturyLink trailing behind.\nDell Stack could have been the computing center for your entire digital life Russian listing shows three new portable personal computers using MacOS Sierra Samsung's Galaxy TabPro S2 will be the second Windows 10 Samsung tablet",

      "text": "dave chappelle netflix deal More Earlier this month, Dave Chappelle made his long-awaited return to sketch comedy this month by hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time in his career. Now, there’s word that the comedian has signed a deal with Netflix that will see three of his stand-up performances added to the streaming service next year.\nTwo of those performances are set to be taken from Chappelle’s personal vault, and will debut concurrently some time in 2017. One set was recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles in March of this year, while the other was shot at Austin City Limits Live in April 2015.\nThe third special will be an original production for Netflix, with Chappelle collaborating with director Stan Lathan, who also helmed his seminal HBO special and partnered with Russell Simmons to produce Def Comedy Jam . No premiere date is set for the third special, according to a report from Variety .\nMore: Dave Chappelle partners with Yondr to make shows phone free\nNetflix already boasts a broad selection of stand-up comedy, with sets from acclaimed comedians like Hannibal Buress, Jim Jefferies, Jen Kirkman, and Louis C.K. However, it’s clear that the streaming giant is eager to ramp up this section of its library, especially in terms of exclusive content.\nIn October, it was announced that Chris Rock will end an eight-year stand-up hiatus by filming two new specials for Netflix. The company will apparently pay $40 million for this content, which demonstrates just how much of a priority comedy is at this moment in time.\nOf course, many of Chappelle’s fans will be hoping that his deal with Netflix will be a precursor to a more substantial return to sketch comedy. There’s been an unwavering demand for more Chappelle’s Show since the series came to a close in 2006, but it remains to be seen whether the comedian could be convinced to produce another show in the same vein.\nWant to wake up with Jeremy Clarkson? You can with hilarious Amazon Echo alarm Chris Rock to break eight-year stand-up comedy hiatus for $40 million deal Saturday Night Live replaces Killam, Pharoah, and Rudnitsky with three new players",

      "text": "Netflix 4K streaming is coming to Windows 10, but only for PCs with the latest Intel processor \nRose Behar \nNovember 22, 2016 7:47pm \nNetflix 4K streaming is finally arriving for Windows 10 this week, but there’s a catch: only PCs with a 7th generation Kaby Lake Intel Core processor will be supported. \nThis restriction stems from the fact that the new processor stocks up-to-date hardware decryption features that are required by film studios and TV networks in order to reduce the risk of pirates capturing 4K playback. In fact, piracy fears have been a large reason behind the dearth of high-quality video streaming on Windows PCs in general. The processor also supports 10-bit HEVC, a popular 4K video codec. \nIf you’re one of the lucky few who has a 4K display and new PC with the latest Intel Core processor, you’ll be able to stream in 4K through Microsoft’s Edge browser when it rolls out this week. If not, you’ll have to upgrade, wait it out or turn to a 4K-capable streaming dongle. Via The Verge Civuck \nConfirmed – working with my Kaby Lake Ultrabook and Netflix Canada but must use Microsoft Edge browser; Chrome doesn’t support it yet. Gewurttraminer \nI don’t think anyone in their right minds would upgrade a computer simply to play back 4K content unless of course they are using an old computer in need of an upgrade.

      "text": "Exclusives , News Exclusives \nIs it too early to release a Barack Obama biopic? Not according to Netflix. Recently Netflix revealed a teaser for their biopic of Barack Obama titled Barry which focuses on the college years of the former President as played by Australian actor Devon Terrell . \nThe biopic will follow the 20-year-old Barack Obama, known to his friends as Barry, who goes to New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. Pushed into the middle of a racially-charged environment, a young Obama in turn found himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. \nAfter initially debuting at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival, Barry will be coming to Netflix on December 16.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Heads To Netflix as AMZN Aims to Stream Live Sports (NFLX, AMZN) By Rakesh Sharma | November 22, 2016 — 1:19 PM EST \nThe streaming service wars are heating up. \nEven as Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ) doubles down on standup comedy, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) is in talks to offer premium sports programming to Prime members on its site. \nAfter signing comedian Chris Rock for a record $40 million deal, Netflix signed a three-standup special deal with Dave Chappelle. “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy – searing, vital, and, now more than ever, essential,” Lishi Nishimura, VP Original Documentary and Comedy at Netflix said. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored to mark his global return on Netflix.” \nChappelle, who hosted Saturday Night Live after the elections earlier this month, has been on a comeback mission in recent years. According to deadline.com , Chappelle has performed at 500 locations in the last three years. The publication also surmises that Chappelle has likely not received a similar package as Chris Rock because only one of his specials is related to current topics: post-election Trump America. Chappelle is most well-known for his stint hosting Chappelle’s Show , from which he retired in 2005. \nChappelle and Rock join a slew of other standup comedians who have found a home at Netflix. The Los Gatos-based company, which has been on a hiring spree in Hollywood, is investing heavily in original content. It is poised to spend upwards of $6 billion this year alone to produce or buy original content programming. (See also: Netflix Aims For Fifty Percent Original Content In Coming Years ). \nIn the meanwhile, Netflix competitor Amazon has promised to double its content spend this year. It is said to be in talks with major leagues, such as the National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL), to stream premium sports content on its streaming service for Prime members. A WSJ report states that Amazon has \"floated the idea of an exclusive premium sports package\" with its Amazon Prime program. It has also paid the bid amount for a tender to stream games from India's popular cricket league IPL. Sports programming is lucrative for cable television because it brings in subscriber fees as well as advertising revenues. For Amazon, exclusive rights to popular sports events could boost membership to its Prime program. Yesterday, the Seattle company debuted The Grand Tour – a show featuring former presenters from BBC’s popular Top Gear program. Amazon said “millions of prime members” streamed the show.

      "text": "Photo: Todd Williamson/Getty Images \nWhen the Robinson family blasts into Netflix's Lost in Space reboot, they'll be joined by Parker Posey as \"Dr. Smith,\" reports Deadline . As one of only two main characters who are not members of the Robinson clan, a family that decides to go all Little House in the Prairie -style to pioneer far away planets, in the 1960's series it was Dr. Smith's role to throw the ship off-course and generally cause problems, both intentionally and out of laziness. Jonathan Harris, the part's originator, played the character in early episodes as more of a classic, mustache-twirling villain, but eventually the Robinson family wore down on him and made him more a lovable schemer who wasn't so good as scheming. Now that Posey is taking over, and making the part a woman, who knows what's in store for Toby Stephens, Maxwell Jenkins, and Taylor Russell, who have all been cast as members of the fam. The series is set to premiere in 2018.",

(Photo: Helga Esteb / Shutterstock.com) \nAnne , the CBC s upcoming Anne of Green Gables TV show adaptation, has cast three key characters from the book series. Dalila Bela will play Anne’s bosom friend Diana Barry. Fans of Once Upon a Time may remember her as young Guinevere in season five of the ABC drama. \nCorinne Koslo has landed the role of Avonlea gossip, Mrs. Rachel Lynde. Finally, Lucas Jade Zumann will play Gilbert Blythe. You may have caught him as Lucas Hicks, in a pair of season four Chicago Fire episodes. The trio joins previously announced cast members Amybeth McNulty, Geraldine James, and R.H. Thomson. \nAdditionally, Aymeric Jett Montaz has been cast as farmhand Jerry Baynard. While the character just gets a passing mention in the novel, the production has greatly expanded the role. \nLearn more from this CBC press release. ADDITIONAL CAST CONFIRMED FOR CBC AND NETFLIX SERIES ANNE, PRODUCED BY NORTHWOOD ENTERTAINMENT – BELOVED CHARACTERS DIANA BARRY, RACHEL LYNDE AND GILBERT BLYTHE CAST \nNov 21, 2016 Dalila Bela, Corrine Koslo, Aymeric Jett Montaz and Lucas Jade Zumann join previously announced cast members Amybeth McNulty, Geraldine James and R.H. Thomson \nCBC, Netflix and Northwood Entertainment today announced the casting of beloved characters Diana Barry, Rachel Lynde and Gilbert Blythe in the upcoming eight x one-hour drama series ANNE . Based on Lucy Maud Montgomery’s timeless classic novel Anne of Green Gables, ANNE continues production in Ontario, Canada until February 2017 and will premiere later in the year on CBC in Canada and globally – everywhere outside of Canada – on Netflix. \nTalented young Canadian Dalila Bela ( Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Once Upon a Time ), who recently reprised her role as ‘Agent Olive’ in Odd Squad: The Movie following a successful series run in addition to landing a co-starring role in The Adventure Club , has been cast as the loveable Diana Barry, Anne’s loyal friend and kindred spirit. Acclaimed Canadian theatre veteran Corrine Koslo (The Shaw Festival’s Come Back Little Sheba , Sweeney Todd and feature film Best in Show ) steps into the role of Rachel Lynde, Avonlea’s resident gossip. \nMontreal native Aymeric Jett Montaz ( Bellevue , Just for Laughs Gags!) also joins the cast as Jerry Baynard, a hired farmhand mentioned in passing in the novel who now features prominently in the new series . Currently receiving rave reviews in Mike Mills’ upcoming feature 20th Century Women opposite Annette Bening, Lucas Jade Zumann ( Sense8 ) will portray handsome and confident Gilbert Blythe, a fellow classmate and Anne’s academic rival. \nThe new cast join previously announced cast members Amybeth McNulty ( Morgan , Agatha Raisin , The Sparticle Mystery ) as the iconic Anne Shirley and award-winning actors Geraldine James OBE ( Sherlock Holmes, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ) and R.H. Thomson ( Chloe, The Englishman’s Boy) as Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. \nANNE is a coming-of-age story about an outsider who, against all odds and numerous challenges, fights for love and acceptance and her place in the world. The series centers on a young orphaned girl in the late 1890s who, after an abusive childhood spent in orphanages and the homes of strangers, is mistakenly sent to live with an aging sister and brother. Over time, 13-year-old Anne will transform their lives and eventually the entire small town in which they live with her unique spirit, fierce intellect and brilliant imagination. Charting new territory, Anne and the rest of the characters will experience adventures reflecting timeless and topical issues including themes of identity, feminism, bullying and prejudice. \nANNE is executive produced by Moira Walley-Beckett (three-time Emmy® and Golden Globe award winner, Breaking Bad , Flesh & Bone ) and Miranda de Pencier ( Beginners, Thanks for Sharing ), under her Northwood Entertainment banner. Walley-Beckett is penning the entire first season of the series and serves as showrunner. \nSTAY CONNECTED AND FOLLOW US FOR NEWS AND UPDATES AND EXCLUSIVES FROM THE SET OF ‘ANNE’ \nSOCIAL MEDIA LINKS:",

      "text": "\nAs his last days in office unfortunately come to a close, it’s safe to say that President Barack Obama’s legacy has been firmly cemented in the minds and hearts of many. However before he officially surrenders the keys to the White House, he and FLOTUS Michelle may want to have a movie date courtesy of Netflix. The streaming service giant finally released the full trailer for its Obama biopic Barry , which is set to arrive just in time for the holiday season.\nAfter the summer release of the independent film Southside With You that detailed the love story between the President and First Lady, comes a second in-depth look at Obama and this time it shows how an ambitious college student went on to make American political history.\nShadow and Act has further details regarding the film, including the synopsis and official Netflix release date.\nThe second of 2 (that we know of) young Barack Obama-related films making a splash this year, made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, to favorable reviews, dubbing it a crowd-pleaser, and heralding star Devon Terrell as a talent to watch. \nA week after its world premiere, Netflix bought worldwide rights to “Barry,” and has now set a December 16, 2016 release date for the film, on the premiere subscription VOD service. \n“Barry’s” official synopsis reads: It’s the Fall of 1981 and a young Barack Obama —known to his friends as “Barry”— arrives as a transfer student at Columbia University. Thrust into Mayor Koch’s racially fraught and crime-ridden New York City, Barry finds himself pulled between various social stratospheres. As he struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships—with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates —glaring issues of inequality force him to confront questions surrounding his own identity. His experiences over that pivotal school year begin to shape his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. \nYou can check out the FULL trailer for Barry BELOW:\nLike BlackAmericaWeb.com on Facebook .

While 4K resolution has been available on a selection of TVs and streaming sticks since the rollout began over a year ago, it's the first time you'll be able to see all those pixels ( or, rather, not see any pixels thanks to the much improved picture quality) on PC. \nMicrosoft made the announcement (along with a list of recommended \" Gilmore Girls \" episodes in a cross-promotional flurry) in a blog post on Monday . \n4K content is only going to be available on compatible Windows 10 2-in-1s and PCs, which means it's not as easy as firing up your PC and plowing through 7 seasons of mother-daughter bonding. Or whatever you want to watch. You'll need to be running the latest Microsoft Edge Web browser in Windows 10, and your computer will need to be packing the latest seventh generation Kaby Lake processor from Intel. Which is to say, it's a pretty small subset of Windows users. Share your voice",

      "text": "Netflix has started to roll out 4K video on the Windows 10 platform. Unfortunately, streaming it requires the latest seventh-generation Kaby Lake Intel processor, and not many devices possess both this CPU and the ability to stream 4K in the first place. What to do?\nIf you're one of the few who has a 4K display Windows 10 laptop embedded with the limited-availability Kaby Lake chip, you're in luck. All you need to do is hop on Microsoft's new browser, Edge , and stream away. Desktop users of Windows 10 will have to keep waiting — the Kaby Lake chips for home PCs aren't expected to arrive until sometime next year .\nThere are only a handful of compatible laptops. Those desperate for ultra-high-definition playback are better off investing in a streaming stick such as the Chromecast Ultra, Roku Premiere+ or Amazon Fire TV. Instead of purchasing a brand new laptop, you can stream 4K video with a significantly cheaper device directly onto a compatible 4K TV — which are much easier to find at the moment.\nGoing forward, 4K devices with Intel's new processor should become standard. Here's a complete list of laptops that are equipped with a Kaby Lake processor, though you'll have to ensure the device also comes with a 4K display. If so, it may be time to take advantage of Black Friday deals around the corner.",

      "text": "HT & Movies Netflix 4K streams require Edge browser, Kaby Lake CPU 4K content can now be streamed through Netflix on your PC, but it requires the use of the Edge browser in Windows 10... ugh \nNetflix is finally beginning to hit the PC with 4K content, but you're going to be locked to using Windows 10, and more horribly - Microsoft's not-so-popular Edge browser. \nIt's a massive limitation, and unlike the source of this news - The Next Web, which report that it could be Microsoft made this move to \"ensure battery efficiency\", as not every person has a laptop with a 4K display. The problem is, the current limitation of Netflix resolution support is 1080p, with the next step being 4K. \nWorse yet, you'll require Intel's next-gen Kaby Lake processor to play 4K content for now. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Microsoft must have paid a considerable sum to Netflix for this stupid exclusive crap, and so did Intel. Microsoft's expensive new, super-awesome Surface Studio rocks a gorgeous 4500x3000 display... and thanks to it not rocking Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake architecture, 4K streams aren't going to work with Netflix.",

      "text": "Nov 22, 2016 Parker Posey Joins Netflix’s Lost in Space as Dr. Smith \nDeadline is reporting that Cafe Society and Mascots star Parker Posey has signed on to co-star in the Netflix reboot of Lost in Space . She will portray the iconic schemer Dr. Smith, as played by Jonathan Harris in the original series and Gary Oldman in the 1998 feature film. \nShe joins a cast that includes Molly Parker ( House of Cards ) as Maureen Robinson; Toby Stephens ( Black Sail s) as her husband, astrophysicist/expedition commander John Robinson; Maxwell Jenkins ( Sense8 ) as her son, Will Robinson; and Taylor Russell ( Falling Skies ) as her daughter, Judy Robinson. \nThe new Lost in Space series is being reimagined by the feature writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold , Last Witch Hunter ), with Zack Estrin ( Prison Break ) showrunning. The plan is for the new Lost in Space to take its cues from the original series. As such, it will center around the Robinson family, who are forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, the new Lost in Space is officially described as being “a survival story for the ages.” \nCreated by Irwin Allen, the original Lost in Space premiered on CBS in 1965 and went on to last for three seasons and 85 episodes. The series focused on the intergalactic adventures of The Robinson family, who were originally sent into the stars aboard the Jupiter 2 for colonization, but the vessel was sabotaged by the backstabbing Dr. Zachary Smith, whose efforts to disrupt the trip resulted in the clan being stranded in the cosmos. \nZack Estrin serves as executive producer on the new Lost in Space alongside Sazama and Sharpless as well as Synthesis Entertainment’s Kevin Burns ( The Curse of Oak Island , Ancient Aliens ) and Jon Jashni ( Godzilla , Pacific Rim ) and Applebox’s Emmy -nominated director Neil Marshall ( Game of Thrones , The Descent ) and Marc Helwig. Marshall is also set to direct several episodes of the series. \nThe 10-episode first season is set to air in 2018. \n(Photo Credit: WENN.com)",

      "text": "Photo by Netflix It's been a long time coming, but Netflix in 4K has finally come to PC. While 4K resolution has been available on a selection of TVs and streaming sticks since the rollout began over a year ago, it's the first time you'll be able to see all those pixels ( or, rather, not see any pixels thanks to the much improved picture quality) on PC.\nMicrosoft made the announcement (along with a list of recommended \" Gilmore Girls \" episodes in a cross-promotional flurry) in a blog post on Monday .\n4K content is only going to be available on compatible Windows 10 2-in-1s and PCs, which means it's not as easy as firing up your PC and plowing through 7 seasons of mother-daughter bonding. Or whatever you want to watch. You'll need to be running the latest Microsoft Edge Web browser in Windows 10, and your computer will need to be packing the latest seventh generation Kaby Lake processor from Intel. Which is to say, it's a pretty small subset of Windows users.\n ",

      "text": "By Jordana Lipsitz 3 hours ago \nDecember is a month with a whole lot attached to it. The holiday season — with its gift-giving, its huge feasts, and its songs — can take up a lot of space in the old noggin. Sometimes a nice, clean detox into new content on Netflix in December is the best way to deal with the sometimes overwhelming holiday season. Snuggling under the covers in your new flannel PJs and fuzzy socks with a mug of (spiked) cocoa is just the ticket. Throw in some Nutella (maybe on toast, maybe just a spoon and jar of it — no judgements here) and you've got yourself a heck of an evening — without all the ho-ho-hullabaloo of the holiday. \nSo yeah, maybe you got an invite to a white elephant party and it could be totally fun, but you know what would be more fun? Sitting on the couch with a hot, cheesy pizza and an episode of Comedy Bang! Bang! And sure, the Hanukkah Ball in that artist's warehouse sounds awesome, but you know what would be more awesome? Making yourself a bunch of latkes and applesauce and basking in the nostalgia of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids . Having friends is great and all, but you know who will never leave you (until Netflix takes them off the site)? This fun new December content. 1. Fuller House (2016) [Embed] \nIf you liked Season 1, then meeting Kimmy Gibbler's cute brother, Jimmy, is going to blow your mind in Netflix's Fuller House Season 2 . If seeing Danny Tanner in some interesting hip-hop themed attire doesn't give you a heart attack first. 2. Honey, I Shrunk The Kids (1989) [Embed] \nDoes anybody else miss Rick Moranis' acting career? Sigh. Catch a glimpse of the '80s icon in all his huge glasses-wearing, apologetic glory in Honey, I Shrunk The Kids. 3. Chasing Cameron (2016) [Embed] \nHave you ever wondered what it's like to be an internet superstar? Vine star Cameron Dallas' unscripted reality series will follow the 22-year-old as he and his crew set out on their first MAGCON international tour. Get ready for a lot of screaming girls from many different countries. 4. The Little Rascals (1994) [Embed] \nIt's time to get the \"I've Got A Pickle\" song stuck in your head for the rest of winter. May it keep you warm on the inside when the weather is cold on the outside. 5. Fauda (2015) [Embed] Netflix is going international by streaming Season 1 of the Israeli political thriller television series about the escapades of \"mista’arvim,\" an undercover branch of the Israeli Defense Forces. The soldiers in this commando unit of the Israel army practice the dress, mannerisms, and language of Palestinians to thwart terror attacks and assist in military action. Make sure to wear gloves while watching if you're a nail-biter because this show is intense . 6. Captain America: Civil War (2016) [Embed] \nNow is the time to remedy the great wrong done, if you didn't take the time to go see Civil War in theaters. This heart-wrenching look at the dark side of being a superhero is almost thought-provoking. 7. Pacific Heat (2016) [Embed] \nFans of the comedy spy series Archer will most likely be down with Pacific Heat, an animated series set in Australia's Gold Coast. The goofy series follows the adventures of an undercover unit, \"Pacific Heat,\" who use unconventional means to take down everyone from the smallest crook to the grandest cartel. Unfortunately, they aren't often successful. 8. Barry (2016) [Embed] \nIt's never to soon for a biopic on one of the nation's coolest presidents — possibly the nation's coolest president. Get ready to fall in love with Barack Obama all over again in Netflix's original movie as we get a view of college-aged Obama. Oh my. 15. Club de Cuervos (2015) [Embed] \nIf you're looking to brush up on that high school Spanish while also viewing the comedy-drama that ensues when a wealthy family patriarch dies, Netflix's first exclusively Spanish language series is the show for you. Season 2 comes out Dec. 9 and follows the patriarch's family members as they fight over control of his favorite soccer team, the Cuervos of Nuevo Toledo. 10. American Beauty (1999) [Embed] \nGet ready to be amazed by the supreme beauty of a bag floating in the wind. American Beauty may show the nitty-gritty underbelly of American suburban life, but it also shows the beauty in the mundane. It's a great watch for any time of year. 11. White Rabbit Project (2016) [Embed] \nThe \"Build Team\" from Mythbusters indulged fans with fun experiments, which would prove or disprove the myths and urban legends the show covered — but they weren't hosts just guests of the show . Now, Netflix is giving the team — which is comprised of Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara — their own time to shine in the sun. In the series, the team will investigate mysterious and amazing phenomena and pop culture. 12. 50 First Dates (2004) [Embed] \nAdam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make falling in love look awesome in their rom-com collaborations. Watch them fall in love over and over again in 50 First Dates. 13. Medici: Masters of Florence (2016) [Embed] \nIf you're jonsesing for Game of Thrones vibes of power-play and on-point period garb, look no further than Medici. Plus, there's the added bonus of historical background along with the intrigue — the series follows the wealthy and powerful Medici family in the 15th century after Cosimo de' Medici takes over the dynasty from his father Giovanni, who may or may not have been murdered. 14. Holes (2003) [Embed] \nFind out why everyone's digging holes at Camp Green Lake in this classic Disney live-action movie based on a YA novel of the same name. Hint: It has something to do with some pretty violent history and a curse or two. 15 . Merlí (2015) \nNetflix also grabbed up a Catalonian series (from a region of Spain called Catalonia) about a philosophy teacher named Merlí, who uses unorthodox tools to interest his secondary school students. More international television with a slice of drama. Sounds good to me. 16. Comedy Bang! Bang! (2012) [Embed] From podcast to IFC series, Comedy Bang! Bang! continues to perplex and amuse fans with the bizarre and discomforting sense of humor of its host, Scott Aukerman. And now you can watch Season 5 on Netflix, which features Weird Al Yankovic as the band leader, replacing Season 4's Kid Cudi. 17. Blue Jay (2016) [Embed] \nIn this indie flick, a pair of high school sweethearts accidentally bump into each in their hometown after 20 years. The duo, played by Sarah Paulson and Mark Duplass, spends the day together in Blue Jay , and the fun they share in adorable and bittersweet to see. 18. House of Wax (2005) [Embed] \nIf you can handle watching a movie in which a bunch of people get turned into wax dolls for a creepy museum, then you'll get the prize of seeing Paris Hilton act in a terrifying horror film. Pretty cool, right? 19. Picture Perfect (1997) [Embed] \nIn this '90s rom-com, Jennifer Aniston plays Kate, a hard-working lady at a business firm who gets passed up for a job because she's not \"stable\" (aka unmarried). Thanks, patriarchy. Kate fakes her engagement to get a promotion, but what if she also happens to fall in love? 20. Hannibal (2001) [Embed] \nNothing will fight the holiday warm and fuzzies quite like the horror movie terrors of Hannibal the Cannibal. Give this movie a watch for the Anthony Hopkins juju if you can't get over Westworld. 21. National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) [Embed] \nMaybe you're feeling like you want some classic comedy. Enjoy it. Revel in it. I'm a zit. Get it? You will after you avoid ice-skating with your friends and instead stay in and watch Animal House. 22. The Spirit of Christmas (2015) [Embed] \nIt's hard to date in the 21st century. It's even harder when the guy you're into is technically dead and not from the 21st century. The tragic couple in this made-for-television movie are the perfect tool to get those catharsis tears out. 23. The Angry Birds Movie (2016) [Embed] \nThe time has come for us to find out the reason the Angry Birds are so grouchy. But honestly, no matter what the reason, those fluffy balls of fun will always be exciting. 24. The Crucible (1996) [Embed] \nMaybe you're a bit of a Scrooge and you're tired of all the happy feels. Then the ideal flick for you is a deep dive into the the bad parts of humanity like deceit, violence, and group think showcased in Arthur Miller's play-turned-movie, The Crucible. 25. Angels In The Snow (2015) [Embed] \nThe holiday season is the prime time to go on family vacations that may or may not make everyone feel a little nutty. But not every family is lucky enough to get snowed in with some people who can help them understand the real meaning of Christmas. That part is something most of us can only get through watching this holiday movie. 26. White Girl (2016) [Embed] \nMaybe for your Netflix and chill you like to get a little more deep and thoughtful by hitting the indie films. Then White Girl , which dives into the underbelly of New York City teen life, will be exactly what your heart desires. 27. Beverly Hills Cop (1984) [Embed] \nYou've probably seen this Eddie Murphy classic a zillion times. It's one of those types of movies. Why not make that a zillion and one? 28. Merry Kissmas (2015) [Embed] \nSometimes you just need a feel-good love story to keep you going. This made-for-TV movie is that story. Because in this movie, the protagonist, Kayla, wishes for true love, and this movie will be darned if she doesn't get it. 29. I Am Not A Serial Killer (2016) [Embed] \nChristopher Lloyd terrifies in this thriller as a supernatual serial killer. He's being chased down by a teen with his own homicidal leanings, so needless to say this movie goes right into the darkest sides of human nature. Plan for a nice, kind gentle movie after this one to quiet your brain. 30. Toys (1992) [Embed] \nThere are very few things as comforting as the comedy of Robin Williams. In Toys , Williams does his standard shtick — goofy accents, physical gags, etc. — but this time he's playing a toymaker around Christmastime so it's even more awesome. 31. The Way Of The Dragon (1972) [Embed] \nSpend some time this holiday season with martial arts master, Bruce Lee. There's something really satisfying about a bunch of guys beating each other up. 32. Holiday Engagement (2011) [Embed] \nThe fake fiancé bit never gets old. Ever. This Hallmark movie does the trope again and it's adorable. When Hillary gets dumped she needs to bring somebody home for Christmas. Of course, she'll probably fall in love with whichever guy she chooses. \nThere you have it. Your automatic get-out-of-hangs card. Thank you, Netflix, for always being there when I need you. Especially when I get invited to another non-denominational winter potluck and need the perfect excuse. \nImages: Netflix (2); Giphy (11) Must Reads ",

My thing is My Ivy E alone can decode 4K HEVC files without a hitch so clearly yes, this is a DRM/walled garden attempt. The closest they can get to a \"closed box\" aproach they can botch together on out not-so-closed boxes. Especially considering HEVC was designed with decoding being easier as a goal, it's the encodes that are r aaaal processor brutal. Quote: Originally Posted by erocker No, it isn't.

      "title": "Netflix’s 4K Steaming on PC Comes with a Big Catch",
      "text": "E-mail \n4K streaming content has been available on Netflix for the past two years, but has been limited to certain capable streaming boxes and smart TVs. Now, Microsoft has revealed that 4K streaming is finally coming to Windows 10 PCs , but with one major caveat: only systems running Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake CPUs will have access to it. \n4K steaming was deliberately withheld from PCs over piracy fears from Hollywood studios. The combination of Windows 10 – which, from its Anniversary Update onwards, carries the PlayReady 3.0 hardware-based DRM system – and Kaby Lake processors – the only Intel CPU capable of decoding the 10-bit HEVC video codec, which comes with HDCP 2.2 protection support – has now provided Netflix with enough security to protect against its 4K content from being ripped by pirates. \nWhile the move might be great news for the handful of people running Kaby Lake systems – mobile versions of the seventh generation chip have been released, but the desktop versions are not expected until 2017 – another disappointing catch with Netflix’s 4K streaming is that it is locked to Microsoft Edge, since it’s the only browser that supports PlayReady 3.0. \nIt seems that Netflix’s strict control against piracy of its 4K content is locking out the majority of its PC-owning userbase, which will surely take a few years to catch up to the video-on-demand service’s hardware requirements. Hooray for DRM!",

      "title": "4K Netflix in Browser? Only with Microsoft Edge",
      "text": "4K streaming is still in its infancy for the most part, but companies like Netflix are pushing the new resolution especially when it comes to own productions.\nBut Netflix 4K streaming is quite demanding: First, you need a monitor or TV that supports the 4K resolution.Then you need a fairly speedy Internet connection, and the right plan on Netflix that enables support for 4K streams on top of that.\nIf you want to watch 4K on your television, you furthermore need it to support that through native apps, or have a device connected to the TV that supports 4K streaming.\nMicrosoft announced recently that the company's own Edge browser is the only web browser out there that supports Netflix 4K streams.\n\nWhile that may be interesting for those of you who use a 4K monitor when they work on their computer, it is the following requirement that may torpedo the availability of the viewing experience significantly.\nYou may only watch Netflix in 4K using Microsoft Edge if the computer is equipped with an Intel 7th generation Kaby Lake processor.\nKaby Lake was officially announced on August 30, 2016 but shipments to OEMs and manufacturers began in the second quarter already.\nEven recent devices, take Microsoft's new Surface Book for instance, are not equipped with a Kaby Lake processor yet. There are not many PCs out there just yet that ship with a Kaby Lake processor.\nThis leaves users who bought the CPU individually, for instance to upgrade an existing PC or build a new rig instead. But Kaby Lake processors are not readily available on the majority of PC hardware shopping sites either.\nThe situation will get better over time, but it seems unlikely that many Windows 10 users will be able to enjoy the Netflix premiere of the new Gilmore Girls season in 4K glory.\nMicrosoft Edge is also the only browser out there for Windows to support 1080p streaming on Netflix. All other browsers on Windows support up to 720p playback only.\nMicrosoft noted on top of that that Edge is also the browser to pick on mobile devices, as it offers better battery performance than other browsers. The company bases this on tests that it ran recently comparing the battery live of Edge to that of Chrome, Opera and Firefox . Google and Opera Software tests came to other results however, so take this with a grain of salt.\nIf you are one of the lucky few whose system meets all the requirements, enjoy!\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post 4K Netflix in Browser?

      "text": "Alice Johnston for Metro.co.uk Monday 21 Nov 2016 3:26 pm I smell snow (Picture: Netflix) \nThe Gilmore Girls revival is finally here. Someone lovingly carved vaginas into a full Thanksgiving dinner \nFor those who have been waiting for years, rewatching the inhabitants of Stars Hollow live their safely comforting, eccentric, happy lives, this week is going to be better than Christmas. \nFor those who have been living under a coffee cart or have been so incapacitated with excitement that you are no longer able to read, the four-part Gilmore Girls revival arrives this Friday on Netflix and will consist of four hour-long episodes, one for every season of the year. ‘Yes, Emily, you may go first’ *sobs* (Picture: Netflix) \nAll our favourite characters are back and you will once again be able to stroll the Connecticut streets with them, clutching takeaway coffee cups and boxes of cornstarch. \nOf course, a huge part of the show involves the food that Lorelei and Rory eat while they’re at town hall meetings, opening their own inns and working at The Franklin (Picture: Netflix) \nWhile it may not be the healthiest food ever, the enjoyment that the Gilmore girls get from food and the bond that it creates between characters makes the show oh-so-cosy, comforting and fulfilling – much like a burger from Luke’s, in fact. \nSo, to feel as close to being a Stars Hollow citizen as is humanly possible (especially for us stuck in the UK who sadly can’t access any of the fabulous looking events being held by Netflix across the pond), here’s a list of foods to eat while you watch adoringly/sobbing/chuckling. Pop Tarts (Picture: Giphy) \nA recurring theme, these delicious breakfast items are enjoyed by Rory and Lorelei on days when they don’t have time to get to Luke’s. \nPop tarts helped Lorelei to break away from her overbearing parents, signalling freedom and independence when she first tried them at a friend’s house. \nMORE: Gilmore Girls’ Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel ‘shocked’ after discovering the show’s biggest secret \nCheap and enjoyable, they’re a perfect entry level food to snack on while watching TV if you’re too anxious about whether Rory will choose Jess to eat a full meal (although frankly, I’m not sure you can call yourself a Gilmore Girls fan if you can’t put away a huge amount of junk food at a moment’s notice). Pizza (Picture: Giphy) \nThe classic, the unbeatable, the reliable, the saviour. Make like the Gilmore women and make pizza and TV your default fallback option. \nCopy Lorelei helping Rory get over Dean the first time and get one with everything on it. \nIf that’s not your thing, go plain and simple like a snowed-in Emily and Richard with a frozen cheese and tomato offering. \nBut, whatever you choose, make sure to grate extra parmesan on top and don’t, for Gilmore’s sake, eat it with salad. \nWe’re not trying to emulate Dean here. Dessert sushi Dreaming of some delicious candy sushi, Lorelei? (Picture: Netflix) \nGet to the next junk food level by creating your own sushi made of sweets. \nCopyrighted by Lorelei, who made it to comfort Rory when she found out she wasn’t able to go to Asia with Logan because he had to go and work for his Dad, they are an inspired and vaguely disgusting concoction. \nTo make the sushi, acquire a pack of Fruit Winders (and flash back to junior school) and your desired candy-based filling.

      "text": "Netflix has 4K ready content and it is already available on apps on streaming boxes as well as UHD smart TVs which have Netflix app onboard. But for users who want to stream on a PC, at the moment only a FullHD streaming option is available. A reason for avoiding 4K streaming on PCs has been to avoid piracy.\nBut from today onwards, Netflix 4K content will be available for streaming on Windows 10 PCs, provided your machine is recent one.\nHow recent? Well, your system needs to have a 7th generation Intel Core series processor under the hood. Also your display needs to be a 4K display. This means that the 4K streaming on PCs is still out of reach for a majority of the Netflix audience, which is yet to upgrade to the latest generation Kaby Lake processor systems. The new Kaby lake processors support 10-bit HEVC which is a 4K video codec.\nUsers in the US will also have to pay an additional $12 monthly premium subscription for Ultra HD streaming. Users will get early access to some Netflix shows than everyone else.\nMicrosoft is using this opportunity to market its Edge browser , which it claims lets you see an extra episode on an Edge browser than on a Chrome browser.\nThe post Netflix 4K streaming available on Windows 10 PCs, but with some terms and conditions appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "While Netflix’s hit TV series like Stranger Things and Narcos, not to mention upcoming titles Barry and Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events , have taken a lot of the limelight this year, there are a few less-pushed movies and shows from the online distributor that are still well worth a watch. One such movie, released today, could be Mercy. \nThe film tells the story of four estranged brothers who return home to say a last goodbye to their dying mother, Grace, however, their hidden motivations (money, obviously) soon reveal themselves. Then, apparently the family’s “already tenuous bonds” are tested when “secrets from Grace’s past” resurface, causing things to go terribly awry as the brothers are thrust into a fight for their own survival.\nThe trailer, which you can see above, showcases some of this fight for survival and it looks pretty intense. There’s masked men with axes, words spelled with fire, and much more. Check out it out above, then head straight over to Netflix to watch in full .\nIn other news, Ellen DeGeneres pulled off an epic mannequin challenge at the White House last night.\n",

      "text": "As his last days in office unfortunately come to a close, it’s safe to say that President Barack Obama ’s legacy has been firmly cemented in the minds and hearts of many. However before he officially surrenders the keys to the White House, he and FLOTUS Michelle may want to have a movie date courtesy of Netflix. The streaming service giant finally released the full trailer for its Obama biopic Barry , which is set to arrive just in time for the holiday season.\nAfter the summer release of the independent film Southside With You that detailed the love story between the President and First Lady, comes a second in-depth look at Obama and this time it shows how an ambitious college student went on to make American political history. Shadow and Act has further details regarding the film, including the synopsis and official Netflix release date.\nVia Shadow and Act:\nThe second of 2 (that we know of) young Barack Obama-related films making a splash this year, made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, to favorable reviews, dubbing it a crowd-pleaser, and heralding star Devon Terrell as a talent to watch. \nA week after its world premiere, Netflix bought worldwide rights to “Barry,” and has now set a December 16, 2016 release date for the film, on the premiere subscription VOD service. \n“Barry’s” official synopsis reads: It’s the Fall of 1981 and a young Barack Obama —known to his friends as “Barry”— arrives as a transfer student at Columbia University. Thrust into Mayor Koch’s racially fraught and crime-ridden New York City, Barry finds himself pulled between various social stratospheres. As he struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships—with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates —glaring issues of inequality force him to confront questions surrounding his own identity. His experiences over that pivotal school year begin to shape his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. \nYou can check out the FULL trailer for Barry BELOW:\n\n \nCheck out today’s Top Stories here:\nhttp://hellobeautiful.com/2913481/robert-johnson-bet-donald-trump-meeting/ \nhttp://hellobeautiful.com/2913531/gabrielle-union-harpers-bazaar/ ",

      "text": "by Graham Pierrepoint \nStreaming has largely swallowed up the way in which many of us view home entertainment – while TV and physical media started making way for digital formats via stores such as iTunes in the early 00s, since then it’s been even easier to sit down and watch whatever we like without having to worry about downloading a thing – and, of course, completely legally. Netflix has largely led the race in terms of online streaming, transforming lounges and bedrooms alike into places where movies and seasons of TV shows can be watched and streamed at the touch of a few buttons. They, like most services, came from humble beginnings, offering postal DVD rental alongside Blockbuster and LoveFilm – while the latter still operates via parent company Amazon, Blockbuster was one of the highest profile rental firms to have been obliterated by the rise of online video – but now, it seems, Netflix’s rivals are gaining pace.\n\nAmazon Prime Video has gained considerable momentum in the past year or so alone, having taken a leaf out of Netflix’s book to focus on offering unique, high-quality programming – only this week, they have likely courted a wave of new subscribers as The Grand Tour, a motoring series featuring the former cast of BBC’s hugely popular Top Gear, made its debut. It’s a show that Amazon paid millions for – and it’s highly likely it will pay off, as early reviews for the show are particularly positive.\n\nIt’s reported, too, that Amazon may be planning to expand their video streaming to even more countries, up to 200 with the capabilities – meaning that Netflix and Hulu may not necessarily have the monopoly over on-demand services that they have been experiencing in recent years. Amazon have also tied their video streaming platform into their one-day delivery service, meaning that they are offering more benefits to new subscribers. Time will tell if they can clinch Netflix’s crown, however.\n\nNetflix recently announced that they had taken on further debt to be able to create more new programming exclusive to the platform – and it may be a move that puts them inches ahead of the major TV networks. With series such as Orange is The New Black and Stranger Things having caught fire in recent times, many now trust the service as both talented in showrunning as they are in show streaming. Where will the race end? And what is truly next for streaming? We will have to wait and see!",

      "text": "Comments \nFor this Gilmore Girls superfan, the release on Thursday of four new mini-movies called Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is surreal. I watched the show when it originally aired from 2000-20007, but have spent the past decade rewatching and rewatching. I had the DVDs before the old episodes came to Netflix in 2014, when it seemed like the rest of the world outside of Gilmore 's strong but small cult fanbase started paying attention to the savvy family dramedy.For me, a storyteller who adores pop culture, the show means comfort. I have it on in the background when I'm cleaning, or cooking. It's what I watch when I don't feel like watching anything, but need a life distraction. I can't tell you many times I have tried and failed to start watching Mr. Robot because all I really wanted to do was watch the Gilmore episode where Rory goes to college.I'm watching the revival at midnight Thursday with my brother, who got me the DVDs and who may be the only man who supports my position firmly on Team Jess. To prepare, I'm rewatching my favorite season, 3, this week. If you're bingeing A Year in the Life this Thanksgiving weekend, consider the following your Guide to Gilmore, a comprehensive primer of best episodes, top quotes and tips for how to watch amid the frenzy of turkey and family. \n\nConsider this impassioned plea about why the show is worth your time , then feel free to argue with my opinions on the show's top 10 episodes or let us know what you think about Gilmore fan Caitlin O'Conner's top quotes . \nIf you've done your due diligence and rewatched the show, get into Gilmore Guys , the podcast in which two guys talk about the Girls. It's gotten even better and more high-profile since our 2015 write-up; the hosts even made it into the new episodes as background extras. \nAnd check out our tips for when exactly is the best time to watch A Year in the Life , especially if you are conflicted about neglecting family members this weekend so you can get your fix of Rory and Lorelai. Sounds like a very Gilmore problem to have.   4:20pm]",

      "text": "Jimmy Fallon has plenty of theories for the long-rumored final four words in Netflix's upcoming Gilmore Girls revival.\nSitting down on Tuesday with Gilmore Girls' Luke, Kirk and Paris (Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn and Liza Weil), Fallon pitched his ideas for the last scene as well. Fallon even started off the segment with his own rendition of his new favorite show's theme song by Carol King.\n\"I'm freaking out,\" Fallon said in announcing his favorite three characters. Calling it the \"best show ever,\" Fallon confirmed that \"every night I go to sleep to Gilmore Girls.\" He's currently in season five, and already has a theory about those last four words , said to have been showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino's plan for the show all along. Is the whole town inside a snow globe?\nRead more: 'Gilmore Girls' \"Epic\" Final Four Words: Cast Shares Their Predictions\nWelcoming three of his favorite Gilmore Girls characters, Fallon grilled the trio on those rumored final words.\nGunn said he still doesn't know what they are. \"I want to watch it with the fans and see,\" he told Fallon. \"Maybe it's 'Kirk is your overlord.'\"\nPatterson said he pitched \"Drop the gun, Kirk,\" but Sherman-Palladino rejected his idea. Fallon's idea? \"Stars Hollow never existed.\"\nOn the Netflix revival, which debuts Nov. 25, Patterson said the outpouring of excitement from the fans now is touching, but not too surprising. \"The fans see it as a religion, it's not just a show to them,\" he explained. \"And we knew during the original run how the fans were reacting to it, so it's not really a surprise.\"\nGunn agreed, adding that \"it feels like the show is more popular now than it ever was. So to hear fans are so excited for it, for a show that we did 15 years ago, it's crazy.\"\nWeil said it was \"bizarre to go back\" to the show after leaving her character of Paris so long ago and moving on to ABC's How to Get Away With Murder. Patterson told Fallon that he had to take a walk around the town before being able to find his character again.\nLast week, the Tonight Show host updated the audience on his binge-watching of the original series (he was still on season four) and",

Lost In Space has already cast Taylor Russell as Judy Robinson , who is the oldest daughter of the Robinsons, the family that ends up getting… y’know… lost in space. So, it’s shaping up to be a pretty diverse cast!\nAnyway, none of our own readers even guessed that Lost in Space might gender-swap any of these roles; on our announcement about Taylor Russell’s casting, some of you speculated about some male actors who might do Dr. Smith justice. Instead, Parker Posey will be doing the honors.\nLuckily, Posey has a lot of experience with comedy, particularly the goofy and over-the-top kind. You might remember that she played the villain in Josie and the Pussycats , a cult favorite of mine (and a favorite of many ). It’ll be fun to see how she chooses to play Dr. Smith.\n(via Coming Soon , image via Craig Duffy on Flickr )\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "Email Netflix \nYou've waited almost 10 years, and now Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Paris, Michel, Sookie and the rest of the Gilmore Girls gang are back with Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . The four-part event does exactly what the title suggests: charts a year in the life of Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) and the characters that orbit the Gilmore girls. \nWhile we have seen the episodes—gasps go here—we have been sworn to secrecy about major plot points, including the shocking twists involved. However, this is everything you need to know. Photos \nGilmore Girls Revival Photos: Return to Stars Hollow \nFirst of all, we liked it. We loved it. The revival has a purpose, a story to tell and it does so in a way that will delight and satisfy viewers. Before you binge, need to refresh your Gilmore memory? We've got your back with this essential episode viewing guide , with episodes for newcomers and veterans. With that out of the way… \nYou will, for real, learn the final four words creator Amy Sherman-Palladino always intended to end the series with. What are they? Well…we can't tell you. But they have quite a history, which we detailed for you. Netflix \nAll of Rory's beaus are back. Matt Czuchry 's Logan is there and Milo Ventimiglia 's Jess shows up to ask Rory the tough questions about her life. Jared Padalecki 's Dean also returns in the revival. But maybe we shouldn't pay that much attention to high school and college boyfriends? Or maybe we should… \nRemember all the back and forth about Melissa McCarthy not returning as Sookie St. James? Well, she did. She's back. And yes, it will tug at your heart strings. \"Oh, it was a bloodbath,\" McCarthy joked with E! News after filming her return. \"No, it was so fun. I get so sentimental to be back on those sets and to see everybody. It was amazing how we just all fell back into it.\" Photos \nBehind the Scenes of Netflix's Gilmore Girls Revival Netflix \nEmily's journey is a heartbreaking one. \"Emily is dealing with widowhood and it's a huge part of the whole thing for her. She has different adventures, some of them are funny, some of them are sad. She's just kind of plodding along trying to find herself, how she does it now, what it means,\" Kelly Bishop told E! News . \nViewers will more about Michel ( Yanic Truesdale ) and his personal life. \"What I can say is that my character has always been very private and we've seen him a lot at work, and this time around we'll know more about who he is, who he's dating and his personal life,\" he told us. \"So that's exciting to me...What's going on in his personal life was surprising! But [I'm] very happy with where he was because it revealed so much more about him personally,\" he said . Watch \nGilmore Girls Stars Reveal Characters' Faves Netflix \nLiza Weil was worried about returning to the world of Gilmore Girls after spending two years on How to Get Away With Murder . \"I was definitely worried because I had wrapped season two of Murder and I think, like, the next day or two days later, I was on set on Gilmore Girls ,\" she told us . \n\"But I will say that Amy and Dan's writing, it just really does the trick for me. Paris is so alive in that writing and it's just very, very different from Bonnie,\" Weil said. \"It was actually a very welcome sort of respite from Bonnie. It felt nice to be a little bit more broad and all of those Paris Geller-y things. And then I had a good cushion of time before going back to Bonnie, but I will say, yeah, it's Amy and Dan and it's [ Murder creator] Pete [ Nowalk ] and you read those scripts and it's all on the page. It certainly made it easier.\" \nNewcomers to Gilmore include Sutton Foster , Kerry Butler , Mae Whitman , Dan Bucatinsky and Christian Borle . Plus, basically everybody you came to know and love during the seven seasons of Gilmore Girls is back, including, but not limited to Sean Gunn , Scott Patterson , Keiko Agena , Danny Strong , Rose Abdoo , Sally Struthers , Liz Torres , Michael Winters , Jackson Douglas , Vanessa Marano and Tanc Sade . \nBe sure to come back to E! News for all your Gilmore Girls needs once you've binged the four-part event. You won't be sorry. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Friday, Nov. 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "Last summer it was announced that Netflix ordered a remake of the classic 1965 sci-fi series Lost in Space. The new series was described as an “epic but grounded science fiction saga focusing on a young explorer family from earth lost in an alien universe and the challenges they face in staying together against seemingly insurmountable odds.\" Deadline is now reporting that Parker Posey (Dazed and Confused, Best in Show, Portlandia, Mascots) has signed on to co-star in the series. She is set to play Dr. Smith in the series, who was previously played by Jonathan Harris in the original series. Then Gary Oldman played the character in the 1998 feature film. They are obviously switching things up with the character. The story will revolve around the Robinson family, \"which is forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, the Robinsons find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and their own personal demons.\" Parker joins the previously cast Molly Parker (House of Cards) as Maureen Robinson; Toby Stephens (Black Sails) as her husband, astrophysicist/expedition commander John Robinson; Maxwell Jenkins (Sense8 ) as her son, Will Robinson; and Taylor Russell (Falling Skies) as her daughter, Judy Robinson. The first season will consist of ten episodes and is set to air in 2018.",

      "text": "Winston Cook-Wilson   CREDIT: Netflix \nThe best episode of Black Mirror ’s recent season, “San Junipero,” had an unforgettable soundtrack: a combination of melancholic synth-orchestral ambience, and a dynamite playlist consisting largely of ’80s pop music. Series creator Charlie Brooker has already released a handy Spotify playlist of the episode’s retro dance hits. According to Film Music Reporter and NME , composer Clint Mansell (known primarily for his soundtrack work for director Darren Aronofsky) will be releasing the score on vinyl and digitally via Lakeshore Records on December 2. \nThe label deals mostly in TV and film music, having recently released the soundtracks for Season 1 of Netflix’s Stranger Things and climate change documentary Before the Flood (with music from Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross and Mogwai), among others. FMR notes that this will be the fourth score from the Black Mirror season to be released. \nSee the album’s tracklist, and listen to Brooker’s “San Junipero” playlist, below. \nBlack Mirror –“San Junipero”: \n2. Faith, Hope, Fear & Falling In Love 3. Tick Tock (Clock Of My Heart) 4. Night Drive 5. Property Of Tucker Systems 6. In Sickness, In Health 7. Life Eternal 8. Waves Crashing On Distant Shores Of Time 9. Endless Summer",

      "title": "‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’: Scott Patterson Says Luke Is Lorelai’s Gibraltar",
      "text": "Neil Jacobs/Netflix November 23, 2016 | 07:53AM PT \nGilmore Girls ” is returning to TV via Netflix on Nov. 25, with four new 90-minute episodes titled “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” Variety spoke with the cast about their favorite “Gilmore” memories and what we can expect from the new episodes. \nScott Patterson has been there from the beginning. Literally — he appears within the first minute of the “Gilmore Girls” pilot. \n“My first day I walked into the rear of the set of Luke’s Diner and was watching the two girls having a scene in the diner, and it was a cold day, but it all just felt right,” Patterson tells Variety . “After I finished shooting that first scene I knew it was going to work. That tuning fork goes on in your soul.” \nFor the next seven seasons, that tuning fork hummed. Patterson was one of the earliest agitators for a revival. “I just thought the fans got a little stiffed there at the end of the seventh season,” he says. “And I just know from my perspective, if I hang in there for seven years and I don’t get the full monty, I’m going to ask for a refund.” Related ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’: Kelly Bishop Talks Tackling Emily’s Grief \nStepping back into Stars Hollow and Luke’s skin after such a lengthy hiatus wasn’t easy, though the impeccable set recreation helped. “It took a little adjustment to get back into it, but you get there,” Patterson says. \nPatterson is a little looser than Luke. The appeal of playing a character like Luke Danes, love of Lorelai Gilmore’s (Lauren Graham) life, was his throwback nature, for Patterson. “He’s loyal, he’s loving, and maybe one of his best qualities is that he doesn’t change. He’s resistant to change,” he says. “He has this Gibraltar-ish sense of comfort he can give.” Lorelai needs that stability in these new episodes, as she attempts to cope with the loss of her father. \n“They are still together, they’re figuring out their next steps in life together,” Patterson says. “He is that rock for her. But there are many curves and twists in the road, and rocks falling from above, and no guardrails, and thousand-foot drops. It’s treacherous sledding in these four episodes for old Luke-y.” \nOne thing that hasn’t changed is Luke’s aversion to new technology. Even in the age of the smart phone, the infamous “no cell phones” policy at Luke’s Diner still stands — “I think it’s an even bigger sign,” Patterson says. Filed Under:",

      "text": "\nWith Thanksgiving this week, we’re heading into a one-month period where we’ll be spending a lot of time with friends and family at various holiday parties and gatherings. So before you get super busy with all your holiday feasting and fun, you might want to take advantage of some of the movies leaving Netflix in December 2016 before they’re gone. Honestly, there’s only a handful of titles that you’ll be sad are leaving, and you can find out which ones they are after they jump. \n\nAmerican Beauty The Best Picture from the year 2000, this sad portrait of American life in the suburbs is thoroughly depressing, not to mention extremely creepy. But it also has one of Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening’s best performances on screen. There’s also a fantastic turn for Chris Cooper as a character who still sadly rings true today. It will also remind you that at one time Mena Suvari was actually a sought-after actress for a few years.\n\nMedora If you’re a fan of underdog sports dramas, then you might enjoy a story about the real thing. Medora is a documentary about a small town varsity basketball team in the heart of the Midwest in Indiana. The team was enduring quite the losing streak as the documentary crew follows them, but with the support of the rural community around them who has been kicked down just as much, there might be hope.\n\nEvent Horizon Before director Paul W.S. Anderson went off to make the tiring Resident Evil franchise, he actually made a pretty damn good sci-fi horror movie in the form of Event Horizon . As a kid whose only association with Sam Neill came from Jurassic Park , this was quite an interesting change of pace. If you’ve never seen it, give it a shot, and see how much potential Anderson had before he decided to make lame video game movies.\n\nDon’t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood Most of the spoofs that have come out of Hollywood in the past 15 years have been garbage. They’re more interested in timely pop culture references and nonsequitur humor than they are in actually parodying a drama in a satirical way. Before Shawn and Marlon Wayans spoofed scary movies with Scary Movie , they took aim at movies like Boyz n the Hood , South Central , Menace II Society , Higher Learning and Juice with this great send-up of the urban drama subgenre. Not all the jokes land, and it’s a bit dated, but it’s still pretty funny.\n\nTop Gun Before Tom Cruise attached himself to the side of the plane for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation , he was Maverick, a real hotshot fighter pilot. This is one of those movies that doesn’t really get made anymore. There’s an equal amount of focus on the jet action in this movie as there is on the romance between Cruise and Kelly McGillis. Nowadays that romance would be thrown to the side in favor of much more adrenaline-fueled action in the sky. But this balance back in 1986 was actually rather perfect.\nKeep reading for the full list of movies leaving Netflix >> The post The Best Movies Leaving Netflix in December 2016 appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "© 2016 Adweek All Rights Reserved Gilmore Girls Mini-Reunion Debuts Friday on Netflix Advertisement Comment \nLorelei and Rory are back! Well, they’re back for four 90-minute specials on Netflix called The Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Each episode covers a season of the year. Here’s the preview: \nThe show ended its original seven season run in 2007, and we have a lot of catching up to do. The quirky mom and daughter combo, for the uninitiated, are close in age – Lorelei had Rory when she was just 16. The two were famous for their quick and witty patter. They also really love coffee. \nThe denizens of Stars Hollow had a home on The WB originally before moving to The CW. All four 90-minute episodes of the mini-series will be on Netflix at once, starting this Friday at 12:01 PT – so east coasters should have some of the Gilmores’ coffee and stay up until 3:01 ET to get their fix. (You better believe some will.) \nThe show has put together a site packed full of goodies for fans. It’s a site for the fictional town of Stars Hollow, CT. You can stop by there for a glimpse of what’s happening in town, as well as clues about what you’re likely to see in the show. \nAccording to Quantcast, the ad tech company that researches the makeup of audiences, Gilmore Girls brings a young age demographic (mainly between 18-34),whose income is skewed highly toward $0-50K incomes. Their top interests include college/universities, books and shopping. This data was based on the searches of 10,000 people.",

      "title": "Everything Leaving Netflix in December",
      "text": "Are you sad to say goodbye to a few more classics on Netflix? You're in luck! Most of the flicks and shows leaving the service in December won't be missed.\nSeriously, I had to look up some of these titles here just to figure out what they could possibly be, let alone if I should care. Camp Takota ? Frequencies ? McConkey ?? Finding even three to be sad about losing was tough, but I did it. Well, maybe two and one whose very existence is mystifying.\nAmerican Beauty (1999)—Gone Dec. 1\nNot many films are huge financial hits and critical darlings that go on to win Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. American Beauty did all of that, cementing the careers of Kevin Spacey, director Sam Mendes, and writer Alan Ball. Not to mention making rose petals and plastic bags floating in a breeze seem all the more worthwhile.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)—Gone Dec. 14\nThe book that sold 80 million copies worldwide led three years later to a film adaptation pairing director Ron Howard with star Tom Hanks, two guys who could do no wrong (until they tried to make another sequel to this flick this year). The original still holds up with its quick-paced look at a Holy Grail legends, Catholic Church conspiracy, and ancient clues only a long-haired symbologist could decipher.\n\nThor: Hammer of the Gods (2009)—Gone Dec. 1\nThe SyFy channel has reclaimed some of its previous Battlestar Galactica -esque glory of late by featuring great shows like The Expanse and The Magicians . Never forget, however, it's also the network of Sharknado and Mansquito . So this \"film\" isn't much of a shock. Knowing that Thor was soon coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, SyFy beat them to the public-domain punch by airing this made-for-TV in Sweden schlock fest. It features a reincarnated-as-a-human-viking Thunder God (played by one of the kids from Home Improvement ) searching Midgard (Earth) for his lost hammer.",

Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,” `’Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "(CNN) Did anyone really need a \"Gilmore Girls\" revival? No more so than an updated \"Full House,\" which doesn't mean the practice isn't smart business-wise for Netflix -- not just tapping into nostalgia, but offering fans an excuse to revisit old episodes.\nEnter \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" four 90-minute installments -- length-wise the equivalent of about eight TV episodes -- served up as a bountiful Thanksgiving weekend binge. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has reassembled practically the entire gang (with the sad absence of the late, great Edward Herrmann), plus some bonuses, kicking off with \"Winter\" and proceeding through the seasons. Netflix loaded up its screeners with detailed spoiler warnings, which seems silly given the contours of the exercise. All that really needs to be said -- not quite a decade after the show concluded its seven-year run -- is that 32-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel) comes back to visit Stars Hollow, where she finds her mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) as feisty and fast-talking as ever, along with a lot of other familiar faces. Those include Lorelai's mom (Kelly Bishop), still wrestling with the grief of her loss; and Luke (Scott Patterson), who in one of the amusing recurring gags keeps giving out wrong passwords for his diner's Wi-Fi access. The four-season structure actually creates some problems. At 90 minutes, the story tends to meander, providing lots of time for rat-a-tat banter (and references to things that weren't on the radar when the show signed off, like \"Game of Thrones\") but moving the plot along at a snail's pace. Read More So while there's plenty of trademark whimsy, there are also indulgences like the musical number in the third episode, which is clever but drags on too long. Those pacing issues also apply to the closing chapter, which, without giving anything away, allowed Sherman-Palladino to craft an ending she was denied, having left before the show completed its network run. Granted, this tepid appraisal comes from someone who, unlike much of the critical community, wasn't gaga for \"Gilmore\" during its original incarnation. For the faithful, just seeing the cast re-inhabit these characters -- or savoring interludes like Lorelai and her mom awkwardly braving therapy sessions -- is probably reward enough. Netflix's pragmatism in bankrolling such revivals nevertheless contains a whiff of cynicism, inasmuch as it's so obviously designed to bolster the \"If you just watched\" part of its algorithm, while exploiting a media sphere that increasingly caters to the passions of small fan bases, in essence serving as its eager marketing partner. It's hard to argue with the strategy, validated by the fact \"Gilmore Girls\" has been trending since the review embargo broke November 16. To borrow from a Carole King song, that's because the streaming service has recognized that even if something like \"Gilmore Girls\" isn't a showstopper, where it leads, we will follow. \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" premieres November 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "Posted Wed Nov 23, 2016 at 06:30 AM PST by Steven Cohen \"Danger, Will Robinson!\" Another new cast member has been revealed for the upcoming show. Netflix has announced the latest casting addition for its new 'Lost in Space' series. According to Deadline , actress Parker Posey is set to play Dr. Smith. The role was previously played by Jonathan Harris in the original 1960s TV series and by Gary Oldman in the 1998 film. The show centers around the Robinson family, who is forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, it is a survival story for the ages. In addition to Parker Posey, Toby Stephens ('Black Sails') is set star as John Robinson, patriarch of the Robinson family. In addition, Taylor Russell ('Falling Skies') will play the family's oldest daughter, Judy Robinson, and Maxwell Jenkins ('Sense8') has been cast as her younger brother, Will Robinson. 'Lost in Space' is being developed by feature writing team Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ('Dracula Untold,' 'Last Witch Hunter'). Zack Estrin ('Prison Break') is on board as showrunner. Likewise, Neil Marshall is on board to direct several episodes. While an exact release date has not been announced, the 10 episode first season of the show is set to debut worldwide exclusively through Netflix in 2018. Other upcoming Netflix premieres include ' Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ' on November 25, ' 3% ' on November 25, ' Fuller House ' season two on December 9, ' Barry ' on December 16, ' A Series of Unfortunate Events ' on January 13, ' David Brent: Life on the Road ' on February 10, and ' Iron Fist ' on March 17. A current Netflix subscription starts at $10 for HD streaming and $12 for Ultra HD streaming.",

      "text": "Everything Leaving Netflix in December 6 hrs ago 0 \nAre you sad to say goodbye to a few more classics on Netflix? You're in luck! Most of the flicks and shows leaving the service in December won't be missed. \nSeriously, I had to look up some of these titles here just to figure out what they could possibly be, let alone if I should care. Camp Takota? Frequencies? McConkey?? Finding even three to be sad about losing was tough, but I did it. Well, maybe two and one whose very existence is mystifying. \nAmerican Beauty (1999)—Gone Dec. 1 Not many films are huge financial hits and critical darlings that go on to win Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Screenplay. American Beauty did all of that, cementing the careers of Kevin Spacey, director Sam Mendes, and writer Alan Ball. Not to mention making rose petals and plastic bags floating in a breeze seem all the more worthwhile. \nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)—Gone Dec. 14 The book that sold 80 million copies worldwide led three years later to a film adaptation pairing director Ron Howard with star Tom Hanks, two guys who could do no wrong (until they tried to make another sequel to this flick this year). The original still holds up with its quick-paced look at a Holy Grail legends, Catholic Church conspiracy, and ancient clues only a long-haired symbologist could decipher. \nThor: Hammer of the Gods (2009)—Gone Dec. 1 The SyFy channel has reclaimed some of its previous Battlestar Galactica-esque glory of late by featuring great shows like The Expanse and The Magicians. Never forget, however, it's also the network of Sharknado and Mansquito. So this \"film\" isn't much of a shock. Knowing that Thor was soon coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, SyFy beat them to the public-domain punch by airing this made-for-TV in Sweden schlock fest. It features a reincarnated-as-a-human-viking Thunder God (played by one of the kids from Home Improvement) searching Midgard (Earth) for his lost hammer. \nLeaving Netflix in December: \nGone December 1, 2016 50 First Dates (2004) American Beauty (1999) Black Ops: Series 2 Camp Takota (2014) Carmen Jones (1954) Cats & Dogs (2001) Curious George: Swings Into Spring (2013) Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (2016) Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) Event Horizon (1997) Frequencies (2013) McConkey (2013) Medora (2013) Monkey Business (1952) Myth Hunters: Series 1 Myth Hunters: Series 2 Neil Young: Heart of Gold (2006) Paycheck (2003) Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie (2008) River of No Return (1954) Sling Blade (1996) Thor: Hammer of the Gods (2009) The Great War Diary: Season 1 The In-Laws (2003) The Out-of-Towners (1999) Top Gun (1986) Valley of the Dolls (1967) World Trade Center (2006) \nGone December 2, 2016 Legends of the Knight (2013) The Red Baron (2008) \nGone December 3, 2016 The Best of Me (2014) \nGone December 5, 2016 Holes (2003) \nGone December 14, 2016 The Da Vinci Code (2006) \nGone December 15, 2016 High Profits: Season 1 World War II in Colour (2009) \nGone December 16, 2016 Beyond the Hills (2012) \nGone December 22, 2016 Dark Skies (2013) \nGone December 26, 2016 Just Friends (2005) \nGone December 27, 2016 Spy Kids (2001) \nGone December 31, 2016 Hercules: The Legendary Journeys: Seasons 1-6 \nFor more unofficial titles leaving the site, visit What's On Netflix.

      "text": "Devon Ice Rink opens for the season in downtown Oklahoma City Deseret Digital Media NewsOK publishes content from Deseret Digital Media, which has a network of websites that includes KSL.com, DeseretNews.com and FamilyShare.com. Netflix's 'The Crown' may well be the best anti-smoking ad ever filmed Jim Bennett, Deseret News Published: November 23, 2016 10:05 AM CDT 0 shares × Britain's Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in London. (Stefan Wermuth, Pool Reuters) \nI’ve only seen four episodes of Netflix’s new prestige series “The Crown,” which will follow the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the early days of her marriage up until the present day. It’s extraordinarily well done, with beautiful production values and solid performances all around. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that this series may go down in history as the finest anti-smoking pubic service announcement ever filmed. \nThe first episode begins with King George VI coughing up blood due to his metastasizing lung cancer. In the next shot, he’s shown happily puffing away at a cigarette, blithely ignorant of the correlation between his smoking habit and the blood in his spittle that he attributes to “the cold weather.” Not long after, young Prince Philip is seen lighting up, too, which prompts this exchange with his soon-to-be-wife Elizabeth. \n“Must you really smoke?” she asks. “You know how I hate it.” \n“Pity,” he answers. “Because I love it so very much. But like a great many other things, I’m going to give it all up for you.” \nAnd so he does, making Elizabeth and Philip unique among the royals. The king continues to indulge his habit, even after he has an entire lung removed. He coughs and sputters his way through all of his scenes until (spoiler alert) he passes away at the age of 56 near the beginning of the second episode. In contrast, the real-life Elizabeth and Philip are still with us today at the ripe old ages of 90 and 95, respectively. Surely that early decision to “give it all up” is the reason this current monarch has enjoyed such longevity, a point that is inescapable while watching this show. \nIn all the films and TV shows that were popular when Queen Elizabeth took the throne, smoking was depicted as glamorous and sophisticated. For me, that makes many of those old movies rather hard to watch. It was just a few years ago that I finally saw “Casablanca” for the first time, and while that classic has a reputation for being a magnificent romance for the ages, the only thing I could think about was how bad everyone must have smelled. Even in all the love scenes, Humphrey Bogart is smoking like a chimney, and you wonder how Ingrid Bergman can kiss him without gagging. Some clever YouTuber decided to make a video called “ Casablanca: Non-Smoking Version .” The video is 35 seconds long. \nThis is one area, then, where pop culture has changed for the better. Consider that in 2002, only 35 percent of movies with a G, PG or PG-13 rating were smoke-free. As of 2015, that number is 62 percent, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nThe CDC has found that there is a direct correlation between smoking on screen and young people choosing to take up the habit, and they estimate that if the MPAA were to assign an R rating to all movies that feature smoking, it would “reduce the number of teen smokers by nearly 1 in 5 (18 percent) and prevent 1 million deaths from smoking among children alive today.” \nThat would be a good thing, even though it would brand “The Crown” with an R rating, too. I still think it makes for a good PSA, though. I can’t imagine any teenager watching King George coughing and hacking himself to death coming away with a positive image of smoking, even though \"The Crown: Non-Smoking Version\" might not be much longer than 35 seconds.

      "text": "Netflix/\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" \nLet's face it: We are responsible for what comes out of our mouths.\nAnd while people are 100 percent responsible for how they react to our words , choosing our words wisely will impact relationships. It starts with the speaker.\nSo what can you say consistently as a person of integrity that will cause others to gravitate toward you, and eventually say, \"This is someone I can trust?\"\nYou can start with these phrases:\n'How did you think that went?' A question all great mentor-coaches in influential roles ask. Reserve your judgment to avoid defensiveness and use this question to let someone else gauge her success by her own standards. This puts the other person at ease, and she is free to decide how successful the task, presentation, performance, or meeting was, and what she wants to talk about in relation to the question.\n'That was my fault.' Put your ego aside because admitting to being human and making mistakes actually increases trust. Dr. Paul Zak, author of \" Trust Factor: The Science of Creating High Performance Companies \" says, \"People who are imperfect are more attractive to us. We like them more than people who seem too perfect.\"\n'Would you mind giving me a hand?' This is especially tactful after you've admitted a short-coming, an oversight, or that you've royally messed up. Asking for help extends your honesty and your humble disposition makes you more trustworthy to the other person.\n'Can I get your advice on this?' Dr. Wood Brooks, author of a study linking people that ask for advice to being perceived as more competent says: \"In our research, we find that people are hesitant to ask for advice because they are afraid they will appear incompetent.\" She says that this is misplaced fear. The reality is that \"people view those who seek their advice as more competent than those who do not seek their advice.\"\n'I trust your judgment.' Trust is a two-way street. By extending it as a gift to others, they'll be more inclined to return the favor and trust you back. This gives workplaces clear competitive advantage and brings teams closer together to produce excellent, cohesive work. Darlene Price , president of Well Said, Inc. and author of Well Said! Presentations and Conversations That Get Results , says \"avoid the 'Do It Yourself' attitude; find ways to rely on others in the workplace. Show that you value and celebrate their input and give them opportunities to earn your trust.\"\n'I couldn't have done it without you.' This is quite possibly the highest form of saying \"thank you.\" By acknowledging someone else's effort for going above and beyond, especially if it makes you look good, put that person on the pedestal he or she deserves! When reinforced as a cultural trait, this simple act of encouragement is mental booster that will send ripples of trust across the organization.\n'Here's what this means for you ...' People want to know where they stand, they want to feel safe, and certainly be ensured that you (especially a boss) have their best interests in mind. If you're selling an idea, getting buy-in to a challenging vision, or requesting money for a project, communicate clearly to your audience the benefits — short and long-term.\n'I'm all ears.' This will instantly send a message to the listener that you're open to dialog and are genuinely interested in what they have to say. Just make sure your body language matches so you are truly giving the other person your undivided attention with no distractions. Add some flattery, acknowledge them for their ideas or suggestions, and you may just spark a productive exchange.\n'What can I do to help?' This phrase can move mountains when deadlines are due, stress is high, and desperation is setting in. Servant leaders that demonstrate action through this question by genuinely helping their employees and having their backs will create a ripple effect.\n'What can I do differently?' Employees with a growth mindset will and should use this phrase often as they learn new things. It demonstrates to their bosses that they're open to suggestions, and are eager to see something from another angle to accelerate their development. And as managers, they should allow their employees the freedom to express their opinions and validate those that add value. It may be that you, the manager, are the one that may benefit from an employee's expertise to help you see something different.\nNOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen \n",

      "text": "1 of 2 | License Photo LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23 (UPI) -- Parker Posey has signed on to star in Netflix's upcoming reboot of the classic sci-fi series, Lost in Space .\nAccording to Deadline , Posey will be taking on the role of Dr. Smith, who was originally portrayed by Jonathan Harris in the television series and then by Gary Oldman in the 1998 film adaptation.\nNetflix's take will borrow from the original CBS series, which ran for 83 episodes from 1965 to 1968 and follows the Robinson family, stranded in space light years away from their intended destination.\nNotably, Dr. Smith is responsible for getting the Robinsons and their crew stranded and was presented as a villain early on in the show before being toned down and made into a more light-hearted character.\nPosey joins a cast that includes Molly Parker as Maureen Robinson, Taylor Russell as Judy Robinson and child actor Max Jenkins as Will Robinson.\nThis is the second Netflix project for Posey. She appeared in the streaming network's comedy film Mascots that premiered on Oct. 13.\n  Parker Posey, Chris O'Dowd appear in trailer for Netflix's 'Mascots' Shannen Doherty set to appear in 'Heathers' TV reboot Scott Patterson says he knows the last four words of 'Gilmore Girls' revival",

      "text": "Email \nTraveling to be with your family? Have the day off in the lead up to the holiday? Just looking for a little Wednesday night binge watching? Here’s your friendly reminder that there are 10 Friends Thanksgiving episodes on Netflix, ready for your seasonal enjoyment. \nLike a lot of great sitcoms, Friends knew how to put their mark on a holiday every year. The Office had Christmas; Modern Family has Halloween, but Friends owned turkey day. There’s a lot of debate out there as to which one was the best , but we’re going to go with season’s 3 “The One with the Football,” mainly because it got the gang out of the apartment or the coffee shop. \nBut don’t take our word for it. They are all on Netflix for you to decide for yourself.",

      "text": "print \nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Saeed Adyani/Netflix \nOne of the most beloved shows of the 2000s comes to life after 10 years off the air with Netflix's four-part revival \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" available to stream on Friday. \nSince it went off the air in 2007, \"Gilmore Girls\" reached cult status with a combination of the WB-turned-CW show's original fans yearning for more and new fans who discovered it later and binged their way through the seven seasons. I admit, I belong to the latter group. There's no telling how big that combined audience is now. Even if it isn't that big, bringing the show back could've only been made possible by a company like Netflix. It doesn't need high ratings — it just needs new subscribers. \nThat said, fans of the show are going to be delighted with this new revival. It's constructed to do just that. And everyone seems to have made their way back, even if for one scene, including the cast members who have gone on to stellar careers: Movie star Melissa McCarthy reprises her role as Lorelai's best friend, Sookie St. James; \"This Is Us\" star Milo Ventimiglia is back as Luke's nephew and Rory's ex, Jess; \"The Good Wife\" star Matt Czuchry reprises his role as Rory's college boyfriend, Logan; and \"How to Get Away With Murder's\" Liza Weil returns as Rory's alpha-female frenemy, Paris. \nNot to mention, there's a host of cameos by some pretty big stars, which Netflix has made me and other critics promise not to reveal. \nSplit into four 90-minute-ish episodes named after the four seasons, \"A Year in the Life\" brings Rory (Alexis Bledel) back to small, quirky Stars Hollow and reunites her with mom/best friend Lorelai (Lauren Graham) within seconds. That first hour of the show feels like a trippy fan dream as the two run around Stars Hollow and get reacquainted with the eccentric townsfolk who never left. \nFrom left, Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" Robert Voets/Netflix \nAs the title suggests, this show has always really been about the Gilmore family girls and the ways that life brings them together and pulls them apart. \nIn these new chapters, we see them once again in different stages of their lives. The funny thing is all three — yes, don't forget the force that is Lorelai's mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) — are struggling with romantic and career questions that are very specific to where they are in their lives. \nThere is also a tear-inducing flashback to an even that affects all of them: the death of patriarch Robert Gilmore. The actor who played him, Edward Herrmann, died of brain cancer in 2014. \nPossibly the biggest problem with the miniseries is that there's very little story for pretty much the first episode. Things pick up going into episode two. But again, fans just want to see their favorite characters again and probably won't care about an extended tour of the show's world for an episode. It's the same reason there's a call for a new \"Sex and the City\" movie — even if the past ones are pretty awful. \nThe true joy for fans will be creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's return after leaving the show ahead of its final season. After all, it's her world and rapid dialogue that we fell in love with. She splits the the writing/directing of the miniseries with her producing partner and husband, Daniel Palladino, but she gets to start and finish the tale with \"Winter\" (episode one) and \"Fall\" (episode four) — as it should be. \nAnd finally, fans will find out the last four words Amy Sherman-Palladino had always planned for the \"Gilmore Girls\" series finale and never got to use. We're interested to see if they live up to the fandom's built-up expectations. I suspect there will be some displeasure over it. \nWatch the trailer below:",

      "text": "Parker Posey (seen here in the TV series \"Frankenstein\") will play Dr. Smith in a \"Lost in Space\" remake for Netflix. Photo by USA Cable Network \nFans of the 1960s sci-fi TV series \" Lost in Space \" remember Dr. Zachary Smith as the easily-annoyed and sometimes sinister psychologist and environmental expert. \nViewers were often wary of the snide personality, lazy demeanor and general lack of ethics of Dr. Smith, who was played expertly by Jonathan Harris. He was the kind of character you love to hate. After all, it's his fault the Robinson family's spaceship flew off course and stranded them in the first place. \nOn Tuesday, entertainment site Deadline Hollywood announced that the role of Dr. Smith has been gender-flipped and will now be played by none other than indie-movie icon Parker Posey in a remake of the series set to air on Netflix in 2018. Related stories Remake of '60s series 'Lost in Space' coming \nPosey has made a lifelong career playing quirky, eccentric and sometimes annoying characters in such films as \"Party Girl,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Best in Show,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"A Mighty Wind,\" \"The House of Yes\" and more recently, \"Mascots.\" \nPosey will join Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as parents Maureen and John Robinson -- and Maxwell Jenkins and Taylor Russell as their children, Will and Judy. \nThe original show ran for three seasons from 1965 to 1968 on CBS. (Editors note: CNET is owned by CBS.) \nThe \"Lost in Space\" reboot from Legendary and Netflix will run 10 one-hour episodes that will follow the adventures of the Robinson family as they are stranded light-years from home.

      "text": "(Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nOne of the most beloved shows of the 2000s comes to life after 10 years off the air with Netflix's four-part revival \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" available to stream on Friday. \nSince it went off the air in 2007, \"Gilmore Girls\" reached cult status with a combination of the WB-turned-CW show's original fans yearning for more and new fans who discovered it later and binged their way through the seven seasons. I admit, I belong to the latter group. There's no telling how big that combined audience is now. Even if it isn't that big, bringing the show back could've only been made possible by a company like Netflix. It doesn't need high ratings — it just needs new subscribers.\nThat said, fans of the show are going to be delighted with this new revival. It's constructed to do just that. And everyone seems to have made their way back, even if for one scene, including the cast members who have gone on to stellar careers: Movie star Melissa McCarthy reprises her role as Lorelai's best friend, Sookie St. James; \"This Is Us\" star Milo Ventimiglia is back as Luke's nephew and Rory's ex, Jess; \"The Good Wife\" star Matt Czuchry reprises his role as Rory's college boyfriend, Logan; and \"How to Get Away With Murder's\" Liza Weil returns as Rory's alpha-female frenemy, Paris.\nNot to mention, there's a host of cameos by some pretty big stars, which Netflix has made me and other critics promise not to reveal.\nSplit into four 90-minute-ish episodes named after the four seasons, \"A Year in the Life\" brings Rory (Alexis Bledel) back to small, quirky Stars Hollow and reunites her with mom/best friend Lorelai (Lauren Graham) within seconds. That first hour of the show feels like a trippy fan dream as the two run around Stars Hollow and get reacquainted with the eccentric townsfolk who never left.\n(From left, Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Robert Voets/Netflix) \nAs the title suggests, this show has always really been about the Gilmore family girls and the ways that life brings them together and pulls them apart. \nIn these new chapters, we see them once again in different stages of their lives. The funny thing is all three — yes, don't forget the force that is Lorelai's mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) — are struggling with romantic and career questions that are very specific to where they are in their lives.\nThere is also a tear-inducing flashback to an event that affects all of them: the death of patriarch Richard Gilmore. The actor who played him, Edward Herrmann, died of brain cancer in 2014.\nPossibly the biggest problem with the miniseries is that there's very little story for pretty much the first episode. Things pick up going into episode two. But again, fans just want to see their favorite characters again and probably won't care about an extended tour of the show's world for an episode. It's the same reason there's a call for a new \"Sex and the City\" movie — even if the past ones are pretty awful.\nThe true joy for fans will be creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's return after leaving the show ahead of its final season. After all, it's her world and rapid dialogue that we fell in love with. She splits the the writing/directing of the miniseries with her producing partner and husband, Daniel Palladino, but she gets to start and finish the tale with \"Winter\" (episode one) and \"Fall\" (episode four) — as it should be.\nAnd finally, fans will find out the last four words Amy Sherman-Palladino had always planned for the \"Gilmore Girls\" series finale and never got to use. We're interested to see if they live up to the fandom's built-up expectations. I suspect there will be some displeasure over it.\nWatch the trailer below: \n\nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n\nMore From Business Insider \nDave Chappelle is reportedly making $60 million for his Netflix comedy specials \nHere's everything leaving Netflix in December that you need to watch before it disappears \nNetflix is releasing 3 new comedy specials from Dave Chappelle",

      "title": "Parker Posey Set for Gender-Swapped Role in Netflix’s ‘Lost in Space’ Remake",
      "text": "SHARE 0 \nVery few actresses have the iron-clad reputation that Parker Posey has developed over the years. In the 1990s, she was a bit of an It-girl, securing iconic roles in a slew of indie projects, from Party Girl and The House of Yes to Dazed and Confused and Waiting for Guffman . And that’s not even counting her work in masterpieces like Kicking and Screaming and Henry Fool , the latter of which set-up a collaborative relationship with the great Hal Hartley . In the aughts, she branched out big time, with roles in Superman Returns (yay!), Blade: Trinity (boo!), and three projects with Waiting for Guffman director Christopher Guest , including the uproarious Best in Show . Image via Possible Films \nShe still works regularly to this day, having now worked with Woody Allen on the hugely undervalued Irrational Man and making a memorable appearance on Parks & Recreation . Now, as Deadline reports , she will be one of the key performers in Netflix’s remake of Lost in Space , a 10-episode remake series with is set to debut sometime in 2018 on the streaming giant. Her role is that of Dr. Smith, the often nefarious and constantly scheming doctor who travels through the universe with the Robinson family on the Jupiter 2. In the original series, the late Jonathan Harris was in the role, whereas Gary Oldman took up the mantle in the not-so-good movie adaptation of the series. Gender reversal alert! \nI’m sure that a few sad people on the internet will have something truly and deeply ignorant to say about this switcheroo and for them, I have exactly no pity or empathy. Posey does great when she’s playing a schemer and for those in need of proof, just watch the menacing emotional undercurrents she gives to the head of the senior high school girls in Dazed and Confused . Her inclusion in the series already suggests that this version of Lost in Space , unlike the movie, will be worth our time in an increasingly suffocating TV market. Related Content",

      "text": "Perry Carpenter \nThanksgiving isn’t just about gorging on sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce, it’s also a time to sit back and relax with some classic Thanksgiving-themed movies and TV shows. From Grey’s Anatomy to Orange is the New Black , here is the best turkey day entertainment available on Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. \nAccording to Hollywood , Netflix has a host of Thanksgiving episodes available to stream. This includes a must watch Season 5, Episode 8 of Friends , titled “The One With All The Thanksgivings.” \nFriends has a lot of Thanksgiving episodes to pick from, but “The One With All The Thanksgivings” is a classic. Not only does everyone share a sentimental Thanksgiving story from their past, but Chandler is rocking his ’80s haircut while Joey puts his head in a turkey. \nOther holiday-themed episodes of Friends include “The One Where Underdog Gets Away,”“The One With the Football,” and “The One With the Late Thanksgiving.” ‘Friends’ [Image by NBC/Universal] \nFor a more modern series, How I Met Your Mother’s “Slapsgiving” is a great Thanksgiving-themed installment. The episode features Marshall and Lily’s first holiday since tying the knot, Robin and Ted give their first salute, and Marshall and Barney finally end their slap bet. Another worthy mention is “Blitzgiving” from Season 6. ‘How I Met Your Mother’ [Image by ABC] \nThe new Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life premieres the day after, but for those that need a quick refresher look no further than “A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving.” The fan favorite mother-daughter duo is back as they prepare to attend four Thanksgiving dinners on the same night. ‘Gilmore Girls’ [Image by The CW] \nApart from food and family, Thanksgiving is also a day for some great football. In the spirit of the game, make sure you watch The League’s Thanksgiving inspired episode in Season 3. Sarah Silverman guest stars as Andre’s sister in this hilarious episode that pairs great with the holiday. \nPerez Hilton reports another Netflix episode to watch is Bob’s Burgers’ “An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal.” The installment features Bob and the family taking Thanksgiving to Mr. Fischoeder, who bribes them into allowing Linda and the children to post as his family. \nFor a more presidential mood, Entertainment Weekly reports that the West Wing’s “Shibboleth” is available to stream on both Netflix and Amazon. The episode is one of the show’s best and features C.J. Cregg pardoning a turkey while President Bartlet is forced to deal with a group of refugees. \nAlso streaming on Amazon and Hulu, The Mindy Project’s “Thanksgiving” features a difficult holiday for the characters. Mindy is forced to meet the girlfriend of a former flame while Danny can’t make time to celebrate. \nWhat would Thanksgiving be without some Grey’s Anatomy ? Two episodes are worth watching for the holiday season, including “Thanks for the Memories” and “Somebody That I Used to Know.” The latter includes Meredith’s epic Thanksgiving dinner for the entire hospital, which naturally leads to plenty of drama. The very first ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Thanksgiving. [Image by ABC] \nWhen it comes to movies, Time is reporting that classic James Bond flicks , available to stream on Amazon, are perfect Thanksgiving films. These include Sean Connery’s best in Dr. No , Goldfinger , and From Russia with Love . They might be a little dated, but they’re sure to appeal to just about every member of the family. \nSpeaking of good family movies, Creed is also available on Amazon. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan and centers on Rocky Balboa’s training efforts with Apollo Creed’s son, Adonis Johnson. If the Rocky franchise is something the family enjoys, then you can also stream Rocky through Rocky V while you’re at it. ‘Stranger Things’ [Image by Netflix] \nIf you just want a good series to watch while you loosen up the belt, consider catching up on shows like Stranger Things or Black Mirror , both of which are available on Netflix. They aren’t exactly Thanksgiving themed, but they are some of the most talked about shows online. Also consider Netflix’s new original series, The Crown . ‘The Crown’ [Image by Netflix] \nIf nostalgia is what you’re after, International Business Times reports that the 1991 film, Dutch is a great one for Thanksgiving . The movie centers on a young man trying to score points with his girlfriend by bringing her son home from prep school. The duo quickly runs into trouble as he discovers the boy isn’t a nice kid. \nFor more laughs with the family, Son in Law will certainly do the trick. The film stars Pauley Shore as Crawl, who gets introduced to his girlfriend’s family over Thanksgiving break. Needless to say, Crawl isn’t exactly used to farm life. \nThanksgiving is also a time that marks the official start of the holiday season. With Christmas right around the corner, why not start the holidays off right with Miracle on 34th Street ? The classic actually begins with the Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, making it a perfect choice to go along with the turkey and stuffing. \nHappy Thanksgiving and happy steaming! \n[Featured Image by NBC/Universal]",

      "text": "Nathalie Caron Wed, Nov 23, 2016 12:09pm \nNetflix’s upcoming Lost in Space TV series has finally found its Dr. Smith, but there’s a tiny little catch: they've pulled a gender swap. \nActress Parker Posey ( Superman Returns ) has been cast in the role of the duplicitous Dr. Smith on the remake of Irwin Allen’s 1965 classic series. The role of Dr. Zachary Smith was previously brought to life by Jonathan Harris in the original series and by Gary Oldman in the 1998 movie. There’s no news as to the first name Parker Posey's Dr. Smith will have, but it's possible they'll go with a female-sounding variation of the character's original name. Or not. \nThe Legendary TV series follows the Robinsons who are forced to come together when they find themselves stranded light-years away from their intended destination. They not only have to battle their new alien surroundings but also their personal demons. The original series was set 30 years in the future (in 1997) and revolved around an attempt by the U.S. to colonize deep space by sending one single family on a five-and-a-half year journey to another planet. That is, until enemy agent Dr. Zachary Smith sabotages the mission, causing the ship to veer off course and essentially becoming lost in space. Oops! \nNetflix’s upcoming Lost in Space remake is the brain child of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold, Last Witch Hunter ) and stars Toby Stephens ( Black Sails ) as astrophysicist and family patriarch John Robinson, Molly Parker ( Deadwood ) as his wife and brilliant aerospace engineer Maureen Robinson, Taylor Russell ( Falling Skies ) as Judy Robinson and Max Jenkins ( Sense8 ) as Will Robinson. Zack Estrin ( Prison Break ) will serve as showrunner for the 10-episode TV series set for a 2018 premiere. \nWhat do you think of the casting of Parker Posey as Dr. Smith? What do you think of the gender swap?",

      "text": "(Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Saeed Adyani/Netflix) \nOne of the most beloved shows of the 2000s comes to life after 10 years off the air with Netflix's four-part revival \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" available to stream on Friday. \nSince it went off the air in 2007, \"Gilmore Girls\" reached cult status with a combination of the WB-turned-CW show's original fans yearning for more and new fans who discovered it later and binged their way through the seven seasons. I admit, I belong to the latter group. There's no telling how big that combined audience is now. Even if it isn't that big, bringing the show back could've only been made possible by a company like Netflix. It doesn't need high ratings — it just needs new subscribers.\nThat said, fans of the show are going to be delighted with this new revival. It's constructed to do just that. And everyone seems to have made their way back, even if for one scene, including the cast members who have gone on to stellar careers: Movie star Melissa McCarthy reprises her role as Lorelai's best friend, Sookie St. James; \"This Is Us\" star Milo Ventimiglia is back as Luke's nephew and Rory's ex, Jess; \"The Good Wife\" star Matt Czuchry reprises his role as Rory's college boyfriend, Logan; and \"How to Get Away With Murder's\" Liza Weil returns as Rory's alpha-female frenemy, Paris.\nNot to mention, there's a host of cameos by some pretty big stars, which Netflix has made me and other critics promise not to reveal.\nSplit into four 90-minute-ish episodes named after the four seasons, \"A Year in the Life\" brings Rory (Alexis Bledel) back to small, quirky Stars Hollow and reunites her with mom/best friend Lorelai (Lauren Graham) within seconds. That first hour of the show feels like a trippy fan dream as the two run around Stars Hollow and get reacquainted with the eccentric townsfolk who never left.\n(From left, Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham, and Alexis Bledel on Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"Robert Voets/Netflix) \nAs the title suggests, this show has always really been about the Gilmore family girls and the ways that life brings them together and pulls them apart. \nIn these new chapters, we see them once again in different stages of their lives. The funny thing is all three — yes, don't forget the force that is Lorelai's mother, Emily Gilmore (Kelly Bishop) — are struggling with romantic and career questions that are very specific to where they are in their lives.\nThere is also a tear-inducing flashback to an event that affects all of them: the death of patriarch Richard Gilmore. The actor who played him, Edward Herrmann, died of brain cancer in 2014.\nPossibly the biggest problem with the miniseries is that there's very little story for pretty much the first episode. Things pick up going into episode two. But again, fans just want to see their favorite characters again and probably won't care about an extended tour of the show's world for an episode. It's the same reason there's a call for a new \"Sex and the City\" movie — even if the past ones are pretty awful.\nThe true joy for fans will be creator Amy Sherman-Palladino's return after leaving the show ahead of its final season. After all, it's her world and rapid dialogue that we fell in love with. She splits the the writing/directing of the miniseries with her producing partner and husband, Daniel Palladino, but she gets to start and finish the tale with \"Winter\" (episode one) and \"Fall\" (episode four) — as it should be.\nAnd finally, fans will find out the last four words Amy Sherman-Palladino had always planned for the \"Gilmore Girls\" series finale and never got to use. We're interested to see if they live up to the fandom's built-up expectations. I suspect there will be some displeasure over it.\nWatch the trailer below: \n\nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n\nMore From Business Insider \nDave Chappelle is reportedly making $60 million for his Netflix comedy specials \nHere's everything leaving Netflix in December that you need to watch before it disappears \nNetflix is releasing 3 new comedy specials from Dave Chappelle",

      "text": "Thanksgiving Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving Looking for something to binge watch after your Thanksgiving dinner? Try out The CW's \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" Photo: Eddy Chen/The CW By Shannon O’Connor, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: # Comments \nThe dishes have been licked clean, the football games have ended and the turkey coma is finally setting in, so what is there to do now? It’s simple: binge-watch some TV. There is no better day to indulge in the cultural phenomenon than the day after Thanksgiving. So jump in (or stay in) your pajamas, find a comfy position on the couch and boot up your Netflix or Amazon que to one (or, if you are feeling adventurous, all) of these shows. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the the Life \nIt’s back! After months of hype and promotion, the four new 90-minute installments of “Gilmore Girls” are finally here . Take a trip back to Stars Hollow, Connecticut and revisit Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke and all the other colorful townsfolk fans have come to adore. Whether you have been a long-time Gilmore fan or are just discovering the series (in this case, bonus you get to binge more!) these installments should provide some laughs, tears and nostalgia (in whatever order you prefer). To accompany this binge, I would suggest copious amounts of coffee, pop tarts and tater tots. Also keep pizza and tacos nearby, you know, just in case. All seasons are currently streaming on Netflix and the new episodes arrive on Nov. 25 at 12:01am. \nGood Girls Revolt \nIn the past few weeks journalism has been an issue of much discussion, so there is no better time to dive into Amazon’s new series “Good Girls Revolt.” The series is loosely based on Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and is a fictionalized account of Povich and her female co-worker’s 1969 struggle with a sexual discrimination case against Newsweek magazine over pay and gender equality. Though the show is set a few decades in the past, it brings to light many issues still plaguing women in the workforce today (noticeably the pay gap). So, don’t be afraid to get inspired while watching. All episodes of the series first season are available on Amazon. \nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend \nMusical lovers and people who love a good Southern California joke or reference , do I have a show for you. Rachel Bloom’s “ Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ” is the musical-comedy extravaganza about a young New York hotshot lawyer who uproots her high-powered life to follow her old high school boyfriend back to West Covina only to find that he is in a serious relationship. Laughs, heartbreak and big (paradoxical) musical numbers ensue, but it is the heart in the show that will keep you coming back (the music is pretty catchy too, though). All episodes of the first season are available for streaming on Netflix. Season 2 is currently airing on The CW (So catch-up!). \nBlack Mirror \nIf you are in the mood for some more serious TV fare, try the bizarre but captivating anthology series “Black Mirror.” The series, which returned for a 6-episode third season late last month, tackles complex, yet engaging storylines that contribute to society’s greatest fears such as blackmail, technology and social media; but be ready for some twists and surprises.The show may make you paranoid (especially with events of late), but just remember it is fiction (for now). All episodes are streaming on Netflix. Advertisement \n“The Crown” \nThough at this point you may be a bit tired of politics and government, Netflix’s latest series “ The Crown ” about Queen Elizabeth II should not be missed. Though we have seen versions of the Queen’s life on screen before, this 10-part series not only focuses on the life of Elizabeth herself but the lives of those around her. Fans of series like “The Tudors” or “Reign” will undoubtedly be drawn to this British monarchy tale that has critics raving. All episodes of the first season are streaming on Netflix.",

      "title": "Thanksgiving Weekend Preview: The ‘Gilmore Girls’ Are Back And ‘The Simpsons’ Has A Huge Marathon",
      "text": "Netflix\n\nGilmore Girls: A Year In The Life (Netflix, Friday) – Arguably the most highly anticipated TV revival of the year is here. We’ve had almost a year of anticipating the return of the Gilmore Girls and it sounds like we won’t be disappointed with this new Netflix version. Expect plenty of callbacks to the original show, guest stars and time spent on the passing of family patriarch Richard (late actor Edward Herrmann). Also on the menu: plenty of snark, quick-fire dialogue and Rory’s love life.\nMacy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade (NBC, Thursday 9:00 a.m.) – The 90 th annual march down to that famous NYC storefront takes place today. Tony Bennett, Sarah McLachlan and Regina Spektor have been tapped to perform but some more stars will probably make surprise appearances on random floats, so keep an eye out in between bites of turkey.\nThe Walking Dead (AMC, Sunday 9:00 p.m.) – A lot of people are saying The Whisperers show up in this week’s episode and judging from the official synopsis, they might be right. A still clueless Tara and Heath stumble upon a new group while scavenging and their setup is unlike anything they’ve ever seen. If you’re a fan of the comics, you know The Whisperers were some pretty bad people: like wearing suits made of zombie-skin bad. Better to just loose all hope now that this show will ever have a happy ending.\nWestworld (HBO, Sunday 9:00 p.m.) – Hector considers Maeve’s proposition; Teddy pays the price for his new-found enlightenment; and Dolores and Bernard draw closer to uncovering/remembering the secrets of the park.\nThe Simpsons 600 Marathon (Fox, Thursday 12:00 p.m.) – Fox is giving fans a 13-day marathon event when it airs the first 600 episode of The Simpsons starting Thanksgiving Day. So after you’ve binged on turkey and pumpkin pie, binge on plenty of “D’oh!”\nMacy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade 90th Celebration (NBC, Wednesday 8:00 p.m.) – Take a look back at the parade’s history; memorable musical performances; and stars who’ve taken part in the festivities before the big day.\nSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X (CBS, Wednesday 8:00 p.m.) – The Gen Xers turn on each other as a power struggles erupts amongst the castaways.\nSNL Thanksgiving 2016 (NBC, Wednesday, 9:00 p.m.) – A look back at some of the best Thanksgiving-themed skits from Saturday Night Live over the years. You better believe Adam Sandler is making an appearance.\nCode Black (CBS, Wednesday 10:00 p.m.) – In what may be the weirdest episode of TV this week that isn’t related to any kind of holiday celebration, the doctors on Code Black treat members of a cult who unwillingly survived a mass suicide attempt.\nSearch Party (TBS, Wednesday 11:00 p.m.) – Dory hooks up with a mysterious P.I. hired to help find Chantal while the group attends a dinner party hosted by a hipster cult.\nThe Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration (ABC, Thursday 8:00 p.m.) – ABC taps DWTS siblings Julianne and Derek Hough to host a holiday celebration from the Walt Disney World Resort, featuring musical performances by Boyz II Men and JoJo; Alessia Cara; Mariah Carey; Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood; Kelly Clarkson; OneRepublic; and Flo Rida.\nThursday Night Football: Steelers at Colts (NBC, Thursday 8:30 p.m.) — Pittsburgh at Indianapolis. The Steelers routed Indy 45-10 in last year’s meeting, with Ben Roethlisberger throwing for 364 yards and four touchdowns.\nThe Great Indoors (CBS, Thursday 8:30 p.m.) – HR forbids Jack from giving feedback to his team after his unnecessarily harsh review of Clark’s work performance. Meanwhile, Emma and Mason confront Brooke for not being woke enough after they help try to add diversity to the intern staff.\nMom (CBS, Thursday 9:00 p.m.) – Violet comes down with a case of mono but, surprisingly, that’s not the worst of her problems.\nLife in Pieces (CBS, Thursday 9:30 p.m.) – John suspects one of Joan’s teachers has a crush on her; Tyler and Clementine have Matt and Colleen over for dinner; Greg misses Lark’s first steps; and Colleen, Heather, Jen and Dougie have a ladies night out.\nPure Genius (CBS, Thursday 10:00 p.m.) – James tries to convince a hockey player with a serious spinal injury to undergo a risky surgery in order to help him walk again. Maybe we should just give a blanket warning to anyone coming to this hospital: all surgeries will be risky.\nSearch Party (TBS, Thursday 8:00 p.m. – 11:30 p.m.) – In case you missed the first handful of episodes, TBS is giving you a chance to catch up with a marathon of the comedy series before two new episodes air at their regular time.\nZ Nation (Syfy, Friday 9:00 p.m.) – Doc encounters a menacing threat as he tries to communicate with Warren.\nVan Helsing (Syfy, Friday 10:00 p.m.) — There are glimmers of hope and reasons for grief when Vanessa and the group take shelter at Susan’s family farm. With Sam finally outed as the serial killer, Vanessa and Mohamad take drastic action against him.\nSearch Party (TBS, Friday 11:00 p.m.) – The search for Chantal ends with some surprising twists (and a bit of bloodshed) thrown in.\nLegends of the Hidden Temple (Nickelodeon, Saturday 8:00 p.m.) – A relic from your childhood is being brought back to life this weekend when Nickelodeon revives their popular game show in movie form.

      "text": "20 movies streaming on Netflix you need to watch with your BFFs during Thanksgiving break jessica tholmer More Thanksgiving is upon us and whether or not you have a long break at work, we can (and should!) always find time to spend time with our friends. Because it is the end of 2016 and we have all finally realized that we all love Netflix and hanging around (raise your hand if you prefer Netflixing with your friends to going out on the town — I know I’m not alone) we have compiled a well-rounded list of the 20 best movies to watch with your friends over Thanksgiving break . (Most of these are fine to watch alone too, if you’re into that.) 1. Pleasantville Pleasantville tells the story of teenage siblings who get transported back in time to the world of the 1950s. The movie is creative (turns to black and white when David and Jennifer are in the 50s, costume changes, etc.) but it is also a really telling film to re-watch at a time where we could all use a reminder of how history can repeat itself. I mean, plus Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire are young and adorable. 2. While You Were Sleeping Speaking of adorable, Sandra Bullock always is, and if you haven’t seen While You Were Sleeping , now is the time. (And if you have, it is always worth a rewatch.) Falling in love while one of you is in a coma is just the kind of unrealistic romcom plot you need this Thanksgiving break. 3. Hope Floats Okay, while we’re at it, why not watch another classic Bullock and throw on Hope Floats . Bullock plays Birdee, a woman who turns her humiliation into a reminder that you can always find solace in home. 4. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days On a lighter note, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is the epitome of the kind of movie that is a blast to watch with a group of friends. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey play each other while falling in love — it’s lighthearted, fun, and their chemistry still holds up today! 5. Titanic So anyway, Titanic is on Netflix right now and everyone should just always watch Titanic at least once a year. Grab your friends and settle in for 3.5 hours of nostalgia, quoting the movie out loud, and probably still shedding a few tears. 6. White Christmas Some people wait for Thanksgiving to end before throwing on the Christmas movies, but guess what?! It’s time. White Christmas is a joy — singing, dancing, a love story, and a great tale of friendship (and sisterhood)! 7. Love Actually Love Actually is one of the most enjoyable movies of all-time, in my very biased opinion. The movie takes place in the six weeks before Christmas, there are a handful of storylines to follow (something for everyone!), and we get to watch a lot of people fall in love. Interwoven in the stories are tales of friendship, heartbreak, and octopus costumes. 8. Cooked Food writer Michael Pollan explores the art of cooking in a deep way in Cooked , traveling around the world to teach us how food can truly shape our lives and relationships. I mean, a documentary called Cooked feels pretty apt for Thanksgiving. 9. She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry On the documentary kick, She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry is a great look into the lives of some of the most radically outspoken and incredibly inspirational women who helped shape the specific feminist movement that began in the 1960s. What better documentary to watch with your equally badass girlfriends? 10 . Tangerine The gritty and wonderful Tangerine is not as light of a watch as some of the movies on this list (though it is classified as a dark comedy), but it is purely beautiful storytelling. Sin-Dee and her best friend Alexandria explore Los Angeles as they seek to get revenge on someone who has wronged Sin-Dee. A super interesting and important watch. 11. Ties That Bind Ties That Bind is the story of three different women who all of one life-changing and tragic event in common. Though Ties That Bind is sad, it is also hopeful and necessary. Women are so strong, and if you need a reminder of that, Ties That Bind is the perfect movie for your group of pals. 12. Amelie Amelie is a woman drawn toward romance, but in the simplest form — the little things. A whimsical and joyous film that is best watched with a group of equally ambitious and romantic BFFs. 13. Mean Girls Now when I say “Friendship,” you say…? MEAN GIRLS . Or, you might if you were a teenager in 2004 like I was. Though obviously Mean Girls has a lot of harsh lessons about friendship, it is hilarious through and through, still to this day. Obviously a great movie to watch with your friends, by yourself, with your mom, with your cat, at the gym, or literally anywhere, anytime, forever. Read More 14. Crossroads Speaking of being a teenager, Crossroads is on Netflix. Crossroads is pure silliness with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Watch this movie with your girlfriends right now, especially if you haven’t seen it since its theatrical release like this girl! 15. Clueless Along the lines of Mean Girls , Clueless stays hilarious to this day, even though I am just slightly younger than the generation this movie was intended for. Dionne and Cher have an incredible friendship, something to aspire to even now. (Plus Paul Rudd, what a babe.) 16. Heathers The darkest of the cult classic trio of films that provide commentary on teenage girls and their high school lives, Heathers is a fantastic movie for a group. Suspense, comedy, morbid bits, and Winona? We’re in. 17. The Little Prince Most of us have come across The Little Prince in its book form, but it is time to watch the Netflix original movie now. The Little Prince is a lot of things, at its briefest description, it is a story of unlikely friendship. (THE BEST KIND.) 18. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe I mean, why not? The movies may have fallen short past the first film, but it is still a magical and exciting journey to watch. The score alone is worth the film, and adventurous fantasy movies are great to watch with your besties. (And let’s be real, Harry Potter isn’t on Netflix so this is the next best thing.) 19. Lilo and Stitch Lilo and Stitch is one of the best and sweetest stories of friendship (and family!) that exists in the Disney world. If you haven’t seen it, grab tissues. (And if you have, still grab tissues.) 20. Home Animated films are great to watch in a group, and if you missed Home in the theaters, it’s definitely worth your time now. An unusual friendship, Rihanna, and lots of heartwarming silliness. Grab your leftovers and throw it on. Enjoy the rest of your Thanksgiving break with your friends, lots of coffee and pie, and someone’s Netflix account. Happy Thanksgiving!",

Because it is the end of 2016 and we have all finally realized that we all love Netflix and hanging around (raise your hand if you prefer Netflixing with your friends to going out on the town — I know I’m not alone) we have compiled a well-rounded list of the 20 best movies to watch with your friends over Thanksgiving break . (Most of these are fine to watch alone too, if you’re into that.)\n1. Pleasantville \nPleasantville tells the story of teenage siblings who get transported back in time to the world of the 1950s. The movie is creative (turns to black and white when David and Jennifer are in the 50s, costume changes, etc.) but it is also a really telling film to re-watch at a time where we could all use a reminder of how history can repeat itself. I mean, plus Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire are young and adorable.\n2. While You Were Sleeping Speaking of adorable, Sandra Bullock always is, and if you haven’t seen While You Were Sleeping , now is the time. (And if you have, it is always worth a rewatch.) Falling in love while one of you is in a coma is just the kind of unrealistic romcom plot you need this Thanksgiving break.\n3. Hope Floats Okay, while we’re at it, why not watch another classic Bullock and throw on Hope Floats . Bullock plays Birdee, a woman who turns her humiliation into a reminder that you can always find solace in home.\n4. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days \n\n\nOn a lighter note, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is the epitome of the kind of movie that is a blast to watch with a group of friends. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey play each other while falling in love — it’s lighthearted, fun, and their chemistry still holds up today!\n5. Titanic \n\nSo anyway, Titanic is on Netflix right now and everyone should just always watch Titanic at least once a year. Grab your friends and settle in for 3.5 hours of nostalgia, quoting the movie out loud, and probably still shedding a few tears.\n6. White Christmas Some people wait for Thanksgiving to end before throwing on the Christmas movies, but guess what?! It’s time. White Christmas is a joy — singing, dancing, a love story, and a great tale of friendship (and sisterhood)!\n7. Love Actually \nLove Actually is one of the most enjoyable movies of all-time, in my very biased opinion. The movie takes place in the six weeks before Christmas, there are a handful of storylines to follow (something for everyone!), and we get to watch a lot of people fall in love. Interwoven in the stories are tales of friendship, heartbreak, and octopus costumes.\n8. Cooked Food writer Michael Pollan explores the art of cooking in a deep way in Cooked , traveling around the world to teach us how food can truly shape our lives and relationships. I mean, a documentary called Cooked feels pretty apt for Thanksgiving.\n9. She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry On the documentary kick, She’s Beautiful When She’s Angry is a great look into the lives of some of the most radically outspoken and incredibly inspirational women who helped shape the specific feminist movement that began in the 1960s. What better documentary to watch with your equally badass girlfriends?\n10 . Tangerine The gritty and wonderful Tangerine is not as light of a watch as some of the movies on this list (though it is classified as a dark comedy), but it is purely beautiful storytelling. Sin-Dee and her best friend Alexandria explore Los Angeles as they seek to get revenge on someone who has wronged Sin-Dee. A super interesting and important watch.\n11. Ties That Bind Ties That Bind is the story of three different women who all of one life-changing and tragic event in common. Though Ties That Bind is sad, it is also hopeful and necessary. Women are so strong, and if you need a reminder of that, Ties That Bind is the perfect movie for your group of pals.\n12. Amelie \nAmelie is a woman drawn toward romance, but in the simplest form — the little things. A whimsical and joyous film that is best watched with a group of equally ambitious and romantic BFFs.\n\n13. Mean Girls Now when I say “Friendship,” you say…? MEAN GIRLS . Or, you might if you were a teenager in 2004 like I was. Though obviously Mean Girls has a lot of harsh lessons about friendship, it is hilarious through and through, still to this day. Obviously a great movie to watch with your friends, by yourself, with your mom, with your cat, at the gym, or literally anywhere, anytime, forever.\n14. Crossroads \nSpeaking of being a teenager, Crossroads is on Netflix. Crossroads is pure silliness with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Watch this movie with your girlfriends right now, especially if you haven’t seen it since its theatrical release like this girl!\n15. Clueless Along the lines of Mean Girls , Clueless stays hilarious to this day, even though I am just slightly younger than the generation this movie was intended for. Dionne and Cher have an incredible friendship, something to aspire to even now. (Plus Paul Rudd, what a babe.)\n16. Heathers \nThe darkest of the cult classic trio of films that provide commentary on teenage girls and their high school lives, Heathers is a fantastic movie for a group. Suspense, comedy, morbid bits, and Winona? We’re in.\n17. The Little Prince Most of us have come across The Little Prince in its book form, but it is time to watch the Netflix original movie now. The Little Prince is a lot of things, at its briefest description, it is a story of unlikely friendship. (THE BEST KIND.)\n18. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe I mean, why not? The movies may have fallen short past the first film, but it is still a magical and exciting journey to watch. The score alone is worth the film, and adventurous fantasy movies are great to watch with your besties. (And let’s be real, Harry Potter isn’t on Netflix so this is the next best thing.)\n19. Lilo and Stitch \nLilo and Stitch is one of the best and sweetest stories of friendship (and family!) that exists in the Disney world. If you haven’t seen it, grab tissues. (And if you have, still grab tissues.)\n20. Home Animated films are great to watch in a group, and if you missed Home in the theaters, it’s definitely worth your time now. An unusual friendship, Rihanna, and lots of heartwarming silliness. Grab your leftovers and throw it on.\nEnjoy the rest of your Thanksgiving break with your friends, lots of coffee and pie, and someone’s Netflix account. Happy Thanksgiving!\nThe post 20 movies streaming on Netflix you need to watch with your BFFs during Thanksgiving break appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Tom Breihan @tombreihan | 9:35 am Share < br />this article: \nNetflix recently hit the world with a new season of the British sci-fi headfuck anthology show Black Mirror , and its best episode is the only one that will not make you feel like we our watching our planet descend into some new cultural hell. The episode “San Junipero” is a deeply moving romantic fantasy that takes place in some version of a California party town in 1987. And its soundtrack is a total nonstop parade of amazing ’80s hits, all of which must’ve cost a fortune to license. \nSpeaking about the episode, Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker says, “There’s huge nostalgia for me. All the music I said I hated, I secretly loved all of it; T’Pau and all of that. It was a great way for me to indulge in all those guilty pleasures, to go back and revisit all of that music people claimed to hate in 1987.” But the episode also has a glimmering score from composer Clint Mansell, and that score is about to get a commercial release, as NME reports . Check below for the tracklist. \nTRACKLIST: 02 “Faith, Hope, Fear & Falling In Love” 03 “Tick Tock (Clock Of My Heart)” 04 “Night Drive” 05 “Property Of Tucker Systems” 06 “In Sickness, In Health” 07 “Life Eternal” 08 “Waves Crashing On Distant Shores Of Time” 09 “Endless Summer” 10 “San Junipero (Saturday Night In the City Of The Dead)” \nThe soundtrack is out 12/2 on Lakeshore Records . And while it sucks a bit that this is the score, and not a collection of songs from the episode, take consolation in knowing that Brooker has turned all of those songs in to a Spotify playlist, which you can hear below.",

      "text": "Netflix Will Release the Score from Black Mirror 's \"San Junipero\" By Joe Allen | November 23, 2016 | 1:05pm Share Tweet Text \nThe third season of Black Mirror was recently released on Netflix , and it left many people with the usual feelings of uneasiness that follow every season of the show. Among the season’s best and most hopeful episodes was “San Junipero,” which also featured an incredible soundtrack, coupled with a score that is just as stunning. Now, Black Mirror fans will be able to get their hands on that score, according to NME . \nWhile this release may not include the pop music that is so prevalent throughout the episode, find solace in the fact that Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker made a Spotify playlist of that music—find that here . “There’s huge nostalgia for me,” Brooker said of the songs. “All the music I said I hated, I secretly loved all of it; T’Pau and all of that. It was a great way for me to indulge in all those guilty pleasures, to go back and revisit all of that music people claimed to hate in 1987.” \nThe soundtrack features 10 songs, and is set to be released by Lakeshore Records on Dec. 2. Composed by Clint Mansell, the score for the episode reinforces the popular music that pops up throughout, and makes the time-hopping “San Junipero” even more immersive. Check out the score’s full tracklist below, and further down, listen to Brooker’s favorite guilty pleasure via the Paste Cloud. \nBlack Mirror “San Junipero” Score Tracklist: 01 San Junipero (80s-90s-00s-??s) 02 Faith, Hope, Fear & Falling In Love 03 Tick Tock (Clock Of My Heart) 04 Night Drive 05 Property Of Tucker Systems 06 In Sickness, In Health 07 Life Eternal 08 Waves Crashing On Distant Shores Of Time 09 Endless Summer 10 San Junipero (Saturday Night In the City Of The Dead) Tags",

      "text": "Thanksgiving Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving Looking for something to binge watch after your Thanksgiving dinner? Try out The CW's \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" Photo: Eddy Chen/The CW By Shannon O’Connor, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: # Comments \nThe dishes have been licked clean, the football games have ended and the turkey coma is finally setting in, so what is there to do now? It’s simple: binge-watch some TV. There is no better day to indulge in the cultural phenomenon than the day after Thanksgiving. So jump in (or stay in) your pajamas, find a comfy position on the couch and boot up your Netflix or Amazon que to one (or, if you are feeling adventurous, all) of these shows. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the the Life \nIt’s back! After months of hype and promotion, the four new 90-minute installments of “Gilmore Girls” are finally here . Take a trip back to Stars Hollow, Connecticut and revisit Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke and all the other colorful townsfolk fans have come to adore. Whether you have been a long-time Gilmore fan or are just discovering the series (in this case, bonus you get to binge more!) these installments should provide some laughs, tears and nostalgia (in whatever order you prefer). To accompany this binge, I would suggest copious amounts of coffee, pop tarts and tater tots. Also keep pizza and tacos nearby, you know, just in case. All seasons are currently streaming on Netflix and the new episodes arrive on Nov. 25 at 12:01am. \nGood Girls Revolt \nIn the past few weeks journalism has been an issue of much discussion, so there is no better time to dive into Amazon’s new series “Good Girls Revolt.” The series is loosely based on Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and is a fictionalized account of Povich and her female co-worker’s 1969 struggle with a sexual discrimination case against Newsweek magazine over pay and gender equality. Though the show is set a few decades in the past, it brings to light many issues still plaguing women in the workforce today (noticeably the pay gap). So, don’t be afraid to get inspired while watching. All episodes of the series first season are available on Amazon. \nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend \nMusical lovers and people who love a good Southern California joke or reference , do I have a show for you. Rachel Bloom’s “ Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ” is the musical-comedy extravaganza about a young New York hotshot lawyer who uproots her high-powered life to follow her old high school boyfriend back to West Covina only to find that he is in a serious relationship. Laughs, heartbreak and big (paradoxical) musical numbers ensue, but it is the heart in the show that will keep you coming back (the music is pretty catchy too, though). All episodes of the first season are available for streaming on Netflix. Season 2 is currently airing on The CW (So catch-up!). \nBlack Mirror \nIf you are in the mood for some more serious TV fare, try the bizarre but captivating anthology series “Black Mirror.” The series, which returned for a 6-episode third season late last month, tackles complex, yet engaging storylines that contribute to society’s greatest fears such as blackmail, technology and social media; but be ready for some twists and surprises.The show may make you paranoid (especially with events of late), but just remember it is fiction (for now). All episodes are streaming on Netflix. Advertisement \n“The Crown” \nThough at this point you may be a bit tired of politics and government, Netflix’s latest series “ The Crown ” about Queen Elizabeth II should not be missed. Though we have seen versions of the Queen’s life on screen before, this 10-part series not only focuses on the life of Elizabeth herself but the lives of those around her. Fans of series like “The Tudors” or “Reign” will undoubtedly be drawn to this British monarchy tale that has critics raving. All episodes of the first season are streaming on Netflix.",

      "title": "Fast-talking 'Gilmore Girls' returns; mad binging forecast",
      "text": "1 / 6 This image released by Netflix shows Lauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream.\nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\"\nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai.\nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns.\nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored.\nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview.\n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\"\nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe.\nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots).\nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original.\n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\"\nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general.\n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said.\nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series.\n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\"\nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it.\nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman.\n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said.\nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon.\nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene.\n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said.\nRead More And does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\"\nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\"\n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\"\nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening?\n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\"\n___\nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth . \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com View the original article on TVGuide.com *DISCLAIMER* : The information contained in or provided through this site section is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional advice.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle is bringing three stand-up specials to Netflix - FOX5 Vegas - KVVU Member Center: Dave Chappelle is bringing three stand-up specials to Netflix Updated: \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth . \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com View the original article on TVGuide.com *DISCLAIMER* : The information contained in or provided through this site section is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional advice.

      "text": "early 2000s Share this article \nGilmore Girls graced us with its presence on Netflix last fall, and we've been working our way through the ups and downs of life in Stars Hollow, CT, like it's our job. Seven years may have passed since the show was on the air, but it's still (always) one of our faves because its witty, real and heartwarming nature is timeless. Still need convincing? Here are 25 irrefutable reasons why: 1. The characters focus on the important things in life... 2. ...like drinks... 3. ...and hating the same things our friends hate. 4. Our guys can really learn from Luke! \n....and Max... \n...and Jess... \n...and Dean. 5. We can watch the Tristan-Dean fight over and over again (and imagine they were fighting over us). 6. ...And drool like Louise while staring at a young Chad Michael Murray . \nHis stint on the show was FAR too brief. 7. Rory's first \"I love you\" might just be the TV scene of the decade. 8. Because sometimes love is just really confusing. 9. But Lorelai knows how to turn our attitudes around with some good old self-affirmation. 10. She learned to put a positive spin on things when growing up with the most difficult mother of all time. 11. And though Lorelai may not be traditional, she gives excellent motherly advice. 12. And she passed on important values to Rory. Like her TV addiction. 13. Rory and Lorelai make us feel better about our lack of ability to function in morning classes... 14. ...not to mention our NEED for caffeine. 15. Rory shares our disdain for excessive PDA... 16. ...and our serious struggles during finals... 17. ...and shows us how to handle mother-daughter disagreements like a pro. 18. Lorelai gets how happy shoes make us... 19. ...and that pizza solves just about everything... 20. ...and that cake is something we simply cannot live without. 21. But when food doesn't have the answer, our people do. \nThey're just the cutest mother-daughter pair ever. #lifegoals 22. Because Paris's ambition is intense but inspiring . 23. And even though she's an oversharer, we all want a Miss Patty in our lives. 24. And Kirk's working on a way for us to avoid the gym, so we HAVE to keep him around. 25. Plus, Emily is a straight-up boss. \nIf you learn nothing from Lorelai and Rory, learn this at least from Emily and Paris: Who run the world? GIRLS. You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition 'Gilmore Girls': The 16 Episodes to (Re)Watch Before Netflix's Revival 9:45 AM 6/17/2016 by Kate Stanhope The WB/Photofest \nFew die-hard Gilmore Girls fans need an excuse to dive back into the beloved family dramedy and binge-watch old episodes, but this summer, they have one. With the Netflix revival set to debut sometime later this year – no premiere has yet been announced – now is the perfect time for both longtime fans and new viewers to catch up on the biggest hours from the show's original seven seasons to properly relive all the biggest romances, breakups, family arguments and Friday night dinners that changed the show. \"Pilot\" Season 1 First things first, let's just say it: This pilot is a little rough. The banter isn't quite up to speed, Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) argue too much and Luke's formal attire (no ball cap, a buttoned down shirt) is just bizarre. This is like watching The Simpsons when it was just a roughly animated sketch on The Tracy Ullman Show. The characters' edges and quirks haven't quite been figured out yet. However, this still sets up all the major need-to-know points like Lorelai's long estrangement from Richard (Edward Herrmann) and Emily (Kelly Bishop), Rory's move from Stars Hollow High to Chilton and also shows Rory and Dean's first meeting. \"Christopher Returns\" Season 1 \nThe episode, as the title so implies, centers on the proper introduction of Rory's father, and Lorelai's on-and-off love interest, Christopher (David Sutcliffe). After channeling his inner James Dean and arriving at the Gilmore house late at night on his motorcycle at the end of the episode prior, Mr. Deadbeat Dad 2001 gets a proper introduction to the zany town that is Stars Hollow, as do the viewers, who learn that Al's Pancake World does not serve pancakes, among other factoids. The episode also features a crucial Friday Night Dinner, in which Christopher's dreadful parents slam Lorelai for ruining their son's life before Richard comes to her defense and kicks them out – a true turning point in Lorelai's newly re-ignited relationship with her parents. \"Love, Daisies and Troubadours\" Season 1 \nAfter being unable to find the words – no, really – to tell Dean (Jared Padalecki) she loves him, Rory is finally able to express her love for him in the season one finale. In one of the least romantic engagements in all of TV history, Max (Scott Cohen) originally proposes marriage to Lorelai over the phone in the midst of an argument. However, when she chastises him for his lack of showmanship –\"there should be a thousand yellow daisies,\" she tells him – he makes up for it by sending, yup, a thousand yellow daisies to her. In hindsight, this season finale pales in comparison to the heightened plot twists, blow-ups and romance to come in later seasons, but the sight of Lorelai sitting in shock and awe among a thousand yellow daisies is an image treasured by all true Gilmore Girls fans. \"Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy\" Season 2 \nIt's hard to imagine Gilmore Girls before the eternal Jess or Dean debate, but indeed, Milo Ventimiglia's leather jacket-clad troublemaker didn't come to town until several episodes into the second season. He wastes no time making an impression (trying to take beer from Lorelai's fridge, stealing Babette's gnome), subsequently causing the normally cool-headed Luke to push him into a lake. However, he leaves the biggest mark on Rory, who is instantly intrigued by his intelligence and manages to find a softer side of Jess not readily accessible to the outside world. Dean never stood a chance. \"I Can't Get Started\" Season 2 \nGilmore Girls became known for its epic season enders that manager to wrap up old storylines while simultaneously blowing everything up for the season to come and it all started with season two. No offense to the best chef in town, but Sookie's (Melissa McCarthy) wedding seems like small potatoes compared to Rory and Jess' pre-ceremony lip lock after he returns to town. The biggest seismic shift of all is Lorelai and Christopher's brief reconciliation before he learns that his ex Sherry (Madchen Amick) is pregnant and opts to get back together with her so that – and here's the gut punch – he doesn’t miss \"They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?\" Season 3 \nThis might be peak Gilmore Girls thanks to the hour's perfect blend of small town shenanigans – Lorelai enters a 24-hour dance content to try and dethrone repeat winner Kirk (Sean Gunn) – and soapy drama as Dean breaks up with Rory midway through the contest because of her poorly hidden affection for Jess. There are few more heartbreaking moments in the series than Kirk running triumphantly around the gym with his trophy to the Rocky theme song while Lorelai stands in the middle confusingly consoling a crying Rory. Don't cry too hard for her though, she started dating Jess the very next episode. \"Say Goodnight, Gracie\" Season 3 \nSure, the season three ender is a stellar episode thanks to Rory's tear jerker of a valedictorian speech, but this is really when things fall apart, and come together, ahead of season four. A Yale-bound Rory finally learns that the truth, i.e. that Jess has flunked out of school and can't take her to prom and the episode ends with him fleeing town, and their relationship, for good in favor of sunny California skies. And on top of that, Dean tells Rory he's engaged. But Lorelai and Sookie get good news when Fran Weston dies, and their dream inn becomes available to purchase in the wake of the fire at their now-former job. \"Ted Koppel's Big Night Out\" Season 4 \nSkipping this far into season four may feel strange, but the transition from high school to college was rough on both Rory and the show, so this is a protective mechanism at its finest. During a lavish tailgate for the Yale-Harvard football game, Rory introduces her family to her awkward new college friend Marty (Wayne Wilcox), aka \"Naked Guy\" and Emily is incensed to discover that Richard has been having lunch with his former flame Pennilyn Lott for years without telling her. The episode kicks off new romances for Paris (Liza Weil), with the much older Professor Fleming (Michael York), and Lorelai, with her father's business partner Jason Stiles (Chris Eigeman). \"Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom!\" Season 4 \nSure, it's easy to fast-forward through a lot of early season four episodes, but the second half had several irons on the fire in advance of the jaw-dropping season finale. After learning that Dean has dropped out of school to work more and save up for his wife's dream townhouse, Rory shares her displeasure at Doose's loudly and is overheard by Lindsay (Arielle Kebbel), who tells Dean he can no longer talk to her. He goes against her wishes and tells Rory he wants to be friends anyways. In one of the more explosive Friday night dinners, Lorelai meets Jason's parents right before his father tells Richard he's suing him and outs Lorelai and Jason as a couple. The episode ends with Richard agreeing to push out Jason and go back to his firm to avoid the lawsuit. Suffice it to say, Jason didn't last much longer. \"Raincoats and Recipes\" Season 4 \nLorelai and Luke kiss for the first time! Rory loses her virginity to Dean! Emily and Richard confirm their separation! It's amazing how many monumental moments the writers jam packed into 42 minutes of television. Once Luke and Lorelai shared their first, and second, kiss on the porch of the newly opened Dragonfly Inn, there was no going back for the former will-they-won't-they-couple. Rory's decision to sleep with Dean despite his still being married to Lindsay brought on the first of the mother-daughter's two major quarrels during the show's seven-season run. (We'll get to the second one in a bit.) \"Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant!\" Season 5 \nAnyone else detecting a major pattern between big episodes of the series and those containing exclamation points in the title? Although this skips over a very sweet first date between Lorelai and Luke, in which he tells her he's \"all in,\" most viewers basically already knew that after his years and years of secret pining. The episode is more notable for Rory's deep dive into the world of mystery man Logan (Matt Czuchry) and his secret society, as well as the sudden return of Christopher, who becomes a single dad after Sherry abandons him and baby Gigi to run away to Paris. The episode ends with Rory coldly telling Christopher to stay away from Lorelai so as not to ruin her relationship with Luke, which proves important in… \"Wedding Bell Blues\" Season 5 \nEmily and Richard (finally!) reunite and celebrate the occasion by throwing a lavish vow renewal ceremony. Ever the manipulative one, Emily uses her special day to squeeze Christopher in between Lorelai and Luke and break them up for good. Now officially no longer with Dean, Rory makes the first move with Logan, but unfortunately their passionate kissing is so very awkwardly interrupted by Lorelai, and Luke, and a drunk Christopher. After Christopher tells Lorelai he was sent by her mother to break her up from Luke, she cuts off all ties with her mother and Luke leaves, breaking up with her in the following episode. \"A House Is Not a Home\" Season 5 \nAt this point, Rory and Logan are in a committed relationship, but this time around, it's his father causing all the trouble. The episode opens with Lorelai picking Rory up from jail, where she was put after being arrested for trying to steal a yacht. Wait, what? Rory's klepto episode is brought on by newspaper magnate Mitchum Huntzberger (Gregg Henry), who tells Rory in the previous episode that she doesn't have what it takes to be a journalist. Rory tells Lorelai she doesn’t want to go back to school, and when Lorelai tries to enlist her parents to help change Rory's mind, they instead agree to let Rory take time off and move into their pool house. As if that wasn't eventful enough, the episode ends with Lorelai proposing to Luke. \"The Prodigal Daughter Returns\" Season 6 \nAfter nearly half a season of estrangement – a lifetime in Gilmore Girls years – Lorelai and Rory reconcile. The latter re-enrolls at Yale thanks to a well-timed visit from Jess and a huge argument with Emily in the episode prior. But while her relationship with Rory is just coming back together, Lorelai's relationship with Luke is on the verge of falling apart after they get into a huge fight about Christopher and after Luke discovers he's the father of a teenage girl (Vanessa Marano) he never knew about it. Worst of all, he decides not to tell Lorelai about the bombshell, creating huge ramifications for their relationship for the rest of the season. \"Partings\" Season 6 \nFor those who really want to be technical about it, this might as well be true blue original series finale of Gilmore Girls . This was the last episode from creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and frequent writer/director Daniel Palladino before they departed the series over a financial dispute. Sherman-Palladino has said that while the events of season seven will have occurred in the revival, they don't conflict heavily with her planned story arcs, so everything after this point is taken with a big grain of salt. As the husband-and-wife team left it, Rory bids an emotional farewell to a recently graduated Logan as he heads off to London to follow his father's orders. Meanwhile, Lorelai walks away from her relationship with Luke after he refuses to elope, and subsequently wakes up in Christopher's bed. \"Unto the Breach\" Season 7 \nTo a certain extent, it feels wrong, very, very wrong to include a season seven episode on this list, but seeing as Logan and Christopher will both be in the revival in some capacity, their season seven storylines must be addressed. The penultimate episode centers on Rory's graduation party, which sets the scene for Christopher and Lorelai's first sighting since their messy divorce – yes, they got married, it's a thing, let's move on – and Logan's very public to proposal to Rory. She turns it down the next day moments after receiving her diploma and Logan promptly rejects her backup offer to continue their long-distance relationship. ",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle is bringing three stand-up specials to Netflix - WFSB 3 Connecticut Member Center: Dave Chappelle is bringing three stand-up specials to Netflix Updated: \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth . \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com View the original article on TVGuide.com *DISCLAIMER* : The information contained in or provided through this site section is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional advice.
