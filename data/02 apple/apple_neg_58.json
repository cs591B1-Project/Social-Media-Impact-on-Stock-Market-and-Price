      "text": "by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nSamsung and Apple have been fighting court battles since 2011 over phones that neither company actually sells anymore. Apple claimed that Samsung copied some of its iPhone designs for the physical appearance and software for early versions of Samsung’s Galaxy line of Android phones. And a jury did find in 2012 that Samsung infringed on Apple’s patents, but the case made its way all the way to the US Supreme Court as Samsung challenged the way the penalties were calculated. \nAs Reuters summarizes , in 2012 Samsung was ordered to pay Apple $930 million. But an appeals court in 2015 reduced that amount to $548 million, which Samsung said was still too much, given the circumstances. \nIt turns out the Supreme Court agrees with Samsung (pdf link). \nAt question was the issue of whether an “article of manufacture,” as described in patent law means a finished product, or just a component. Samsung argued that while it was found guilty of violating Apple design patents, they only covered some components of the company’s complex smartphones… and so rather than paying damages based on the total price of a smartphone, the damages should be calculated based solely on the cost of the infringing components. \nWhile Samsung did pay $548 million to Apple last year, the company wants to get $399 million back. And Samsung could probably use a bit of extra cash right now. \nIn ruling for Samsung, the Supreme Court hasn’t actually said how much money Apple should refund Samsung. Instead, the justices, in a unanimous decision, simply agreed that “article of manufacture” applies to components and not just finished products and ordered the case to be sent back to a lower court to figure out damages. \nSo what’s the likely impact of all this on future patent disputes? Damages are likely to be lower, which could reduce incentive for some patent rights holders to pursue legal action. \nThen again, even if Samsung gets back $399 million, the company will still have paid Apple $149 million in damages. And that’s not even mentioning the amount of money the company had to spend to defend itself in court. So if you’re thinking of releasing a product that infringes on a few patents, you’d still better have very deep pockets. Share this:",

      "text": "Apple Watch sales hit record 10:26am EST - 01:11 \nApple CEO Tim Cook says the holiday quarter is on track to be the best ever for the Apple Watch. As Fred Katayama reports, this comes just as iPhone sales are beginning to level off.   \nGood time for Apple? Reuters has learned Apple Watch sales to consumers set a record in the first week of holiday shopping. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the gadget. He said the watch could be in his words \"one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.\" He did not say how many were sold. Analysts say strong sales are to be expected during the holidays because the watch makes a more natural gift than, say, a Mac or an iPhone. And the holiday quarter is usually Apple's strongest. But just Monday, research firm IDC estimated that Apple Watch shipments had fallen 71 percent in the third quarter from a year ago. Apple needs new sources of growth. Sales of its key product, the iPhone, have begun to level off. TECHnalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell doubts the Apple Watch can make up for that, saying, \"While I'm not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category.\" Apple shares, which have underperformed the broader market with just a roughly 4 percent gain this year, rose at the start of trading.  //reut.rs/2hcKD4v",

      "text": "Share \nApple just recently rolled out another new bit of functionality for the Apple Watch. The latest version of the Apple Store app for Apple watch now allows wearers to make purchases right from their smartwatches. \nAs of now, purchases Apple Watch users can make are limited to lower priced items (meaning this excludes iMacs and most other Apple devices) and accessories that they had previously favorited on the Apple Store’s app for iPhone and iPad. The upcoming AirPods will likely be included for purchase when they eventually show up in stores. \nUsers still can’t browse Apple’s online catalog directly with the watch or make immediate purchases straight from their wearable tech device. Payment for favorited items purchased via Apple Watch will be conducted via Apple Pay. \nAs far as increasing functionality of wearable tech, this newest development is a bit low on the scale. Though it’s certainly a new bit of convenience for Apple’s biggest fans, it might not be the sort of development that will influence sales much. \nThe smartwatch market cooled down considerably in the second half of 2016 — declining by 52 percent in the third quarter of 2016. Total smartwatch volumes reached 2.7 million units shipped in Q3, compared to the 5.6 million units shipped in the third quarter of last year.",

      "text": "The Supreme Court tossed an Apple lawsuit against Samsung on Tuesday after ruling in Samsung’s favor, the Associated Press said. This isn’t the end of the suit that has run on and on since a ruling in 2012. Litigation will continue in lower courts.\nThe Justices considered Apple’s allegations that Samsung copied Apple patents related to iPhone designs in order to create its own smartphones. Previous jury rulings have sided with Apple in the past, requiring Samsung to cough up fees to Apple, but the appeals process has kept things moving onward and upward up to the supreme court.\n11 of Samsung’s smartphones and three patents are named in the suit and, according to the Associated Press , the latest ruling means that “Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned” from those smartphones. The suit called for payment of $399 from Samsung to Apple.\nBack to the lower courts Apple originally asked the Supreme Court to look into the lawsuit back in July . At the time, Apple said Samsung hadn’t provided lower courts with any evidence that it shouldn’t cover the full fine levied against it. That figure was initially set at $930 million before it was decreased to $548 million last year. Samsung has argued it doesn’t owe $399 million of that total since it infringed on certain aspects of smartphone design but, as it argues, not the entire smartphone.\nFor now, Samsung and Apple look like they’ll remain in court for a while yet.\n\n\nSource : AP ",

The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nA Samsung Electronics laptop computer is displayed at a shop in Samsung's main office building in central Seoul July 23, 2013. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930. KS) said on Tuesday it will increase dividends and consider splitting itself, as the tech giant faces possibly the biggest structural change in its 47-year history. The world's top maker of smartphones, memory chips and televisions, however, said it was \"absolutely neutral\" about whether to proceed, and provided little detail on the potential restructuring, underwhelming investors and keeping shares flat. Media: WochIt Media Apple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.

      "text": "Enlarge this image A Samsung and Apple smartphone are displayed on Aug. 6, 2014. in London. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images hide caption \ntoggle caption Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images A Samsung and Apple smartphone are displayed on Aug. 6, 2014. in London.\nPeter Macdiarmid/Getty Images The Supreme Court has weighed in on a patent battle between Samsung and Apple, siding with Samsung by declaring that the patent infringement for an element of a design should be treated differently from the infringement of an entire design.\nTechnology Samsung Fight Among Many In Apple's Patent War The dispute between the two tech giants isn't about whether Samsung violated Apple's patents — but rather about how much money it's reasonable for Samsung to pay for the infringement.\nLaw What's In A Design? A Smartphone Battle In The Highest Court Samsung previously had been ordered to pay Apple $399 million in damages. The high court's unanimous decision sends the suit back to a lower court to reconsider what is a reasonable amount.\nHere's how NPR's Nina Totenberg and An-Li Herring explained the underlying issue a few months ago :\n\"The two smartphone giants have been battling each other — not just in the marketplace but also in the courts — since 2011, a year after Samsung unveiled a new set of smartphones, including the Galaxy. Like iPhones, the Samsung products, for the first time, had rounded corners and square icons on a touchscreen.\n\"Apple alleged, in part, that its South Korean rival had infringed three design patents for discrete components of the iPhone — the front face of the device, the rounded edges framing the face, and the device's distinctive matrix of colorful square icons.\n\"In 2012, a jury ruled in Apple's favor and Samsung was ordered to pay $399 million in damages — all the profits it had made on 11 infringing phone models.\n\"Samsung appealed, arguing that it should not have to fork over its total profits; rather, it should only be liable for the specific design elements it infringed.\n\"The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, rejected that argument, agreeing with Apple that Samsung had to cough up all of its profits on an infringed 'article of manufacture.'\n\" 'The game then becomes, what's the article of manufacture?' says Daryl Joseffer, who formerly served as principal deputy U.S. solicitor general. 'Is it the cover of the phone which is the design? Or is it the entire phone?'\nArticle continues after sponsorship The Supreme Court unanimously concluded that the \"article of manufacture\" doesn't have to be the entire phone.\nAs we reported in May, Samsung has said the laws that govern copyright infringement like this were outdated and due for re-examination. The South Korean tech giant noted that the logic behind the $399 million decision would apply even if an 18-wheel tractor trailer included design infringement in a single cupholder.\nAll Tech Considered From The Birth Of The iPhone To An Era Of Lawsuits Here's more from our coverage then:\n\"A smartphone contains thousands of parts, many of which are functional rather than ornamental, Samsung argues. \"The law of the smartphone cannot follow reflexively from the law of the spoon,\" it says in court documents . ...\n\" In its opposing brief , Apple counters by arguing that the law 'could not be clearer': It explicitly holds an infringer liable for the 'total profit,' and not just a portion of it.\"\nIn the end, the highest court in the land released a very brief decision that turned largely on definitions.\nThe Supreme Court, citing multiple dictionaries, concluded there was no reason why an \"article of manufacture\" couldn't be a component, as easily as an entire product.\nAll Tech Considered What Will Apple's Patent Case Mean For Phone Design?",

      "text": "\nSamsung and Apple are still fighting it out in the U.S., and the country's top court has just ruled in the Galaxy maker's favor.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Samsung's favor in its ongoing design patent war with Apple, throwing out an earlier ruling that Samsung would have to pay the iPhone maker $399 million for infringing on its design patents, and giving Samsung a chance to win back some of the damages awarded to its rival. The justices voted 8-0 that Samsung's patent infringement could only affect a component of an infringed product — i.e. the iPhone's distinctive appearance — and not the sum total of its parts.\nThe ruling gives Samsung another chance to win back $399 of the $548 million awarded to Apple. That figure has already been whittled down on appeal from the $930 million originally awarded in 2012. Samsung argued that the infringing parts in certain Galaxy phones played a small role in its products' success, and thus it shouldn't have to hand over all of its profits from these devices.\nAs Reuters reports, the argument centered on the definition of \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. law, and whether it related to the entire product, or just specific components.\nApple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nThe case will now return to a lower court to calculate the (new) portion of profits that Samsung must pay Apple.\n",

      "text": "Home » News » World News » Despite growth in wearables market, Apple loses steam: IDC Despite growth in wearables market, Apple loses steam: IDC 8 hours ago | 06-12-2016 | IANS San Francisco, Dec 6 : While the overall wearables market grew 3.1 per cent year-over-year in the third quarter of 2016, Apple Watch share took a downturn owing to an ageing lineup and an unintuitive user interface, market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) has said. [NK World] Apple's decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in the third quarter and the company stood fourth with 4.9 per cent share. According to IDC's 'Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker' report, total wearables shipments reached 23 million in the third quarter. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, Senior Research Analyst, IDC Mobile Device Trackers. Basic wearables, primarily comprised of fitness bands, accounted for 85 per cent of the market and experienced double-digit growth. Fitbit, with a 23 per cent share, was once again the market leader in the third quarter as the vendor released a long-awaited refresh for the \"Charge HR\" wireless activity wristband with \"Charge 2\". Xiaomi stood second with 16.5 per cent market share. \"The company across all business lines continues to struggle to gain any significant traction outside China,\" the report added. With a market share of 5.7 per cent, Garmin stood third as the company with one of the widest portfolios among all the vendors. \"The company managed to expand its channel presence over the past year, focusing on numerous sports equipment chains and independent retailers,\" the report noted. Samsung, with 4.5 per cent market share, stood fifth and the company was able to sustain shipments of its Gear S2, particularly the cellular-enabled versions, through various wireless service providers, the findings showed. IDC expects the momentum for basic wearables to continue for the remainder of 2016. However, smart wearables capable of running third-party apps will likely continue to struggle in the near term. anuj/na/dg",

      "text": "Apple Watch sales hit record 3:26pm GMT - 01:11 \nApple CEO Tim Cook says the holiday quarter is on track to be the best ever for the Apple Watch. As Fred Katayama reports, this comes just as iPhone sales are beginning to level off. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nGood time for Apple? Reuters has learned Apple Watch sales to consumers set a record in the first week of holiday shopping. Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the gadget. He said the watch could be in his words \"one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.\" He did not say how many were sold. Analysts say strong sales are to be expected during the holidays because the watch makes a more natural gift than, say, a Mac or an iPhone. And the holiday quarter is usually Apple's strongest. But just Monday, research firm IDC estimated that Apple Watch shipments had fallen 71 percent in the third quarter from a year ago. Apple needs new sources of growth. Sales of its key product, the iPhone, have begun to level off. TECHnalysis Research analyst Bob O'Donnell doubts the Apple Watch can make up for that, saying, \"While I'm not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category.\" Apple shares, which have underperformed the broader market with just a roughly 4 percent gain this year, rose at the start of trading.

      "text": "By Andrew Chung / Reuters Today at 9:50 a.m. Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S4, left, and Apple's iPhone 5 are seen in this picture illustration taken in Seoul, South Korea, May 13, 2013. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo \nWASHINGTON —The Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 7. Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated a $399 million infringement award against Samsung Electronics in a long-running design patent dispute with Apple. \nThe court, in an 8-0 decision , kicked back the patent award to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, saying the lower court calculated the patent award based on the whole iPhone, while the design patents may cover only pieces of the device. \nThe Federal Circuit's failure to consider a smaller damage award based on pieces of the iPhone \"cannot be squared\" with patent law, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court. The lower court, in its ruling, said it could not separate out the infringing pieces of the smartphones because they were not available for sale to the public, she noted. \nBut \"the term 'article of manufacture' [in patent law] is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not,\" Sotomayor wrote. \nThe damage award relates to three design patents covering the face and rounded bezel design of the iPhone and the grid of sixteen icons on the phone's home screen. \nSamsung, with support from Google, Facebook, and other tech companies, had asked the Supreme Court to take a new look at design patents, even though the rules have remained largely unchanged for more than a century. \nRepresentatives of Apple and Samsung were not immediately available for comment. \nThe two companies' patent disputes will continue. Separately, the same appeals court reinstated a $119.6 million award for Apple back in October. The appeals court ruled that two Apple smartphone design patents, one related to a slide-to-unlock feature , are valid and Samsung infringed a third patent related to helping smartphone users find phone numbers.

      "text": "App developers not ready for stricter iOS security requirements Many iOS apps opt out of Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) feature or deliberately weaken it Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 6, 2016 8:30 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe fingerprint reader in the Apple iPhone 5S is integrated into the home button. Credit: Martyn Williams IT security: 3 things you need to know now \nA month before Apple is expected to enforce stricter security requirements for app communications in iOS, enterprise developers don't seem ready to embrace them, a new study shows. \nThe study was performed by security firm Appthority on the most common 200 apps installed on iOS devices in enterprises. The researchers looked at how well these apps conform to Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) requirements. \nATS was first introduced and was enabled by default in iOS 9. It forces all apps to communicate with Internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections and ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers without known weaknesses are used. For example, SSL version 3 is not allowed and neither is the RC4 stream cipher, due to known vulnerabilities. \nBefore ATS, app developers implemented HTTPS using third-party frameworks, but configuring SSL/TLS properly is hard, so implementation errors were common. These weakened the protection that the protocol is supposed to provide against traffic snooping and other man-in-the-middle attacks. \nCurrently iOS provides a method for apps to opt out of ATS entirely or to use it only for specific connections, but Apple wants to change that. At its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June, the company announced that it will require all apps published on the App Store to turn on ATS by the end of this year. \nThe requirement won't be enforced at the OS level, but through the App Store review process. Using some of the ATS exceptions will still be possible, but developers will have to provide a \"reasonable justification\" for using them if they want their apps to be approved. \nDuring their study, the Appthority researchers found that 97 percent of the analyzed apps -- 193 out of 200 -- used exceptions and other settings that weakened the default ATS configuration. \n\"Among the top 200 iOS apps that we analyzed, 166 apps (83 percent) bypass at least some ATS requirements by setting 'NSAllowsArbitraryLoads' attribute to 'true' in their Info.plist files,\" the Appthority researchers said in their report. \"However, not all of them bypass ATS requirements for all network connections. For instance, a company can still support ATS requirements for network connections with its domain, while allowing ATS to bypass all other connections.\" \nAmong the apps that didn't use HTTPS for all of their connections were popular ones like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Fox News, CNN, BBC, Netflix, ESPN, Hulu, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote, but also utility apps like Flashlight, QR code readers and games. \nWhile it could be argued that some connections don't need HTTPS because they aren't used to transfer sensitive data, the Appthority researchers found 10 applications that did send device IDs, email addresses, physical addresses, ZIP codes, geolocation information and even passwords or secret keys over unencrypted HTTP links. \nThere are many reasons why developers can't turn on ATS for all connections and are likely to request ATS exceptions during the app review process. For example, many apps don't talk only to their developers' servers, but also to third-party advertising, market research, analytics and image or video hosting services. The use of HTTPS on these external services are out of app developers' control. \nATS provides fine-grained exceptions like \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia,\" which can, for example, be used to allow the streaming of video or audio content over HTTP, while encrypting all other connections. \nHowever, based on Appthority's analysis, it seems that so far developers have preferred using the more generic “NSAllowsArbitraryLoads” which disables ATS for all connections, when dealing with such problems. \nThe company didn't find any app that used the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInMedia\" or the \"NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent\" attributes to limit the scope of ATS exceptions. It hopes that Apple's new requirements will change that. \nMany apps that do use ATS disable some of its security features. For example, none of the apps analyzed by Appthority used Certificate Transparency, which is available in ATS. \nFurthermore, seven of them disabled SSL certificate validation and 46 didn't use certificate pinning. Thirty-eight apps disabled Forward Secrecy and eight apps set the allowed TLS protocol version to 1.0 or 1.1, even though the secure default in ATS is TLS 1.2. \n\"We still expect iOS apps with unencrypted data in enterprise environments, even after January 1,\" the Appthority researchers said. \"When Apple approves such apps for the App Store, there will still be the security risks associated with unencrypted data for some connections, so it’s important for enterprises to have visibility into and management of the risks related to apps with those exceptions.\" To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page , LinkedIn page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "| Follow About | \nAppleholic, (noun), æp·əl-hɑl·ɪk: An imaginative person who thinks about what Apple is doing, why and where it is going. Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Faith in fake Apple Watch news industry falls 71% On estimates, context, and reality distortion Computerworld | Dec 6, 2016 5:10 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry \n“Apple Watch sales fall by 71 percent”, the headlines claim , but these reports perfectly illustrate a preference for clickbait over substance as the narrative grabs yet another chance to transgress journalistic probity in the service of anti-Apple snark. “Off the charts” \nIDC has published new data on what it calls the “wearables” market. This claims Apple Watch sales fell around 71 percent in the third 2016 quarter. \n“The primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface,” said an analyst, before stating, “Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged,” IDC said . \nThese estimated figures are based on the analyst’s own research, but I don’t think they include any definitive Apple Store retail or online sales data, nor do I think they include sales through those non-tech department stores in which Apple Watch is often sold . \nThis means IDC’s data is quite speculative, particularly as Apple doesn’t share its own sales data. \nIDC does not count iPads as computers in its PC market share figures because it doesn’t think they can be compared, but it is interesting that it does see low-end fitness trackers as devices that can be compared to smart wearables. Reality distortion \nWhat really matters when you sift through the headlines reporting IDC’s estimates is the way the information is presented as relating to the here and now, with the actual context relegated to an aside. \nThe quarter in question was a bridging period between Apple’s WWDC announcement of the Apple Watch Series 2 and the device shipping in September. \nSales declines at that time were a lull before the storm. \nPeople stopped buying Apple Watch because they wanted to buy the new version and had to wait to do so. \nThe headline should be “Apple Watch sales slow while customers wait for a new version,” not “Apple Watch sales fall 71 percent”. \nThe first is what happened, the second is also what happened but divorces the events from the time in which they took place, and what they represent. \nUnfortunately, this kind of credible reporting doesn’t fit the narrative of our current patch of anti-Apple reality distortion. This could even be why a much more positive recent wearable industry analysis from Canalys has not been more widely reported. \n“Canalys research shows that shipments compared favorably to those in Q3 2015, the first full quarter after the original Apple Watch’s launch in April 2015,” the analysts said in November. What really happened? \nIn a rare response to IDC’s “expert” analysis, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, spoke to Reuters . \nApple probably felt the need to respond because the manner in which IDC’s data is being presented reflects badly on Apple Watch 2 – readers see the headline, but miss the context. \nTim Cook : \"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" he said. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” he explained . \nCook declined to share any fresh sales data. Failure everywhere \nThe big picture is very different from the sketch we see from IDC. At the high end of the smart wearable market, Apple now reigns supreme. Lenovo-owned Moto, Huawei, LG and (possibly) even Samsung are abandoning (or at the least, slow to develop their presence in) Android Wear. \nIt is true that some leading conventional watchmakers are fighting for survival by putting Android inside their devices, but the truth is that Apple now dominates the high end of this industry in a similar way in which its iPod once dominated the MP3 player market. \nThis is even before launch of a Series 3 model next year, a model that in conjunction with AirPods and (potentially) glasses will replace most of what you use your smartphone for . \nWhile there are many who say Apple remains overly exposed to iPhone income, it is worth thinking about this recent note from Neil Cybart at Above Avalon, which may help illustrate the growing importance of Apple Watch. Total Apple revenue in 2001: $5.4BApple Watch revenue in 2016: $4.2B — Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) December 2, 2016 \nIn a separate note, Cybart adds, “Cook's comment implies Apple Watch sales will be close to 5M units this quarter. It's time for the doubters to admit Apple Watch is a thing.” \nIndeed. \nGoogle+?

WWDC 2015: The top 3 biggest reveals \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated a $399 million infringement award against Samsung Electronics in a long-running design patent dispute with Apple. \nThe court, in an 8-0 decision , kicked back the patent award to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, saying the lower court calculated the patent award based on the whole iPhone, while the design patents may cover only pieces of the device. [ iPad Pro vs. Surface Pro vs. Pixel C vs. Galaxy TabPro S : The \"tabtop\" tablet/laptop hybrids compared. | Get deep into Windows: Subscribe to the InfoWorld Windows Report newsletter . ] \nThe Federal Circuit’s failure to consider a smaller damage award based on pieces of the iPhone “cannot be squared” with patent law, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court. The lower court, in its ruling, said it could not separate out the infringing pieces of the smartphones because they were not available for sale to the public, she noted. \nBut “the term ‘article of manufacture’ [in patent law] is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not,” Sotomayor wrote. \nThe damage award relates to three design patents covering the face and rounded bezel design of the iPhone and the grid of sixteen icons on the phone’s home screen. \nSamsung, with support from Google, Facebook, and other tech companies, had asked the Supreme Court to take a new look at design patents, even though the rules have remained largely unchanged for more than a century. \nRepresentatives of Apple and Samsung were not immediately available for comment. \nThe two companies’ patent disputes will continue. Separately, the same appeals court reinstated a $119.6 million award for Apple back in October. The appeals court ruled that two Apple smartphone design patents, one related to a slide-to-unlock feature , are valid and Samsung infringed a third patent related to helping smartphone users find phone numbers.

      "text": "Tweet \nHere's the deal. Apple doesn't want to publish smartwatch sales data in its quarterly financial reports. So, to tell us where Apple Watch stands in relation to the competition in the wearables market, analysts come up with estimates, which may or may not be close to the truth. IDC did the same thing this week, claiming that Apple Watch sales nosedived in Q3 2016. \nApple typically does not comment on such claims, as it prefers to keep quiet and not add any fuel to the fire. It's a strategy that works, because, first of all, the Apple Watch was never in any real kind of trouble to begin with. So far, it's been considered the market leader in its segment. But now that IDC announces a major decline, Tim Cook decides it is time to tell us that Apple Watch is actually \"doing great\". \nIDC provided some numbers to back up its claims, estimating shipments for the past quarter at just 1.1 million units. A year prior, Apple moved 3.9 million smartwatches. That would equate to a 71 percent fall, assuming the numbers are accurate. But here's the thing: we really don't know if they are. And if they are Apple is not denying it. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year\", says Cook to Reuters. \"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch\". \nNotice how there is no mention of the past quarter, only this one. IDC and other analyst companies are usually close in their estimates when there is no official figure provided, so there is no reason to suspect that IDC is off -- in a meaningful way, at least -- this time around with its estimate. And, certainly, Cook's response does little to disprove IDC's claims, as it offers no sales figure -- or growth figure -- for us to compare, not for the past quarter and certainly not for this one. \nThe reason why I bring Cook's comments into a discussion started by last quarter's Apple Watch sales is because some writers see it for what it is not: a response to IDC's claims. Instead, Cook wants to shift focus to this current quarter, which is typically when Apple products perform the best. And this quarter is when it can do that, without being questioned. \nIf you look at historic earnings data , Apple shines in its fiscal Q1, which is the last quarter of the year for everyone else, so, naturally, a product will perform great then. And, remember, the Apple Watch Series 2 was released in mid-September. Also keep in mind that, as is usually the case with Apple devices, a new product will enjoy a great deal of success when it's fresh on the market. \nBasically it boils down to this: Apple Watch sales were probably terrible last quarter, but they're \"great\" now.",

Up Next Memes that need to die along with 2016 \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday handed Samsung a victory in its long-running patent dispute with Apple. \nWhat's at stake was how much money one company had to pay for copying the designs of another. The nation's highest court said in a unanimous opinion that damages for design patent infringement can be based only on the part of the device that infringed the patents, not the entire product. \nCurrent law said an award could be collected on the entire profits of an infringing device. In this case, that's the $399 million Samsung paid Apple late last year. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion for the court that the only question resolved today \"is whether, in the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant 'article of manufacture' must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.\" \nThe court concluded that the relevant article of manufacture \"need not be the end product sold to the consumer but may be only a component of that product.\" For more on Apple v.

      "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings.\nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nSamsung had been seeking to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance.\nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by $382 million.\nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid Apple $548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nApple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct. 11.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years (additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington)",

      "title": "Fake news? Tim Cook pushes back on Apple Watch sales estimate.",
      "text": "Despite a damning analysis by the International Data Corporation (IDC), Tim Cook says the Apple Watch is “doing great.”\nOn Monday, an IDC report claimed Apple Watch sales were down 71 percent in the third quarter, while fitness trackers lead the wearables market. Apple’s chief executive conveyed a different narrative to Reuters, however, writing that the company’s smartwatch sales growth was actually “ off the charts ,” but declining to share actual sales figures.\n“In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history,” Cook wrote. “And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.”\nRecommended: Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! In the original report, IDC analysts identified an “aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface” as the cause of Apple’s apparent sales decline.\nTest your knowledge Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! “As user tastes change, so will their needs,” Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team, said in a statement. “That's the opportunity for smart wearables with multi-functionality and third-party applications, both for consumers and business users. To get there, we need to see more intuitive user interfaces, seamless user experiences, standalone connectivity, and applications that go beyond health and fitness and into personal and professional productivity.”\nBut that analysis may hinge upon uncertain data. Apple doesn’t share its sales data , notes ComputerWorld tech columnist Jonny Evans, so IDC’s estimates may or may not be entirely accurate. It’s also unclear whether the research firm included sales estimates from non-tech department stores, where the Apple Watch is commonly sold.\nEven if IDC’s sales estimates are correct, the overall narrative may not be. The report combines high-end smartwatches and low-end fitness trackers in the same “wearables” sales category, which may skew overall market trends. Meanwhile, the third quarter was also a “bridging period” between the announcement of the Apple Watch Series 2 and the device’s actual release in September – in other words, consumers may have stopped buying the previous Apple Watch while waiting for the new model.\nIn a post for ComputerWorld, Mr. Evans wrote :\nThe headline should be “Apple Watch sales slow while customers wait for a new version,” not “Apple Watch sales fall 71 percent.”\nThe first is what happened, the second is also what happened but divorces the events from the time in which they took place, and what they represent.\nIn this way, reports of plummeting sales represent a trickier type of fake news story . The IDC report and Cook’s statement are competing realities, both presented as fact even though neither can be easily debunked. And until some actual figures are released, it will likely stay that way.",

      "text": "Netflix is proving a free app can make big money on Apple’s App Store.\nThe video-streaming app, which is free for users to download but requires a subscription to its service, is now the top-grossing iPhone app in Apple’s App Store. The achievement comes about a year after Netflix announced that it would offer in-app purchases in the program, allowing users to sign up for the service or add the ability for multiple users to watch its content on the same account all from within its software. Sensor Tower, a company that offers mobile app services and analytics, says the app is also the top-grossing iPhone app in India, Mexico, and Colombia.\nApple AAPL tracks the most popular free and paid programs in its App Store based on their total number of downloads on any given day. The company’s top-grossing chart provides insight into the apps that are generating the most revenue through the marketplace. That revenue is generated through the sale of paid apps or via in-app purchases. In Netflix’s case, the company’s app is available as a free download, but comes with in-app purchases ranging from $8 a month to $12 per month, depending on the number of “screens,” or simultaneous viewers, a user might want.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nNetflix’s success is also Apple’s success: Apple takes a portion of the revenue generated from paid apps and in-app purchases. Apple typically takes 30% of revenue generated from the sale of an app or in-app content, but for subscription-based apps of an auto-renewing subscription, the company takes 70% the first year and 85% in subsequent years. It’s unknown what the revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Netflix is.\nNeither Netflix NFLX nor Apple shares how much an individual app generates in revenue through the marketplace, but Sensor Tower’s data suggests it might be significant.\nSensor Tower, which derives its data from anonymous information it collects across millions of smartphones, estimates that Netflix is generating nearly $2.9 million a week in net revenue from its iPhone app. The analytics firm estimates that Netflix’s weekly iPhone app revenue hovered at less than $50,000 in fall 2015, when the in-app purchases were rolling out to users.\nFor more about Apple’Watch, watch: \nLooking ahead, Netflix might have some work cut out for it to stay atop the top-grossing heap. The chart is always changing and apps are constantly moving up and down the list. Just last month, for instance, Netflix was in the seventh spot for highest-grossing iPhone apps. On Nov. 14, it was in the second spot.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously backed Samsung in a patent dispute filed by Apple over the design of the two companies' flagship smartphones. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Share \nThe Supreme Court has unanimously backed Samsung in a patent dispute filed by Apple over the design of the two companies' flagship smartphones. \nHere's more from the Associated Press: \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nWall Street Journal legal affairs reporter Brett Kendall joins Take Two to discuss.

(AFP/DON EMMERT) A \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday (Dec 6) tossed out a US$399 million patent award from Samsung over copying Apple's iPhone design, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, in a case closely watched by the tech industry. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the US$399 million penalty - one element of a major patent infringement case - was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture ... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details of the case. - AFP/de",

      "text": "In its new Apple v. Samsung ruling, the Supreme Court has changed how patent damages are calculated The amount Samsung has to pay, though, is back in a lower court’s lap. share Ina Fried The Supreme Court handed a huge victory to Samsung on Tuesday, tossing out nearly $400 million in damages it was ordered to pay to Apple in their long-running patent infringement case. The ruling, while sending Apple’s specific case back to a lower court, changes the landscape for how design patent verdicts can be calculated. A federal jury had earlier ordered Samsung to pay Apple $399 million for infringing on design patents used in Apple’s iPhone, one part of a larger patent verdict for Apple. That amount was based on Samsung’s entire profits for the Samsung phones that were found to infringe. However, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that damages need not be calculated based on the profits for an entire device. The case had been closely watched as it was the first time in more than a century that the Supreme Court had looked at design patents , with plenty of big companies weighing in. Samsung had backing from tech giants Google, Dell, HP and Lenovo, while Apple’s position was backed by a host of companies including Tiffany & Co., Adidas and plastic shoemaker Crocs. In a unanimous opinion, the court ruled Tuesday that juries need not award damages based on the profits for an entire product if the item consists of many parts. “In the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant ‘article of manufacture’ ... need not be the end product sold to the consumer but may be only a component of that product,” justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the court’s unanimous opinion. However, the Supreme Court didn’t actually decide how damages should be calculated in this case. Instead, it decided a lower court could sort that out and sent the case back to the trial court for yet more hearings. “Unfortunately, the court did not give lower courts any guidance as to how to determine whether the \"article of manufacture\" in any given case is the product sold to consumers or a component,” said University of Notre Dame law professor Mark McKenna. “Presumably it has something to do with the nature of the design patent claim, but the court did not make that clear.\" So, even after a trip to the Supreme Court, the case of Apple v. Samsung continues. Apple, though, really lost this battle when it failed to get an injunction halting sales of Samsung phones. Since then, it’s basically been about how much money Samsung does or doesn’t have to pay — and the amounts here are essentially chump change for both.",

      "text": "Holiday Buyer's Guide Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple The nation's highest court said damages for design patent infringement should be based on part of an infringing device, not the entire product. Up Next Memes that need to die along with 2016 \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday handed Samsung a victory in its long-running patent dispute with Apple. \nThe nation's highest court said in a unanimous opinion that damages for design patent infringement can be based only on the part of the device that infringed the patents, not the entire product. \nThe ruling reshapes the value of designs, and how much one company has to pay for copying the look of a competitor's product. Current law said an award could be collected on the entire profits of an infringing device. In this case, that's the $399 million Samsung paid Apple late last year. But this decision means that amount will likely go down. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion for the court that the only question resolved today \"is whether, in the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant 'article of manufacture' must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.\" \nThe court concluded that the relevant article of manufacture \"need not be the end product sold to the consumer but may be only a component of that product.\" \nThe Supreme Court didn't, however, say how damages should be determined.

      "text": "\nSupreme Court opens the door for Samsung to further reduce the damages against it.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that a statute applied to manufactured products was applied too narrowly in the company's patent fight with Apple, leaving the door open to Samsung having the judgment against it reduced. While the company was originally ordered to pay $399 million to Apple, the court held that the damages could potentially be reduced because only certain components of the relevant devices might be infringing on Apple's patents, rather than the whole of each device.\nFrom the ruling :\nIn the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant \"article of manufacture\" for arriving at a §289 damages award need not be the end product sold to the consumer but may be only a component of that product.\n\"Article of manufacture\" is defined as something made by hand or machine, and can refer both to a product sold, as well as a component of that product. The Supreme Court did not make a decision on what constituted an \"article of manufacture\" in this case, but they did rule that the lower Federal Court had applied the statute too narrowly in its ruling.\nThe case now heads back to the Federal Circuit court for reconsideration.\nThis is just the latest in a long series of judicial showdowns between Apple and Samsung, which began in 2011 when Apple filed a patent infringement suit against its Korean rival. Apple won the original suit, being awarded over $1 billion in damages. Over time, that award has been reduced by various courts as Samsung has fought its way through the U.S. legal system.\n",

      "text": "International Business Samsung wins over Apple in US$399m patent appeal The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a US$399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. Posted 07 Dec 2016 00:41 Updated 07 Dec 2016 01:25 Samsung is the world's largest producer of smartphones. (AFP/DON EMMERT) A \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday (Dec 6) overturned a US$399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the US$399 million penalty - one element of a major patent infringement case - was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture ... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the US$548 million penalty - knocked down from an original US$1 billion jury award - Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nNO CLARITY \nObservers had been watching to see how the court - which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century - would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design.\" \nEric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. \n\"By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties' ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,\" Goldman told AFP. - AFP/de",

      "text": "Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks \nIf there's one thing that Apple values more than most other tech companies, it's product secrecy. Whereas other big name tech companies like Google and Microsoft enjoy showing users what type of crazy new technologies they've been working on, Apple in contrast prefers to keep everything under wraps until it has a shipping product to show off. \nThat said, a recent letter that Apple sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finally gives us some concrete proof that the company has a strong and ongoing interest in self-driving car technology. Sure, it was no secret that Apple was working on a car initiative of some sort given its hiring spree of engineers with deep experience across the entirety of the car design and manufacturing process. Still, it was never entirely clear if Apple was initially looking into building a car of its own or, perhaps, focusing on ancillary software technologies instead. \nUntil now. \nThe aforementioned letter to the NHTSA was sent out on November 22, 2016 but only came to light over the weekend. The letter, penned by former Ford engineer Steven Kenner, relays that Apple is \"investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nThe full letter reads: \nApple is pleased to provide the following comments on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (Policy), published by the Department of Transportation and the National Highway TraSafety Administration (NHTSA). Apple believes this Policy will be fundamental to ensuring the safety and public acceptance of automated vehicles while providing a ﬂexible path for innovation. \nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation. \nExecuted properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience—to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without. It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation. \nApple affirms that, in order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHTSA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continue to explore new tools and authorities like those outlined in Section IV of the Policy—including expanded exemption authority—with the goal of fostering innovation, improving regulatory ﬂexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology \nNotably, rumors of Apple researching the development of its own branded car have been swirling about for many months. Just two months ago, however, the New York Times published a story relaying that Apple was \"rethinking what it plans to do about self-driving cars.\" \nThat report reads in part: \nIn a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly. \nThe job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple’s car initiative. The company has added resources to the project — code-named Titan — over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort. \nAs it stands now, it's widely believed that Apple has put its ambitions of designing and manufacturing an electric car on hold as it refocuses its efforts on developing self-driving car technology.

A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nA unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Related content",

That reading is too narrow, the Supreme Court concluded. \nApple had obtained the damages for infringement of three design patents for the iPhone: its black rectangular front face with rounded corners, the surrounding rim, and the use of 16 colorful icons on a black screen. \nThe applicable statute requires identification of the “article of manufacture” using the infringing design, and then the calculation of total profit made on that item of manufacture. \nThe term “article of manufacture” can encompass both a product sold to a consumer, and a component of the product, the Supreme Court concluded. “That a component may be integrated into a larger product, in other words, does not put it outside the category of articles of manufacture,” Sotomayor wrote. \nCiting inadequate briefing on the issue, the Supreme Court declined to decide whether the relevant articles of manufacture in the Apple case were the design components or the smartphone. \nRelated article : \nABAJournal.com : “Supreme Court will consider damages issue in Apple and Samsung smartphone patent fight” Previous:",

      "text": "Linked By John Voorhees \nThe iPhone 7 Plus features a dual camera system that enables a special Portrait mode in the Camera app. Apple has collected tips for using Portrait mode from professional photographers, like this tip from photographer Pei Ketron: \n”Portrait mode on the new iPhone 7 Plus creates beautifully realistic background bokeh that rivals DSLRs.” When taking photos of pets and animals she advises, \"give your pup some space. Portrait mode uses the telephoto lens, so a distance of about eight feet away is recommended. Have treats ready. You'll get the best results when your subject isn't moving.” \nUnder the right conditions, Portrait mode can take some wonderful photographs as these demonstrate. The rest of the photographs and tips posted by Apple are available in the Apple Newsroom .",

      "text": "Secdo, a cybersecurity startup with offices in New York and Israel, has raised $10 million in venture capital funding from some high profile investors.\nLeading the Series A round were RDC, an arm of Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elron Electronic Industries elrnf ; Marius Nacht, cofounder and chairman of Check Point Software Technologies chkp , Israel’s most well-known cybersecurity firm; and the founders of Anobit, a semiconductor chip designer that Apple aapl acquired for as much as $400 million to $500 million in 2011.\nShai Morag, Secdo cofounder and CEO, and several of the company’s backers share a common history. Morag, Check Point’s Nacht and Anobit’s Ofir Shalvi are veterans of Talpiot, a prestigious and highly exclusive leadership program within the Israel Defense Forces.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nGil Barak, chief technology officer and cofounder of Secdo, said that the idea for the two-year-old company grew partly out of his experience in the Israeli military’s Unit 8200, often described as Israel’s equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency.\n“We tried to create a platform that mimics what a high tier security forensics investigator in an enterprise would do, like Mandiant-type investigations,” Barak told Fortune on a call, referring to Mandiant, the well-known incident response arm of the cybersecurity firm FireEye feye , which FireEye picked up for about $1 billion a couple of years ago .\n“With Secdo the process is entirely automated,” he said.\nFor more on cybersecurity, watch: \nSecdo aims to sift through the deluge of security alerts that flood corporate security operations centers and automatically take defensive action based on that information. The tool is designed to record the activity within an organization’s IT systems, trace breaches back to their source, and fix the problems.\n“Security teams are overwhelmed with alerts and are unable to respond effectively due to limited resources and the complexity of forensic collection and analysis,” Secdo CEO Morag said in a statement.\nOn a call with Fortune , Anobit’s Shalvi compared the technology to the systems that protect casinos, which have to deal with all kinds of threats to their business.\n“Just collecting an entire video feed from cameras is not effective,” Shalvi said. “It’s not just about recording everything, but about building a story in smart way.”\nSecdo said it would use the funding to expand its sales in the U.S., its customer support, and its research and development.",

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple   12:08 PM Dec 6, 2016 at 3:47 PM Sam Hananel,   \nWASHINGTON (AP) \" A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. About Us",

The court ruled on Tuesday that Samsung may not have to give up $399 million for copying parts of the distinctive look of Apple’s iPhone. Credit Kevin Wolf/Associated Press WASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Samsung may not have to give up $399 million in profits for copying parts of the distinctive look of Apple ’s iPhone. A federal law says that companies found liable for infringing design patents on an “article of manufacture” are liable for their total profits. The decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. , No. 15-777, turned on the meaning of the quoted phrase. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said an article of manufacture may sometimes be the entire product sold to consumers — here, Samsung’s phones — and sometimes be the components found to have infringed a design patent. Apple’s patents covered specific design elements of the iPhone, including its black rectangular front face with rounded corners and its colorful grid of 16 icons. A jury found that Samsung had infringed those patents. “All told,” Justice Sotomayor wrote, “Apple was awarded $399 million in damages for Samsung’s design patent infringement, the entire profit Samsung made from its sales of the infringing smartphones.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Design patents, which address what products look like, are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court had not heard a design patent case in over a century. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court that handles patent appeals, ruled that the federal law “explicitly authorizes the award of total profit from the article of manufacture bearing the patented design.” The court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that “an award of a defendant’s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.” But it added that “those are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.” “We are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,” the court said. Justice Sotomayor’s opinion did not resolve the question of whether the article of manufacture at issue in the case was the whole phone or just parts of it. She said only that the Federal Circuit had been wrong to rule that “the relevant ‘article of manufacture’ must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product.” “In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. “In the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.” The Supreme Court returned the case to the Federal Circuit for further consideration. Justice Sotomayor’s analysis leaned heavily on dictionaries. “An ‘article’ is just ‘a particular thing,’” she wrote, citing two dictionaries. “And ‘manufacture’ means ‘the conversion of raw materials by the hand, or by machinery, into articles suitable for the use of man’ and ‘the articles so made.’ “An article of manufacture, then, is simply a thing made by hand or machine,” she concluded. “So understood, the term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.” Patent lawyers had hoped for a broader ruling about the scope of design patents in the digital age. Companies that sold products with distinctive designs filed a brief supporting Apple and urging the justices to protect their investments. Technology companies filed briefs supporting Samsung, arguing that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties. \nFollow Adam Liptak on Twitter @adamliptak .

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Updated 1 hr ago \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is siding with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices on Tuesday threw out a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design. The court said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices.

      "text": "Technology • 22 minutes ago • Views: 36 \nThe Supreme Court has overturned Apple’s $400 million award in its long-running patent lawsuit against Samsung. Apple won the case in 2012, convincing a federal court that a number of Samsung devices had infringed upon iPhone design patents — including one for a rectangular device with rounded corners and bezels, and another for a home screen comprised of a grid of colorful apps. The Supreme Court’s decision today does not reverse Apple’s win, but does mean that the case will be returned to the Federal Circuit so that the damages can be reassessed. \nThe Supreme Court’s judgement is complicated, but hinges on the method by which damages are calculated for cases involving the infringement of design patents. The $400 million won by Apple was based on a percentage of the entire profit Samsung made from its infringing smartphones. But, the South Korean company argued that this figure shouldn’t be based on the entire profit, but only part of the profit, as only part of the phone’s design was copied from Apple. The Supreme Court agreed that damages could be calculated this way — but it declined to say whether they should be in this particular case.",

The new Apple Watch models are diplayed inside an Apple Inc. store in Los Angeles \nBy Julia Love \nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc (O: AAPL ) Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook did not respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \nStrong sales of the Apple Watch are to be expected during the holiday quarter as the gadget is a more natural gift than some of the company's other products such as the iPhone or Mac computer, said analyst Bob O'Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. Apple also lowered the price of the gadget this year, potentially helping the holiday sales comparison, O'Donnell noted. \nApple is facing mounting pressure to show new sources of growth as sales of the iPhone, the company's lifeblood, begin to level off. O'Donnell said he remains skeptical the Apple Watch can fill the void, citing uncertain demand among consumers for smartwatches. \n\"While I’m not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category,\" he said. \nIDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

      "title": "Supreme Court Sides With Samsung in $399M Patent Fight With Apple",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Supreme Court Sides With Samsung in $399 Million Patent Fight With Apple \nThe “ design case of the century ” ended with a whimper on Tuesday as a unanimous Supreme Court overturned a lower court’s $399 million ruling involving three patents for Apple’s iPhone. \nWhile the decision was a clean win for Samsung, it was also a limited one as the top court avoided any sweeping statements, and sent the case back to the lower court to clear up just how much Apple’s AAPL design patents—which cover the shape and look of the iPhone—should be worth. \nIn a brief 11-page opinion , Justice Sonia Sotomayor ruled that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals was wrong to award damages to Apple based on the total profits Samsung made from devices like the Galaxy X, which a jury had found wrongfully copied elements of the iPhone. \nThe case turned on a law that awards total profits based on an “article of manufacturer,” and whether that phrase must be interpreted to mean the entire product—in this case a smartphone—or just a part of it. \nThe unanimous court had no difficulty finding the lower court was wrong to say the phrase had to mean the entire product. Here’s the key paragraph from the decision: \nthe term “article of manufacture” is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not. Thus, reading “article of manufacture” in §289 to cover only an end product sold to a consumer gives too narrow a meaning to the phrase. \nJustice Sotomayor added that the process for finding the value of design patent damages involved a two-step process: First, a court had to identify the “article of manufacture,” and then secondly, “calculate the infringer’s total profit made on that article of manufacture.” Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nThe Supreme Court, however, declined to explain how to go about identifying the “article” in question. Even though this question occupied most of the Justices’ time at a hearing which took place in September, Tuesday’s ruling kicked the issue back to the lower court to decide on the grounds Apple and Samsung had not properly briefed the issue for the Supreme Court. \nWhat this means is that the lower court will re-evaluate and also certainly find a way to reduce the current $399 million award to Apple. \nIn the bigger picture, the long-running intellectual property feud between Apple and Samsung will trundle on, but will host just a vestige of its former significance. The feud began in earnest when Apple’s late CEO Steve Jobs declared he would wage “thermonuclear war” against Samsung and Google’s Android GOOG operating system, which he believed to be a blatant rip-off of the iconic iPhone. \nWhile the fight continues to echo in a variety on ongoing court cases, including the design patent one, the legal aggression between Apple and Samsung has largely subsided. \nApple and Samsung did not immediately return a request for comment.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray After a week or so of negative data points about Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone , with analysts cutting estimates, Credit Suisse ’s Kulbinder Garcha today swoops in with some good news, which is that demand for the iPhone seems just fine, and the company’s heading for record shipments.\n“Supply chain checks from our Asia team are supportive of iPhone strength, particularly around the mix,” writes Garcha, who has an Outperform rating on the shares, and a $150 price target.\n“December quarter builds are expected to be 87mn, the highest quarterly build number we’ve seen historically,” he adds.\n“Additionally, the mix of the iPhone 7 Plus continues to be strong, with the 7 Plus expected to make up ~45% of the iPhone 7/7 Plus mix, materially higher than the ~35% we currently estimate.”\nGarcha, however, is really “ looking forward to the iPhone 8 super cycle ,” he writes, referring to what is presumably the next model, coming sometime in 2017.\nIn fact, he’s so positive on iPhone, he offers up an infographic showing growth through 2018’s presumed “ iPhone 9 ” and 9-Plus and something he’s calling an “iPhone 9 Pro”:\n\nGarcha notes there have been a number of concerns, such as Apple’s ability to get organic light-emitting diode technology in adequate quantity for an “all-glass” version of the iPhone. He writes that Apple will figure a way:\nThe main concern is whether the production capacity will be up to speed in time for the product launch. Given this concern, we believe that Apple will likely pursue one of three product scenarios next year: (1) 2 iPhones, both OLED; (2) 3 iPhones, 1 OLED version; or (3) 3 iPhones, all OLED. \nGarcha thinks Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ) will have enough capacity to make 71 million units of an OLED-based iPhone in 2017, and another 276 million units in 2018:\nSamsung could produce 559mn OLED smartphone displays by 2018 according to our Asian team. According to an analysis by our Asia team, given Samsung significant investment in capacity expansion, Samsung could potentially produce up to 559mn OLED smartphone displays in 2018 (assuming 90% yield). Samsung is currently allocating most of the current capacity to Other non-Apple vendors, which we estimate will make up ~283mn units in 2016. Assuming the rest of the incremental capacity goes to Apple going forward, Samsung should have capacity to produce ~276mn OLED displays for Apple by 2018. Our own meetings with Samsung also indicate that capacity could be sufficient at ~271mn OLED units by 2018. In our meetings with Samsung, the company noted that it plans to add 7 A3 lines by 2018. Assuming all of this incremental capacity goes to Apple, this implies ~271mn OLED displays for Apple by 2018. However, sole sourcing could be risky. While Apple has done it before, we would note that sole sourcing the display for an entire product line could be risky, especially as the display already accounts for ~10% of the total BOM.",

      "text": "Wed, Dec 7, 2016, 4:54 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 5 hrs 6 mins Samsung wins over Apple in $399 mn patent appeal By Rob Lever | AFP – 10 hours ago Recommend View Photo \nSamsung is the world's largest producer of smartphones \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \n- No clarity - \nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design.\" \nEric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. \n\"By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties' ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,\" Goldman told AFP.

      "text": "Wed, Dec 7, 2016, 4:55 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 5 hrs 5 mins Samsung triumphs over Apple in $399 mn patent appeal AFP – 11 hours ago View Photo \nSamsung is the world's largest producer of smartphones \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday tossed out a $399 million patent award from Samsung over copying Apple's iPhone design, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, in a case closely watched by the tech industry. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture ... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details of the case.

      "text": "Supreme Court sides with Samsung in Apple patent case by Seth Fiegerman @sfiegerman  33 PM ET iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S7: The underwater challenge The thermonuclear war isn't over yet. \nThe Supreme Court sided with Samsung ( SSNLF ) on Tuesday and unanimously reversed an earlier appeals court ruling that the company must pay $399 million to Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) for patent infringement. \nThe court was not asked to weigh in on whether Samsung actually violated various Apple design patents. Instead, the court ruled it's possible a design patent only covers part of a product rather than all of it. \nTranslation: Just because a company's product copies one or two features from a competitor doesn't necessarily mean it has to forfeit all of that product's profits to its competitor. \nThe case now goes back to a lower court where the two companies will once again take up the issue of how much Samsung should pay in damages for copying iPhone features. \n\"It's clearly a victory for Samsung,\" says Michael Risch, a patent law professor at Villanova University. \"How big a victory remains to be seen.\" \nRelated: Apple under Tim Cook: More socially responsible, less visionary \nThe Supreme Court ruling is the latest twist in a long corporate battle. It goes back to a pledge from Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs to wage \"thermonuclear war\" against those behind Android for what he saw as a blatant copy of the iPhone. \nIn 2012, a jury ruled that Samsung must pay Apple more than $1 billion for copying the various hardware and software features from the iPhone and iPad. A federal judge later reduced that penalty by $450 million. \nSamsung asked the Supreme Court late last year to review $399 million of those damages related to several design patents, including its phones' rounded corners and home screen display with 16 app icons. The patents impacted 11 Samsung phones. Samsung argued the damage was calculated based on an unfair and outdated standard. \n\"Even if the patented features contributed 1% of the value of Samsung's phones, Apple gets 100% of Samsung's profits,\" Samsung said in its original appeals filing. \nThe court ruling provides a much-needed win for Samsung at a time when it is facing a costly fallout from exploding batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone line. \nIt also marked a rare instance of the Supreme Court weighing on design patents, with potential repercussions for other businesses going forward. \n\"This is the first time the Supreme Court has been asked about it,\" says Risch. \"It will potentially reduce design patent damages.\" \nReps for Samsung and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  33 PM ET",

      "text": "Washington: The US Supreme Court told a lower court to take another look at a $399 million award won by Apple Inc. from rival Samsung Electronics Co. for copying the design of the iPhone.\nThe unanimous decision extends a legal battle that dates back to 2011 and at one point spanned the globe and engulfed every major maker of smartphones.\nWriting for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Apple might not be entitled to Samsung’s entire profit on 11 infringing smartphones. She told a federal appeals court to consider whether Apple should be able to recoup profits attributable only to particular components. The high court stopped short of deciding that question itself.\nSotomayor said the lower court’s approach “cannot be squared with the text” of the federal patent statute.\nDesign patents, which cover the ornamental look of an object rather than any functional aspect, are increasingly used by tech companies and makers of consumer products to differentiate their products from competitors. The Supreme Court hadn’t considered design patents since disputes involving spoon handles in the 1870s and carpets in the 1890s. \nThe legal issues in the case narrowed after the high court accepted it in March. Apple said it accepted that in some cases the patent holder can collect only the profit attributable to a particular component, and not the earnings from the entire product.\nApple argued, however, that Samsung failed to show that the patented designs applied only to part of its phones. Samsung contended that it was Apple’s burden to show that the infringement gave Samsung any increased profits.\nGoogle, Facebook Inc., eBay Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said in filings that a victory for Apple would allow owners of design patents to extract unfair rewards on products that can have hundreds or even thousands of features.\nA federal appeals court said Apple could collect Samsung’s entire profit.\nApple introduced the iPhone in 2007, revolutionising an industry that before then had received limited interest from consumers. Apple said that Samsung simply copied the look of the iPhone to avoid a loss of market share.",

      "text": "iPhone 8 Release Updates: These 7 Apple iPhone 8 killer features will certainly blow your mind By Staff Writer Dec 06, 2016 07:43 AM EST PARIS, FRANCE - DECEMBER 01: The Apple logo is displayed on the facade of the new Apple store Saint Germain during the press day on December 01, 2016 in Paris, France. On December 3, Apple will inaugurate and open its new Apple store to the public at the 'Marche Saint-Germain' (Saint Germain market). (Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Advertisement \nApple fans are anxiously waiting for iPhone 8 and if rumors to be believed, the device will be unlike anything ever released before. \nAccording to Thrillist insiders, there are a number of big news going around related to iPhone 8. \nWireless Charging \nApple is slowly going wireless. Apple's AirPods, company's first ever wireless headphone, is already stirring much demand from the consumers even before its release. \nApple is also busy perfecting wireless charging devices for iPhones and this technology could very well come together with iPhone 8. Sources also stated that with wireless charging one can charge their mobile as far as across the room. \nNo Home Button Advertisement \nTo increase the screen size, Apple is reportedly removing the Home button. In its place, it is expected that some kind of \"virtual\" home button will be featured. Apple is also developing its fingerprint scanner for the upcoming device for a smoother work experience. \nEye and Face Scanning Technology \nWith Fingerprint scanner a hit among users, speculations are being made that Apple may include a scanner in iPhone8 which will scan iris and/or face of a user to unlock and carry on various features in the device. \nCurved Screen \nSamsung has already beat Apple with Galaxy S7 Edge, where the screen is a little outwardly curved on either sides. However, many believe that Apple will adapt this feature in iPhone 8. \nGlass Body \nAnother major theory regarding the upcoming device is that it will showcase a full glass body, surrounded by metal frame. \nHigher Quality Images \nApple had always made sure in the past that the images displayed in the device are best quality. Thus, Apple may adapt an OLED display to ensure high quality images is what consumers will get always. \nThree Different Models \nSource claim that iPhone 8 will come in three different models. There will be \"premium\" model, which will sport a curved OLED screen. Other two models will feature 4.7in and 5.5in screen sizes, and LCD display. \nAs per The Wall Street Journal, Apple is currently testing and developing as many as 10 different prototypes, which if successful will feature in the upcoming iPhone 8. \nApple iPhone 8 is expected to be released during the last quarter of 2017. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "on Tuesday December 06, 2016 @01:00PM from the design-war dept. The Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. From a report on Reuters: The justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. The decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. The court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.

      "text": "For the first time in a century, the US Supreme Court has weighed in on how much design patents are worth. The answer: not nearly as much as Apple thinks.\nThe 8-0 opinion (PDF) is a rebuke to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which held that the relevant \"article of manufacture\" for calculating damages was—in fact, had to be—the entire smartphone. That meant even though Apple's patents covered only certain design elements, it was entitled to $399 million in lost profits damages.\nIn an opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court rejected that approach, finding that the statutory term \"article of manufacture\" could mean either a whole product or just one component of a product.\nFurther Reading Supreme Court may reel in Apple v. Samsung damage award \"Reading 'article of manufacture' in §289 to cover only an end product sold to a consumer gives too narrow a meaning to the phrase,\" writes Sotomayor.\nThe damage numbers in this case, the first of two mammoth Apple v. Samsung trials, have shifted over time. In 2012, the first Apple v. Samsung trial ended with a jury slapping Samsung with a $1.05 billion verdict for infringing Apple patents and trademarks. After appeals, the trademark damages were thrown out, with $548 million in damages remaining, based entirely on patent infringement. With this Supreme Court case, Samsung was looking to get back most of that money—the $399 million that's based on three design patents.\nThe patents at issue are D618,677 (a black rectangle with rounded corners, shown above), D593,087 (with bezel on surrounding rim), and D604,305 (a colorful grid of 16 icons.)\nFurther Reading Supreme Court takes up Apple v. Samsung , first design patent case in a century The Supreme Court declined to rule on exactly what should be the \"article of manufacture\" in the case, saying that issue wasn't sufficiently briefed—a suggestion made by the US Solicitor General during oral arguments .\nThe case will go back down to the Federal Circuit, which will recalculate the damages using the Supreme Court's criteria. However, today's ruling is narrow enough that the appeals court could still come up with a high number—or even the same number. The Supreme Court said only that they can't assume the whole product is the damages base, but Sotomayor's opinion acknowledges that it could be appropriate in some cases.\nThat seems unlikely to happen, however. Even though it's a narrow opinion, it's a sign that the Supreme Court is seeing overreach here, and it is going to expect a smaller number. The Federal Circuit will not want another high court rebuke to add to its growing list.",

Learn more... \nTue, Dec 6, 2016, 17:59 GMT - UK Markets closed Samsung wins over Apple in $399 mn patent appeal By Rob Lever | AFP – 37 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \n- No clarity - \nObservers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is \"an article of manufacture,\" leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n\"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,\" he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) , Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of \"fundamental principles of visual design.\" \nEric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. \n\"By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties' ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,\" Goldman told AFP.

      "text": "5 hours ago \nDespite its best efforts, Apple is still boring . \nAccording to data released from analytics firm IDC Dec. 5, Apple’s share of the wearable market in the third quarter shrunk significantly. Apple shipped roughly 4 million smartwatches in the quarter last year, according to IDC, but could only manage to ship roughly 1 million this year—a 70% drop in shipments. \nEvery other manufacturer has gained market share this quarter. Samsung is now selling about as many smart devices as Apple, up 90% from the same quarter last year. Fitbit, although up slightly from the year earlier, recently forecast that it’s likely to have a much weaker holiday quarter than Wall Street had been expecting. Its stock plummeted 30% to about $8.50 on the news. \nApple launched its newest watches , the Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Nike+ , partway through the third quarter, in early September, meaning that some people may have held off on buying an Apple Watch earlier in the quarter if they’d been reading the rumors that a new one was on the way. But there doesn’t seem to have been in a massive uptick in watch sales after the release, so perhaps people weren’t waiting for the new models. Regardless, Apple will be hoping people are out right now buying Watches as stocking stuffers for the approaching holiday. iPhone and Mac sales have been weak in recent quarters, and Apple posted its first yearly loss in over a decade in October. \nWhatever Apple’s solution to return to growth might be, Apple Watch probably won’t be part of it.

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo New of Apple’s iPhone 6s has been making the rounds again after Apple confirmed that a batch of units need to have their batteries replaced . The admission followed complaints that some iPhone 6s units were shutting off with 30 percent of battery life still left in the tank. It’s annoying, sure, but Apple says it’s not a safety issue . Better yet, an update is in the works that might help solve the problem.\nApple had originally called on users to have the batteries replaced entirely, though there might be something it can do to prevent users from having to swap out batteries. Apple recently confirmed to Business Insider that it’s working on a software update that will roll out to iPhone 6s users as soon as next week. The patch will apparently help Apple take a closer look at what’s going on inside a large number of iPhone 6s units.\niPhone 6s software update will help Apple understand battery problems “This will allow us to gather information over the coming weeks which may potentially help us improve the algorithms used to manage battery performance and shutdown,” Apple said. “If such improvements can be made, they will be delivered in future software updates.”\nApple doesn’t confirm that a software update is going to be the only fix, which means some iPhone 6s owners may have to get their batteries replaced. But there’s a chance, and next week’s patch will help Apple make the call. We’ll let you know when the diagnostics patch drops so you can update. In the meantime, read our earlier report to find out if your iPhone 6s unit is affected .\n\n\nSource : Business Insider ",

      "text": "2 hours ago Quartz africa \nTo cope with a worsening dollar shortage over the last year, Nigeria’s Central Bank has proposed a number of controversial policies . One of those has been suspending the use of local currency denominated debit cards for international transactions. \nFor local businesses, the effect of the policy has been tough. Unable to pay for raw materials and imports with local currency denominated cards, they’re forced to purchase dollars at a steep price on the parallel market. Jet-setting Nigerians have also had vacation and shopping trips disrupted. But, a silver lining is starting to emerge. \nFaced with losing subscribers in Africa’s largest economy, some of the world’s biggest tech companies are beginning to charge for services in naira, Nigeria’s local currency, rather than US dollars. Over the past month, Apple subscribers have taken to social media to complain about being unable to pay for the company’s services. Great. I can't pay for my Apple Music subscription because my country has blocked all foreign transactions on all Naira cards.  @AllyShimmer They've cut me off everything. Apple music, iCloud storage, BBM subscription. Nigeria is stifling. \n— Agboola .S. (@AgboolaS) November 6, 2016 So my @DiamondBankNG and @StanbicIBTC Nigeria cards can't pay for my @AppleMusic subscription and I lost all my music. Sad stuff \n— Tony Montana (@Dayo36) November 2, 2016 \nAs a result, Apple has announced that it will start charging subscribers for its various services in naira, the local currency. In an email, Apple told subscribers “the currency of the App Store, the iTunes Store, and Apple Music in Nigeria will soon be changing from U.S. dollars to Nigerian naira.” Following the currency change, Apple said, “pre-orders or subscriptions” will be billed in naira. Looks like that Apple Music money from Nigeria is too much for Apple to ignore pic.twitter.com/RElCkkUihv \n— Hafiz Ibrahim (@fizo07) December 3, 2016 \nBefore Apple, Facebook had also adopted a similar tact. The social networking site started charging for ad campaigns in naira back in June, as the currency situation got worse. Nigeria, with more users than anywhere else on the continent, represents an important market for Facebook. Google started accepting naira payments for apps and games in its Play Store in Aug. 2015, just as the forex problems started to bite initially. But Google still requires Nigerian business users of its AdSense and AdWords services to pay in dollars. \nFor months, Nigeria has battled a forex crisis triggered mainly the drop in the price of oil, its main export. With government revenues plummeting, the value of Nigeria’s naira has crashed for much of the past year. While initially putting a fixed exchange rate in place to peg the value of the naira against the dollar, a devaluation of the currency in June has resulted in a steep drop in value, making it more expensive and difficult for Nigerians to get hold of scarce dollars. \nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

      "text": "Supreme Court sides with Samsung in Apple patent case Author: By Seth Fiegerman \nThe thermonuclear war isn't over yet. Related Content Instagram finally lets users disable comments By Sara Ashley O'Brien \nThe Supreme Court sided with Samsung on Tuesday and unanimously reversed an earlier appeals court ruling that the company must pay $399 million to Apple for patent infringement. \nThe court was not asked to weigh in on whether Samsung actually violated various Apple design patents. Instead, the court ruled it's possible a design patent only covers part of a product rather than all of it. \nTranslation: Just because a company's product copies one or two features from a competitor doesn't necessarily mean it has to forfeit all of that product's profits to its competitor. \nThe case now goes back to a lower court where the two companies will once again take up the issue of how much Samsung should pay in damages for copying iPhone features. \n\"It's clearly a victory for Samsung,\" says Michael Risch, a patent law professor at Villanova University. \"How big a victory remains to be seen.\" \nThe Supreme Court ruling is the latest twist in a long corporate battle. It goes back to a pledge from Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs to wage \"thermonuclear war\" against those behind Android for what he saw as a blatant copy of the iPhone. \nIn 2012, a jury ruled that Samsung must pay Apple more than $1 billion for copying the various hardware and software features from the iPhone and iPad. A federal judge later reduced that penalty by $450 million. \nSamsung asked the Supreme Court late last year to review $399 million of those damages related to several design patents, including its phones' rounded corners and home screen display with 16 app icons. The patents impacted 11 Samsung phones. Samsung argued the damage was calculated based on an unfair and outdated standard. \n\"Even if the patented features contributed 1% of the value of Samsung's phones, Apple gets 100% of Samsung's profits,\" Samsung said in its original appeals filing. \nThe court ruling provides a much-needed win for Samsung at a time when it is facing a costly fallout from exploding batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone line. \nIt also marked a rare instance of the Supreme Court weighing on design patents, with potential repercussions for other businesses going forward. \n\"This is the first time the Supreme Court has been asked about it,\" says Risch. \"It will potentially reduce design patent damages.\" \nReps for Samsung and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "Samsung scores Supreme Court victory in patent suit against Apple A unanimous decision by the Supreme Court was announced on Tuesday in favor of Samsung in its long running patent battle with Apple. The Court ruled 8-0 to overturn an Appeals Court ruling that ordered Samsung to pay its rival $399 million. The case was remanded back to lower court. The key ruling made by the Court holds that a company does not have to turn over all of the profits it made selling a product with stolen designs, if the design patent covers just components and not the design of the whole product. Back in August 2012, after Samsung and Apple faced each other in a highly publicized trial, the jury awarded Apple $930 million. A decision by The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, ruled that the looks of the iPhone could not be protected by a trademark. That took Samsung's obligation to Apple down to $548 million, which it paid to Apple last December. Samsung said that it should not have to pay $399 million of that amount, which covered the use of the iPhone's icon grid, rounded corners and bezels. For its part, Apple said that the success of the iPhone was due to innovative designs that were copied by others. Samsung, says Apple, went out of its way to deliberately copy the style of the phone for its Galaxy series. Samsung's argument, which was accepted by the Supreme Court, was that it should not have to give up all of its profits for a device with thousands of patented parts and designs of which Apple's patents covered just a small amount. The entire battle came down to the definition of the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law. Apple, Samsung and the Court all concluded that it could mean a single component rather than a finished, completed product. How the term is read determines whether Samsung should return to Apple all of its profits for smartphones that copied Apple's design patents, or whether Samsung is liable for the use of designs that represent a small amount of the components used on such phones. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the unanimous Court that \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.\" Now it is back to lower court where Samsung's lawyers, armed with this new definition, will attempt to whittle down the damages amount. Anything less than $548 million means that Samsung will be receiving a refund from Apple. source: Reuters",

      "text": "Samsung defeats Apple in $399m patent appeal December 6, 2016 tweet \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399m penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. \nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399m penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.” \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \n“The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \n“Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture… and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.” \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548m penalty — knocked down from an original $1bn jury award — Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. No clarity \nObservers had been watching to see how the court — which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. \n“Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n“Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,” he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of “fundamental principles of visual design.” \nEric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. \n“By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties’ ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,” Goldman told AFP .

      "text": "Court says Apple may not be entitled to full Samsung profit Lower court said Samsung copied Apple’s design of iPhone \nThe U.S. Supreme Court told a lower court to take another look at a $399 million award won by Apple Inc. from rival Samsung Electronics Co. for copying the design of the iPhone. \nThe unanimous decision extends a legal battle that dates back to 2011 and at one point spanned the globe and engulfed every major maker of smartphones. \nWriting for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Apple might not be entitled to Samsung’s entire profit on 11 infringing smartphones. She told a federal appeals court to consider whether Apple should be able to recoup profits attributable only to particular components. The high court stopped short of deciding that question itself. \nSotomayor said the lower court’s approach \"cannot be squared with the text\" of the federal patent statute. \n“The term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,” Sotomayor said in the opinion. \nDesign patents, which cover the ornamental look of an object rather than any functional aspect, are increasingly used by tech companies and makers of consumer products to differentiate their merchandise from competitors. The Supreme Court hadn’t considered design patents since disputes involving spoon handles in the 1870s and carpets in the 1890s. Components of Products \nThe legal issues in the case narrowed after the high court accepted it in March. Apple said it accepted that in some cases the patent holder can collect only the profit attributable to a particular component, and not the earnings from the entire product. \nApple argued, however, that Samsung failed to show that the patented designs applied only to part of its phones. Samsung contended that it was Apple’s burden to show that the infringement gave Samsung any increased profits. A federal appeals court said Apple could collect Samsung’s entire profit based on a strict reading of the law. \nGoogle, Facebook Inc., EBay Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said in filings that a victory for Apple would allow owners of design patents to extract unfair rewards on products that can have hundreds or even thousands of features. \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, will have to develop some sort of legal standard on when a patent owner can get all profits or just a portion. While the Obama administration suggested a test, neither Apple nor Samsung submitted legal arguments on that issue and so it has to be addressed by the Federal Circuit, Sotomayor said. ‘World of Turmoil’ \n“We’re probably entering a world of turmoil where there’s no clarity of where the test is,” said lawyer Rick McKenna , head of the design rights group at Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “It’s going to be quite a while before we have a clear understanding of what we should be doing.” \nApple introduced the iPhone in 2007, revolutionizing an industry that before then had received limited interest from consumers. Apple said that Samsung copied the look of the iPhone to avoid a loss of market share. \nPhones by both companies have evolved beyond the look that sparked the global fight, and all that’s left of the legal battle is how much Samsung must pay over those earlier models. In a second case, Samsung was ordered to pay $119.6 million for infringing patents on smartphone features. \nEven with a rise in the number of design patents, there aren’t many lawsuits over them compared with fights over inventions, and they rarely involve products worth billions of dollars. That means the Apple and Samsung fight is the best chance to resolve the question left open by the Supreme Court on how to value patented designs, McKenna said. \nThe case is Samsung Electronics v. Apple, 15-777. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE ",

The court said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices.

      "title": "Tim Cook's Apple Watch sales coyness does Apple no favors",
      "text": "Reddit \nApple CEO Tim Cook has defended Apple Watch sales, after a damning report on the state of the wearables market criticized the recently-updated smartwatch. According to IDC, Apple was the fourth largest wearable device vendor worldwide in the third quarter of 2016, with just under 5-percent market share. That’s despite what IDC says is a whopping 71-percent decline in growth compared to the same period twelve months ago. \nIDC’s numbers claim 1.1m Apple Watch shipments in the three month period ending September 2016. That’s versus a stated 3.9m in Q3 2015, when Apple was said to have more than 17-percent of the wearable market. The big winner in IDC’s growth numbers is Samsung, with an 89-percent increase year-on-year. \nEven so, Samsung is still in fifth place with 1m shipments in Q3 2016. Its market share from devices like the Gear S2 is 4.5-percent, IDC says, while smart headphones like the Icon X also helped. However, exactly what portion of those shipments was made up of bundles with phones like the Galaxy S7 and Note 7 is unclear. \nApple did, of course, release the Apple Watch Series 2 in mid-September, though the overlap with Q3 is minimal. IDC does recognize that it addresses some of the lingering complaints leveled at the first-generation wearable –“an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface”– but argues that “Apple’s success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.” \nApple CEO Tim Cook promptly made a defense of Apple Watch, apparently in reaction to the critical analyst figures. In an email to Reuters , Cook said that the company’s own data suggests “that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.” Indeed, he predicted, the wearable is set to break sales records. \n“Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch” Tim Cook, CEO, Apple \nHowever Apple still refuses to release specific Apple Watch sales figures. The wearable is lumped in with the “Other Products” in the firm’s quarterly financial reporting, along with sales of Apple TV, Beats products, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. That contributed $2.4bn in the most recently reported quarter, but there’s no way of knowing for sure what percentage of that was made up of Apple Watch sales. \nThat reticence, and glowing-but-vague comments like Cook’s, are unlikely to do much to bolster confidence in the wearable, and with watchOS 3 putting greater emphasis on standalone apps for Apple Watch, it comes at a time when the company needs all the developer enthusiasm it can find. Opting to withhold details is generally interpreted as there being no good news to report. Meanwhile, it’s notable that the bulk of wearable sales in IDC’s report come from cheaper, more basic fitness trackers rather than the smartwatches many assumed would supplant them.",

      "text": "Reddit \nGoogle Play Movies of all sorts have appeared available for purchase and rental for several Android devices today. These 4K versions of top-tier AAA film releases are appearing on the Google Play store right this minute – though not for all Android devices that support 4K. As Google suggests, Chromecast Ultra, Sony Bravia Android TVs, and Xiaomi’s Mi Box 3 will have access right off the bat. \nTo make a push for the 4K release, Google is giving away a single 4K movie through Google Play Movies with purchase of the Chromecast Ultra. At this time, the selection of movies available with this deal include Captain Philips and Ghostbusters (2016). That means an approximately $20+ digital movie for “free”, just so long as you consider this sort of deal to be giving you something for free as long as you make a purchase. \nUPDATE: It would appear that 4K movies cannot be rented at this time, only purchased. It’s not clear whether this will remain a rule through the future, but for now it is what it is. \nMeanwhile: YouTube flips the switch on 4K streaming \nAt the time this article is published, Google will have added a cool 125 4K movies to its library with 4K resolution. Google has also announced that they’re bringing their Google Play library of media to Daydream VR headsets. All movies and TV shows and clips from Google Play will be able to be downloaded and watched with the virtual reality headset and a compatible phone. \nIn addition to a set of streaming video services like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Video, Google Play is now one of the premiere 4K video services in the world. Apple’s 4K video game appears to be lagging by comparison – though waiting for the demand before the supply is produced is one of Apple’s strategies in general – for the most part. \nMany of Google’s Top Movies and TV Shows of 2016 are 4K. Just make sure you’re browsing the list with a device that’s part of Google’s rollout and you’ll see the option for sale.",

      "text": "Comments The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple’s iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world’s top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone’s trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \nSamsung had been seeking to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple’s iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance. \nAfter a trial in 2012 , Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict , but said the iPhone’s appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung’s damages back by $382 million. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term “article of manufacture” in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court’s ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term “article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,” she wrote. \nSamsung in December 2015 paid Apple $548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone’s rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. \nApple said its iPhone’s success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone’s look and many user interface features, Apple said. \nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. \nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world’s top smartphone maker. \nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct. 11. \nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. \n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham) \nRelated:",

      "text": "Comments Apple Inc. is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation. \n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. \n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience – to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang) Copyright 2016 Reuters.

      "text": "Rather than being in a dive, the company claims that its Apple Watch Series 2 is seeing record sales. \nWho is right? Industry Suggests Plummeting Apple Watch Sales \nWe first reported on the dire state of smartwatch sales at the end of October, when analytics firm IDC released third-quarter numbers. According to its data, smartwatch sales were down a whopping 51.6% on the year. The story was even worse for Apple. \nAccording to IDC, Apple Watch sales were down 71.6% for the quarter. The time covered by the data included the first two weeks of the Apple Watch Series 2 launch. 10 Ways to Make Money in the Market in 2017 \nIDC followed that report yesterday with a Q3 sales report on all wearables . Again, it spiked out Apple Watch sales as being particularly atrocious: \n“The primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple’s success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.” \nThe top five wearable vendors — including rivals Fitbit Inc (NYSE: FIT ) and Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) — all posted growth, leaving Apple Watch out in the cold. Apple Fires Back \nApple was quiet when the initial smartwatch sales numbers were released, but the company responded to IDC’s latest claims. \nSpeaking to Reuters , Apple CEO Tim Cook fired back against IDC’s suggestion that the Apple Watch has not only nosedived in popularity, but also its contention that it faces an uncertain future. \n“Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” So Who’s Right? \nIs the Apple Watch rebounding or doomed to “muted success”? It’s difficult to separate the success of the Apple Watch from the success of the smartwatch category overall. And sales numbers aside, there’s little doubt the product category has stumbled. \nLenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS: LNVGY ) is backing away from releasing a new Moto 360, one of the most popular smartwatches running rival Android Wear operating system. Meanwhile Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) subsidiary Google delayed the release of version 2.0 of its Android Wear platform from the fall to early 2017.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray After a week or so of negative data points about Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone , with analysts cutting estimates, Credit Suisse ’s Kulbinder Garcha today swoops in with some good news, which is that demand for the iPhone seems just fine, and the company’s heading for record shipments.\n“Supply chain checks from our Asia team are supportive of iPhone strength, particularly around the mix,” writes Garcha, who has an Outperform rating on the shares, and a $150 price target.\n“December quarter builds are expected to be 87mn, the highest quarterly build number we’ve seen historically,” he adds.\n“Additionally, the mix of the iPhone 7 Plus continues to be strong, with the 7 Plus expected to make up ~45% of the iPhone 7/7 Plus mix, materially higher than the ~35% we currently estimate.”\nGarcha, however, is really “ looking forward to the iPhone 8 super cycle ,” he writes, referring to what is presumably the next model, coming sometime in 2017.\nIn fact, he’s so positive on iPhone, he offers up an infographic showing growth through 2018’s presumed “ iPhone 9 ” and 9-Plus and something he’s calling an “iPhone 9 Pro”:\nGarcha notes there have been a number of concerns, such as Apple’s ability to get organic light-emitting diode technology in adequate quantity for an “all-glass” version of the iPhone. He writes that Apple will figure a way:\nThe main concern is whether the production capacity will be up to speed in time for the product launch. Given this concern, we believe that Apple will likely pursue one of three product scenarios next year: (1) 2 iPhones, both OLED; (2) 3 iPhones, 1 OLED version; or (3) 3 iPhones, all OLED.\nGarcha thinks Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ) will have enough capacity to make 71 million units of an OLED-based iPhone in 2017, and another 276 million units in 2018:\nSamsung could produce 559mn OLED smartphone displays by 2018 according to our Asian team. According to an analysis by our Asia team, given Samsung significant investment in capacity expansion, Samsung could potentially produce up to 559mn OLED smartphone displays in 2018 (assuming 90% yield). Samsung is currently allocating most of the current capacity to Other non-Apple vendors, which we estimate will make up ~283mn units in 2016. Assuming the rest of the incremental capacity goes to Apple going forward, Samsung should have capacity to produce ~276mn OLED displays for Apple by 2018. Our own meetings with Samsung also indicate that capacity could be sufficient at ~271mn OLED units by 2018. In our meetings with Samsung, the company noted that it plans to add 7 A3 lines by 2018. Assuming all of this incremental capacity goes to Apple, this implies ~271mn OLED displays for Apple by 2018. However, sole sourcing could be risky. While Apple has done it before, we would note that sole sourcing the display for an entire product line could be risky, especially as the display already accounts for ~10% of the total BOM.",

      "title": "Apple’s Damages From Samsung Should be Reconsidered, Says U.S. Supreme Court - Tech Trader Daily",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray The U.S. Supreme Court a short while ago ruled that the a lower court should reconsider damages of $399 million that Samsung Electronics owes to Apple ( AAPL ) when found guilty in 2012 of infringing Apple design patents on the iPhone , according to a write-up of the ruling by Dow Jones Newswires ’s Brent Kendall .\nAt issue was whether Samsung must pay Apple all the profit it earned on infringing devices or just some. The Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s ruling, and the case is “remanded for further proceedings.”\nThe text of the ruling can be found on the Supreme Court site, under SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., ET AL. v. APPLE INC .\nJustice Sotomayor wrote the opinion of the unanimous court, according to the document.\nThe heart of the opinion is that the lower court erred in deciding that the target of damages was the entire phone as an “ article of manufacture ,” which the court says is too narrow, because individual components could be an article of manufacture.\nAs Sotomayor writes, “article” can mean an end product, or just a component that’s sold to a consumer within the context of the end product:\nThis case involves the infringement of designs for smartphones. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit identified the entire smartphone as the only permissible “article of manufacture” for the purpose of calculating §289 damages because consumers could not separately purchase components of the smartphones. The question before us is whether that reading is consistent with §289. We hold that it is not [...] This case requires us to address a threshold matter: the scope of the term “article of manufacture.” The only ques- tion we resolve today is whether, in the case of a multi- component product, the relevant “article of manufacture” must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product. Under the former interpretation, a patent holder will always be entitled to the infringer’s total profit from the end product. Under the latter interpretation, a patent holder will some- times be entitled to the infringer’s total profit from a component of the end product.\nApple shares are up 67 cents, or 0.6%, to $109.78.",

      "text": "Business The U.S. Supreme Court told a lower court to take another look at a $399 million award won by Apple from rival Samsung Electronics for copying the design of the iPhone. The Spokane Apple store is shown in this November file photo. (Colin Mulvany / The Spokesman-Review)  25 A.M. Supreme Court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple By Sam Hananel   A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look.  25 a.m.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Buy shares of TPK Holding ( 3673TW ) in advance of Apple ’s ( AAPL ) move to organic-light emitting diodes in the iPhone, is the advice of Narci Chang with J.P. Morgan in a note to clients this morning.\nChang, who has an Overweight rating on TPK shares, and a price target of 100 New Taiwan Dollars, cites an article from ChinaTimes stating that the company is “said to be the exclusive touch panel lamination supplier for the OLED touch bar on Apple’s new MacBook Pro.”\nThis, to Chang, is a run-up to TPK supplying an “ iPhone 8 ,” presumably the next model, coming out sometime next year, which many think will have a radical new design that employs OLED :\nWe believe MacBook Pro’s OLED touch bar adopts an out-cell touch panel structure, with an ITO-glass-based out-cell touch sensor laminated on top of the OLED display that is supplied by Samsung (OW, covered by JJ Park) together with the cover glass. We note TPK is the exclusive supplier for this multi-touch touch panel of special shape at present. We expect the revenue contribution of this MacBook pro touch bar could be less than 5% of TPK’s 2017 revenue. However, this business paves the way for TPK’s potential business opportunities to all the OLED display devices Apple might pursue in the future. This also proves that TPK remains the leading touch panel partner in Apple’s product roadmap, in our view. We cautiously expect TPK to turn more aggressive on OLED touch film-sensor related capacity once the customers’ orders are firm by 4Q16-1Q17. We reiterate our view that TPK is the runner-up in the race for 5.8” iPhone 8’s OLED out-cell touch panel orders, only second to Nissha Printing (OW, covered by Itaya Masashi).\nTPK shares today closed down 10 cents at 55.10 in Taipei trading.",

      "text": "In a statement to Reuters , Cook refuted IDC’s report of declining Apple Watch sales—sort of. \n“Sales growth is off the charts,” Cook said. “In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” \nSell-through is how many watches were actually sold, which is different from how many were shipped to retailers. IDC estimated that Apple sold 1.1 million watches in the third quarter of 2016, a time frame that included two weeks of Apple Watch Series 2 availability. It’s still the leading smartwatch, but other wearables like Fitbit’s activity trackers beat the Apple Watch by a mile. \nApple doesn’t break out Apple Watch sales figures in its earnings reports—it’s in an “other” product category that also includes the Apple TV—and Cook didn’t release specific numbers in his statement to Reuters, so IDC could be right about the device’s third-quarter performance. \nBut Cook would have a more complete picture than the research firm, given that the Series 2 and Series 1 reboots have been available to buy for 3 months now. Potential buyers were likely waiting to order a device until the second-gen model was released, and even then many models were sold out for weeks following the launch. \nThe holiday quarter is also likely to be the strongest in terms of Apple Watch sales, because the gadget is a more giftable (read: more affordable) option than an iPhone or MacBook. \nBut we likely won’t find out exactly how many watches Apple has sold, unless the company decides to release that information. \n(Editor’s note: Macworld and IDC are both part of the same parent company, IDG.)

      "text": "Dec 6, 2016 A Samsung and an Apple smartphone are displayed on Aug. 6, 2014, in London. Getty Images \nThe Supreme Court has weighed in on a patent battle between Samsung and Apple, siding with Samsung by declaring that the patent infringement for an element of a design should be treated differently from the infringement of an entire design. \nThe dispute between the two tech giants isn't about whether Samsung violated Apple's patents, but rather about how much money it's reasonable for Samsung to payfor the infringement. \nSamsung previously had been ordered to pay Apple $399 million in damages. The high court's unanimous decision sends the suit back to a lower court to reconsider what is a reasonable amount. \nHere's how NPR's Nina Totenberg and An-Li Herring explained the underlying issue a few months ago : \n\"The two smartphone giants have been battling each other — not just in the marketplace but also in the courts — since 2011, a year after Samsung unveiled a new set of smartphones, including the Galaxy. Like iPhones, the Samsung products, for the first time, had rounded corners and square icons on a touchscreen. \n\"Apple alleged, in part, that its South Korean rival had infringed three design patents for discrete components of the iPhone — the front face of the device, the rounded edges framing the face, and the device's distinctive matrix of colorful square icons. \n\"In 2012, a jury ruled in Apple's favor and Samsung was ordered to pay $399 million in damages — all the profits it had made on 11 infringing phone models. \n\"Samsung appealed, arguing that it should not have to fork over its total profits; rather, it should only be liable for the specific design elements it infringed. \n\"The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, rejected that argument, agreeing with Apple that Samsung had to cough up all of its profits on an infringed 'article of manufacture.' \n\" 'The game then becomes, what's the article of manufacture?' says Daryl Joseffer, who formerly served as principal deputy U.S. solicitor general. 'Is it the cover of the phone which is the design? Or is it the entire phone?' \nThe Supreme Court unanimously concluded that the \"article of manufacture\" doesn't have to be the entire phone. \nAs we reported in May, Samsung has said the laws that govern copyright infringement like this were outdated and due for re-examination. The South Korean tech giant noted that the logic behind the $399 million decision would apply even if an 18-wheel tractor-trailer included design infringement in a single cup holder. \nHere's more from our coverage then: \n\"A smartphone contains thousands of parts, many of which are functional rather than ornamental, Samsung argues. \"The law of the smartphone cannot follow reflexively from the law of the spoon,\" it says in court documents . ... \" In its opposing brief , Apple counters by arguing that the law 'could not be clearer': It explicitly holds an infringer liable for the 'total profit,' and not just a portion of it.\" In the end, the highest court in the land released a very brief decision that turned largely on definitions. The Supreme Court, citing multiple dictionaries, concluded there was no reason why an \"article of manufacture\" couldn't be a component, as easily as an entire product.",

      "text": "Technology US Supreme Court backs Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a US$399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. Posted 07 Dec 2016 02:25 A Samsung logo and a logo of Apple are seen in this September 23, 2014 illustration photo in Sarajevo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Files A \nREUTERS: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a US$399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future. \nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favouring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly US$930 million in penalties, later cut by US$382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival US$548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make US$399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colourful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. \nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker. \nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote. \nPERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY \nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products. \n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview. \nRepresentatives from Apple and Samsung could not immediately be reached for comment. \nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said. \nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. \nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. \nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777. \n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham) - Reuters",

      "text": "By Andrew Chung (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung <005930.KS> in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple(AAPL.O), throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million (£314.8 million) penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future.\nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favouring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colourful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nThe legal dispute centred on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\n\nPERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY\nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products.\n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview.\nRepresentatives from Apple and Samsung  \nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.\nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 7. 23% off LilGadgets Premium Children's Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with... \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated a US$399 million infringement award against Samsung Electronics in a long-running design patent dispute with Apple. \nThe court, in an 8-0 decision , kicked back the patent award to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, saying the lower court calculated the patent award based on the whole iPhone, while the design patents may cover only pieces of the device. \nThe Federal Circuit's failure to consider a smaller damage award based on pieces of the iPhone \"cannot be squared\" with patent law, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court. The lower court, in its ruling, said it could not separate out the infringing pieces of the smartphones because they were not available for sale to the public, she noted. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nBut \"the term 'article of manufacture' [in patent law] is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not,\" Sotomayor wrote. \nThe damage award relates to three design patents covering the face and rounded bezel design of the iPhone and the grid of sixteen icons on the phone's home screen. \nSamsung, with support from Google, Facebook, and other tech companies, had asked the Supreme Court to take a new look at design patents, even though the rules have remained largely unchanged for more than a century. \nRepresentatives of Apple and Samsung were not immediately available for comment. \nThe two companies' patent disputes will continue. Separately, the same appeals court reinstated a $119.6 million award for Apple back in October. The appeals court ruled that two Apple smartphone design patents, one related to a slide-to-unlock feature , are valid and Samsung infringed a third patent related to helping smartphone users find phone numbers.

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Brent Kendall\nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled a lower court should reconsider how much money Samsung Electronics Co. owes rival Apple Inc. for infringing patents on the iPhone's design.\nSamsung has been challenging a $399 million award to Apple after jurors in 2012 found that 11 smartphone models from the South Korean electronics giant infringed Apple's design patents.\nThe Supreme Court said an appeals court used the wrong analysis when it ruled for Apple.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for a unanimous court, said the holder of a design patent isn't always entitled to the total profits on an infringing product sold to consumers. In multicomponent products, sometimes a patent holder will only be entitled to the infringer's total profits on the specific component that infringed the patent, she said.\nThe decision, however, didn't resolve the dispute between the smartphone makers. The court declined to apply its legal rules to the specifics of the case, so it didn't determine whether Samsung must pay its total profits on the 11 phones or just its profits attributable to the screen and case design of those products.\nThe justices said a lower court should sort out that issue.\nNeither Apple nor Samsung immediately responded to requests for comment.\nThe case had been closely watched in tech circles. An array of companies including Dell Inc., Facebook Inc., and Google Inc. had filed a court brief in support of Samsung. They argued it would be absurd to require companies to fork over their total profits on complex modern technological products when one component among thousands in a device infringed another company's design.\nA group of design professionals and companies including Crocs Inc., Tiffany & Co. and Adidas AG supported Apple, saying a total-profits remedy was important for protecting valuable and innovative designs that drive consumer demand and are the lifeblood of many businesses.\nThe smartphone makers have been locked in a variety of patent battles. The case before the high court involved the highest profile litigation, which dates back to 2011.\nThe $399 million was part of a $930 million award Samsung was ordered to pay by a trial court. The rest of the money stemmed from other Apple claims not before the Supreme Court. Part of the overall damages award already was scheduled to be revisited in the lower courts.\nFor all the money involved, the case isn't expected to have much impact on smartphone consumers. Despite losing past rulings to Apple, Samsung has been able to continue selling phones and has moved on to newer models.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-06-161335ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on Tuesday tried to punch back against a downbeat report on Apple Watch — but it was unclear is he landed any meaningful blows.\nCook said that Apple Watch is very popular and that “sales growth is off the charts.”\nThe rosy outlook stands in stark contrast to a report from IDC released 24 hours ago that found that Apple Watch shipments plunged 71 percent in the third quarter, to 1.1 million units.\nCook countered that sales of Apple’s wrist computer set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and that the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the Apple Watch, according to Reuters .\nOf course, the periods Cook focused on are outside the period included in the IDC report.\nAlso, Cook didn’t respond when asked for concrete sales figures for the gadget. Critics pounced on his relentlessly vague language when it comes to the Apple Watch.\n“Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Cook wrote in an email to Reuters.\n“Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,” Cook wrote.\nCritics countered, however, that “sell-through” is merely an indicator of how many watches sold versus the number that were shipped to stores — a metric that says little about how many were actually sold.\nUnlike the iPhone, the iPad and Mac computers, the Apple Watch’s numbers have been lumped into an “other products” category in Apple’ s quarterly results since its September 2014 launch.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy",

      "text": "In Apple v. Samsung, SCOTUS Makes $399M Decision And it goes with Samsung in design patent case By Jenn Gidman , Newser Staff Posted Dec 6, 2016 12:03 PM CST 4 comments Comments A victory for Samsung. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) A victory for Samsung. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) (Newser) – Apple tried to hold onto the full $548 million in damages it recouped from Samsung in a lawsuit over smartphone design patents, but it looks like it may now have to settle for much less, based on a Tuesday Supreme Court decision, the Hill reports. The ruling noted that even though Apple's 2011 complaint accused Samsung of ripping off the look of the iPhone for its own devices (including the \"rectangular front face with rounded edges\"), as well as how the grid that shows app icons is presented, Apple couldn't collect on damages on total profits Samsung took in for its phones overall (Apple had originally been awarded more than $1 billion by a jury in 2012, but that number was whittled down.) And it all came down to three words, per Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the court's 8-0 opinion, per Reuters , which notes the high court almost never hears design patent cases. According to Section 289 of the US Patent Act , the \"article of manufacture\" term used in patent law is meant to cover both the entire product that a consumer can buy, as well as individual elements, or components, of that product. The ruling points out that when an item is just one component (e.g., a dinner plate), it's easy to apply this law, but for a multi-component item such as a smartphone, it becomes trickier. The Supreme Court disagreed with the appeals court's ruling that the smartphone as a whole was the only way \"article of manufacture\" could be interpreted, instead deciding that design infringement (and therefore damages) could be parsed into separate components. The Supreme Court's decision overturned the appeals court's ruling for $399 million awarded to Apple, but Fortune notes the case is now being sent back to the lower court to decide how much Apple's patents really merit. (These two have been fighting for a while.)",

      "text": "reader comments 0 Share this story \nA new report from IDC shows Apple Watch sales have slumped since last year. The report estimates that Apple has sold 1.1 million Watch units in the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from a year ago. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told Reuters that sell-through, or the number of Apple Watches that reach consumers rather than the number on store shelves, reached a new high. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts,\" Cook said. \"In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" Further Reading Fitbit Charge 2 reviewed: A calculated update that’s ideal for new users \nApple also expects the holiday shopping season to be big for the Watch. This could prove to be true, since it is arguably the most complementary device in Apple's lineup and more suited as a gift than an iPhone. Apple generally doesn't talk about Apple Watch sales on its earnings calls, nor does it reveal exact sales numbers for the device. The Watch remains in an \"other products\" category (along with the iPod and Apple TV), rather than standing on its own in the company's sales figures. \nIDC cites two reasons for this slump in Apple Watch sales: first is Apple's decision to launch the Series 2 Watch in mid-September, toward the end of the third quarter. But the other reason is more interesting: the consumer shift away from smartwatches and complex wearables and to more simple fitness trackers. This time last year, smartwatches were expected to overshadow fitness trackers and take over the wearable market. However, that trend seems to be changing as more people favor fitness-focused wearables that are easy to use. \"Basic wearables,\" a category that IDC fills mostly with fitness bands like those from Fitbit and Garmin, made up 85 percent of the wearable market. \nWe've seen Apple already try to face this challenge head-on with its Series 2 Watch, which is inherently more of a fitness device with its onboard GPS and swim-tracking features. But the Apple Watch is still much more expensive than most dedicated fitness trackers: the most affordable Series 2 model is about $375, whereas Fitbit's most expensive device, the Surge tracker, is just $250. Not only are Apple Watches a big monetary investment, but it appears the time investment—as in, the amount of time it takes to set up and learn how to fully use an Apple Watch—may be too much for some wearables customers.
