      "title": "Apple Pay Should Pair With iBeacon 11/21/2016",
      "text": "Over the last few years, Apple has invested in the retail industry, primarily through the launch of Apple Pay and iBeacon.\nIn October 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay but has yet to see massive adoption. A year earlier, it was iBeacon, which is growing rapidly and our research shows that more than 8 million beacons are deployed globally. The forecast in 2021 is a massive 500 million beacons.\nWhat is Apple´s big play here? Are those two revolutionizing technologies really meant to live in solos or has Apple planned how they’ll work together to accelerate the growth and adoption of both? I believe the latter and here is why: \nApple Pay and iBeacon are the perfect tag team. iBeacon can be used as a trigger to get people into the store and enrich the shopping experience and Apple Pay as the final close of the visit through an easy and convenient check out technology. The missed opportunity is to tie the two technologies together and create a holistic customer experience. If Apple and retailers want a higher adoption of Apple Pay, they should include iBeacon technology. In store, I want my payment apps to send me beacon triggered notifications with relevant offers. I’m now in a true mobile experience and don't want to pull out my payment card. Apple Pay and iBeacon has to be a de facto tag team. Apple Pay has a data challenge iBeacon will solve. Apple is not in the business of collecting or monetizing data, but the real reason Apple doesn't do more with Apple Pay data is that it can´t. The limitation lies in the technology as Apple Pay and NFC- based systems lack access to the product level. It’s privacy friendly, but is an issue for the development of Apple Pay. Without data from transactions and store visits, Apple Pay loses its potential value to retailers and consumers. Retailers rely on customers and purchase data and customers expect retailers to know them and provide better experiences. This is where iBeacon can complement Apple Pay. iBeacon can be enabled to collect data about customer interactions with beacons. The data collection is always opt-in and tied to the advertising identifier (IDFA), a privacy friendly identifier Apple introduced when iBeacon launched. Through beacon deployments, retailers and brands can collect data to understand what people do in-store. iBeacon complements Apple Pay, allowing retailers to build and improve their business. In return, customers get a contextual experience enhancing the physical world they live in.  One more thing. Earlier this year a new Apple device passed through the FCC and the device comes with both Bluetooth and NFC. We've earlier speculated if this is a new ‘iBeacon 2.0,’ a new point of sales system or both. Apple’s secret are more safely guarded than Fort Knox. We’ll just have to wait for the next Developer Conference or Keynote. There should be no doubt that iBeacon and Apple Pay will play an important role in accelerating each other's growth.",

      "text": "Apple offers a fix for iPhone 6S sudden-death battery issue by  12:56 PM   \nAnother day, another problem with Apple's popular iPhone line of handsets. This time, the trouble involves batteries in some iPhone 6S models. Unlike the Samsung Note7, the issues don't revolve around safety concerns or spontaneous combustion . In the case of the iPhone 6S, some phones occasionally shut off even when the battery is at half capacity. The company says it will replace batteries on affected phones for no charge. The handsets in question have a serial number in a specific window and were built in September and October 2015. \nUsers must back up and erase their phones prior to handing them over for service, so if you are someone else's \"answer person\" when it comes to technology, expect to hear some complaining about iTunes and iCloud in the near future. As usual, phones with outstanding damage to the screen or other components will be denied service until the other issues are repaired. iPhone owners must seek service through Apple, as wireless carriers are not participating in the repair campaign. According to Forbes, the China Consumers Association alleges that iPhone 6 handsets suffer from the same problem, but those phones are so far not included in the repair program.",

      "text": "Apple Inc. is the world’s most valuable company and has a massive cash stash, but some analysts fear a prolonged period of weak innovation has set the company up for a “decade-long malaise.”\niPhone sales are expected to peak with the release of Apple’s AAPL, +1.52% 10th anniversary iPhone next year, according to models from Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who predicts 245 million iPhones will sell in Apple’s 2018 fiscal year. That would reflect an increase of 9% from the fiscal 2017 FactSet consensus estimate of 225 million, and an increase of more than 15% from the fiscal year that ended in October.\nHowever, Uerkwitz believes next year’s iPhone cycle will present “one last growth hurrah” before consumers begin to drift away from the high prices Apple commands for it smartphones. Apple may struggle to raise iPhone prices meaningfully beyond the next cycle as it deals with fewer hardware breakthroughs and a narrowing performance gap between the iPhone and its closest premium-tier competitors, Uerkwitz wrote.\n“The risks to the company have never been greater,” said Uerkwitz, who has a perform rating on the stock. “We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.”\nAlso Read: Share buybacks will return with a vengeance next year\nAnother analyst, Monness Crespi Hardt’s James Cakmak, echoed similar bearish sentiment Monday, warning about changing consumer behavior that have lengthened upgrade cycles, and competitive threats from the likes of Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.14% GOOG, +1.14% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +2.61% in the phone, video-streaming and augmented-reality realms.\n“Apple won’t have it easy again for a while, if ever,” Cakmak said.\nOne issue is an increase in demand for used and refurbished phones. Cakmak warns that Apple’s refurbished-phone program may cannibalize new-device sales, which would further depress average selling prices. Trends tracker IDC said Monday it expects the global used smartphone market to nearly triple from 2015 through 2020 , which could impact original equipment manufacturers and mobile operators like Apple and Samsung Electronics 005930, +0.44% .\nLast month, Apple reported its first ever annual decline in iPhone sales . Its shares have risen 2.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% , but have underperformed in the past year, falling more than 6% versus a 6% gain for the blue-chip index.\nDespite the bearish calls, the average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average target of $130 implies 16% growth from Monday’s closing price.\nTesting Out Augmented Reality at WSJDLive (0:41) WSJ technology reporter Georgia Wells experiments with the Microsoft HoloLens at the WSJDLive tech conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. With the augmented reality headset, she could see instructions for fixing a jet engine.\nBullish analysts have more confidence that Apple can maintain a stranglehold on the market for high-price smartphones. Canaccord Genuity’s Michael Walkley, who reiterated a buy rating and $140 price target Monday, said he expects Apple to “extend its leading market share of the premium tier smartphone market,” despite competition from Google’s Pixel phone and other Android phones. Samsung’s disastrous Note 7 recall has also helped this quarter, he said.\nOthers have been bullish on Apple’s reported efforts on smart cars and augmented reality. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been optimistic about AR and has secured a number of acquisitions over the past two years to help accelerate those plans. While Cakmak said Apple is trailing both Google and Amazon, Upload VR’s entrepreneur in residence, Robert Scoble, citing sources, recently reported that Apple is working on a set of mixed-reality glasses that could be ready in 10 months.\nAlso See: Apple and augmented reality—where we’re going, we won’t need iPhones\nStill, other uncertainties loom, such as the new White House administration. While president-elect Donald Trump’s proposed repatriation tax “holiday” would make it easier for Apple to return cash to the U.S. and put that money to work, other Trump policies that might make Apple build more iPhone components in the U.S. could offset tax-related financial benefits.\nLast week, Japan’s Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple reached out to supplier Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd. 2354, -0.60% about studying the possibility of moving some production to the U.S., which Cakmak said might have negative implications.\nMore from MarketWatch Kellyanne Conway Discusses How to ‘Drain the Swamp’ Giuliani’s Trump-Like Audition for Secretary of State Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq all close at new record highs",

      "text": "› Apple's 2016 holiday ad is a monster with a message that we all need to learn Apple's 2016 holiday ad is a monster with a message that we all need to learn Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + In 2013, Apple's holiday ad was about a kid who seemed to be disinterested in what his family was doing during a holiday vacation. Just when we think the kid is a bad seed, sitting with his iPhone all day and ignoring his family, the truth comes out. He's been filming a family oriented video with his phone. A real tearjerker if there ever was one, and it even won a Creative Arts Emmy for \"Outstanding Commercial.\"The 2014 holiday ad from Apple showed a young woman using Apple devices to produce a cover version of a song that her late grandfather recorded to vinyl years ago. Last year's holiday ad featured a duet between Stevie Wonder and Andra Day. The pair sang Wonder's 1967 tune \"Someday At Christmas.\"This year, Apple has come up with a video that covers a topic that we've all heard about since the election. Inclusion. The spot is titled \"Frankie's Holiday,\" and it shows a monster (Frankenstein) shunned by the people in his home town. Everyone is scared of him, even when he screws in a couple of light bulbs on each side of his neck turning him into a Christmas beacon.While the townspeople look on, Frankie uses his iPhone to play a backing track and starts singing a holiday song. And as usual, it takes a young child to show the elders how to make someone feel at home. Soon, all the scared faces of the townspeople are replaced with smiles as everyone sings. And Apple comes up with a tag line that we can only pray is being seen by certain politicians who will remain nameless. \"Open your heart to everyone.\" Pass the tissues, please.",

So, let's just cut to the chase: Samsung is reportedly taking on the Jet Black iPhone 7 with a glossy black model of its S7 flagship just in time for holiday shoppers.

It had moved engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV. \n  CLOSE X Edit Favorites \nEnter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

      "text": "Monday's stock market generated another record close, and on top of that, Jim Cramer saw an extremely rare occurrence — both FANG and oil rallied at the same time. \nFANG is the acronym Cramer created to represent high-growth technology plays that tend to lead the sector. It stands for Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google, now under the parent Alphabet . \nPresident-elect Donald Trump 's surprise victory caused a sudden shift in stocks as money managers rebalanced portfolios. Money rotated into banks and drug stocks, but on the back of FANG. They took money out of technology, and rotated it into the new groups. \nThis time, it was different. \n\"The growth stock sell-off made sense when it seemed like there was no new money coming in. But we now have a host of sources showing that cash is flooding into the market, and when that money comes in it flows to stocks like FANG and the much aligned Apple ,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"I think these all have room to run.\"\n\n\n\n\nTim Rue | Bloomberg | Getty Images Gas is flared off from a flame boom aboard DCOR LLC's Edith offshore oil and gas platform in the Beta Field off the coast of Long Beach, California. \"We now have a host of sources showing that cash is flooding into the market.\" -Jim Cramer Diamondback Energy , which aptly has the ticker symbol of FANG, also landed on Cramer's radar. Not only does it have prime holdings in the Permian and low costs, but also Cramer believes it will benefit under Trump. \nWhile President Obama has played a key role in fighting climate change, this also means he doesn't want fossil fuels or pipelines to prosper, Cramer said. Trump is pro-fossil fuels and also wants all fossil fuel companies, even coal miners, to prosper. \n\"He wants to build more pipelines and drill as much as possible. And while that is probably bad news for polar bears, it is great news for the oil stocks,\" Cramer said. \nHence, Cramer was a fan of both FANGs. FANG the technology cohort and FANG the energy stock. \nThus, Monday brought a day of mutual coexistence for high-growth technology and natural resource stocks, which Cramer rarely sees occur. \n\"That is proof of more money coming in, it is proof of a better attitude toward the assets class known as stocks … The Trump rally is still not over, it is just morphing into another form of a bull,\" Cramer said. \n\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC \nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Much like the company did when it killed off its monitor business, Apple has disbanded its wireless router team and moved employees to other, more profitable, departments. \nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn’t been publicly announced. Apple hasn’t refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn’t currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers.",

      "text": "Update 11/19: Sources tell Recode that Apple purposely limited the LTE capability of the iPhone 7 on Verizon in order to make the handset similar across carriers.\nIf you're looking for the fastest phone on Verizon, you may want to steer clear of the iPhone 7. According to researchers at Twin Prime Inc and Cellular Insights, Apple may be throttling its flagship phone on that network.\nView photos\nCredit: Sam Rutherford More Credit: Sam Rutherford\nThe researchers shared their results with Bloomberg , reporting that the Galaxy S7 was twice as fast as the iPhone 7 on Verizon after collecting data from more than 100,000 phones that downloaded a large image. This huge delta exists despite the fact that the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 use the same advanced Qualcomm X12 modem.\nMORE: Why You Might Want to Skip iPhone 7 and Wait for 8\nWhy would Apple possibly throttle its own phone? Perhaps to make the device's performance more consistent across carriers. The iPhone 7 for AT&T uses a slower Intel LTE modem that's capable of 450 megabits per second speeds, while the X12 modem on the Verizon model has a theoretical max of 600 Mbps.\nApple didn't deny that it might be throttling its own phone, telling Bloomberg only that the \"iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple's wireless performance standards.\" The spokesperson added that \"there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\nThat may well be true, but it's important to note that Apple is comparing only iPhones to iPhones across networks and not handsets from other manufacturers.\nIn a follow-up story, sources told Recode that Apple did in fact throttle the Qualcomm modem on the Verizon iPhone 7 in order keep the different versions of the phone \"as similar as possible.\" Apple has another motive: to realize the cost savings of having two chip suppliers.\nRecode went on to say that it would be difficult to know how well the iPhone 7 would perform if the Qualcomm modem was used to its full potential because one doesn't exist. But the Galaxy S7's much better performance on the same network seems like a pretty good clue.\nA phone's 4G LTE throughput is only one aspect of a its performance. The overall speed, camera quality and battery life are all important. But consumers should be able to get the most out of Verizon's network, especially given that its plans tend to cost more than that of the competition.\nSee also : The Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) Best iOS Games - Top Rated Games by Category 29 Hidden iOS 10 Features You Need to Try 11 Weirdly Awesome (and Useful) Gifts",

      "text": "Glossy Black Galaxy S7 Reportedly In The Works  00 PST \nOne of the most popular options for Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus right now would be the Jet Black finish . This is despite the fact that this would result in a phone that is a fingerprint magnet, and also prone to scratching to the point where even Apple recommends that users buy a case to protect it . The things we do in the name of aesthetics, right? \nThat being said, it seems that Samsung could have something similar planned for the Galaxy S7 as well. According to a report from The Investor in Korea, word has it that Samsung has a glossy black finish planned for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. At the moment there is a black version offered by Samsung in the form of the Onyx Black which has kind of a matte finish to it, so presumably this new version will offer a more shiny surface similar to the iPhone 7’s Jet Black. \nFor those wondering why Samsung is still messing around with color options for the Galaxy S7 at this stage of the game, it is because the Note 7 has been officially discontinued which means that for 2016, the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are the only flagship phones that are being offered by the company. \nThe color options, like blue coral version that was recently launched are ways to keep the phone fresh and to keep customers interested. No word on when this glossy black Galaxy S7 will be launched, but hopefully it will be soon. \nFiled in Cellphones > Rumors . Read more about Galaxy S7 and Samsung . Key Specs",

The kicker: There's not a single ornament, light, or strand of tinsel on it. Claridge's Christmas tree. Claridge's \nIve and his designer partner Marc Newson focused instead, they said, on centering an immersive experience around the tree that makes it feel like guests are walking through a snow-covered forest. \nRelated: The Holly and the Ive-y: Apple's Design Guru Has a Christmas Surprise \n\"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,\" the design duo said in a statement. \"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\" \nThe exclusive — and frequently over-the-top — holiday tree has been a Claridge's tradition for the past seven years, with designers such as Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry's Christopher Bailey having the honor in previous years. \nSo there you have it. Don't feel like digging out a dusty box of ornaments? Tell everyone you're taking your Christmas cues this year from Apple's design genius. Alyssa Newcomb ",

      "text": "Apple is apparently preparing to disband its internet router division, with plans to distribute staff to other parts of the company. It seems that the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and the AirPort Time Capsule will all be discontinued sooner rather than later.\nIt’s been three years since Apple last launched a new router, so it’s not too surprising to see the company make this decision. However, there will certainly be plenty of users who are disappointed to find that they’ll have to look elsewhere for a replacement when their current AirPort router gives up the ghost.\nApple has been in the process of shutting down its wireless router team for the past year, according to a report from Bloomberg . It’s expected that rather than laying off staff, most people working as part of the team will be reallocated to projects that bring in more revenue, such as the group charged with development of Apple TV.\nMore: Apple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week\nThis isn’t the first example of Apple exiting a particular hardware category in recent months. In June, the company discontinued its Thunderbolt display , which prefaced a collaboration with LG on brand new monitors targeted toward Mac users.\nIt seems feasible that the company could pursue a similar strategy in terms of its router business. By partnering with another outfit that specializes in that area, Apple could offer a router that’s in keeping with the Mac design aesthetic without having to take on the risks and costs associated with a relatively niche product.\nApple is yet to comment on the future of its router business officially, and AirPort products are still available via the company’s official online store. However, it seems like the writing could be on the wall for this particular sector of Apple’s output.\nWatch Apple’s latest product announcements live, right now Apple is making efforts to unify its cloud services into one location Nvidia job listings hint at renewed graphics chip deal with Apple",

      "text": "\nApple reportedly stops making WiFi routers Engadget 8 hrs ago Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget We hope you weren't dead set on getting a new AirPort Extreme any time soon. Bloomberg sources claim that Apple has \"disbanded\" its WiFi router division, quietly ramping it down over the past year as team members joined other divisions (including the Apple TV group). Reportedly, the shutdown is meant to \"sharpen the company's focus\" on those devices that make up the bulk of its revenue. A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the move, but Apple hasn't introduced a new router since 2013 -- it's not as if they had a lot of work on their plate.\nIt's a quiet end for a team that, at one point, was crucial to the proliferation of WiFi. The original AirPort Base Station, along with the first iBook laptop, helped popularize the very concept of wireless networking. Remember a keynote crowd freaking out when Steve Jobs showed that he didn't need an Ethernet cable to surf the web? For a while, Apple was usually one of the first companies to adopt a new WiFi standard -- it would even use draft specs and update once the technology was finished. It also made important strides in networked audio (through the AirPort Express) and fully integrated network backups (Time Capsule).\nHowever, it's not surprising if Apple is bowing out. Much like what we saw when it stopped making displays , the company is facing an increasingly commoditized market where rivals have to compete on purely iterative upgrades like increased coverage . Even speedy 802.11ad WiFi isn't a big selling point. How does Apple stand out (and thus make a profit) when most routers are fast enough, cloud backups are simple and networked audio is just a matter of buying a wireless speaker ? As sad as it might be to see the AirPort line fade away, it's not nearly as important to Apple's success as it once was.\nBloomberg\nGo to MSN Home",

Microsoft CEO laughs at Apple for making iPad Pro like Surface 0 \nTechnically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image Photo by Stephen Brashear, Getty Images \nWords can come back to haunt you. \nSometimes, they even slap you about the chops while sniggering: \"Heh, heh, heh.\" \nAnd so it is that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken some of Tim Cook's words and gently wafted them right back at him. \nIn an interview with the Australian Financial Review , Nadella mused on the increasing success of the Surface. \nHe painted it as an example of Microsoft's risk-taking nature. He also contrasted this attitude with that of his competitors. \n\"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,\" he said. \"Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\" \nActually, it was four years ago. Should you not be familiar with the subtext here, Cook was on a 2012 earnings call when he mused about hybrid computers. He said converging two different products involved too many trade-offs. \nThen he added , quite immortally: \"You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user.\" \nThis may not have been quite right. Indeed, in its August launch of the iPad Pro, Apple expressly claimed that it was a computer. Which confused a lot of people, as Apple had always insisted it was a tablet.

These analysts don't seem to understand that distinction, but I think they are making a big mistake,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nOppenheimer reiterated a buy rating on Apple on Monday, but said it expects iPhone sales to peak in fiscal year 2018, writing that \"we believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation; instead it will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone.\" \nUltimately, Opco said it expects Apple to \"embark on a decade long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater.\" \nCramer was flabbergasted. David Paul Morris   silhouette of Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc. \"I don't want to fight that tide of potential good news for Apple or for any of these stocks.\" -Jim Cramer \nAside from the fact that Apple could add as much as $40 per share if the government allows its massive overseas cash hoard to repatriate to the U.S. under   , its stock is also insanely cheap at just 10 times 2018 earnings projections. \nCramer was also willing to bet that the company's service stream, with more than 1 billion users, could be gigantic. \nThe downbeat analyst projections affected more than just Apple, too. Last week, there were many downgrades of bank stocks, which have roared since Trump's surprise victory. Regional banks and major banks have been downgraded, as analysts say they have been overvalued and are ahead of themselves. \n\"Despite their monster moves, the banks stocks are so far behind the rest of the market it is almost laughable,\" Cramer said. \nCramer failed to see how banks could be ahead of themselves when they are nowhere near where they used to be, especially with the expectation that Trump will ease regulation, there will be rate hikes. The group is a buy, not a sell, Cramer said. \nGoldman Sachs also downgraded Caterpillar to a sell from a hold because of \"extended commodity infrastructure downturn\" back in January, and provided a price target of $51. Caterpillar closed at $92 on Monday. \n\"I don't want to fight that tide of potential good news for Apple or for any of these stocks,\" Cramer said. \n ",

      "title": "McLaren on Apple talks: company never made ‘definitive proposition’",
      "text": "Reddit \nIn September, a report from the Financial Times suggested Apple was interested in either a ‘strategic investment’ or outright acquisition of McLaren, something that would reportedly get Apple’s codenamed Project Titan back on track. That report itself was followed up with a couple other reports confirming the same news, but now we have word from McLaren itself: Apple never made a ‘definitive proposition’ to the company. \nIt seems Apple was indeed in talks with McLaren to some degree, but any speculation that Apple had made a bid for the company — or proposed a big investment — weren’t accurate. The information comes straight from McLaren Automotive CEO Mike Flewitt, who told Reuters recently: \nThere wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition. \nAnd thusly the reports receive closure. Apple’s own automotive project — dubbed Project Titan — reportedly has been shelved, with Apple ‘rebooting’ the project and laying off workers in the process. Reports have it that Apple is now working on the car project with a new ‘strategy,’ developing technology for autonomous cars rather than trying to develop an entire car itself. \nBefore the layoffs, reports indicated that Apple’s Project Titan had grown to more than 1,000 workers, something itself due to the company’s recruitment efforts. The current state of the project and what it is working on isn’t clear at this time.",

      "title": "Apple uses iPhone 7 to grow smartphone share in Australia: IDC",
      "text": "Beyond cyber espionage lies cyber sabotage and cyber disinformation \nApple's Australian market share grew from 40.41 percent last quarter to 46.42 percent this quarter, thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7 ; however, this represented a year-on-year gain of just 1.23 percent due to the saturation of the Australian market . \n\"As the market matures, incremental innovation will not be enough to drive positive results, as consumers believe the added features do not warrant an upgrade, especially in the high-priced segment,\" IDC Australia market analyst Bilal Javed said. \nSamsung experienced a 6.9 percent drop over the quarter, from 32.89 percent market share last quarter to 26.01 percent this quarter, and down 3.42 percent year on year due to the global recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 . \nDespite this, Samsung continues to enjoy the second-highest smartphone market share in Australia, followed by Alcatel, with 60.2 percent of the market, up 1.9 percent year on year and 0.66 percent quarter on quarter; ZTE, with 5.17 percent market share, up 2.29 percent year on year and 1.64 percent quarter on quarter; Huawei, with 4.92 percent market share, up 2.36 percent year on year and 1.64 percent quarter on quarter; and others including Oppo, with 11.46 percent market share, down 4.36 percent year on year and down 2.75 percent quarter on quarter. (Image: IDC) \n\"Interestingly, the market also saw a rise in shipments from vendors offering devices in the low/mid-priced bracket,\" Javed added. \n\"Shipments were mainly driven through the open market as well as the prepaid channel as established vendors such as Alcatel, Huawei, Motorola, [and] Oppo aim to establish their footprint in Australia.\" \nAccording to Oppo Australia CMO Michael Tran, the Chinese device manufacturer is targeting an increasingly higher percentage of consumers who do not wish to upgrade their high-end devices frequently, and are instead opting for lower-end models, for which Oppo is \"perfectly situated\". \n\"With the Australian market maturing, we're starting to see longer periods between upgrade cycles,\" Tran said in a statement. \n\"What we're seeing is consumers increasingly purchasing low- to mid-tier phones outright on prepaid or SIM-only plans. Those that do want to go down the contract route are also looking at alternative mobile devices, which have lower or zero handset repayment costs and offer greater value.\" \nLast month, IDC reported Oppo topping the Chinese smartphone market , with 20.1 million shipments or 17.5 percent market share, growing by 106 percent year on year. \nOppo was followed in China by Vivo, with 19.2 million shipments or 16.7 percent market share; Huawei, with 18 million shipments or 15.7 percent market share; Xiaomi, with 10 million shipments or 8.7 percent market share; and Apple trailing in fifth place, with 8.2 million shipments or 7.1 percent market share. \n\"Oppo's success is not something that was achieved overnight,\" Xiaohan Tay, senior market analyst for Client Devices Research at IDC APAC, said at the time. \n\"Back in the earlier years, when vendors depended on operator subsidy to grow, Oppo was clear in its direction and focused on expanding its offline channels. It also had key strengths such as its VOOC fast-charging technology and in the elegant design of its phones. This, coupled with its aggressive marketing tactics, helped it succeed in the market.\" \nIDC on Monday predicted that the used   will grow   thanks to trade-in programs, forecasting that it   in 2020. \nIn Australia, the no-contract sector now makes up 15.4 percent of the mobile market , up from 11.9 percent last year, while post-paid is down from 55.6 percent to 53.4 percent and prepaid from 32.6 percent to 31.2 percent, according to market research company Kantar. \nIn terms of carrier market share in Australia, Kantar reported that Telstra increased by 0.2 percent to hold 39.9 percent of the total mobile market. \nTelstra was followed by Optus, which holds 22.3 percent of the market, up by 0.9 percent; Vodafone Hutchison Australia holds 14.9 percent, down 0.2 percent; other mobile virtual network operators account for 7.5 percent, down 1.1 percent; Virgin Mobile holds 5.2 percent, down 0.5 percent; Amaysim holds 4.9 percent, up 0.3 percent; Aldi Mobile holds 3 percent, up 0.8 percent; TPG holds 2.7 percent, down 0.6 percent; and Boost Mobile holds 0.7 percent of the market, up 0.1 percent.

      "text": "Jony Ive no longer involved in Apple physical hardware design in the same capacity? Jony Ive no longer involved in Apple physical hardware design in the same capacity? Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + In the latest episode of long-time Apple blogger John Gruber's Talk Show, guesting SixColors founder Jason Snell briefly touched on design chief Jony Ive's current role in the Cupertino company. Mr. Snell has heard that that Jony Ive is currently not as involved in physical hardware design as he used to be. Rather, he's been largely focused on architecture matters, such as Apple's \"spaceship\" campus and the company's retail stores. He's working closely with Apple retail executive Angela Arhendts on these cases.If true, this means that Jony Ive won't directly mastermind the rumored all-screen iPhone 8. Scheduled for 2017, the device is said to have an OLED display with an embedded touch-based haptic home button. Meanwhile, some argue that the recently released \"Designed by Apple in California\" photo book is part of Ive's prolonged retirement. For example, he's been seen very little in Apple advertising in the past few years, mostly being present as a background voice for product design movies shown at keynotes. He's also not attending all Apple events, despite his high-level position of Chief Design Officer.As with all internal Apple matters, it's hard to be absolutely sure about anything. Still, even if Jony Ive is no longer crafting iPhones by himself, his work for Apple over the past 20 years will leave a lasting legacy for the company's design team to follow. ALSO READ",

      "text": "No 32 GB RAM New MacBook Pro Option? That's Because It Would've Reduced Battery Life, Apple Says 21 November 2016, 8:24 pm EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior VP for marketing, has explained the absence of a 32 GB RAM MacBook Pro. According to him, such a model would have required a different logic board design that posed a risk of reducing battery life.   Apple's new MacBook Pro lineup has received quite a number of sharp critique lately, with the bulk of acerbic jabs hitting its lack of important ports , its new but somewhat lackluster Touch Ba r, the absence of newer Intel Kaby Lake processors on the machines and the lack of a 32 GB RAM option. The new MacBook Pro models plateau at 16 GB, which is rather measly for labor-intensive programs to be likely utilized by creative professionals, one of the main demographics Apple is marketing the machine toward. A 32 GB RAM Option Would Reduce Battery Life Phil Schiller, Apple's senior VP for worldwide marketing, has continuously defended aspects of the new machines, which are often the target of criticism issued by several people and publications. According to MacRumors, Schiller has allegedly issued a response to an email from Ben Slaney, a software developer, explaining why the new MacBook Pro lineup doesn't go beyond 16 GB of RAM. According to Schiller, a 32 GB configuration would have translated to a different logic board design for the MacBook Pro, which in turn will put battery capacity at risk. \"To support 32 GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life,\" Schiller's alleged response reads. Intel Processors Powering New MacBook Pro Doesn't Support LPDDR4 Slaney has written an article deftly detailing the MacBook Pro's RAM configuration. The new machines use an enhanced version of DDR3 RAM, LPDDR3E, which can only be as high as 16 GB. If the MacBook included a 32 GB RAM option, it would have forced Apple to use a different type of RAM called DDR4, the low-power version of which, the LPDDR4, isn't supported by Intel's sixth-generation processors inside the 2016 MacBook Pro models. Furthermore, using the iStats Menus tool, Slaney was able to determine that, under normal conditions, the LPDDR3E RAM only uses 1.5 watts, while other notebooks with DDR4 RAM use around 3 to 5 watts of power. So there you have it. The new MacBook pro models don't come with a 32 GB RAM option because Apple found it unwise to potentially reduce the machine's battery life. Additionally, if Apple opted for LPDDR4 RAM, Skylake would have been absent from the machines. \nWhile the lack of a 32 GB RAM option will frustrate some folks apprehensive on getting the new MacBook Pro model, Apple undoubtedly opted for a better trade-off in this situation, prioritizing battery life foremost. That said, the new MacBook Pro's battery life isn't really that excellent, proving to be underwhelming when compared with older MacBook models. You can just imagine how fast a theoretical 32 GB RAM MacBook Pro would power down.  ",

(Credit: Carl Court/Getty Images) × Apple offers free battery replacement for iPhone 6S shutdown problem The Apple logo is displayed on the back of an iPhone on August 3, 2016 in London, England. (Credit: Carl Court/Getty Images) \nHONG KONG — Apple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n“A very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. It didn’t provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple’s battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease”— when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.

The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple’s battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease”— when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.

      "text": "11/21/16 AT 9:19 PM Close \nApple confirmed over the weekend that some iPhone 6s users from China were experiencing unexplained battery issues. This past Sunday, the tech giant launched a program allowing affected customers to get the battery replaced for free. \nApple first started receiving reports of the issue last week from a Chinese consumer-protection group. Users said that their iPhone 6s units began spontaneously shutting down on their own even when they still have 50 percent of battery life left. Their devices would only turn on when it’s been plugged into a wall adapter, according to CNET . \nApple has acknowledged that only a limited number of iPhone 6s units are affected by the problem. The tech giant said on its battery replcaement program page that the only iPhone 6s units affected by this issue were manufactured between September and October 2015. Apple also made it clear that this is not a safety issue unlike what happened with Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7. \nApple didn’t specify when it found out about the problem, how it knew it was related to the batteries or how it determined which iPhone 6s devices are affected by the issue, according to the Wall Street Journal . This also marks the second time that Apple offered a free battery replacement program for its iPhones. Related Stories How To Get A Cheap iPhone On Black Friday \nFor users who may have problematic iPhone 6s devices, they should contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider, an Apple Retail Store or the Apple Technical Support online to know if their iPhone 6s device is eligible for the free battery replacement. Customers will have to visit one of those service providers in person, so that their iPhone 6s can be examined. Apple also warned users that mobile carriers are not participating in the battery replacement program. \nUsers are also reminded to back up their data via iTunes or iCloud, turn off the Find My iPhone feature and then erase all data on their phones to prepare for the battery replacement process. If a user’s iPhone 6s is damaged in a manner that impedes the battery replacement, that must also be fixed but with extra charges. \nThe battery replacement program is available worldwide, but Apple may restrict repairs to the country or region where it was purchased and it doesn’t extend the standard warranty coverage. The program also covers iPhone 6s batteries for three years after the first retail sale of the unit. \nThe battery replacement program was launched just a week after Apple announced the screen repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus flickering display and touch-screen issues, as pointed out by Ars Technica . iPhone 6 Plus users will only have to pay $149 to get their devices fixed as long as the display itself isn’t broken.

      "text": "MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Gets 1/10 Rating From iFixit \nSchiller’s words were very important since they helped clarified the error Slaney made in his attempt to explain why the new models only have a maximum of 16GB of RAM on his site, MacDaddy . Slaney previously claimed that the good explanation why there is no 32GB model was because the LPDDR3E specification tops out at 1866MHz. \nAppleInsider also explained that another reason why the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does not have a 32GB RAM variant is because the Intel Skylake CPUs that came with the new laptop only supports up to 16GB of RAM at 2133MHz. There is hope for MacBooks with 32GB RAM, however, since the Cupertino giant is reportedly looking into using Intel’s Kaby Lake processors for its next laptops. \nThe advantage of using LPDDR3E RAM at this point is found on the power consumption of the Mac laptops. The new MacBook Pro could last for up to 30 days of standby time. On the contrary, if Apple used DDR4 RAM, the laptops could barely last for less than 7 days even on standby mode.

      "text": "Apple’s executive ranks are still overwhelmingly white and male Change is slow going at Apple, according to new data filed with the U.S. government. share Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images Even tech companies with a commitment to boosting the diversity of their workforce are finding gains hard to come by. A case in point is Apple. The iPhone maker released new data Monday night showing that the company’s highest ranks remain even more white and male than the company as a whole. Just 20 of Apple’s top 107 executives are women, according to a government filing, while only five are from underrepresented minority groups (defined as black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander). Another 14 executives are Asian, while the remaining 88 are white. Those numbers are roughly unchanged from a year ago. In the next layer of management, women made up 27 percent of the workforce. More than 65 percent of those managers and mid-level executives are white, 23 percent are Asian, with just 11 percent from underrepresented minority groups and 1 percent who define themselves as multiracial. As with the executive ranks, those numbers are little different than they were in 2015. The data is included in a form known as the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Even while publicly sharing the data, Apple has said that the EEOC data doesn’t reflect how the company itself breaks down its workforce, and is not the way it measures its diversity progress. In August, Apple released its last public numbers , noting that 32 percent of its workforce was female and 22 percent of employees were from underrepresented minorities. The numbers, which represented slight increases from 2015, reflect global hiring for women, and only the U.S. with regard to underrepresented minorities. Apple In terms of new hires, Apple’s figures were higher than its workforce as a whole, with 37 percent being women and 27 percent being from underrepresented minorities. (The data used for both the EEOC and Apple’s companywide diversity report covers the same time period.) But if Apple’s gains are small, at least it’s moving in the right direction. Microsoft, by contrast, released figures last week showing that the overall number of women at the company dropped in 2016 for the second year in a row . Microsoft blamed layoffs in its phone unit for the decline. The total number of black and Latino employees at Microsoft did go up compared to last year, but just barely. And at least Microsoft and Apple continue to share their data. While many tech companies started sharing diversity reports several years ago, many have yet to offer updates this year, and fewer still have shared this year’s EEO-1 filing. The EEOC, meanwhile, has used aggregate data to highlight that whites, men and Asians are overrepresented in high-tech jobs, while women, blacks and Latinos are less present in the high-tech industry than in the workforce as a whole. While Apple is ahead of many peers in its percentage of women, and a leader in terms of employing underrepresented minorities, it has not been immune to criticism. Earlier this year, reports from Mic and Gizmodo raised allegations that some corners of Apple were home to a significantly sexist culture. In an exclusive interview with Recode , Apple HR chief Denise Young Smith said the incidents described in the articles didn’t reflect the Apple she knows, but that the company did investigate, adding that “commensurate actions have been taken.” Such actions can range from an informal conversation to dismissal, and Apple didn’t disclose what actions it took. Here is Apple’s 2016 form: And for comparison purposes, here is the 2015 form: And the one from 2014: recode_divider More From Recode",

This, along with a few other reasons, has created something of a backlash among developers and creative professionals who argue that Apple's new notebooks are overpriced and under-powered.\nEven though Apple's 2017 MacBook Pro update will reportedly include a price reduction and support for 32GB of RAM , and even though Apple's new laptops are reportedly selling like hotcakes, there remains a vocal minority of users who still can't wrap their collective heads around the fact that Apple, in 2016, would release a Pro level laptop with no upgrade option for 32GB of memory.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nPick up Apple’s base level MacBook Pro for $100 off at Amazon Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 ",

      "text": "** 40% off for limited time! **** BEST OF 2015 APP BY APPLE **** FEATURED WORLDWIDE 2015, 2016 AS \"BEST NEW APPS\" BY APPLE **Stay Inspired.There is a whole world that we get from images. A single picture can fill us with inspiration which, in turn, brings us joy. Such impressions grow to create wonder and amazement for the world. That growth and creation is made possible by you. And Pixave is here to store and organize those inspired moments - to enable you to bring them to mind whenever, wherever you are.A beautiful workspace, more powerful than beforePixave is the ultimate image organizer. The updated version includes the new Light/Dark user interface with the Collection now supporting auto-import, while the Smart Collection and System Collection has become more powerful and refined, providing this new version with an even more convenient and user-friendly workspace. You will be amazed at such useful features. Pixave’s innovative and useful workspace lays the groundwork for you to draw inspiration, unhindered, from your images - because your inspirations are precious and beautiful.More Formats!Pixave supports common image formats such as GIF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PNG, TIFF, ICNS, AI, PSD, EPS (included PDF info only), PDF, TGA, SVG, BMP, ICO, Camera RAW , as well as document formats from Mac Graphic Killer applications such as *Affinity Designer, *Affinity Photo, *Pixelmator, *Sketch, *Audodesk Graphic, *Acorn document. And now, even more formats are supported: TrueType® Font, OpenType® Font, MOV, M4V, MP4, MPO (Multiple Picture Object Image), DAE for 3D Objects, OBJ files, *Apple Pages, *Numbers, *Keynote, *iBook Author, *MS Word, *Excel, *PowerPoint. Also the popular Mac software *OmniGraffle, *MindNode, *Comic Life 3, *Napkin, *Flinto, *iThoughtsX, *Principle, *Art Text 3 document are supported. (formats with “*” requires the relevant app to be already installed)AutomationSpecified media, along with tag information, can now be automatically imported from a designated folder. To import, images no longer need to be dragged, images no longer need to be clicked to apply tags, and image types no longer need to be separately categorized. Just place your desired files into the designated folder and Pixave will automatically import the selected media and automatically apply selected tags. Now importing media is taken care of automatically. How convenient!Easy TaggingAdding and searching for tags is a piece of cake. Many tags can be applied immediately to a number of images, and can be searched for along with its tag. Pixave’s new Tag system really is quite something. During import, not only are the keywords included in the image identified and automatically added to the tag, but tags added by the user can also be very easily applied. For tagging, simply drag the tag to an image or vice versa. This way of adding new tags or searching for tags provides a fresh approach in accessing them. Beware to not become overwhelmed by the incredible new tagging interface – the ability to apply numerous tags simultaneously to numerous images.Enhanced Web CapturePixave’s web capturing capabilities have evolved. Now, the website that you wish to capture can be captured while interchanging freely between desktop and mobile modes. Pixave’s web capture also provides iPhone, iPad, as well as Landscape options for easy and flexible capture. Additionally, webpage resources can be directly downloaded as well - this feature enables you to directly import any graphic elements that you see on a website into Pixave with Web Browser ExtensionsExciting ExportEven exporting has evolved. Alongside the basic function of exporting according to image type, you can also adjust the image size in set increments, customize the file naming pattern and apply Watermarks. Tags you have inserted and managed are now also included within the image during export. And the ability to create ePub files is, no doubt, a bonus.

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — During the American presidential campaign, president-elect Donald Trump complained that the United States had lost too many manufacturing jobs and promised to force big companies such as Apple to bring that work home. \"I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,\" he said.\nFor a host of reasons, Apple is unlikely to produce iPhones in the U.S. But opening a smartphone factory is not the only way to provide solid employment for working-class Americans who lack college degrees.\nApple's overall contribution to the U.S. economy is significant. Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the U.S., it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads.\nApple's rapid growth in central Texas, where it employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world's largest technology company and their economic impact.\nAt Apple's sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company's vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them.\nEmployees help run Apple's iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company's U.S. operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple's products.\nThe Austin campus — the company's largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. — offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-storey cafeteria that serves an abundance of food, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy.\nAlthough contractors at the Austin technical support call centre earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call centre employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year.\n\"Apple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 per cent increase in our employee teams,\" the company said in a statement. \"We made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centres for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\"\nAbout 1½ kilometres from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple's Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware.\nFlex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion.\nApple could in theory build more products in the U.S. through contractors such as Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labour make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand.\nLarger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer.\n\"It's easy to ship a phone, and it's harder to ship a computer,\" said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. \"And it's harder still for cars and refrigerators.\"\nThe New York Times",

The company declined to comment on the matter. \nApple's wireless router lineup includes the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule, which sell for $99, $199, and $299, respectively. All are said to have lagged behind other top router manufacturers in the adoption of new standards. \nCombined with Apple Watch and Apple TV sales, the wireless router lineup generated $11.1 billion and 5 percent of sales for Apple in fiscal 2016.",

      "text": "4 comments \nFittingly, James Whale’s Frankenstein turned 85 years old today. \nMany of the monsters in Universal’s oeuvre were both misunderstood and tragic figures, and none moreso than Frankenstein. The creation of a same-named mad scientist, Frankenstein just wanted to fit in and be treated like everyone else, but sometimes the world is just too cruel for such acceptance. Thanks to this new commercial from Apple, however, Frankie finally receives the warm welcome he’s always yearned for. \nIn the two-minute ad, which will surely be cut down significantly for TV, Frankenstein leaves his solitary hideout and heads out into the world in an effort to spread some holiday cheer; though things initially go about as sour as you’d expect, all it takes is one little girl to turn everything around. Thankfully, unlike in the original film, Frankenstein doesn’t toss her into the water. \nThe touching ad, titled “Frankie’s Holiday,” stars Brad Garrett as the monster. It’s amusing to remind that Garrett and the late Peter Boyle played father-and-son in “Everybody Loves Raymond,” because Boyle of course played Frankenstein’s monster in Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein ! \nNow more than ever, open your heart to EVERYONE.",

By Nov. 21, 2016 5:47 p.m. ET Text Size Large Beginning this week, Mac users will be able to shop with ApplePay. Illustration: Apple \nApple will be celebrating the iPhone’s tenth birthday in June 2017. One analyst uses the approaching milestone to assess Apple’s next decade, and he’s not optimistic about the company’s future. \n“We believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (artificial intelligence, cloud-based services, messaging); instead [it] will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone,” writes Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst with Oppenheimer. \nUerkwitz says that Apple will likely have shipped 1.2 billion iPhones by the time the smartphone’s tenth birthday arrives next year. \nBut, he adds: “We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.” \nSuch frank and long-term talk is rare on Wall Street, where analysts tend to focus on quarter-by-quarter changes and rarely criticize a company’s overall mission. \nBut Apple seems to be at a critical point in its evolution. The company suffered its first sales decline in 15 years during the just ended fiscal year. In the fourth-quarter, Apple sold fewer units across the board -- the number of iPhones, iPads, and Macs sold all fell. \nMuch of Wall Street remains optimistic, especially as Apple grows its so-called services business -- subscriptions to offerings like iCloud and Apple Music. But in each of those areas, Apple faces tough competition from the likes of Dropbox (storage) and Spotify (music). And Apple has yet to give consumers a real reason to switch to its ecosystem, which gets back to Uerkwitz’s critique. \nBig Picture: Apple is at a turning point, as the iPhone approaches its tenth birthday. One analyst says: “We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.” \nMore from Barron’s Next:",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Oppenheimer & Co .’s Andrew Uerkwitz today reiterates a “Perform” rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), writing that the company “lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),” and as a result, “Over the next decade we believe the stock will generally underperform the market.”\n“We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise ,” concludes Uerkwitz.\nWe believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater. However, we believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last “growth” hurrah from the tenth anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company. Our Perform rating is unchanged for now.\n(Contrast this report with the bullish note today from Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley .)\nApple shares are up $1.66, or 1.5%, at $111.72.\nBy June 29th of next year, writes Uerkwitz, the iPhone will be ten years old, Apple will have sold 1.2 billion units, and sales will probably “peak” at 245 million, he thinks, which he refers to as the first “ crack ” in its empire. Prices may even peak, with the next model, he thinks, as “fewer hardware breakthroughs are available today that can trigger favorable mix shift.”\nNor is he impressed with Apple’s software and its services offerings. Even though they are “the most effective defense from competition,” he thinks there’s “plenty of competitors that can seriously harm Apple’s ecosystem with software and services.”\n“We believe the cracks are showing in the Apple wall of invulnerability,” he writes.\nDespite Apple’s great effort at plugging holes with thumbs (inducing favorable mix shift and higher ASP), we see iPhone unit growth dropping to low single-digits in the next four years (FY16- FY20) at a CAGR of 2%. We believe that fewer new user additions and a more diversified installed base will significantly impact the sustainability and consistency of iPhone shipment growth in the next five years. We present our estimated installed base growth trajectory from 2016 to 2020 as follows.\nThat model shows the installed base rising from 677 million as of the fiscal year that ended in September, to 943 million by the end of 2020.\nTo Uerkwitz, the 8% decline in shipments this past fiscal year, despite a rise in installed base, was “the dual impact of lower new user additions and an elongated replacement cycle ─the two headwinds often go together as the result of a weaker product cycle.”\nAs subsidies dry up , and as features become not as impressive at the high end of the smartphone market, growth is slowing overall for the most expensive devices, including the iPhone, and “the high-end smartphone segment is slowing down faster than other segments, due to the closing performance gap between lower end phones and higher end phones.”\nAnd India , he believes, can’t pick up the slack, as “emerging regions such as India and Southeast Asia still have the market potential given their low 4G penetration and large population, but iPhones’ premium pricing may prohibit much near-term revenue upside from those emerging areas.”\nAnd new categories seem to have dried up for Apple, he believes: “We believe in the near term it is very difficult to find anything bigger than the iPhone or iPad. Moreover, it is increasingly difficult to build on the proven success of current devices by filling the gaps with different sized displays and add-on functionalities.”\nIn Steve Jobs’ words, a computer is “a bicycle for our minds”; desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones are simply different forms of that bicycle. We are confident in saying that the need for such a bicycle is here to stay, but the question is: what form will it take after the smartphone? It could be an earpiece, it could a pair of glasses, it could be a watch, and it could be some electronics to be embedded in our bodies. We believe the third option is the most likely in the near term, for its market potential, feasibility, and strategic fit with Apple’s identity. A head-mounted computing device can introduce a new paradigm for human computing interface, something Apple is the most adept at. Bottom Line We believe there are only a few product categories for Apple to enter in order to resume growth when the iPhone slows down. Head-mounted displays, or AR/VR headsets, have the most potential, but near-term technical hurdles are also substantial for these devices to become a mass-market success.\nAs for software, he argues apps may fade, as more and more popular services can be used in a number of ways, such as by messaging. “One will no longer just be able to order an Uber via a smartphone app, but be able to do it through messaging or voice activated speaker or any device that is connected to the cloud – and all without “downloading” a native app.”\nAnd Apple is losing the battle for A.I., he believes, which is becoming “the new operating system, the new interface”:\nApple (Siri), Facebook (bots), Google (Google Assistant), Amazon (Alexa), and Microsoft (Cortana) have showed us a glimpse of the future. In this AI-dominated future, apps, apps- turned-platforms, and mobile operating systems may all disappear into the background, “hide” inside the microphone arrays, or show up as a contact on your messenger app. It could be everywhere─Siri is still working when users are silently swiping their phones, giving restaurant recommendations and triggering review apps when it notices users are planning a dinner date in chat. Facebook apps and the Google Assistant app could do the same, on both iOS and Android platforms, removing the operating system’s role as the glue of all apps, services, and people on one’s social network. Apple originally had a two- to three-year head start on AI with the acquisition of Siri. But Siri’s development since Apple took over in late 2011 is best characterized as sluggish. It took Apple almost five years to open up Siri to third-party developers (a critical move to make it more usable by more people). Amazon and Google released products recently that are highly competitive, if not superior to Siri, and with broader support to third-party services and devices. The same disappointment can be found in many other native apps: iOS-Music, Camera/Photos, and iMessage all had years of head start, but only received key improvements as a reaction to superior third-party apps and services. Apple never seems to maintain its dominating lead in hardware in its software and services. But software and services will play a heavier role in the future of mobile user experience […] With the trends above, Apple may lose its edge as a leading innovator for interface.",

      "text": "Apple's top management largely white and male, but overall workforce trending toward diversity By Monday, November 21, 2016, 08:22 pm PT (11:22 pm ET) Apple on Monday quietly released employment diversity statistics current as of July 2016, revealing high level executive and management positions are overwhelmingly filled by white males. The results outlined in Apple's EEO-1 Federal Employer Information Report ( PDF link ) are largely unchanged from last year despite a very public push for diversity in the workplace. It appears progress is being made below the company's upper echelons, however. Specifically, 73 of Apple's top 107 executives and senior officials and management are white males. Only 20 females, 15 of whom are white, fill those seats. Last year only one Hispanic or latino employee —one man —was among Apple's top ranks, a number that increased to two people this year. Another 14 senior staff members are Asian, up from 12 in 2015, while 3 are black or African American. In the tier below, first and middle manager positions are likewise dominated by white males. Some 48 percent are white men, while another 18 percent are white women. Here, minorities have a modicum of representation, with 23 percent reported as Asian, 7 percent Hispanic or Latino, 4 percent black and 1 percent listed as multiracial. Pacific Islanders represent under 1 percent of the category. Apple is making gains toward a more ethnically diverse workforce, however. Over the past year, net Asian hires were up by 2,455 people, while the number of Hispanic and black employees ticked up 951 and 783, respectively. The company added 226 white employees over the same period. As it has done with previous EEO-1 reports, Apple notes statistics relayed through the required government form are inferior to its own internal metrics on diversity. \"The EEO-1 has not kept pace with changes in industry or the American workforce over the past half century. We believe the information we report elsewhere on this site is a far more accurate reflection of our progress toward diversity.\" Like many Silicon Valley tech companies, Apple is facing external pressure to bring more diversity to its team, especially top-level leadership positions. To that end, the company launched an \"Inclusion & Diversity\" campaign lauded by top executives, the most vocal being CEO Tim Cook. Apple also curates employment statistics for public viewing, as well as stories of select staff members, on a dedicated webpage . Currently posted metrics show slight improvements in hiring practices as part of an overall upward trend toward a more diverse workforce. Apple says 37 percent of new global hires are female, while women account for 32 percent of the company's existing employees. In the U.S., underrepresented minorities account for 27 percent of new hires. Further, Apple this past year identified and closed pay gaps to reach pay equity between men and women in the U.S. The company is currently analyzing salaries, bonuses and annual stock grants of employees worldwide, promising to fix any gaps that are discovered.

      "title": "Apple Offers $149 to Fix iPhone 6 Models With Touch Screen Failures",
      "text": "NEWS ANALYSIS: Apple has started a program to fix iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus handsets with so called \"touch disease\" failures for $149. When Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices started showing up with a strange failure mode earlier this year, users were mystified at first. The problem, which soon became known as “touch disease,” emerged when handsets stopped responding to touch commands and a flickering gray bar appeared at the top of the screen. The details of smartphone failures were first described in detail by iFixit, an electronics repair website. Initially, Apple’s response to iPhone owners who experienced the problem when their phones were out of warranty was an offer to sell them a replacement phone at an out-of-warranty price, usually around $349. Now, Apple has introduced a program to fix phones for a lower price, $149 . The Touch Disease issue with the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus is a direct result of the light, flexible construction of the handset's case which allowed the phone to bend in normal use, such as when stowing in phone in trouser pockets or handbags. The case's lack of strength and resulting flexibility is the apparent cause of Touch Disease.The flexing apparently causes two “Touch IC” chips inside the phone to break free from the phone’s system board. Once the connections break, the phone can no longer sense pressure on the screen and it stops responding.“For quite a long time Apple wasn’t able to repair those phones,” said Julia Bluff, director of advocacy for iFixit. “It requires a board level repair specialist,” Bluff explained. “You had to replace those Touch IC chips. Apple can’t do that. Apple wasn’t giving consumers any options other than buying an out of warranty replacement unit,” something that didn't sit well with many users. Bluff said that at this point, it’s not clear whether Apple has begun repairing those iPhones, or simply replacing them with other units with the same design weakness. But she noted that independent repair shops have developed methods of repairing the dead iPhones so they won’t fail again by adding some shielding that also protects the Touch IC chips. “There used to be a shield to provide protection,” Bluff noted, “but they don’t have that in the 6 or 6s.” The obvious question for folks with an iPhone 6 Plus or 6s Plus is what to do if your phone hasn’t started giving any trouble. Basically there are three options. One is to sell or trade in your phone now while you still can and buy something else, perhaps an iPhone 7 Plus. Another option is to wait for the failure to happens, which then gives the owner the choice of going to Apple to fix or exchange your phone or having a repair shop fix it. Taking it to an independent repair shop likely means that your phone will actually be repaired and made stronger so it won’t break again. But that means paying to fix a phone that you bought only recently. How did Apple let this happen?“I think Apple dropped the ball. It’s a design flaw,” said Alan Zeichick, principal analyst for Camden Associates. “There’s no reason if the phone was properly designed that this would happen.” Zeichick said that because it was Apple’s poor design, that the company should replace the phones with units that don’t have the flaw. “This should be an out of warranty replacement,” Zeichick said. Zeichick noted that other iPhones have had similar problems and that in those cases the devices were simply replaced. The original iPhone 5 had a problem where in some cases the batteries would start to swell and lift the screen away from the smartphone's face, he explained, adding that his phone at the time was replaced.“This should not be at any cost to the customer. It’s a design flaw or a faulty component,” he said. What concerns several observers is that similar problems keep happening. When the iPhone 6 Plus bending problem appeared, for example, perhaps Apple should have beefed up the design of the case. But there have been a series of such problems.“As Apple steps up its battles with Samsung, it needs to step up its game in terms of quality,” Zeichick said. He pointed to “bendgate”, touch disease, the iPhone 4 antennas. ;“They need to get their designs better. Samsung is going to figure this out. They’re not going to make a rookie mistake like the Note 7 again,” Zeichick sand. “Apple has to get this right.” At this point, it’s not clear why it took Apple so long to recognize that Touch Disease is a real problem. Perhaps it’s because the company didn’t have a good way to fix the failing phones and saw selling replacements as the only options. It may also be that Apple’s executives really believe that the company has the best products available and didn’t foresee the need for a fix to products that had been bending since day one. It appears that Apple is accumulating a long list of problems that it needs to design out of existence. And it needs to use that improved design to rebuild confidence in its smartphones. As Peachick puts it, “Apple is running out of chances.”",

      "text": "Photo by think4photop / Shutterstock.com \nApple is offering a free replacement to customers whose iPhone batteries are malfunctioning. \nSome iPhone 6S devices are going black and powering themselves off on their own due to defective batteries. Although Apple says the battery issue poses no safety concerns, the tech giant is offering free battery replacement on impacted devices. \nApple says the battery malfunction that causes phones to unexpectedly shut down only affects “a very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015. \nIf you have experienced sudden shutdowns on your iPhone 6S, Apple says you should stop by an Apple store or an Apple-authorized service provider and have them check your phone’s serial number. \nIf you experienced shutdown issues and already paid for and replaced your iPhone 6S battery, the tech giant wants you to contact them at the Apple website to request a refund. \nAlthough the battery replacement on affected phones is free of charge, Apple says anything that impairs the battery replacement — like a cracked phone screen — “will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement.” \nAccording to Ars Technica , the China Consumers Association first identified the problem — which can cause a sudden phone shutdown once the battery charge dips to between 50 and 60 percent — and asked Apple to investigate it last week. \nIt’s unknown how many Apple devices are affected by the faulty batteries. \nApple is not the only manufacturer to have issues with its phones. Just last month, Samsung ceased production and sales of its popular Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after the device’s battery was blamed for some phones overheating or exploding . \nWhat kind of smartphone do you have? Have you had any issues with it?  ",

      "title": "Future of Apple Pay Australia still unresolved",
      "text": "  \nMore than two years after Apple launched Apple Pay, only one of Australia’s big four banks – the ANZ – has adopted the digital payments platform.   \nThe country’s other three major banks are still waiting on a ruling from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC ) on their request to be allowed to collectively negotiate with, but also boycott, Apple on a number of fronts. \nThey maintain that Apple’s determination to control access to, and the use of, the near field communications (NFC) chip – which is key to secure contactless payment – in the iPhone limits consumer choice and that, in any case, their customers should not be charged extra payment fees by Apple to use its digital payments platform. \nThe ACCC declined to give the banks interim authority to proceed, instead giving itself more time to weigh up the arguments. A draft decision is expected any day, with a final announcement in early 2017. \nIn the meantime, payments specialist Cuscal has said it has worked with Apple so that 31 of its clients – Australia’s smaller banks and credit unions – will be able to give their customers access to Apple Pay. \nCuscal managing director Craig Kennedy said: “Our clients were clear that they wanted their customers to be able to use Apple Pay.” \nThe company has now updated the digital wallet it supplies to clients to allow them to offer their customers Apple Pay. Read more about mobile payments Samsung Pay is being used by about five million people in the US and South Korea , with China being the next step in its global launch. Barclays Bank brings Apple Pay to its customers nine months after its main competitors , with the announcement of its support of the app. \nReferring to the security and privacy claims that Apple makes about its service, Cuscal noted that the card numbers used to effect payments were not stored on the device or on Apple servers. However, that underpinning security is not delivered by Apple, but through a tokenisation service that is delivered by major credit card issuers such as Visa and MasterCard. Each time a transaction is made, a unique token is issued by their networks that allows the payment to be completed securely. \nAmerican Express offers a similar service and it, along with ANZ, were the first organisations to allow their customers to use Apple Pay in Australia. Since then, it has been a slog for the computer giant to gain further traction. \nAnd it’s not as if Australians don’t like tap-and-go payments. According to the RFI Group, almost three out of five Australians have used a contactless card to make a payment. However, only one in 10 have used a mobile wallet. \nThe ongoing wrangle between the banks and Apple is likely to sour future relations regardless of the ACCC’s decision. It could also encourage the banks to focus on NFC-enabled Android phones as a digital payments platform. \nIn Australia’s case, that might make a lot of sense. According to research company Kantar, in the three months to September, Android phones’ share of the Australian market rose to almost 60%. Although the launch of the iPhone 7 did give Apple a sales spurt, its market share for the quarter was 37%. CW+ Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join. E-Zine",

      "text": "Apple to hold one-day Black Friday sales event after skipping 2015 By Monday, November 21, 2016, 09:19 pm PT (12:19 am ET) Apple late Monday night posted a webpage teasing an upcoming one-day shopping event set for Black Friday, suggesting the company is reinstating its seasonal sale. Light on information, Apple's Black Friday Special Offers webpage simply advertises a forthcoming \"shopping event\" scheduled for Friday, Nov. 25. Known as Black Friday, the date traditionally sees retailers slash prices on goods, marking the start to the holiday shopping season. \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list,\" Apple says. Apple previously participated in the annual consumer tradition by extending conservative sale prices on select merchandise, including popular products like iPad and Mac. The company decided to scale back offers to bundled gift cards in 2013 , then went back to device discounts for the 2014 holiday. Apple nixed Black Friday promotions altogether in 2015. While pricing and availability has yet to be announced, Apple is advertising free two-day delivery on in-stock items ordered through its online store by 5:00 p.m. Customers often take advantage of Apple's generous shipping rates to check off last-minute gifts. The Black Friday webpage also includes links to curated Holiday Gift collections for Apple products, Music gifts, photography accessories and games and toys. Those looking for stocking stuffers are provided a link to purchase Apple gift cards. Apple's deals are not expected to outclass those from authorized resellers and retail channel vendors. For example, AppleInsider readers can already enjoy slashed Touch Bar MacBook Pro prices from Adorama and iPhone 7, MacBook Pro and iMac hardware discounts from B&H Photo . Make sure to check out AppleInsider's Price Guides for the latest deals. Topics:",

      "text": "10 Comments The engineering team is being disbanded, according to Bloomberg. \nApple may be killing off its Wi-Fi router business, according to a report that suggests the engineers who develop them are being reassigned to other divisions within the company. \nApple's Wi-Fi routers include the AirPort Express , a $99 white box that has been redesigned several times since its introduction in 2004. Its last refresh was in 2013, however, and Bloomberg today reports that the team who works on it and other Apple routers has been gradually disbanded over the past year. \nCiting people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg says the decision to disband the team indicates the company doesn't plan to develop new versions of its routers, which also include the AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule. \nApple did not immediatley respond to PCMag's request for comment. // Related Articles Pre-Order $129 'Google Wifi' Router Replacement \nThose pricier devices—up to $400 for the version of the AirPort Time Capsule that includes a 3TB hard drive for backups—were also introduced more than a decade ago during the early years of Wi-Fi adoption. The ubiquity of ISP-provided routers, the rise of the Wi-Fi-connected Internet of Things, and newcomers like Google have all threatened Apple's position in the high-end router market. \nSo have rapidly changing Wi-Fi standards, which Apple has been relatively slow to adopt, instead relying on its routers' easy setup and tight integration with the Mac ecosystem to woo customers. Still, the current versions of the AirPort Extreme and AirPort Time Capsule both include support for dual-band, 1.3Gbps Wi-Fi. \nIf Apple does stop selling its routers, it will follow a recent trend to streamline product offerings and focus on the most profitable parts of the company. Cupertino exited the external monitor business when it stopped selling its Thunderbolt Display this past summer. The $999 monitor had not been updated since 2011.",

      "title": "Apple disbands AirPort wireless router team, to focus on core consumer products",
      "text": "Yes, those old and outdated wireless routers called AirPorts by Apple may soon be taken off shelves. According to a report by the Bloomberg , Apple has finally shut its wireless routers team, a move that comes as the company tries to focus more on its money making consumer products like the Apple Watch and the Apple TV.\nApple began shutting down the team over the past year, and according to Mark Gurman, moved its engineers into other streams including Apple TV. Apple has not delivered a single update to its AirPort line-up since 2013, which would indicate that it could either have given up on a product that was not delivering the enough revenue or it has something else in mind to connect those devices together.\nWireless standards have been changing over the years with faster speeds and wider coverage thanks to newer chips. Priced between $99 to $299 its hard to justify the “Appleness” of the AirPort when established brands like Belkin, D-Link and Netgear deliver more for a lot less.\nThe whole problem with the AirPort was that it was not a necessity, meaning that it could generate revenue like the Lightning port that has been licensed to plenty of third-party accessory makers. AirPort routes did not offer anything unique even in the guise of the AirPort Time capsule which doubled as backup storage for Apple’s Mac computers.\nHowever, knowing Apple, we could be looking at a new wireless standard in the near future. Something that will work specifically for Apple-made products. But for now, it’s just goodbye to the good old AirPort!\nThe post Apple disbands AirPort wireless router team, to focus on core consumer products appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Apple Teases One-Day Black Friday Shopping Event Monday November 21, 2016 9:41 pm PST by Husain Sumra Apple tonight updated its website with a brand new page teasing a one-day Black Friday shopping event. Apple didn't offer Black Friday deals last year, opting to allow third-party retailers like Best Buy and Target to offer deals instead. Friday can't come soon enough. Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check off everyone on your list. Last year, Apple SVP of Retail Angela Ahrendts said the company was backing away from Black Friday promotions because \"being good to your employees will always be good for your business.\" On its Black Friday website, Apple says that its one-day shopping event will include free shipping on in-stock items ordered by 5 PM. You'll also be able to take part in the event with the Apple Store app and in-store. Those interested in visiting an Apple retail store on Black Friday will need to check their local Apple store's extended holiday hours because there will not be uniform opening and closing times. Apple has also provided easy links to four holiday gift collections curated by the company, including \"Apple gifts,\" \"Music gifts,\" \"Photography gifts\" and \"Games & Toys.\" It's unclear what kind of Black Friday promotion the company will use this year. In the past, Apple has offered gift cards worth variable amounts with the purchase of Apple products. For instance, purchasing a Mac would yield a $100 gift card. However, in its European stores Apple has also opted for more traditional discounts .",

      "text": "0 The iPhone 6S and the IPhone 6S Plus showcased at the Sept. 9 2015 launch event. Image via The Verge (Twitter) \nApple has admitted what a Chinese consumer protection group reported a week ago: various iPhone 6s units are indeed shutting down unexpectedly. The tech giant confirmed the issue but said that the problem is only limited to a number of handsets within a short serial number range. Affected iPhone 6s models are those that were manufactured from September to October 2015. \nApple insists that this is not a safety issue. The company pushes for the problem to be resolved via a battery replacement program, which the company is currently offering for free. Apple has not disclosed the official number of affected iPhone 6s units and in which regions. \nAccording to PCWorld , Apple was asked by the China Consumers Association to look into the core problem that has caused the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s models to automatically shut down. The sudden shutdowns are believed to occur once the battery level drops to about 60 or 50 percent. \nAustralian owners of the affected Apple smartphones can go to the nearest Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider to have their device serial number checked to confirm if the unit is eligible for a free battery replacement. Apple’s wireless carrier partners are not involved with the battery replacement program. \nOwners of the affected Apple handsets can start the battery replacement process by backing up their data to iCloud or iTunes, turning off the “Find My iPhone” feature and erasing all data and settings. \nFor more information on how to back up data using iCloud or iTunes, click here . For more information on how to remove a device from “Find My iPhone,” click here . To erase data and settings, go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings. \nApple noted that iPhone 6s units with any kind of damage should have it fixed before proceeding with the battery replacement. \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” announced Apple . \nThe company also said that Apple iPhone 6s owners who believe that their handsets were affected by the problem but have already paid to replace the batteries would be able to get a refund.",

      "text": "0 A woman listens to a store employee talk about the Microsoft Surface during the grand opening of a flagship Microsoft Corp. retail store in New York, October 26, 2015. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nApple and Microsoft have just updated their high-in-demand laptops, the Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Book. Both the companies have included latest technologies and innovations in their devices so as to compete with each other successfully. As both laptops are favourites for the tech-savvy customers, it might be tough to choose between the two. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book has been updated with some top-class features whereas the Apple MacBook Pro now has the crystal-clear Retina Display. In fact, the Apple MacBook Pro has received a major design upgrade after four years. \nThis has created a lot of hype among fans. Apart from the high-res Retina Display, the laptop is now much thinner and lighter when compared to Apple MacBook Air. Among the top features included in the Microsoft Surface Book, fans are really upbeat about the Surface Pen Stylus, touchscreen display and a lot of processing power. \nHowever, fans have been mesmerised by the Microsoft Surface Book’s detachable screen that transforms the portable laptop into a portable tablet. In terms of operating system, the Apple MacBook Pro runs on the latest version of MacOS Sierra. Sierra provides an amazing user experience with seamless running of Siri, iMessage, iCloud among others. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book runs on Windows 10 and users can also use the Microsoft Cortana virtual assistant for regular activities. The Surface Book can be purchased from Microsoft Store Australia for $2,299 inclusive of GST. It would include the basic 128GB storage, 8GB RAM and Core Intel i5 processor. \nOn the other hand, the basic 128GB storage, 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB RAM, 13-inch model costs $1,999, as per Apple Australia . \nThus, for the experimenting buyer who can shell out some extra dollars, may go for the Microsoft Surface Book. Hardcore Apple fans would love to get their hands on the MacBook Pro as they have been waiting for upgrades for a long time. Moreover, its basic model is less expensive than the Surface Book.",

If the battery has already been rreplaced, customers could be eligible for a refund. \nApple also recently acknowledged iPhone 6S smartphones suffer from “ Touch Disease ,” which causes the touch screen to stop working, sometimes for months.

      "text": "Reddit \nApple today has quietly released its latest diversity numbers, reflecting of the company as of July of this year. The numbers show that Apple is continuing its push towards diversity in the workplace, but that executive and upper management positions are still largely filled by white males… \nIn the report, Apple outlines that 73 of its top 107 executives are white males. The remaining spots are filled as follows: 20 females, 15 of whom are white 2 Hispanic or latino employees (up from 1 last year) 14 Asian employees (up from 12 last year) 3 black or African-American employees \nGoing further down the ladder, first and middle manager positions are held predominantly by white males. Specifically, 48 percent of those posts are occupied by white men, while 18 percent are white women. 23 percent of these positions are held by Asian employees, 7 percent Hispanic or Latino, 4 percent black, and 1 percent multiracial. \nApple has been very public about its push towards a more diverse workforce , and in many ways it’s making strides towards those goals. Today’s diversity report shows that the number of net Hispanic employees was up 951 people, while net number of African-American or back employees was up 783 people. The number of Asian hires was up by 2,455 employees. \nApple’s latest diversity numbers come in a form known as the EEO-1, which is document required by the government and filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Apple, however, is a firm believed that the EEO-1 has not kept pace with industry changes and is thus not reflective of its true diversity: \nWe make the document publicly available, but it’s not how we measure our progress. The EEO-1 has not kept pace with changes in industry or the American workforce over the past half century. We believe the information we report elsewhere on this site is a far more accurate reflection of our progress toward diversity. \nApple last released diversity numbers in August with data collected with its internal methods, showing a more diverse company makeup than its EEO-1 report does. Nevertheless, Apple is clearly making strides towards its diversity goals, albeit at a slower pace than some may desire. Guides",

      "text": "Apple axes Wi-Fi router division November 21, 2016 - 18:06   Apple has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers , another move to try to sharpen the company’s focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, Bloomberg reports citing people familiar with the matter. \nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn’t been publicly announced. \nApple hasn’t refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn’t currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans. \nRouters are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. Apple currently sells three wireless routers, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule. The Time capsule doubles as a backup storage hard drive for Mac computers. \nThe products, which cost $99, $199, and $299, respectively, make up a small slice of Apple’s revenue and are part of Apple’s “other products” category on its financial statements. The category, which includes the Apple Watch and Apple TV, generated $11.1 billion in fiscal 2016, or about 5 percent of total sales. Related links:",

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nEnlarge Image Throwing a little jab?\nPhoto by Stephen Brashear, Getty Images Words can come back to haunt you.\nSometimes, they even slap you about the chops while sniggering: \"Heh, heh, heh.\"\nAnd so it is that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken some of Tim Cook's words and gently wafted them right back at him.\nIn an interview with the Australian Financial Review , Nadella mused on the increasing success of the Surface.\nHe painted it as an example of Microsoft's risk-taking nature. He also contrasted this attitude with that of his competitors.\n\"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,\" he said. \"Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\"\nActually, it was four years ago. Should you not be familiar with the subtext here, Cook was on a 2012 earnings call when he mused about hybrid computers. He said converging two different products involved too many trade-offs.\nThen he added , quite immortally: \"You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user.\"\nThis may not have been quite right. Indeed, in its August launch of the iPad Pro, Apple expressly claimed that it was a computer. Which confused a lot of people, as Apple had always insisted it was a tablet.\nMore Technically Incorrect Apple preaches inclusiveness with Frankenstein's monster Drake reveals Taylor Swift weakness in new Apple Music News anchor tries to draw cannon, draws oh, look At the time, Microsoft couldn't help emitting a guffaw in the form of an ad whose message was -- my paraphrase -- \"Yo, Apple. Please do shove it.\"\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Nadella, though, is projecting some confidence. He explained to the Financial Review that you have to make room for failures. Not everything will work.\nAnd sometimes, you have to take the jokes for a while before you suddenly get imitated.\nI cannot confirm that Jony Ive is already working on a revolutionary refrigerator/toaster design. Still, it took a very long time for NFL announcers to stop calling a Surface an iPad .\nSo perhaps both companies have a little work to do here.\n ",

      "text": "Apple to swap ‘faulty’ iPhone 6S batteries  20 am Apple is offering to replace the batteries of a “small number” of iPhone 6S phones with a fault that makes them unexpectedly shut down. \nThe phones with this fault were manufactured between September and October 2015, it said in a statement. \nAffected devices will suddenly stop working even though the handset’s battery has plenty of charge. \nAnyone with an eligible phone who takes up the offer will get a free replacement battery for their handset. No response \nIn its announcement, Apple urged customers who believe they have a faulty phone to contact an Apple store, an authorised repair shop or the firm’s support line to start the process of getting a new battery. A “limited serial number range” was affected, it said. \nPhone owners should back up data and then wipe it all off the handset before surrendering it for the replacement, it added. Phones with cracked screens might have to be repaired before Apple would go ahead with swapping the battery, it said. \nApple added that mobile operators would not be taking part in the replacement effort. \nThe AppleInsider website suggested that the fault with the iPhone 6S could be traced to people charging their handset with generic chargers rather than Apple’s own-brand ones. \nUsing one of these third-party chargers damaged circuitry which meant the amount of charge in the battery was not being reported correctly to the phone’s operating system. Apple has not confirmed if this is the cause. \nThe battery swap programme comes only a few days after Apple announced a separate offer intended to fix a fault on the iPhone 6 Plus. \nThat problem meant that the touchscreens on some handsets steadily became less and less responsive if they had been accidentally dropped on to a hard surface a few times. \nGadget sites traced the cause to chips used to drive the touchscreen that came loose after an impact. \n–",

      "text": "DirecTV Now Supports Single Sign-on for Upcoming 'TV' App on iOS and Apple TV Monday November 21, 2016 10:55 pm PST by Eric Slivka Apple's upcoming iOS 10 .2 and tvOS 10 .1 updates will bring a new \"TV\" app where users will be able to view much of their TV and movie content from across various apps, all centrally located to make it easy to pick up where you left off and receive recommendations on additional content. The new TV app has been gradually going live on both platforms for U.S. users during the beta testing period, and it works hand-in-hand with a \"Single Sign-on\" feature that will let subscribers to certain pay TV services authenticate their accounts once on a systemwide basis and receive access to content across all supported apps for which they are eligible. When the early beta of Single Sign-on began going live earlier this month, there were four supported TV providers, with Dish Network and its Sling TV subsidiary being the most recognizable while small regional services GVTC Communications and Hotwire rounded out the list. Full support for Single Sign-on will require apps to be updated to recognize the systemwide authentication, but the provider listings have offered a glimpse at which providers are currently on board with the feature. As of this week, another major provider has joined the Single Sign-on program, with AT&T's DirecTV now appearing in the TV Provider list for authentication. The addition of DirectTV's 20 million U.S. subscribers makes it the biggest provider to support the feature so far, displacing Dish Network and Sling TV. The addition of DirecTV isn't necessarily a surprise, as Apple had touted \"DirecTV, Dish Network, and more\" in its press release announcing the new TV app last month, but it's apparently taken DirecTV a few extra weeks to prepare. Still notably absent are the major U.S. cable companies such as Comcast and Charter/Time Warner, and there's no word on if or when those companies will be coming on board. Apple has announced that the new TV app will become available to the public in December, indicating the company intends to release iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 within that timeframe.",

      "text": "Save $ 15 on Roku - Streaming Stick (2016 Model) - Black. \nSave $15 on the current-gen Roku Streaming Stick \n\nThis pocket-sized streamer is Roku's latest streaming stick and features a powerful quad-core processor coupled with dual-band wireless technology. It plugs into your HDTV's HDMI port giving you access to Roku's rich platform, which supports hundreds of apps like Netflix, HBO Now, and Sling TV. This deal is $15 under the traditional price. \n\nWas $49.99 . Is Now $34.99 . See details on Amazon There are lots of ways to stream online content directly to your TV, including simple set-top boxes, compact streaming sticks and powerful game consoles. For the largest selection with minimum fuss, the Roku Ultra ($130) is the way to go. This 4K-compatible device features more than 3,500 channels, a remote control with a headphone jack and a powerful search feature that trawls multiple services to help you pinpoint your favorite content.\n\nIf your tastes skew minimalist, you can also check out the newly redesigned Google Chromecast ($35), which matches a streamlined feature set with a low price tag. (There's also a 4K option, the Google Chromecast Ultra , for $70.) At the other end of the spectrum, an Xbox One ($400) costs a pretty penny, but gives you access to plenty of streaming services, plus blockbuster video games and Blu-ray discs.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that if you own a smart TV and stick to the big streaming channels (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, etc.), you probably do not need a separate streaming device. Smart TVs tend to have these channels built in.\nHow We Test Streaming Devices Testing streaming players is usually a simple process that prioritizes content over performance. Any streaming player worth its salt can play video well, but only a good one possesses straightforward navigation, robust search features and a wide variety of content to suit all tastes.\nThe first thing we evaluate is the setup, to see how quick and simple it is. From there, we take the user interface for a spin to see what content gets highlighted, what gets hidden, and how easy it is to navigate to our favorite channels. We'll also watch a few different shows on a variety of channels to gauge the quality of the video and audio.\nAfter that, it's onto the extra features, like gaming, voice search and screen mirroring. These factors don't weigh quite as heavily toward the final score, but they're nice to have if they work well, and extremely distracting if they don't.\nEditor's choice Roku Ultra Best Streaming Media Player Overall 9/10 Superior \nReview $129.99 Amazon Number of Channels 3,500+ Size 4.9 x 4.9 x 0.9 in Weight 8.0 oz The Roku Ultra is one of the few media players on the market that will let you watch Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Video and similar channels in full 4K resolution with support for HDR color and Dolby audio protocols. This small, quiet player can do so much more, though. With access to more than 3,500 channels, the Roku Ultra is also a gateway to obscure movies, original online content and niche channels, from cooking, to cardio, to cartoons. The remote control offers an audio jack for private listening and a mic for a voice search that trawls more than 100 providers, so you’ll never lack for things to watch.\nMORE: Top 10 Online Streaming Video Services \nGoogle Chromecast 2 Best Streaming Stick 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $35.00 Newegg Number of Channels 1,000+ Size 2.0 x 2.0 x 0.5 inches Weight 1.4 oz Like any good streaming stick, the Chromecast 2 is concealable, portable, and doesn't take up much room. A recent redesign even adds a splash of color to the device. But the best changes to the Chromecast are under the hood -- it supports 802.11ac and features an adaptive antenna system -- and in the app you use to control the streaming device. Google revamped the Chromecast app to make it easier to find streamable content, highlighting video from apps already installed on your phone. The addition of support for Spotify helps Chromecast close the gap with Roku's Streaming Stick and the $35 price tag makes the Chromecast your most affordable streaming option.\n\n\nChromecast Ultra $69.99 Best Buy Nvidia Shield Best Android TV Player 7/10 Very good \nReview $199.99 Amazon Number of Channels 30+ Size 5.1 x 8.3 x 1.0 inches Weight 23.0 oz Android TV is a clean, intuitive and robust operating system, and the Nvidia Shield takes full advantage of it. The Shield splits the difference between a streaming box and a gaming console, and has a lot to offer on both fronts. In addition to enjoying your favorite shows and movies on apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus and Plex, you can download hundreds of high-end Android games. You can also stream big-budget titles like Borderlands from the cloud via the Nvidia Grid program. Rounding out the video offerings, the Shield will be able to display and record TV broadcasts when tuners become available in the future. Add in support for 4K content from sites like YouTube and Netflix, as well as the ability to play your own media via USB, the Shield is one of the most versatile streaming players.\nSlingbox M2 Best Live TV Streamer 6/10 Worth considering \nReview $199.99 Amazon Number of Channels N/A Size 4.7 x 8.1 x 3.8 inches Weight 22.4 oz The Slingbox M2 is not for cord cutters, as it doesn’t host any streaming services like Netflix, Hulu Plus or Amazon Instant Video. However, it provides place shifting for cable- or satellite-TV subscribers. The Slingbox M2 hooks into your cable box, then transmits the signal to just about any computer or mobile device, anywhere in the world. With simple setup and excellent picture quality, the Slingbox M2 is an ideal choice for videophiles who want to take full advantage of their premium TV channels, even when they’re far away from home.\nMORE: How to Stream Video from a Mobile Device or Computer to a TV \nEditor's choice Xbox One Best Game Console for Streaming 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $399.99 Amazon Number of Channels 50+ Size 13.1 x 10.8 x 3.1 inches Weight 112.8 oz While you probably shouldn't run out and buy a game console just for streaming online video, if you want both games and streaming services to take center stage in your living room, the Xbox One is the way to go. With more than 50 streaming apps, a library of excellent games, a built-in Blu-ray player and the ability to route your cable or antenna feed through it, the Xbox One is about as comprehensive as entertainment centers get. For those who want something a little cheaper, last generation's PlayStation 3 is still a viable choice at a much lower price.\n\n\nMORE: PS4 vs. Xbox One: Which Console Is Right for You? Apple TV (2015) Best Streamer for Apple Users 7/10 Very good \nReview $149.00 Staples Number of Channels 1,000+ Size 3.9 x 3.9 x 1.4 inches Weight 15.0 oz The Apple TV has come a long way since its debut in 2007. The 2015 version of the Apple TV is still the most convenient way to play iTunes content on a big screen, but it's also now one of the easiest streaming devices to navigate. A powerful Siri search allows users to communicate conversationally with the Apple TV (\"I want to see TV shows with Patrick Stewart\"), as well as give follow-up instructions (\"Just his new ones\") about movies, actors, directors, studios, age ratings and more. Apple TV offers hundreds of apps, ranging from videos and music to real estate and fitness, as well as a handful of great games.\n\n\nGoogle Chromecast Ultra New and Notable $69.00 Google Google's Chromecast is one of the smallest, cheapest and best streaming players on the market. In November, the Chromecast Ultra will take the same aesthetics and channel selection, and bring the whole experience into 4K. With faster performance, more stable Wi-Fi and support for both HDR and Dolby Vision protocols, the Chromecast Ultra will also cost a bit than its full HD counterpart: $69, to be precise.\n\nWhat to Stream Now that you've selected the right streaming player for you, it's time to get down to the business of watching some shows. To get you started we've scoured the options on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Now and Showtime Anytime to bring you the best shows to binge watch . We'll even tell you exactly how long it will take for you to watch every episode. \nAnd when you come to the end of that list we can tell you where to find some other great shows to watch such as Empire , Better Call Saul , Downton Abbey , Vikings , The Walking Dead , Game of Thrones and Peppa Pig . So many shows, so many ways to watch. \nRelated Buying Guides: \nBest Miracast Receivers \nBest Wireless Screen-Mirroring Devices \nBest Roku Channels \n\nStreaming DEALS Roku Stick 3600R \n\nSave $15 on the current-gen Roku Streaming Stick \n\nThis pocket-sized streamer is Roku's latest streaming stick and features a powerful quad-core processor coupled with dual-band wireless technology.

That is either because the author is unfamiliar with this, or because he chooses not to be clear about it, or because he thinks that if it is not paid video watching it is not worth it. What he should have called the article is : \"The best paid video content media players.\" There is a whole new market for media streaming boxes that can not only act as second choice desktops but do media streaming and much more as part of their function. These are boxes such as the Probox2 EX, the MINIX Neo X8, the Rikomagic MK902II ,etc. These type of media streamers are much more powerful then this restricted, low functionality, low power boxes in the article. The form factor that I am talking about will become even more powerful once they start using google's new mobile operating system Lollipop.\n\nWhat the boxes such as Apple, Roku boxes excel at is streaming paid video and not much more while the media boxes that I mentioned offer you the use of unrestricted applications use, the streaming of media through applications such as XBMC (KODI) ,and a lot more interaction with your media.\n\nMany of these boxes have quad-core processors and powerful video processors that put Apple and Roku boxes to shame in terms function and even usability. \n\nSo, tech reviewers will soon be forced to make a distinction between specialized video\nwatch boxes and real media streaming boxes. 0 morganfj Dec 14, 2014, 12:03 PM ROKU 3 is problematic to a small degree.. But the worst part of ROKU is that there is NO real CARING Customer support... For example... Failure to play files which are stated as playable (MKV and MP4 both H.264 Audio - NO Other Formats!!!) MKV if set to 5.1 will have no sound and many newer MP4 files will freeze the unit causing reset.... ROKU's answer.. CONVERT the File and to same format and try again... IN FACT Most questions are about failures to operate correctly are answered via FORM LETTER.\nThe Problem ROKU is hardwires the decoder.. NO upgradable Codecs are used.. thus any updates to Converter's Coders can not be upgraded to ROKU, and this unit is already years out of date.. Older files may work, but don't count on downloading newer files and having them work... THIS WILL ONLY GET WORST!\nNext Problem: RESETS.. Seems that ROKU will on occasions.. especially in USB mode.. FREEZE and RESET This will drive you crazy.. Again.. Primary software is hardwired and very little update capability was put into this old unit... \n\nBOTTOM LINE.. The ROKU 3 you by today is IDENTICAL to the units built 4 years ago.. Some minor software is updated as is the software in these older units.. but Major changes CAN NOT BE CORRECTED by software due to design. Considering inexpensive microprocessors and min. memory used. RODU could have used a software system that was fully upgradable also a good Upgradable Decoder COULD HAVE BEEN USED along with CODECS instead of limited hardwired Codes.. This would have allowed for ALL formats to be played and upgraded as changes are made...BASICALLY: They saved a buck in this $99 unit at the consumers COST!\n\nI FEEL THAT PLACING this old unit at the top of the list is irresponsible of this site.. SIMPLE SELLS NuMBERS does not make the Better Product.... 0 Daniel Muvdi Jan 15, 2015, 8:06 PM you don't mentioned Fire Tv that its completly wrong in my opinion is one of the best so far. 0 davesr1980 Jan 19, 2015, 8:00 PM This review is for this media players that they are calling the best are the most basic and waste of money unit the more you use them the more you wish they could do and most of the unit listed can do half of what a good player can do for instance kdlink hd700 hd700 or a200 is listed and the are most definitely in the top 10 so I assuming top ten units you can pick up in Walmart or best buy 0 lost_n_austin Feb 1, 2015, 2:53 PM Good grief, nothing whatsoever here about devices optimized for file playback.\n\nMove along... move along... 0 KADIEMAC Apr 15, 2015, 10:26 AM I cut the satellite cord a month ago and went with the ROKU3. I am loving it !! The only problem that I have encountered was I could only get a fragmented lined homepage a few days ago. I unplugged it from the power source and it reset. We had a power outage in my area that night. I'm not sure if that played a part but I've had no issues since. I'm glad I am no longer under Directv's thumb!! 0 Dave4321 May 29, 2015, 12:28 PM Any android player with a decent processor can stream any game with the Limelight/Moonlight app as long as you have an Nvidia graphics card. I can stream any game with my Fire TV. 0 mca10spro May 31, 2015, 3:33 PM Quote: you don't mentioned Fire Tv that its completly wrong in my opinion is one of the best so far. 0 mca10spro May 31, 2015, 3:34 PM I agree. I am looking at the Fire TV. It looks pretty good. Also, just today I saw a samsung device. 0 svexec Jun 21, 2015, 8:40 AM what's TOTALLY missing from the market is a simple web browser url locator to view ANYTHING so I can surf the net on my TV without a laptop and view hulu free version!!! Remember the good old days of WebTV? 0 Benham Sep 11, 2015, 8:54 AM Chromecast now supports HBO Now. 0 Den Watsons Oct 28, 2015, 6:51 AM I use MCPlayer to stream with Chromecast on my Smart TV. Good quality and Dolby sound 5:1. 0 NOT_PROVIDED_317 Dec 4, 2015, 1:18 PM Too bad Roku is the WORST if you need anything after you buy it. Hours and hours and hours of put a gun to your head BS just to get simple answers if you are even lucky enough to get to someone. Do not expect any call backs if promised or any replies if you use their reply back system. 0 vivstar Jan 14, 2016, 6:55 AM These kind of devices are very difficult to rate as it's so subjective. Someone who is heavily invested into the Apple universe with TV shows, movies and music all bought from Apple would benefit from an Apple TV. Someone who enjoys tinkering and playing around with their device might prefer a Raspberry Pi. 0 SR-71 Blackbird Feb 23, 2016, 4:28 PM Chrome 2 has always done me right. 0 Timothy_25 May 16, 2016, 10:19 PM Important to know that Roku Streaming Stick for 2016 isn't supported and doesn't work with Time Warner Cable I was told here in Honolulu. But the fact that it takes the place of the \"Digital Adapter\" that is rented with a monthly fee of $10, covers the Roku 3 purchase price over a course of a year 0 jgsmmhrd May 27, 2016, 12:31 PM this appears to be an ad. there is no mention at all about all the devices that have kodi. 0 Comment Firstname Submit",

      "text": "Apple is reportedly ending development of its AirPort wireless routers \nRose Behar \nNovember 21, 2016 3:25pm \nApple is shutting its doors on the division that makes its AirPort wireless router products, according to a report from Bloomberg reporter and long-time Apple tipster Mark Gurman. \nThe shutdown is reportedly an effort to “sharpen the company’s focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue.” Gurman adds that over the past year, engineers from the division have been dispersed to other development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV. \nApple hasn’t refreshed its line of routers, which include the AirPort Express ($199 CAD), AirPort Extreme ($249 CAD) and AirPort Time Capsule — a $379 CAD device that doubles as a hard drive — since 2013. While the routers lag behind those created by competitors like D-Link and Netgear when it comes to adopting advances made in chip technology, they had a core demographic of users that appreciated its design and easy integration with Mac products. \nApple wireless router division also has an important place in Wi-Fi history, helping to popularize the concept of wireless networking with the debut of the original AirPort Base Station and iBook laptop. This move, if it indeed comes to pass, echoes Apple’s decision in October 2016 to stop making its own external monitors, instead entering into a sales partnership with LG . \nIf you’d still like to get your hands on an AirPort, the devices remain available on Apple’s Canadian site. \nRouters aren’t sexy enough for Apple consumers. FTR_Part_deux \nWhen I upgraded my Dlink router to the Airport Extreme and added an Airport Express to stream music to my hifi, I couldn’t have been any happier. For me, they’ve been more reliable than the Dlink. Karl Dagenais \nSame here, first router I’ve had that never required a reboot. Gewurttraminer \nD-Link is absolute garbage. Those saying otherwise clearly have no idea what they’re talking about FTR_Part_deux \nAt the time when I was looking for a new wireless router, my work IT guy suggested the Dlink DIR-655. The first one I bought was great and worked like a charm and what I liked the most was the signal strength. I bought a second DIR-655 and was less than happy, compared to the first one I bought. It required constant rebooting that I just gave up on it. \nFor now and for my own personal use, the Airport Extreme and Express have been working really well. My needs on my home network isn’t super intensive, but I’m just glad that I’m not constantly rebooting the router. It also sits beside my old school Dlink Boxee and I can wirelessly stream 1080p w/DTS 5.1 movies to it with no stuttering, so I’m totally happy thus far. Gewurttraminer \nI hear ya. I run multiple devices on these routers so lets say an Apple TV, laptop, PS4, and a couple smartphones at the same time and really within our household its never given me a problem. And I’ve also NEVER had to reboot so yes, its expensive as routers go but its reliable and solid and I’ll be using mine until they completely die. dirtyKIMCHI \nD-Link unfortunately released multiple variants (Hardware Revisions) for the DIR-655 router. DIR-655 had A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B1, & C1 variants; each revision (A, B or C) having different firmware and changes in hardware. Unless the consumer has this knowledge that there are many versions, they just buy the box that states DIR-655. \nAll Network Equipment Manufacturers do this, unfortunately. Even Apple did this with the AirPort Extreme & Time Capsule as Generation 1 to 5 all look the same, but have many differences in hardware (Time Capsules having Capacity variants). FTR_Part_deux \nDlink shoulda stuck with the version that worked the best. lol They would have kept me as a customer. It’s Me \nThey used to sell quite well. They work well, are very easy to set up and get updates and provided some nice to have features years ago (printer sharing, disk sharing, etc) \nLikely it’s margins. Margins on routers are fairly low and cheaper routers are getting better and better. Hard to justify the higher price but Apple wants high margins items. Gewurttraminer \nActually I have two of these devices and I haven’t seen an update in over a year to the firmware.That said they have been good to me and met my needs as a backup and as a router. It’s Me \nI have two Extreme units as well, from different generations. Last update was May of this year. \nUsually seem to get updates once or twice per year. Gewurttraminer \nYeah I haven’t received any update in May. I check once every few months and nothing. Still don’t care much. They continue to function quite well and still prefer them over the Bell Home Hub Do Do \nI really believe in the not too distant future that Apple will get out of the “computer” market outside of IOS products all together. That’s the vibe I’m getting. They seem to have gotten out of the “pro” market with this last iteration of Macbook pros. It’s Me \nI think they will stay as long as there is money in it. They aren’t the type to leave money on the table, assuming it is significant money. They still seem to be doing well with macOS devices, so I don’t see them suddenly deciding to walk away from billions of dollars. fred \ngood riddance, their products were too expensive, and not very reliable Gewurttraminer \nYeah Fred whatever. Go buy a DLink. Haha It’s Me \nWould you think differently if you’d used one? Can’t Fix Stupid \nI liked this line of routers. Pretty understated but they worked well. jay \nApple get more and more out of the computer business. I like the airport extrem and a lot possibly to have all connected together but Apple has no more interest in that. iPhone is the only important thing for them and as soon they find out to get the iPad Pro more powerful they will stop supporting macOS Get Updates \nSign-up for MobileSyrup news sent straight to your inbox Categories",

It looks like Samsung is doing everything it can to boost sales of the Galaxy S7 after its Note 7 handset was cancelled.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. You Can Tell Apple’s Siri to Send Money Via PayPal \nPayPal just made it a lot easier to send money on your iPhone. On Thursday, the payments giant debuted an integration with Apple’s voice assistant Siri to allow users to send money to contacts via voice commands. \nPayPal pypl previously unveiled a similar integration with Siri and its Venmo app, which allows people to send money to one another. Venmo and PayPal competitor Square Cash also debuted a voice-controlled feature with Siri earlier this year. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nIt’s not surprising that PayPal is tapping into voice commands to send money. Tapping into voice-based assistants, like Siri, is becoming a more intense battle for tech giants, including Amazon amzn and Google googl . \nPayPal is also potentially gearing up for a busy holiday season with payments. The company predicts that people will use its services to send 17 million transactions in December alone. Last year, the company processed $41 billion in transactions sent from one contact to another using PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom. \nThe feature is now available in 30 countries. ",

However, customers can expect free two-day delivery on products which are in stock and ordered by 5:00pm on the day. \nIn the past, Apple has been known to participate in Black Friday. While the company's discounts and deals have not been extensive, Apple has previously offered discounts for items including gift cards and devices including Macs and iPads. \nHowever, on Black Friday 2015, you had to go to third-party retailers and vendors to snap up deals on Apple devices as the iPad and iPhone maker chose to avoid the shopping day altogether.",

      "text": "Apple's Phil Schiller Talks 32GB RAM MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Corazon Victorino Pin it Share Apple’s senior vice president for worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, has explained why it’s unlikely for the Cupertino giant to create a MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM. More Apple debuted its new MacBook Pro models in late October sans a configuration that supports 32GB of RAM. This Monday, the Cupertino giant’s marketing chief, Phil Schiller, has explained why this is so. In an email that was sent in response to a query from software developer Ben Slaney, Schiller clarified why the new Mac laptops only max out at 16GB of RAM and not 32GB. According to Schiller, the main reason behind this is because a 32GB RAM would entail the use of a different logic board design, and the latter could compromise the space for the laptop batteries, as per MacRumors . “The MacBook Pro uses 16GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHz. To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life,” Schiller explained in the email. Schiller’s words were very important since they helped clarified the error Slaney made in his attempt to explain why the new models only have a maximum of 16GB of RAM on his site, MacDaddy . Slaney previously claimed that the good explanation why there is no 32GB model was because the LPDDR3E specification tops out at 1866MHz. AppleInsider also explained that another reason why the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does not have a 32GB RAM variant is because the Intel Skylake CPUs that came with the new laptop only supports up to 16GB of RAM at 2133MHz. There is hope for MacBooks with 32GB RAM, however, since the Cupertino giant is reportedly looking into using Intel’s Kaby Lake processors for its next laptops. The advantage of using LPDDR3E RAM at this point is found on the power consumption of the Mac laptops. The new MacBook Pro could last for up to 30 days of standby time. On the contrary, if Apple used DDR4 RAM, the laptops could barely last for less than 7 days even on standby mode. Related Articles ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple Will Fix Defective iPhone 6s Smartphone Batteries for Free \nApple will fix any iPhone 6s smartphone suffering from what the company says is an uncommon battery problem. \nThe tech giant AAPL will replace the battery on any iPhone 6s that shuts down unexpectedly, the company confirmed in a Support post on its website on Sunday. The replacement will be free, but limited to iPhone 6s units purchased between September and October 2015 that fall within a certain, but unidentified, serial number range. \nThe announcement comes just days after iPhone 6s owners in China were complaining that their devices were shutting down when they still had battery life left. Soon after, the Chinese consumer-protection agency, China Consumers Association, came to their defense and called on Apple to immediately address the problem. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \n“In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who’ve reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,” the agency said in an open letter on Tuesday. \nSoon after, Apple responded, saying that it had found the problem. Apple said last week that it was only affecting a small number of devices and wouldn’t cause a safety problem for users. Apple’s announcement over the weekend was confirmation that the company would address the problem. \nOn its support page, Apple says it will replace batteries at one of its retail stores or via an Authorized Service Provider. Wireless carriers will not participate in the replacement program. Apple also cautioned users to get their iPhones fixed before they tried to have their batteries replaced. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple says. ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple Reportedly Ending Airport Router Line Introduced by Steve Jobs \nApple is ending its long running line of Wi-Fi routers after disbanding the team responsible for the wireless devices over the past year, according to a new report. \nEngineers who worked on Apple’s line of Airport routers, first introduced by Steve Jobs in 1999, have been reassigned to other units, Bloomberg reported on Monday citing anonymous sources. The company had not released an updated router in three years. \nFortune reached out to Apple aapl for comment and will update this story if a response is received. \nApple appears to be honing it hardware efforts somewhat to focus on its core product—such as the iMac desktop, MacBook laptops, and the iPhone—plus more promising sidelines, such as the Apple TV and Beats headphones. After unveiling new MacBook Pro laptops last month, Apple said it would cease development of its own line of monitors. \nApple’s Airport line, still listed for sale in its online store, runs from $99 for a basic Wi-Fi router to $400 for a router that included a large hard drive for storage. The products run the fastest currently adopted Wi-Fi standard known as 802.11ac. \nBut the industry is on the verge of moving to an even faster standard known as WiGig, or 802.11ad, which would allow for wireless video streaming at 4K ultra-high definition resolution and quicker gaming connections between devices. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nJobs introduced Apple’s first wireless router alongside a new candy-colored line of iBook laptops at a time when Wi-Fi technology was almost brand new and not commonly found in homes. Based on the 802.11b standard, the router worked at a maximum speed of 11 megabits per second. \nA few competitors that make wireless routers have already introduced devices that include early version of the WiGig standard, which can operate at up to seven gigabits per second,. Netgear’s ntgr $500 Nighthawk X10 router, for example, includes both the older 802.11ac standard and the 802.11ad standard. ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Watch Apple’s 2016 Holiday Ad In Response to U.S. Disunity \nApple on Monday released its 2016 holiday ad. It stars Frankenstein, who just wants to be accepted. \nThe ad, called “Frankie’s Holiday,” starts off with Frankenstein sitting alone while listening and recording a Christmas song in his home. He appears to be living in seclusion. With a Christmas tree behind him, he walks down to the local community, where people are aghast at his sight. One man is seen clutching his child. \nHowever, Frankenstein doesn’t want trouble. Instead, he pulls out Christmas lights, plugs them into his neck, and starts singing “There’s No Place Like Home for the Holidays.” When he runs into a potentially embarrassing mishap, a little girl comes to his rescue. The entire community then joins in the singing, making him feel like part of the group. Get Data Sheet , F ortune ’s technology newsletter \nThe ad ends with a message: “Open your heart to everyone.” \nSince Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, protests have cropped up across the country amid fears that the president-elect won’t act in the best interests of those who didn’t vote for him and groups he criticized during the campaign. The protests followed a similarly contentious presidential campaign that caused some of the divide between those who voted for Trump and those who did not. \nThe campaign wasn’t the only cause for concern across the U.S. this year, as many other protests across the country have broken out in support for African-Americans and against police violence . Others have demonstrated in their support of police officers. \nAll of that was not lost on Apple AAPL . The company’s ad is intended to deliver a message of unity at a time when the U.S. and the world are experiencing disunity. And its apparent aim is to repair some of those broken bonds. \nApple’s ad comes on the heels of a similar commercial released last week by Amazon . In that ad, an imam and priest come together over tea, share a hug, and show a genuine care for each other. It’s widely been viewed as a response to the anti-Muslim speech that characterized part of the 2016 Presidential campaign. \nAfter the ad’s release, Amazon AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos said last week that he was “proud” of his team for creating a powerful ad. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nApple’s ad will begin airing on television on Thanksgiving Day and will run through the holidays. ",
