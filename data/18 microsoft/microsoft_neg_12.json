We didn’t face random reboots on Build 14965 Coming to other routine and important stuff, Mobile Data and WiFi connections work fine on our devices System-wide sharing seems broken but randomly on build 14965 Microsoft Edge has been working much better on Build 14965 Gaming works fine and multitasking with even two games open in background is rock solid Video Playback and streaming works fine Multitasking for apps works impressively and apps resume really fast from background. Apps don’t crash in background while multitasking Battery Life is much better on Build 14965 as compared to last two builds. Major Bug & Issues : Bluetooth functionality needs a UI overhaul with control options like allowing “which devices to connect automatically” or “manually”.

      "text": "Tweet \nClaims of anti-competitive behavior are incredibly common in the world of tech; Google finds itself on the defensive on just about a weekly basis. Microsoft is certainly no stranger to accusations of anti-competitiveness, most notably for bundling Internet Explorer in older versions of Windows. But now it's Microsoft's approach to security that's in the firing line. \nEugene Kaspersky (yes, that one: the Russian security expert and CEO of Kaspersky Lab) has fired a vitriolic tirade at Microsoft in which he complains about how Windows Defender works in Windows 10. Windows 10 has been lambasted for many reasons since it launched, and things are not really improving as we near the launch of Windows 10 Creators Update . Kaspersky is so furious about the way in which Defender operates that he has written a lengthy and bitter blog post entitled: \"That's It. I've Had Enough!\" \nIt would be easy to dismiss Kaspersky's epic 2,000-word diatribe as a 'rant', but it is much more than that. The blog post may be angry in its tone, but it is also level-headed and well-argued. Kaspersky accuses Microsoft of creating \"a challenge for all computer users and the entire ecosystem of independent developers for Windows\". \nHe points to complaints from Windows users that Windows 10 has been caught changing settings in the background, covertly switching default settings from third-party apps to Microsoft's own products. With Kaspersky's (both the name and his company) vested interest in security, it's little wonder that the main thrust of his complaint centers around Windows 10's Defender security product: \nWhen you upgrade to Windows 10, Microsoft automatically and without any warning deactivates all 'incompatible' security software and in its place installs... you guessed it -- its own Defender antivirus. But what did it expect when independent developers were given all of one week before the release of the new version of the OS to make their software compatible? Even if software did manage to be compatible according to the initial check before the upgrade, weird things tended to happen and Defender would still take over. \nKaspersky is unhappy with the way Microsoft tries to encourage a switch to Defender even if it deems that compatible security software is installed. He points to a scary-looking window that appears and tries to entice users into re-enabling Defender -- which, if done, incidentally, means the third-party security tool is disabled. It's activity like this that leaves Kaspersky \"both very disappointed and dismayed\". \nHe goes on to complain about how developers have been restricted by Microsoft in how they can advertise an expired license to their users. Should your anti-virus license run out, developers can only warn you of this for a three-day period -- and if you don’t renew the license in this time, Windows Defender is automatically enabled for you. It could be argued that this is a case of Microsoft trying to keep computers secure, but it is also very easy to see it as being anti-competitive behavior. This is particularly true when you consider something else that Kaspersky points out: \nMicrosoft has introduced a limit on the number of antiviruses you can have on a PC: one (or two -- if one of them is Defender; see below). At first glance this looks like sense : all for a more comfortable user experience. But the devil's in the details... \nLet's say you've an independent AV. You intentionally -- or not (e.g., with bundled software) -- install a trial version of a different AV, but forget to delete it or purchase a license for it. When the trial period is up, Windows quietly turns off both AVs, and -- you guessed it -- turns on Defender! So, it's out with two non-Microsoft products, and in with one Microsoft product, in no way whatsoever for a more comfortable -- or safer -- user experience. \nFurther ire is raised by what can happen next: \nMicrosoft violates its own rule regarding only being able to have one AV on a system. The rule doesn't apply to Defender: despite the presence of an independent AV, Windows will occasionally turn on its AV scanner. It demonstrates the results of its blustery activity, again egging the user on to ditch the other AV and stick with Defender. \nKaspersky says it is only possible to come to one conclusion based on all of this evidence: \"Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose\". He has gone as far as complaining about Microsoft in both Russia and Europe: \nWe think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own product. The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn't beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks. The company is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market, and infringes upon the interests of independent developers of security products. \nTherefore: \nWe've taken the decision to address official bodies in various countries (including the EU and Russia ) with a request to oblige Microsoft to cease its violation of anti-competition legislation and to remove the consequences of that violation. \nSpecifically : \nTo oblige Microsoft (i) to provide new versions and updates of Windows to independent developers in good time so they can maintain compatibility of their software to Windows; (ii) explicitly inform the user of the presence of incompatible software before upgrading Windows and recommend the user to install a compatible version of the software after the upgrade; (iii) always explicitly ask the user for his/her approval to enable Windows Defender. \nMicrosoft will almost certainly just dismiss these claims, but it will be interesting to see exactly how the company decides to respond.",

      "title": "Webjet Partners with Microsoft to Create the World's First Blockchain for Hotel Bookings – CoinSpeaker",
      "text": "share \nWebjet has announced the blockchain proof-of-concept solution developed in partnership with technology giant Microsoft . The project is expected to improve travel industry processes and change the way online payments for hotel bookings are conducted. \nIn general, blockchain holds great promise for the travel industry that usually involves multiple parties. The technology could be used to significantly speed up the settlement of payments that occur in different currencies and countries. Its open ledger system reduces risks by maintaining digital identities and storing permanent records of transactions and user data. \nWebjet’s new solution is based on Azure, the Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. The company expects the blockchain technology will help it to minimize costs, accelerate online payments processing, and increase security. \nIt took six months for companies to build the PoC which is claimed to be the first blockchain for hotel bookings. \n“Globally, hotel room wholesaling is a hundred-billion-dollar marketplace,” John Guscic, Managing Director at Webjet, said in a press-release . “Every day there are millions of transactions taking place and a single hotel stay could involve five or more transactions in the distribution chain. The marketplace can be prone to data discrepancies due to the volume of bookings passing through multiple systems. Between five and 10 per cent of bookings can be impacted or, in other words, up to 10 billion dollars’ worth of transactions.” \nNew blockchain for hotel bookings is expected to improve travel processes by eliminating errors that result in additional expenditures. \n“As we’ve tested the technology, we quickly realized it had the potential to improve processes with the rest of our travel partners who face similar complexities,” Guscic said. “It didn’t just benefit the Webjet environment; it could potentially assist every one of our partners in the supply chain to improve their efficiency.” \nWebjet is developing the new solution in three phases. The first stage includes the PoC, which will be tested by Webjet’s Lots of Hotels and Sunhotels brands. During the second phase, they will process thousands of transactions to trial the automated features of the distributed ledger technology. After this, the brands will select external parties that will test the new platform. \nAs Guscic told The Australian Financial Review , Webjet’s blockchain solution is used by its b2b wholesaling division that offers hotels to travel firms. The company plans to expand the platform between 250,000 hotels it works with and many third party suppliers. \n“We realized facilitating bookings in the travel industry through blockchain could become an additional business we could enter in the future, and the same technology could also help solve problems outside the travel industry. Undoubtedly, the blockchain technology built with Microsoft is an exciting opportunity for us over the next few years,” Guscic added. Share This article ",

Please try again. Please select a newsletter. Please enter a valid email address. Did you mean ? Inventors Microsoft logo used with permission On November 10, 1983, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Microsoft Corporation formally announced Microsoft Windows, a next-generation operating system that would provide a graphical user interface (GUI) and a multitasking environment for IBM computers. Introducing Interface Manager Microsoft promised that the new product would be on the shelf by April 1984. Windows might have been released under the original name of Interface Manager if marketing whiz, Rowland Hanson had not convinced Microsoft's founder Bill Gates that Windows was the far better name. Did Windows Get Top View? That same November in 1983, Bill Gates showed a beta version of Windows to IBM's head honchos. Their response was lackluster probably because they were working on their own operating system called Top View. IBM did not give Microsoft the same encouragement for Windows that they gave the other operating system that Microsoft brokered to IBM. In 1981, MS-DOS became the highly successful operating system that came bundled with an IBM computer .\nTop View was released in February of 1985 as a DOS-based multitasking program manager without any GUI features. \ncontinue reading below our video 5 Steps to Starting Your Own Business IBM promised that future versions of Top View would have a GUI. That promise was never kept, and the program was discontinued barely two years later. A Byte Out of Apple No doubt, Bill Gates realized how profitable a successful GUI for IBM computers would be. He had seen Apple's Lisa computer and later the more successful Macintosh or Mac computer. Both Apple computers came with a stunning graphical user interface. Wimps Side Note: Early MS-DOS diehards liked to refer to MacOS (Macintosh operating system)as \"WIMP\", an acronym for the Windows, Icons, Mice and Pointers interface. Competition As a new product, Microsoft Windows faced potential competition from IBM's own Top View, and others. VisiCorp's short-lived VisiOn, released in October 1983, was the official first PC-based GUI. The second was GEM (Graphics Environment Manager), released by Digital Research in early 1985. Both GEM and VisiOn lacked support from the all-important third-party developers. Since, if nobody wanted to write software programs for an operating system, there would be no programs to use, and nobody would want to buy it.\nMicrosoft finally shipped Windows 1.0 on November 20, 1985, almost two years past the initially promised release date.",

      "text": "Excel lets you control the number of decimal places displayed by data. \nThe options for displaying decimals includes altering existing data using the ribbon setting the number of decimal places for existing data or for empty cells using the Format Cells dialog box Altering the default number of decimal places shown in all cells in a worksheet \nIndividual or groups of cells rather than have the text spread over multiple cells in the worksheet . \nFor numbers that are already entered on a worksheet, you can increase or decrease the number of places that are displayed after the decimal point by using the toolbar buttons. You can also specify the number of decimal places that you want to use when you apply a built-in number format to the cells or data. To have Excel enter the decimal points for you, you can specify a fixed decimal point for numbers. \nSelect the cell or range of cells that contains the numbers for which you want to change the decimal places. \ncontinue reading below our video 9 Tips to Extend Your Phone's Battery cell rather than have the text spread over multiple cells in the worksheet . Increase or decrease the decimal places on a worksheet \nOn the Formatting toolbar, do one of the following: Click Increase Decimal Button image to display more digits after the decimal point Click Decrease Decimal Button image to display fewer digits after the decimal point In cell E1 type the text: Monthly Expenses and press the Enter key on the keyboard. By entering data into E1 the label in cell D1 should be cut off at the end of cell D1. As well, the text in E1 should spill over into the cell to the right. To correct the problems with these labels, drag select cells D1 and E1 on the spreadsheet to highlight them. Click on the Home tab. Click on the Wrap Text button on the ribbon . The labels in cells D1 and E1 should now both be fully visible with the text broken into two lines with no spill over into adjacent cells. Specify the decimal places for a built-in number format On the Format menu, click Cells, and then click the Number tab. Click Decrease Decimal Button image to display fewer digits after the decimal point In the Category list, click Number, Currency, Accounting, Percentage, or Scientific.. In the Decimal places box, enter the number of decimal places that you want to display. To correct the problems with these labels, drag select cells D1 and E1 on the spreadsheet to highlight them. Click on the Home tab. Click on the Wrap Text button on the ribbon . The labels in cells D1 and E1 should now both be fully visible with the text broken into two lines with no spill over into adjacent cells. Specify a fixed decimal point for numbers \nOn the Formatting toolbar, do one of the following: On the Tools menu, click Options. On the Edit tab, select the Fixed decimal check box. In the Places box, enter a positive number for digits to the right of the decimal point or a negative number for digits to the left of the decimal point In the Decimal places box, enter the number of decimal places that you want to display. To correct the problems with these labels, drag select cells D1 and E1 on the spreadsheet to highlight them. Click on the Home tab. Click on the Wrap Text button on the ribbon . The labels in cells D1 and E1 should now both be fully visible with the text broken into two lines with no spill over into adjacent cells. For example, if you enter 3 in the Places box and then type 2834 in a cell, the value will be 2.834. If you enter -3 in the Places box and then type 283 in a cell, the value will be 283000. Click OK. The FIX indicator appears in the status bar. On the worksheet, click a cell, and then type the number that you want. Note The data that you typed before you selected the Fixed decimal check box is not affected. Tips To temporarily override the fixed decimal option, type a decimal point when you type the number. To remove decimal points from numbers that you already entered with fixed decimals: On the Edit tab of the Options dialog box, clear the Fixed decimal check box. In an empty cell, type a number such as 10, 100, or 1,000, depending on the number of decimal places that you want to remove. For example, type 100 in the cell if the numbers contain two decimal places and you want to convert them to whole numbers. Click Copy Button image (or press CTRL+C) to copy the cell to the Clipboard, and then select the cells that contain the numbers with decimal places. On the Edit menu, click Paste Special, and then click Multiply.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book 2 news, specs and release date: Big changes to address customer complaints",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft Official) Shown in the photo is the current Surface Book. The Surface Book 2 has yet to be made available. \nChanges are expected for the upcoming installment of Microsoft's Surface Book after users complained about the device's functionality. \nReports indicated that users of the Microsoft Surface Book all faced similar problems surrounding its design. With the negative feedback regarding the device, many are expecting the company to have a fix for these problems in the upcoming product. \nOne of these problems was the Surface Book's hinge. Many were complaining that the hinge did not allow the device to close, allowing for dirt to enter it. This brought about a lot of criticism from users and is one of the things that Microsoft will reportedly be changing. \nThat being said, the new Surface Book is said to address this by presenting a big change to the line. Microsoft will apparently be turning the hinge into a standard one in order to fix the problem. With that, many can look forward to a better device that will also be more aesthetically pleasing. Advertisement \nThe upcoming Surface Book 2 is said to be similar to its predecessor in terms of some of its aesthetics too. However, a lot of other improvements are expected. It was stated that the new model will allow for better graphics, reaching up to 3840 x 2160 pixels. In addition, it will likely include Intel's new Kaby Lake processor which will boost the device's performance. The battery life of the device is also going to be improved. \nSince the device also features the highly acclaimed Surface Pen, innovations on the accessory are expected as well. With that, Microsoft is said to include a built-in dock that will power up and recharge the additional gadget. This change is pivotal for the franchise, as the Surface Pen is one of the device's selling points. \nHowever, there has yet to be any news on the official specs of the upcoming device. Many are expecting it to be unveiled early 2017. Fans will have to wait for more updates on the matter.  ",

      "text": "Advertisement Microsoft Surface Pro 5 boasts superior specs than Apple’s iPad Pro2, to be released early 2017 By Harsh Soni Nov 12, 2016 09:11 AM EST Advertisement \n(Photo : Wikimedia Commons)Latest leaks of Kaby Lake specifications suggest processors for hybrids and over hundred designs are expected to launch by last quarter of 2016 \nAdvertisement \n\nWith Black Friday coming up, various deals are now being offered for many devices. Many reports said that users should turn a blind eye on the deals for the Surface Pro 4 as the release of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is just around the corner. \nWe all know that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 was noticeably left out from the recent Microsoft event, but fans still believe that the hybrid device is indeed arriving very soon. \nThough the tech giant has not confirmed the improvement of the Surface Pro 5 rumors but the speculations and leaks about the device are abounding. The upcoming hybrid seems to rock the hybrid portable enterprise device market next year. Advertisement \nThe rumors are pointing that Microsoft will be releasing a hybrid device that will be equipped with Intel's Kaby Lake processors. The Microsoft's decision to apparently release Surface Pro 5 early 2017 instead of late 2016 appears to target the release of Intel's latest processor. \nSurface Pro 5, with Kaby Lake chips, would stand far beyond than its competitor especially the upcoming Apple iPad Pro 2, which is also rumored to be released in early 2017. Another reason why Surface Pro 5 release date pushed to 2017 also includes the Windows 10 Redstone 2 OS arrival, which is also scheduled for early 2017. \nThe next-gen Microsoft tablet is expected to pack in a 16GB of RAM and powered by Intel's Kaby Lake processor as said earlier. Surface Pro 5 is also expected to feature the Nvidia Pascal GPU card as well as the enhanced battery with USB-C support, reports iDigital Times . \nAccording to Inquisitr , Surface Pro 5 is equipped with as much as 1TB of storage and 16GB of RAM, while Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro currently tops at 256GB of storage and 4GB of RAM \nOne thing that would definitely give the Surface Pro 5 a definitive edge over the iPad Pro 2 is the operating system used in the two devices. The iPad Pro 2 would most likely still run iOS , a mobile operating system. This severely cripples the device, since even basic tasks such as working on multiple MS Word documents would prove tricky on the iPad Pro 2. \nMicrosoft's Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro of Apple Inc. were two of the most awaited tablets that were released in 2015. The Surface Pro 4 was unveiled at the beginning of October 2015, and one month later, the iPad Pro rolled out, according to Load The Game , now the rivalry to be seen between the Surface Pro 5 and the iPad Pro 2. \nAccording to AutoWorldNews , Microsoft Surface Pro 5's base model will be starting at $899. The 4K UHD model will come with a steep price tag of $1,599, if rumors proved to be true. \n",

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nApple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Nordstrom ( JWN ) have been hovering near their buy zones as Walt Disney ( DIS ) and Facebook ( FB ) are moving opposite in ways at their 200-day lines. Apple \nApple has been hovering in and out of buy range from a 110.33 buy point initially cleared Sept. 14, but ultimately finished the week below that level, at 108.43. Big tech names in general have not joined the Trump rally as investors pivot to other sectors like defense, banks and basic materials. Microsoft \nFellow tech giant Microsoft rebounded from support at its 50-day line, closing the week at 59.02, back above a 58.80 buy point after falling just below the pivot on Thursday. The stock is about 4% below its high reached Oct. 25. Nordstrom \nAfter retaking its 50-day line, department store Nordstrom is now extended past its 5% buy range. The stock gapped up 7% Thursday to re-clear a 53.81 flat base entry as rival department stores were bullish on the holidays. Nordstrom extended gains Friday on its estimate-beating quarterly report, closing the week 16.5% higher. Walt Disney \nDisney retook its downward-sloping 200-day line after issuing its quarterly report late Thursday. The media powerhouse missed earnings estimates, and its ESPN subscriber woes continue. But the stock is rising as CEO Bob Iger is bullish on ESPN's future. Facebook \nFacebook, on the other hand, has been heading toward its 200-day line and dipped below that level intraday on Thursday and Friday, but ended the week above that level. The move came shortly after Facebook crumbled below its 50-day line as the social media leader projected decelerating ad revenue growth in 2017.

      "text": "No matter how minor an update, if it brings great new things or improvements to your digital life, then they should be welcomed with open arms. If you use Microsoft apps, you know that they regularly bring updates as they try to build their reputation as an app developer, which in fairness to them, they are actually doing a great job. Today, it’s the turn of Arrow Launcher, an Android personal launcher, and OneDrive, the cloud storage service, to receive some tweaks and turns.\nVersion 2.6 of the Arrow Launcher brings a few changes that long-time users may find useful. You can now customize the size of your icons, which is apparently one of the most requested features in the app. You can now also put shortcuts for apps on the apps page. The widgets page is also now back so you can have a dedicated page just for them. They also promised that memory usage has been optimized so it’s “more memory efficient than ever”, and of course the usual bug fixes and improvements.\nMeanwhile, over at OneDrive, they also have a couple of new features for version 4.6. When you take a photo of a whiteboard after a meeting or a planning session and you upload it to OneDrive, it will automatically clean up the image for you. Then you’ll be able to send it to your colleagues and collaborate on whatever it is you discussed. If you’re using OneDrive for Business, every time someone shares a file with you or one of your teammates edits a file that you shared with them, you’ll get a notification.\nIf you don’t have either Arrow Launcher or OneDrive yet, you might want to give them a try in case you’re looking for an Android launcher or a cloud storage service respectively. Go and download them though their Google Play Store pages.",

According to a report in 9to5 Mac, some Asus Chromebook Flip users faced problems while using Microsoft’s apps including Word, PowerPoint, Word and Excel. They were greeted with a message saying the app was ‘unsupported on this device’. This has led to some thinking Microsoft has blocked access for select Chromebook devices. However, the company has clarified the glitch could be because the Play Store for Office suite for Android is still in beta phase. In a statement to 9to5 Mac, the company said it is working to improve the experience. \n“Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability,” Microsoft told the site. \nThe report talks about restrictions that Microsoft has put on Office for Android. As per the company, Chromebook users with a display larger than 10.1-inches will be using a restricted version of the suite. Also, users will need a subscription to Office 365 to print, create or edit documents. While Asus Flip users can enjoy free access to Office suite on the device, they’ll need a subscription to to so on another device. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd ",

      "text": "Nintendo NES Classic Edition Sold Out, Scalpers Taking Advantage Of The Demand? Microsoft Xbox One Outsold Sony PS4? By Pets Torrefranca ,   09:00 am PS4 VS Xbox One VS Nintendo WiiU, which is the best console in the console wars? (Photo : YouTube/Overwatch and Top 10 Videos) \nThe three titans of gaming are hyping up the market as the holiday season approaches. Microsoft Xbox One is said to have surpassed Sony PS4 in console sales, while Nintendo is selling out the NES Classic Edition. Advertisement \nSony, Microsoft, and Nintendo are three of the biggest names when it comes to gaming. The so-called console wars between Microsoft Xbox One and the Sony PS4 have been going on ever since the last-gen consoles were launched. Nintendo, on the other hand, is just in the background making what it does best, creating fun video games. \nThe rivalry between Sony and Microsoft has now reached new heights. Both companies have just released their upgraded versions of their current consoles boasting speed and graphics enhancements. According to GSM Arena's article on November 11, 2016, Microsoft launched the Xbox One S and has been outselling the Sony PS4 in the US market for the past four months, with UK and Australia in the last two months. \nSony on the other side of the competition has just released what seems to be the company's most powerful console, the PS4 PRO. Sony's new console boasts of increased GPU, higher memory, and faster loading times. Sony also announced recently that they have surpassed the 47 million units sold but experienced a decline in operating income. Both companies also released software updates for their current consoles. \nWhile all of these are happening, the humble Nintendo is busy reproducing the classic edition of the NES or Nintendo Entertainment System. According to Forbes , the NES Classic Retro Edition sold out moments after announcements from Amazon regarding the availability of the console. \nNintendo has once again created the hottest item for the holiday season. Scalpers are currently taking advantage of the situation even though Nintendo promised to restock the market's NES inventory before the holidays. The latest NES posted on EBAY has a price tag of $4,999.00.   Classic USB NES Controller for PC $9.99",

      "text": "on Sunday November 13, 2016 @09:34AM from the fallout-from-flame-wars? dept. \"Preliminary results of a new Microsoft survey show nearly two-thirds of people surveyed had at least one negative online experience that had an impact on them in the real world , ranging from a loss of trust in others, increased stress or sleep deprivation,\" reports Computerworld. Microsoft's chief online safety officer writes: Both adults and teens said they became less trusting of others in the real world after a negative interaction online (adults: 31%, teens: 29%). Consequences to adults that outpaced those to teens included the older generation becoming less trusting of people online (42% of adults vs. 37% of youth), and a reluctance to participate in blogs and other online forums (23% of adults vs. 20% of teens)... The study, \"Civility, Safety and Interaction Online -- 2016,\" polled youth ages 13-17 and adults ages 18-74 in 14 countries... Half reported being \"extremely or very\" worried about online risks generally, with the most common concerns being unwanted contact (43%) and various forms of harassment (39%). Microsoft's blog post urges people to \"Embrace digital civility and model healthy behaviors for young people both online and off\" -- and also notes that today is World Kindness Day .",

      "text": "Bill Veghte, \nTech veteran Bill Veghte, who's held executive positions at Microsoft and HP and been the CEO of SurveyMonkey, just emerged from his nearly year-long hiatus to announce his full-time job as executive chairman of a startup called Turbonomic.\nThis was surprising news for a bunch of reasons. For one, it's fairly unusual for a startup to hire an executive director from outside the company as a full-time job unless it's part of a bigger management shakeup. For another, Turbonomic has already had a couple of big management shakeups and its ship appears to be sailing well now.\nTurbonomic turns the $5 billion network management market on its head. It uses a \"supply and demand\" model to automatically match an app with the exact amount of computing and storage capacity it needs, changing that capacity as the app's needs grow or shrink, with no human intervention needed. \nThat's backwards from how this process typically works, where IT folks sort of guess at how much capacity an app needs, then use performance monitoring software to warn them when they need to tweak things. \nThe company has had a number of management shaekups. Back in 2013, boardmember and VC investor Ben Nye took over as CEO on an interim basis. Then he stayed on permanently and tells us he has no intention of leaving now.  \nSince Nye took over,  Turbonomic has been on a tear,  Nye said. It's grown from  62 employees to 420, he said, and had 2015 revenue of $44.6 million, according to the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing private companies . Turbonomic currently  has about 1,600 customers and has had 25 consecutive quarters of growth, Nye said.  \nUntil about four months ago, Nye was both its CEO and a managing partner at Bain Capital Ventures. He's still at Bain as a VC but no longer managing the enterprise software investment practice that he founded. In terms of salary and pay, this was an expensive move, he jokes.  \n\"I had to go back to partners at Bain and say, hey listen, I think this is big idea and I think I need to go do this. They were quite gracious. It was expensive economically. If anyone is paying to go to work, believe me, I am,\" he jokes. \nDigging in But he wanted to dig in  to the startup for two reasons. First, he felt an obligation to the people he hired as interim CEO, many who came to work with  Nye directly. Nye is a five-times Forbes Midas List VC  who's backed successful companies like LinkedIn, DocuSign, SolarWinds, and Rapid7.  \nThe second is the same reason that he convinced  Veghte to join. They are both blown away by the technology created by founders Shmuel  Kliger and Yuri Rabover. \nBill Veghte, \"W hen someone takes a space you know well and all of the sudden they twist it and show it to you a new way, a little dopamine goes off in your head and you think, oh my god, this is going to be huge,\" Nye said.\n\"But these guys don’t know much about the financial side, or marketing side, and then you say, ok, I can help them with this.\"\n \nHe believes Turbonomic is solving a real and urgent need that can help companies save significant money. \"The average data center is more than 50% over-provisioned,\" says, meaning that companies buy and run far more computers and storage than they really need just to make sure their apps work well.  \nFor instance, one of the company's biggest clients now uses 775 terabytes fewer of memory and 2500 terabytes fewer of storage in just in two data centers, just by automatically right-sizing its apps, Nye says. \nTurbonomic  also works on clouds like Amazon Web Services and Google.  \nIn fact, this kind of automation is the big selling point for Google's App Engine cloud. And Google's automation tech came from a startup called Stackdrivers, a company Nye backed and sold to Google. \nLooking his children in the eye As for Veghte joining the company, that's another signal that  Turbonomic  is one to watch. \nVeghte has been in the tech industry for  three decades, cutting his teeth during the early years at Microsoft building products like Windows and Office. Then he ran HP's enterprise business and, as its COO, helped mastermind its split into two companies. He was also briefly CEO at SurveyMonkey, replacing one his friend Dave Goldberg after Goldberg's tragic death. \nBut he quit the CEO job and went back to the SurveyMonkey board early this year, citing a difference of opinion on strategy. \nBill Veghte, He's spent the last few months traveling the world and checking out everything from startups to VC roles, he told Business Insider, and could have gone anywhere. \nBut, unlike his short-lived CEO role at SurveyMonkey, which was competing in an unfamiliar market,  Turbonomic's tech is 100% in  Veghte's wheelhouse. And Nye lobbied hard to get him to join.  \nWhile at Microsoft, he helped to create System Center, the monitoring software that  Turbonomic now competes with.  Veghte says that this type of old-fashioned software created \"a freakin' hairball\"  out of today's data centers.  Turbonomic not only fixes, but can  help save the planet by allowing companies to use less data center equipment — meaning less energy.\nAfter taking time off, he realized he can't fix all the world's problems, but he loves technology and knows how to do build it.\n\"I can make the world a better place by building great technologies that use a lot less carbon emissions, so I can look my children in they eye,\" he says.\nNOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies \n",

      "text": "Tech veteran Bill Veghte, who's held executive positions at Microsoft and HP and been the CEO of SurveyMonkey, just emerged from his nearly year-long hiatus to announce his full-time job as executive chairman of a startup called Turbonomic.\nThis was surprising news for a bunch of reasons. For one, it's fairly unusual for a startup to hire an executive director from outside the company as a full-time job unless it's part of a bigger management shakeup. For another, Turbonomic has already had a couple of big management shakeups and its ship appears to be sailing well now.\nTurbonomic turns the $5 billion network management market on its head. It uses a \"supply and demand\" model to automatically match an app with the exact amount of computing and storage capacity it needs, changing that capacity as the app's needs grow or shrink, with no human intervention needed. \nThat's backwards from how this process typically works, where IT folks sort of guess at how much capacity an app needs, then use performance monitoring software to warn them when they need to tweak things. \nThe company has had a number of management shaekups. Back in 2013, boardmember and VC investor Ben Nye took over as CEO on an interim basis. Then he stayed on permanently and tells us he has no intention of leaving now. \nSince Nye took over, Turbonomic has been on a tear, Nye said. It's grown from 62 employees to 420, he said, and had 2015 revenue of $44.6 million, according to the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing private companies . Turbonomic currently has about 1,600 customers and has had 25 consecutive quarters of growth, Nye said. \nUntil about four months ago, Nye was both its CEO and a managing partner at Bain Capital Ventures. He's still at Bain as a VC but no longer managing the enterprise software investment practice that he founded. In terms of salary and pay, this was an expensive move, he jokes. \n\"I had to go back to partners at Bain and say, hey listen, I think this is big idea and I think I need to go do this. They were quite gracious. It was expensive economically. If anyone is paying to go to work, believe me, I am,\" he jokes. \nDigging in But he wanted to dig in to the startup for two reasons. First, he felt an obligation to the people he hired as interim CEO, many who came to work with Nye directly. Nye is a five-times Forbes Midas List VC who's backed successful companies like LinkedIn, DocuSign, SolarWinds, and Rapid7. \nThe second is the same reason that he convinced Veghte to join. They are both blown away by the technology created by founders Shmuel Kliger and Yuri Rabover. \n\"W hen someone takes a space you know well and all of the sudden they twist it and show it to you a new way, a little dopamine goes off in your head and you think, oh my god, this is going to be huge,\" Nye said.\n\"But these guys don’t know much about the financial side, or marketing side, and then you say, ok, I can help them with this.\"\n\nHe believes Turbonomic is solving a real and urgent need that can help companies save significant money. \"The average data center is more than 50% over-provisioned,\" says, meaning that companies buy and run far more computers and storage than they really need just to make sure their apps work well. \nFor instance, one of the company's biggest clients now uses 775 terabytes fewer of memory and 2500 terabytes fewer of storage in just in two data centers, just by automatically right-sizing its apps, Nye says. \nTurbonomic also works on clouds like Amazon Web Services and Google. \nIn fact, this kind of automation is the big selling point for Google's App Engine cloud. And Google's automation tech came from a startup called Stackdrivers, a company Nye backed and sold to Google. \nLooking his children in the eye As for Veghte joining the company, that's another signal that Turbonomic is one to watch. \nVeghte has been in the tech industry for three decades, cutting his teeth during the early years at Microsoft building products like Windows and Office. Then he ran HP's enterprise business and, as its COO, helped mastermind its split into two companies. He was also briefly CEO at SurveyMonkey, replacing one his friend Dave Goldberg after Goldberg's tragic death. \nBut he quit the CEO job and went back to the SurveyMonkey board early this year, citing a difference of opinion on strategy. \nHe's spent the last few months traveling the world and checking out everything from startups to VC roles, he told Business Insider, and could have gone anywhere. \nBut, unlike his short-lived CEO role at SurveyMonkey, which was competing in an unfamiliar market, Turbonomic's tech is 100% in Veghte's wheelhouse. And Nye lobbied hard to get him to join. \nWhile at Microsoft, he helped to create System Center, the monitoring software that Turbonomic now competes with. Veghte says that this type of old-fashioned software created \"a freakin' hairball\" out of today's data centers. Turbonomic not only fixes, but can help save the planet by allowing companies to use less data center equipment — meaning less energy.\nAfter taking time off, he realized he can't fix all the world's problems, but he loves technology and knows how to do build it.\n\"I can make the world a better place by building great technologies that use a lot less carbon emissions, so I can look my children in they eye,\" he says.\n\nMore From Business Insider \nThe deadly roadside blunder that helped bring down one of Mexico's most vicious cartels \nScience says parents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common \nSilicon Valley was worried about the wrong bubble",

      "text": "It is currently only available on iOS for iPhone. \nMicrosoft researchers study lung cancer risks by analyzing web search data \nMicrosoft is continuing its fight against cancer, after initially researching Pancreatic Cancer. Now, they’ve turned their heads towards lung cancer. The company is looking for preventative measures in order to help stop lung cancer before it even begins, rather than focusing on treatments after a person has lung cancer. \nMicrosoft Research will use an algorithm along with anonymized data to link potential risks and health symptoms. \nMicrosoft releases statement on Trump’s election win \nFollowing the surprise election win by Donald Trump this week in 2016 US elections, Microsoft has issued a statement . \nMicrosoft CEO, Satya Nadella, made the first part of the statement via LinkedIn: \nYesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. With that in mind and looking to the future, Brad Smith today outlined in a blog Microsoft’s thoughts and recommendations for the new Administration and Congress. \nPresident and Chief Legal Office, Brad Smith, also made a statement on the Microsoft website. \nMicrosoft issues battery fixes for Surface Pro 3 via newest firmware update \nAfter reports of battery issues on Microsoft’s Surface Pro 3, the company has now released its first firmware update since August, which fixes issues reported with the battery . \nv38.11.50.0 corrects an error that may occur on a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices where the full charge capacity of the battery is misreported to the operating system and device firmware. This update corrects the firmware component that functions as a “fuel gauge” so that the battery capacity is accurately reported. See Surface Pro 3 Battery FAQ for more information. \nBing Predicts missed badly on the U.S. elections, and here’s Microsoft’s response \nBing Predicts is used to predict the result in many areas, such as sports and politics, but for the US election in 2016, it got its prediction wrong . Instead of Hillary Clinton winning, Donald Trump did. In response, Microsoft has provided a statement regarding Bing Predicts: \nBing Predicts uses several sources including search, web, social data, third-parties and more to inform predictions. True to the nature of all predictions, we can never guarantee 100% accuracy. \nThat’s it for this week – we’ll be back next week with more!",

      "text": "Second Surface Pro 3 Battery Issue Fixed By Microsoft  23 PST \nWe first found out that there was a battery issue with the Surface Pro 3 earlier this year. Microsoft looked into the matter and confirmed that it didn’t have anything to do with the hardware itself and that it could be fixed through a firmware update. An update was then released after several weeks to take care of the issue, however, a second issue soon cropped up. Microsoft has now taken care of the second Surface Pro 3 battery issue through a firmware update. \nMicrosoft confirmed the second battery issue with the Surface Pro 3 in September. It came soon after the company released a fix for a different battery issue that this device was facing. It was more or less the same issue, some users were facing rapid battery degradation. \nMicrosoft has now sent out a firmware update for the Surface Pro 3 which addresses this issue once and for all. It’s meant for users who have a Surface Pro 3 that features an LGC battery. It says that this issue affects a “limited number” of Surface Pro 3 owners who experienced that “their battery can no longer hold a charge, and it looks like the battery capacity has diminished.” \nThe company says that this update corrects the logic in the firmware component that basically acts like a fuel gauge for the battery so that the actual battery capacity is properly reported. “System Firmware Update — 11/7/2016” is now being rolled out by Microsoft for the Surface Pro 3. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "New Razer Blade Available Now From Microsoft Store By Adnan Farooqui on 11/13/2016 07:42 PST \nRazer’s new notebook is now available for purchase from the Microsoft Store. The company launched the updated version of its Blade notebook a few weeks ago. Razer has been selling it directly to customers since then but if someone wants to pick one up via Microsoft’s online store, they can now do that. Microsoft’s online store is offering the Razer Blade notebook in two different configurations. \nThe updated Razer Blade notebook is powered by the latest Core i7-6700HQ processor from Intel coupled with 16GB of RAM. It features a full HD 14 inch display as well as an NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics processor which makes this notebook ready for virtual reality . The Razer Blade is powered by Windows 10. \nAll of this is packaged inside a body that measures 0.7 inches thick and comes in at just 4 pounds. No major changes have been made to the design of the notebook, everything that’s worth paying good money for is packaged inside the shell. \nMicrosoft’s online store is selling the new Razer Blade with 512GB SSD for $1,999 and with a 1TB solid-state drive for $2,399. Interestingly, the 512GB configuration is already listed as out of stock so it’s unclear how long it’s going to take for this particular model to be back in stock. \nFiled in Computers .

      "title": "Why Did Windows 10 Flop?",
      "text": "Tweet \nWhen Windows 10 was first released by Microsoft, the company was so keen on expanding its userbase and doing away with older versions that it came as a free upgrade for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 users. Despite all of these efforts, there are still many people (likely including you or someone you know) who continue to rely on older versions. The market share for the newest version of the operating system for the majority of 2016 has hovered around seventeen percent , while Windows 7’s market share still gobbles around half of all systems. \nThis isn’t necessarily a good sign, obviously, but it also leaves us with one very important question: how did things get this way? We’re Experiencing the XP-To-Vista Phenomenon All Over Again \nWindows XP was arguably one of the most successful iterations of its family with roughly ten percent of the entire world still hooked up to it in 2016 (according to the NetMarketShare stat linked earlier) despite Microsoft refusing to continue supporting the system with updates since April 2014. Attempts have been made to plug the security holes the OS had and Vista came out with in early 2007. \nBecause of its clunky interface and resource-hungry applications, people continued to favor the operating system that Microsoft had released six years prior. Then along came Windows 7 in 2009, and many of the issues plaguing Vista have been solved, reaching new heights in popularity with a sleeker graphical interface and more organized buttons and gizmos. It was user-friendly, had a more temperate approach to memory usage, and played well with older programs that had been designed for XP. It was, in essence, the worthy successor. \nThe release of Windows 8 was more of a “let’s try something new because why not?” approach. Its impact created lots of controversy with the removal (and subsequent replacement in 8.1) of the Start menu and a more touch-friendly interface (on systems in which the vast majority of screens did not have touch capability). As of October 2016, this OS’ market share is below XP’s (by that time, XP was 15 years old). \nWindows 10 was an attempt to fix this and herald a new era that would name a successor to 7. Alas, the main attitude of users was “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Windows 7 continued to gain market share despite every effort possible to wave the newer version in front of everyone with a screen. Then Came The Rumors and Controversies \nWindows 8 wasn’t the only attempt at a successor that was mired in controversy. From rumors of spying to actual founded accusations of intense data mining on its users , Microsoft had a lot to answer for when reporters began prying into Windows 10 with a more sober perspective. \nThe controversies didn’t end there. In an attempt to push installation of the operating system further than a simple “we’re offering it for free,” the update that would install the new version on systems running Windows 7 and 8 went from being optional to receiving a “recommended” status. Although it may be argued that updates can be rejected, default systems would often install recommended updates automatically. Some people have restarted their systems only to later discover that Windows 10 was installed without their permission. \nThese controversies have ultimately demolished the popularity of an operating system that would have otherwise been promising. Even more troubling for Microsoft is the fact that Linux is becoming an easier alternative for mainstream users to adapt to. The strengthening of this operating system could cause long-term problems if Microsoft doesn’t adapt quickly to the demands of their userbase. There’s a reason they keep using Windows 7 just as there is an equally relevant reason why an increasing number of people are just kicking the franchise out of their systems and installing Linux distributions (which compose roughly seven percent of 2016’s market share). \nWhat if Microsoft decided to stop support for Windows 7 someday? Would you switch to the next best thing or abandon the OS entirely and go for a Mac or Linux setup? Tell us in a comment! Is this article useful? No The Complete Beginner's Guide to Ubuntu 16.04 \nAre you tired of using Windows or OS X as your operating system and thinking of trying out, and possibly switching, to Linux? In this Complete Beginner's Guide to Ubuntu 16.04 ebook, we will guide you and show you everything you need to know about Ubuntu - the most popular Linux distro.",

      "title": "Why two influential tech tycoons have fallen in love with a startup called Turbonomic",
      "text": "Tech veteran Bill Veghte, who's held executive positions at Microsoft and HP and been the CEO of SurveyMonkey, just emerged from his nearly year-long hiatus to announce his full-time job as executive chairman of a startup called Turbonomic.\nThis was surprising news for a bunch of reasons. For one, it's fairly unusual for a startup to hire an executive director from outside the company as a full-time job unless it's part of a bigger management shakeup. For another, Turbonomic has already had a couple of big management shakeups and its ship appears to be sailing well now.\nTurbonomic turns the $5 billion network management market on its head. It uses a \"supply and demand\" model to automatically match an app with the exact amount of computing and storage capacity it needs, changing that capacity as the app's needs grow or shrink, with no human intervention needed. \nThat's backwards from how this process typically works, where IT folks sort of guess at how much capacity an app needs, then use performance monitoring software to warn them when they need to tweak things. \nThe company has had a number of management shaekups. Back in 2013, boardmember and VC investor Ben Nye took over as CEO on an interim basis. Then he stayed on permanently and tells us he has no intention of leaving now. \nSince Nye took over, Turbonomic has been on a tear, Nye said. It's grown from 62 employees to 420, he said, and had 2015 revenue of $44.6 million, according to the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing private companies . Turbonomic currently has about 1,600 customers and has had 25 consecutive quarters of growth, Nye said. \nUntil about four months ago, Nye was both its CEO and a managing partner at Bain Capital Ventures. He's still at Bain as a VC but no longer managing the enterprise software investment practice that he founded. In terms of salary and pay, this was an expensive move, he jokes. \n\"I had to go back to partners at Bain and say, hey listen, I think this is big idea and I think I need to go do this. They were quite gracious. It was expensive economically. If anyone is paying to go to work, believe me, I am,\" he jokes. \nDigging in But he wanted to dig in to the startup for two reasons. First, he felt an obligation to the people he hired as interim CEO, many who came to work with Nye directly. Nye is a five-times Forbes Midas List VC who's backed successful companies like LinkedIn, DocuSign, SolarWinds, and Rapid7. \nThe second is the same reason that he convinced Veghte to join. They are both blown away by the technology created by founders Shmuel Kliger and Yuri Rabover. \n\"W hen someone takes a space you know well and all of the sudden they twist it and show it to you a new way, a little dopamine goes off in your head and you think, oh my god, this is going to be huge,\" Nye said.\n\"But these guys don’t know much about the financial side, or marketing side, and then you say, ok, I can help them with this.\"\n\nHe believes Turbonomic is solving a real and urgent need that can help companies save significant money. \"The average data center is more than 50% over-provisioned,\" says, meaning that companies buy and run far more computers and storage than they really need just to make sure their apps work well. \nFor instance, one of the company's biggest clients now uses 775 terabytes fewer of memory and 2500 terabytes fewer of storage in just in two data centers, just by automatically right-sizing its apps, Nye says. \nTurbonomic also works on clouds like Amazon Web Services and Google. \nIn fact, this kind of automation is the big selling point for Google's App Engine cloud. And Google's automation tech came from a startup called Stackdrivers, a company Nye backed and sold to Google. \nLooking his children in the eye As for Veghte joining the company, that's another signal that Turbonomic is one to watch. \nVeghte has been in the tech industry for three decades, cutting his teeth during the early years at Microsoft building products like Windows and Office. Then he ran HP's enterprise business and, as its COO, helped mastermind its split into two companies. He was also briefly CEO at SurveyMonkey, replacing one his friend Dave Goldberg after Goldberg's tragic death. \nBut he quit the CEO job and went back to the SurveyMonkey board early this year, citing a difference of opinion on strategy. \nHe's spent the last few months traveling the world and checking out everything from startups to VC roles, he told Business Insider, and could have gone anywhere. \nBut, unlike his short-lived CEO role at SurveyMonkey, which was competing in an unfamiliar market, Turbonomic's tech is 100% in Veghte's wheelhouse. And Nye lobbied hard to get him to join. \nWhile at Microsoft, he helped to create System Center, the monitoring software that Turbonomic now competes with. Veghte says that this type of old-fashioned software created \"a freakin' hairball\" out of today's data centers. Turbonomic not only fixes, but can help save the planet by allowing companies to use less data center equipment — meaning less energy.\nAfter taking time off, he realized he can't fix all the world's problems, but he loves technology and knows how to do build it.\n\"I can make the world a better place by building great technologies that use a lot less carbon emissions, so I can look my children in they eye,\" he says.\n\n  \nThe deadly roadside blunder that helped bring down one of Mexico's most vicious cartels \nScience says parents of unsuccessful kids could have these 6 things in common \nSilicon Valley was worried about the wrong bubble",

      "text": "Cortana Will Soon Be Released In South Korea   08:01 PST \nIt has been over a year since Microsoft unveiled its digital personal assistant called Cortana . It has gradually made its way to more Windows-powered devices by Microsoft and the company has gradually been rolling it out in more countries across the globe. Microsoft is working to expand Cortana to more countries and the company has confirmed that its digital personal assistant is soon going to be released for its users based in South Korea. \nMicrosoft has already said that South Korea, China, and Japan are its primary markets in Asia and it previously hinted that the digital personal assistant might imminently be released in South Korea. \nMicrosoft has made Cortana available in thirteen different regions across the globe with support for eight different languages. The digital personal assistant is already available in China and Japan. \nWhile the company hasn’t provided a confirmed date yet, executive vice president of artificial intelligence and research at Microsoft Harry Shum has confirmed via Twitter that Cortana is coming to South Korea soon. \nConsidering the fact that Cortana is already available in two of the three key Asian markets for Microsoft, it’s only a matter of time before the company releases in South Korea as well. Even if it hasn’t confirmed a release date right now, it’s evident that Cortana will go live in South Korea sooner rather than later. Cortana is coming to Korea soon!

      "text": "Diffinity is a feature-rich yet lightweight free diff and merging program for PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system.\nSo-called diff tools highlight differences of plain text files. The author of Diffinity put the focus on source code files and there on making diffs as easy to read as possible.\nWhile that is the case, you may load any plain text file and even binary files in the application to see all the differences between those two loaded files.\nNote : Diffinity is a .NET application and as such requires the Microsoft .Net Framework 4.5.1.\nDiffinity \nDiffinity's interface is well designed. You start with a click on open to load two plain text files using the program. The application displays the program's side by side in its interface and uses color coding to highlight differences right away.\nWhile that is helpful already, it is linking these differences so that you know exactly where things are not identical but different.\nYou may want to click on the number button in the interface to enable line numbers as they may be useful when you are comparing these two text files.\nThat's not the only option that you have though. You can hide whitespace differences that are highlighted in blue with a click on the whitespace button, or enable syntax colors which is highly beneficial if you compare two source code files.\nSyntax colors are supported for several programming and scripting languages including php, xml, java, html, cpp, css, or .vbproj.\nYou can use buttons to jump to the next or previous diff in a file, or use keyboard shortcuts instead if you prefer to use the keyboard for that. There is obivously also an option to scroll the text, or use the zoomed representations on the left side of both text files to jump to that section.\nThis section is color coded as well so that you see the differences there without having to display that part of the code or text.\nDiffinity supports copy operations on top of that. All that is required for that is to select a block on the left or right, and click on the copy left or right button afterwards. The program adds the block to the other file that is loaded then.\nLoaded files can be saved directly, which overwrites them, or saved as another file instead using the save menu.\nYou may want to go through the preferences section on first start as it holds several interesting options.\nThe preferences allow you to change colors manually or by loading one of the available presets. Other options include changing font settings used in the editor, change word delimiters, or enable several selection based options such as ignoring case or matching only whole words.\nClosing Words Diffinity is an excellent program for Microsoft Windows device. It loads quickly and displays differences as soon as it starts. While that may differ for very large files, it had no performance issues with light to medium sized files.\nNow You: Do you use diff software?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Diffinity diff and merging program for Windows appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "4chan /pol/ board hackers that corrupted Microsoft’s Tay try their hand at Loebner prize winning Mitsuku Chatbot, and fail DATE: 2016–11–13 16:26:03\nYou may remember back in March this year when Microsoft unleashed Tay, an Artificially Intelligent chatbot, onto Twitter. Tay learnt its knowledge by interacting with users, and in less than a day the A.I. had been corrupted by a group of hackers from the /pol/ board on 4chan who corrupted the chatbot by teaching it to be racist and sexist.\n4chan is an open imageboard website where users can post anonymously. The 4chan /pol/ board is the Politically Incorrect board on the 4chan website which has become notoriously racist and offensive. Due to the ability of users to post anonymously, the website has become a free for all where people can get away with posting almost anything with no accountability.\nRecently I wrote an article about Mitsuku, an A.I. chatbot developed by Steve Worswick that won the most human like A.I. in the Loebner prize this year . On the 20th of April, Steve began to notice that Mitsuku was receiving an unusual amount of traffic. In normal circumstances when this happens, Mitsuku has usually been featured in an article somewhere on the internet, but this was the not case.\nUnlike Tay, when Mistuku learns, she learns locally and emails Steve who will decide whether the information she has learnt should be incorporated into her global knowledge base. Steve had begun to receive a lot of emails from Mitsuku about information that she had been taught which included information about Hitler, feminists, and various offensive comments. It was not long before Steve received a Google alert which pointed him towards the direction of the /pol/ board on 4chan and he was able to locate the culprit thread that was attempting to corrupt Mitsuku.\nThroughout the day Steve followed the thread and sat back and watched as people posted screen shots of what they had taught Mitsuku, gloating about how they had corrupted the A.I. Steve had posted several comments informing people that in fact Mitsuku had not been compromised, and that none of the offensive information had made it to Mitsuku’s global knowledge base, these comments seemed to be ignored as the board members continued to post screen shots glorifying the fruits of their labor.\nAt one point there were 100 concurrent users interacting with Mitsuku, which was above the norm of roughly 10–20. The would be hackers were sending roughly 18,000 interactions per minute, almost 6 messages per second, in a bid to corrupt Mitsuku in the way they had succeeded with Tay. Due to the amazing technology at Pandorabots where Mitsuku is hosted, the increase in traffic posed no issues to the A.I. who was able to handle and respond to each and every input she was receiving.\nAfter about 4 or 5 hours, the 4chan hackers realized that their attempts to convert Mitsuku into a foul mouthed racist where having no affect globally and decided to call it a day and give up.\nOne of the features of the 4chan boards is that threads get deleted after a certain amount of time so the original thread was deleted. In July a different group of hackers on the 4chan website who were unaware of the earlier failed attempts, decided to try exactly the same thing. Again thanks to Mitsuku’s supervised learning, their efforts were a total waste of time and Mitsuku was left unharmed and uncorrupted. Once again in November, yet another group attempted to corrupt Mitsuku with the same outcome. The (very offensive) thread from the hack attempt is, at this moment, still online and available on the following link: Click Here To View The 4chan Thread . Eventually, this thread will be deleted, and so no doubt they will try once more (and fail) to corrupt Mitsuku.",

      "text": "E-mail \nThe 15th anniversary of Halo is almost here, and Microsoft is already teasing us ahead of the date, where they look set to reveal something via their upcoming live stream. \nTo get us excited, they’ve released a teaser for the stream (below), and you’ll have to tune in at 3:43PT on Tuesday, November 15th to see what’s going on. With 15 years of Halo 1, not forgetting the 12th birthday of Halo 2, which happened on the 9th of this month, we’re eager to see what is coming too, and we think we have a rough idea what to expect too. \n“The studio is working on a number of cool things to help celebrate this huge milestone which also happens to coincide with the 15 th anniversary of Xbox itself,” said Brian ‘ske7ch’ Jarrard in the announcement. “Mark your calendars now and please plan to join us throughout the day as we collectively celebrate and offer a huge thanks to our community for supporting Halo for 15 years!” \nThe trailer has music from Halo 3, which we already know featured in the MCC, but it wasn’t exactly remastered or anywhere near as polished as the Halo 1 and 2 releases the bundle included. Since the launch, there have been cries far and wide for a real Halo 3 remaster. Halo 5: Forge is still pulling its weight on PC too, but there are many features missing. Will we see Halo hit the PC in the same way that Forza: Apex helped bridge that series to Windows? We really want to be right on this one, so fingers crossed.",

Adactin with the Anztb Certified Testing company is Australia Which Providing this course by the testing professionals Getting Started with Coded UI Automation Tool Software testers revere the high level language support offered by Coded UI automation tool. It is a known fact that software testers prefer learning VB Script (used by QTP [presently known as UFT] and Test Complete automation tools), as it is easy compared to other languages such as Java, C# or VB.NET. Software testers who have knowledge of writing code in object-oriented programming language (OOPL) especially prefer using Coded UI automation tool. Why Coded UI is a Smart Choice in Test Automation The robust capabilities of Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server (TFS) have made them hot favorites among software developers. Developers utilize both these tools to create superior software applications. The combined usage of TFS, Visual Studio and its testing tools augments the process of agile development. Here are few reasons why Coded UI tool is a preferred choice for software testers: Software testers and Developers can work using the same tools/language, which enables them to collaborate effectively. The Coded UI automation tool supports both web and windows projects, as both C# and VB.NET are known for their robustness. The element identification mechanism is a powerful feature in Coded UI. Coded UI strongly supports Synchronization. The Playback Engine supports features such as ‘WaitForReadyLevel’, ‘WaitForControlExist’ etc., it makes the test execution stop till UI Threads or All Threads are ready. Automation tests can be run on remote machines with the help of ‘Tests Agents’. Coded UI supports AJAX controls. Descriptive Programming is another impressive feature supported by Coded UI tool, which allows software testers to automate scenarios based on object properties. There’s no need to wait for the user interface to record/assert scenarios. Coded UI allows developing an extensive test suite and performing tests in local environments. Using Coded UI with layered framework, automation teams can develop sophisticated tests. Utilizing Log4net.dll, software testers can log the results and capture exceptions in an effective manner. Adactin is an ANZTB Certified software testing company in Australia which provide the microfost coded ui testing training and services for more information about this company go through this link http://www.adactin.com/training/courses/functional-automation/test-automation-microsoft-using-coded-%20ui/ If you want to buy online book visit at https://www.amazon.com/dp/0992293545/ref=cm_sw_su_dp",

Joe Bacaron Nov 13, 2016 10:56 AM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Evan Blass \nThe news and rumors on the Microsoft Surface phone have been silent these past few days, but a new leak surfaced about what can be expected from the smart phone when it releases in a few months' time. \nAccording to notorious tipster, Evan Blass , the new Microsoft Surface phone will be \"powered by a laptop-class Intel processor, would this have blown your mind?\" \nThis seemed to confirmed previous rumors on news sites about the Microsoft Surface phone being powered by Intel. If this is true, the company is really sending a message to its competitors out in the market to step up their game. \nAs to the Microsoft Surface phone specs, there's not much to go expect for the rumors that have been circulating for a while now. \nAccording to PCAdvisor , early reports on the device revealed that it will follow the lead of the Surface tablet with a \"squared metallic design. The size would be about 5.5 inches and the display will feature AMOLED tech with resolution of 1440 x 2560p.   \nIn terms of memory, the phone will reportedly have 4GB of RAM along with either 64GB or 128GB of storage, which can be expanded through the microSD card slot. The phone will be running 64-bit Intel processor. The main camera at the back will reportedly feature 21 megapixel, although there's no report if it will have dual lens. The front snapper, meanwhile, will be 8 megapixel. \nFor price of the Microsoft Surface phone, it will reportedly range between $700 and $1,100. \nTune in for more Microsoft Surface phone news and rumors, particularly on the release date and specs, which will be published here when they become available ahead of the release date, which is expected in the spring of 2017.",

      "text": "\nBrief : Apparently, Open Source alternatives to Microsoft Office is not good enough for Brazil and thus they are reverting to proprietary Microsoft Office and other Microsoft tools. \nThe latest trend in Europe and developing countries was to ditch proprietary Microsoft Office and adopt an Open Source solution such as OpenOffice or LibreOffice . The move was more concerned with cost saving than for the love of Open Source. Whatever may be the reason, at least several government organizations have started to look beyond Microsoft.\nBut perhaps the euphoria died for some of them. Brazil that had opted for an open source policy is now reverting to Microsoft in an attempt to “generate cost efficiencies and standardize the IT applications portfolio across departments”, reported ZDNet .\nYes, you read that right. Brazil is opting for Microsoft for ‘cost efficiency’. It’s actually a deal with Microsoft that will allow the Brazilian government to buy Microsoft product licenses as per their requirement in the next 12 months, at a previously negotiated price.\nAnd it’s not just Microsoft Office that they are getting. The deal includes Windows 10 and Windows Server (huh!!).\nWith this massive deal, Brazil departs from their Open Source policy put in place in the year 2003. The idea behind the open source switch was to reduce licensing costs and allow local IT companies to develop products for the government but apparent ‘lack of skills and interest’ led to the demise of this policy as the government struggled to get quality software.\nNot just Brazil It’s not just Brazil that is going back into the arms of Microsoft. Remember Italian region Emilia-Romagna switching to OpenOffice ? Well, they are also going back to Microsoft Office , though, it’s not specified to be Microsoft but a proprietary cloud-based solution.\nThe open source move was already criticized by some of our readers and I had my suspicion as well. OpenOffice has not been in active development mode for last few years. In fact, OpenOffice has started indicating that it might be discontinued .\nLibreOffice would have been the better choice here to replace MS Office. But the governments being the government, opted for the wrong Open Source solution. I do believe that had they opted for LibreOffice, things would have been better, specially considering that LibreOffice has worked a lot on its cloud solution .\nThese are not good news for us Open Source enthusiasts but I am rooting for the further success of LibreOffice so that it becomes the de facto alternative to MS Office and a ‘better one’ than that.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Surface table (now PixelSense) was always a great technology held back by the massive cost of having such a huge high-resolution multi-touch screen.\nNow Microsoft has applied for a new patent “INTERACTIVE INTEGRATED DISPLAY AND PROCESSING DEVICE” which should make the technology cheaper and more realistic for mass adoption.\nThe patent describes an integrated PC and projector with sensors (such as a camera or IR depth sensors) which could be placed on a surface such as a large table and then turn that table into a large-screened computing device.\nMicrosoft writes:\nOften, users of computing devices need to share information with other users and collaborate on common information. Various information sharing services allow users of their computing devices to exchange information. Many services provide some form of visualization for this information exchange.\nThe technology, roughly described, includes an integrated processing and projection device which can rest on a supporting surface provides interactivity between users. The interactivity is provided in a projected display area projected by the device on the supporting surface. The integrated processing and projection device includes a processor and a projector designed to provide a display on the supporting surface of the device. Various sensors enable object and gesture detection in the display area. An interactive service, provided using the device or a network connected host, enables users of companion processing devices to interact in the display area of the integrated processing and projection device using the companion devices, via an interface in the display provide by the projector. Users without companion devices can interact with users of companion devices using an interface provided in the display area.\nAn integrated processing system includes a display projector provided in a housing adapted to be supported by a surface. The display projector is adapted to display an interface in a display area on the supporting surface. The system includes an RGB camera and an infrared emitter and detector, wherein the RGB camera and the infrared detector each have a field of view encompassing a detection area including at least the display area. The system includes a communication interface receiving input and providing output to associated devices. The system includes a processor and memory having code operable to instruct the processor to receive input from one or more associated devices via the communication interface, the input comprising at least data to be shared in the display area, and provide an output in the display area of the data to be shared based on input instructions from the one or more associated devices.\nLike many patents the idea is not very novel, but as described appears very practicable with currently available technology such as Kinect sensors and would of course be a lot cheaper than the $12,000 Surface Hub, while also not taking up much space when not in use, and being resistant to damage and dirt.\nThe patent was applied for in May 2015, and included staff from Microsoft’s Education workshop and marketing departments, presumably reflects some of Microsoft’s recent thinking and suggests we may see something like this marketed at schools in the future.\nThe full patent can be viewed here .",

      "text": "Retail Glossary - Terminology & Definitions Updated July 29, 2016 . \nThe Microsoft vision is an example of how a company mission statement that is big and vague can produce results that are hit and miss. To. (See the Microsoft corporate mission and values below.) Microsoft Founders Facts and Trivia: The Microsoft Company has its roots back in 1975 when Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen sold their first computer software called Altair BASIC to MITS Creative Electronics Company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates was 19 years old and Allen was 22. The first year’s revenue for Gates and Allen was about $16,000.The Microsoft name was first used in 1976 and the company was first incorporated in 1981. Microsoft Company Headquarters: Microsoft corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft Corporate Mission Statement and Values: The Microsoft mission statement is so big, that it fails to provide any clear direction about products, purpose, or specific outcomes. The corporate mission of Microsoft is: \"At Microsoft, our mission and values are to help people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential.” The Microsoft values do provide more definition about what’s important, but it is clear that Microsoft’s biggest failures are at least partially a result of leaders who didn’t value the company’s values. The Microsoft Values are... ”As a company, and as individuals, we value integrity, honesty, openness, personal excellence, constructive self-criticism, continual self-improvement, and mutual respect. We are committed to our customers and partners and have a passion for technology. We take on big challenges, and pride ourselves on seeing them through. We hold ourselves accountable to our customers, shareholders, partners, and employees by honoring our commitments, providing results, and striving for the highest quality.\" More About U.S. Company Mission Statements, History, and Headquarters:",

      "text": "Microsoft has partnered with Bahrain start-up accelerator CH9, to support the development of the SME sector in the Kingdom.\nThe two companies have signed an MoU, for Microsoft to support technology start-ups and provide cloud solutions for start-ups.\nAs part of its agreement with CH9, Microsoft will co-opt the business accelerator to work with the Microsoft Academic Programs in Bahrain.\nCH9 will become an official Microsoft BizSpark Network Partner. BizSpark is a Microsoft initiative aimed at businesses that are within their first five years of operations. Benefits to start-ups include mentorship sessions, best-practice advice and free software.\nRelated Articles Saudi tech start-ups to drive Kingdom's Vision 2030 Fourth edition of Sharjah Leadership Program launched A bold new frontier Company Articles FireEye iSIGHT now available in Windows Defender ATP Microsoft: Russian hackers behind Windows flaw Egypt launches Public Schools Portal\nUnder the MoU, CH9 will create a special incubation award for the winner of the Microsoft Bahrain Imagine Cup. The Imagine Cup is a worldwide annual competition held by Microsoft to encourage entrepreneurial spirit among college students.\n\"SMEs are the lifeblood of Gulf economies and regional incubator and accelerator units, like CH9, play a vital role in nurturing that potential - finding funding and helping start-ups build the momentum needed for long-term success,\" said Sherif Tawfik, country general manager, Microsoft Bahrain and Oman. \"We believe we have a lot to offer these SME ecosystems, by working with organisations like CH9 and bringing strategy and longevity to newly formed businesses. That is why we formed initiatives such as the Imagine Academy, YouthSpark and BizSpark; to identify talent early, help it grow and give it the means to keep going, so it can join the next generation of innovators.\"\n\"CH9 was formed to help business flourish and to promote Bahrain as a start-up hub,\" said Mohamed Altawash, founder and managing director, CH9. \"We have access to venture-capital and angel investors; we put business leaders in touch with people that can get them moving on their journey. We provide a platform that supports, teaches, encourages and inspires entrepreneurs. So when we encounter likeminded organisations such as Microsoft - organisations committed to the furtherance of innovation - it makes sense that we join forces and ask, ‘What can we do together, to support these start-ups and the vital role they play in our economy?'\"",

      "text": "Did you know that you can contact Microsoft tech support by phone if you are a Office 365 customer? They usually call back within the hour and do a great job in helping you out! I had months where I called them once a week and they put so much effort and time in the issue, it's incredible. I am extremely satisifed with their technicians! You should try it. – Daniel Jan 19 at 7:12 Daniel I did log tickets with MS support, but after two days of support and them not being able to give me a solution I posted here.. Sometimes MS support is great, others, the guys are vastly inexperienced. I had to explain to the guy which powershell commands to use to test that the TNEF was in fact disabled.. – leo_oz Jan 19 at 7:25 I'm sorry to hear that. While you wait for an answer from someone on serverfault, I'd suggest you call Microsoft again and kindly ask the support technician to escalate the problem (That's the magic phrase 😉). In my experience, they maybe want to try one or two more things and then give it to the expert (usually their boss). This may take another day or two, but then the expert should call you back. At least from my experience. – Daniel Jan 19 at 7:41 Some other ideas, but from the sound of it, I am not sure if they actually work. You could try to remove the addressee from the Outlook cache and the user's address book. It can happen that the sending format is attached to either if them and overrides the sending format you define in the mail itself. But that wouldn't explain why setting it to text sends it as text. – Daniel Jan 19 at 7:49 Thanks Daniel - Unfortunately Plain text was the only way to solve the problem, as these email addresses are from a Database... – leo_oz Jan 22 at 4:56",

      "title": "Best Windows 10 Devices You Can Buy: 2-in-1s, Notebooks & Phones",
      "text": "In days gone by, Microsoft could measure its success by how many copies of Windows it sold. Every time shoppers purchased a new desktop or notebook, they were purchasing Windows too, even if they weren’t giving money over to Microsoft explicitly. Users didn’t love Windows, they merely tolerated it because it worked with their software and came on a machine from Asus, Dell, Lenovo and HP they wanted. Speaking about the launch of Windows 10 , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made it clear that he hoped users would see Windows 10 devices in a different way.\n“We want to make Windows 10 the most loved version of Windows,” Nadella told everyone at the operating system’s launch event. For that dream to come to fruition the Windows ecosystem needed big changes. Windows 10 devices have to come with features people want. Microsoft has to deliver new features people don’t yet know they need too.\nAdvertisement\nRead: Windows 10 Anniversary Update Review: Everything Necessary\nEmboldened by Microsoft’s own efforts with hardware, PC makers have delivered a stunning array of devices that are meant for lots of different tasks and situations. Together with Windows 10, they’re the best the Windows ecosystem has ever offered.\nAdvertisement\nHere are the best of the Windows 10 devices you can buy.\nAdvertisement\nBest Windows 10 Devices: Notebooks Dell XPS 13 & Dell XPS 15\nPC maker Dell hoped to shed its cheap, basic box image when it went private a few years ago. The Dell XPS 13 and Dell XPS 15 are the best notebooks that the company has ever made.\nRead: Dell XPS 15: Equipped for the Amazing\nEqually at home in a boardroom or on a home office desk, they both have aluminum and carbon fiber bodies. They have the thinnest bezels of any Windows 10 notebook too. Both can be configured for touch. The Dell XPS 15 also has a 15-inch 4K display option.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dell XPS 13 starts at $799.99. The Dell XPS 15 sells for $999.99.\n[ Buy the Dell XPS 13 and Dell XPS 15 at Dell.com ]\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon\nThe undisputed king of the entire ThinkPad line, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the complete package. It’s relatively light for a 14-inch notebook, weighing just 2.6 pounds. It’s got a 2K display option, a fingerprint reader, wireless dock technology and lasts 10 hours on a single charge. On top of all that, it’s a ThinkPad, meaning its keyboard is spectacular.\nRead: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2016) Review: Flawless Execution\nAdvertisement\nThe ThinkPad X1 Carbon starts at $1,142.10 on Lenovo’s website. For the person that simply wants to get things done, it’s a great buy.\n[ Buy the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon at Lenovo.com ]\nHP Spectre\nIf you’re looking for a stunning and light ultrabook, nothing compares to the HP Spectre. From top to bottom it measures just 10.4mm. It weighs 2.45 pounds. Its chassis is a mix of black and gold aluminum. There’s some carbon fiber mixed in too.\nAdvertisement\nRead: New HP Laptops: OLED, Elegance and a Giant Tablet\nThe HP Spectre is for the design-conscious buyer that’s also ready for the future. It uses 6th generation Intel Core processors and can be configured with up to 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Connecting displays, smartphones and more is all handled by three USB Type-C ports, two of which use Thunderbolt technology for fast transfer speeds.\nThe HP Spectre recently got a price cut to $1069.\n[ Buy the HP Spectre from HP.com ]\nBest Windows 10 Devices: 2-in-1s Lenovo Yoga 900S\nWith its watchband hinge and good looks, the Yoga line of devices helped give birth to the Windows 10 2-in-1. This year’s Yoga 900S finally strikes the right balance between heft, power and build quality. Starting at $949.99, the device uses Intel’s Core M processors to achieve its thin body.\nRead: Lenovo Yoga 900S Review\nThe 12.5-inch device can last up to 10.5 hours on a single charge. Fold the display back and it instantly becomes a best-in-class Windows tablet.\n[ Buy the Lenovo Yoga 900S from Lenovo.com ]\nSurface Pro 4\nMicrosoft created the very first tablet that can be a notebook with the Surface. The best example of that design remains the Surface Pro. 2015’s Surface Pro 4 is thinner than its direct predecessor, while allotting for a lap-friendly design that has no fan and higher-end processors that pack enough processing power for anything short of gaming.\nRead: Surface Pro 4 Review: The Best There Is\nThe Surface Pro 4 starts at $749 without its keyboard cover.\n[ Buy the Surface Pro 4 from MicrosoftStore.com ]\nHP Elite X2 210\nNot all Windows 10 devices that can transform into tablets break the bank. The HP Pavilion X2 certainly doesn’t; it costs just $499.\nInside is an Intel Core M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. An included hardware keyboard docks with the 12-inch high-definition tablet so that users can enjoy a notebook-like experience when they want. It has one full-size USB 2.0 port, Micro-HDMI and a USB Type 3.1 Type-C port for transferring pictures and video quickly from latest smartphones and tablets.\n[ Buy the HP Elite X3 from MicrosoftStore.com ]\nSamsung Galaxy Tab Pro S\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S has the same basic form factor as the Surface Pro 4. It’s more tablet than notebook. Inside is 4GB of RAM and an Intel Core m3 processor.\nWhat puts this device on this list are some smart changes that Samsung made to what’s effectively the 2-in-1 standard design. It’s 12-inch display uses AMOLED technology so that it’s capable of deeper blacks and brighter colors. To get its thin profile, Samsung opted for a USB 3.0 Type-C port like most smartphones and tablets are coming with these days anyway. Lastly, it’s included a free keyboard cover with every Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S that it sells. Microsoft charges $129 for the Surface Pro 4 cover.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S costs $799.99.\n[ Buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro S from MicrosoftStore.com ]\nBest Windows 10 Devices: Tablets HP Envy 8 Note\nThe single standout in an otherwise desolate Windows 10 tablet market is the HP Envy 8 Note. Inside the 8-inch high-definition tablet is an Intel Atom X5 processor with 2GB of RAM. The device has a pen for writing and drawing digitally, plus 4G LTE technology so that it can connect to mobile data networks.\nThe device only costs $199.\n[ Buy the HP Envy 8 Note from MicrosoftStore.com ]\nBest Windows 10 Devices: Phones Alcatel Idol 4S\nThe only new Windows Phone to come to T-Mobile before the start of the holiday season, the Alcatel Idol 4S can be connected with a dock and used as a low-power replacement for a Windows 10 PC. There’s a 5.5-inch high-definition display and a Snapdragon 820 processor inside. The camera has a 21 megapixel sensor and comes packaged at T-Mobile with a set of virtual reality glasses. It’s the first Windows phone to support the technology.\n[ Buy Alcatel Idol from T-Mobile ]\nLumia 950 XL\nThe Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL are Microsoft’s remaining Lumia devices. Launched a year ago, they each can be used with a special dock to replicate a PC experience. They both have optical sensors that allow users to log into them without a PIN code. Each offers a 20-megapixel camera too.\nWhere they differ is pricing and screen size. The Lumia 950 XL is $499 without a two-year contract. The 950 costs $399 and has a 5.2-inch display. Microsoft is selling both of these devices with a free display dock. The AT&T Lumia 950 is just $298.99.\n[ Buy the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL from MicrosoftStore.com ]\nBest Windows 10 Devices: Desktops HP Pavilion Wave\nNowhere has HP’s focus on design translated into better devices than its desktops. The HP Pavilion Wave is an all-one that expects to be sitting on a desk. It comes with 8GB of RAM, an Intel Core i5 processor and 1TB of storage. It can fill an entire room with sound on its own thanks to a Bang and Olufsen sound system.\nThe HP Pavilion Wave starts at $689.99.\n[ Buy the HP Pavilion Wave at HP.com ]\nHP Elite Slice\nThe module device movement came to desktops with the HP Elite Slice. It gets its name from the slices, or modules, that users can add to the device for more features. A base model sells for $699.99 with 4GB of RAM, an Intel Core i3 processor and 500GB of storage.\nOptional add-ons include a meeting room device with speakers and area microphone. There’s a wireless charging slice for smartphones too.\n[ Buy the HP Slice at HP.com ]\nGood luck choosing your next Windows 10 device.",

      "text": "How Anaplan plans to kill off Excel use within the enterprise © Microsoft Excel A single morning spent with the British cloud vendor makes it clear that it views Microsoft Excel spreadsheets as the common enemy, and this is how they plan to move the enterprise away from it. \nScott graduated from Cardiff University with a degree in English Literature and a diploma in Magazine Journalism. He has a keen interest in disruptive tech, sport and the media. Follow: LinkedIn Google Plus \nAnaplan - the cloud-based vendor of business modelling and planning software - wants to eliminate Excel spreadsheet-based business processes within the enterprise. \nSpeaking at its Hub 16 event in London this week, chief marketing officer Grant Halloran said that Excel is often overlooked as part of an organisation's IT application environment, despite its widespread use. \n\"What we don’t see is the smattering of Excel spreadsheets across this landscape on IT diagrams. It is spread through the business like a virus,\" he said. \nHe added: \"Excel is a phantom system that works in the shadows.\" \nExcel spreadsheets still form a core part of many business processes in some of the biggest organisations in the world, particularly the financial services and insurance industries. \nAnaplan's mission is to eliminate the tedious and error-prone process of teams editing and passing around Excel spreadsheets via email. Related \nThe problem Anaplan founder Michael Gould saw with spreadsheets was that they tended to sit within each business function. They aren't linked up, which creates a fragmented view of the business and makes effective planning and decision making more difficult. What the customers say \nStrahan Wilson - CFO at restaurant chain Cote Brasserie - arrived at an organisation with this exact problem two months ago. \"Coming to Cote I found that we were stuck in the Excel dark ages,\" he told Computerworld UK. \"We did one budget a year which was done for July and it was essentially a one man operation.\" \nWilson admits the new budget planning cycle could be done in Excel, but would be too difficult to implement at any scale. \"Having 80 restaurants means 80 spreadsheets. So each time you change a variable you need to change it 80 times if you need to change the approach, therefore you never do. \n\"The migration to Anaplan means we are able to say that's not right and this is a much better approach to do it. By changing master data once you build the module that affects that line and it doesn't care if there are 80 restaurants or a thousand restaurants, it is just elements within your model and takes all of that into consideration.\" \nRead next: Cote Brasserie moves from 'herculean planning' to monthly budgeting cycle with adoption of Anaplan \nMatt Jones, CFO at insurers AXA Art said that although Excel will always have a place within organisations like AXA, it falls down when it comes to modern data volumes. \n\"The status quo within any organisation is Excel spreadsheets,\" Jones said. \"That's the starting point for planning and analysis. \n\"Excel had a role to play when data was of a certain quantity and complexity, but all organisations now have to look beyond that and find alternative ways to handle that complexity. Also the expectation around analysis and decision making has increased significantly.\" Excel won't die \nHowever, Jones says that organisations will never be entirely rid of Excel spreadsheets. \n\"I think you will never get to zero Excel and nor would I want to,\" he said. \"There are times when as a tool it is absolutely the right thing to use. I think the challenge with Excel is when you need something which is scalable, has user access control based on an individual's role and the ability to reorganise structures, that's where a tool like Anaplan really has its benefits.\" \nAs Wilson from Cote put it: \"[For] some lines - like uniforms - it just isn't worth building KPIs, we just don't spend enough. Why go to the effort of building something bespoke in Anaplan when you can just take the run-rate based on existing spreadsheets and carry on as you are?\" Changing role of the finance department \nAnaplan's customers claimed that the efficiency offered by the cloud tools can help reshape the role of finance teams within an organisation. \nJones from AXA said: \"I strongly believe that the office of finance can really enhance business and strategic decision making. \n\"Historically we have been playing a scorekeeping and gatekeeping role but actually we need to move into a business partnering role and products like Anaplan enable the finance team to move into those higher value activities and add value to executive decision making.\" \nLuke Enock from Provident Financial added: \"Tools like Anaplan allow you to have that closeness with the CEO to run scenarios and create those views of the future without having to start a two month process. The role of the CFO will change.\" Recommended for you ",

      "text": "Tweet by William D'Angelo , posted 33 minutes ago / 209 Views \nMicrosoft announced it will be celebrating the 15 anniversary of the Halo franchise with a live stream on November 15th at 3:43pm PT. \nHere is an overview via Halo Waypoint : SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY EPISODE OF THE HALO LIVESTREAM! \nTune in to Twitch.tv/Halo at approximately 3:43 p.m. PST for our special tribute to Halo. During the jam-packed show we’ll have a special walkthrough of the Halo Museum, talk Halo Wars 2 with Dan Ayoub & Max Szlagor, hear about some of the team and community’s fondest Halo memories, play Halo 5 with fans, talk HCS with Tashi & Strongside, take a look at the upcoming Halo Loot crate with James, answer your tweets and whatever else we end up doing when we inevitably stray from script. This’ll be my very first time in the co-host seat and I’m super excited to read all of your totally positive and inspiring Twitch live-chat comments! HALO 5 “ANNIVERSARY THROWBACK” PLAYLIST \nBattle on some of your favorite Halo: Combat Evolved maps re-imagined in Halo 5 thanks to Forge and a number of super talented community builders! I’ve seen Uny working on these maps and they look fantastic. I also know there’s excitement building externally and I want to manage your expectations by clarifying that this is Halo 5 gameplay on sweet Forge re-creations of classic maps with the Halo: CE pistol as the starting weapon. FREE STUFF! \nWhat kind of birthday party would it be without goodie bags for attendees!? I don’t want to spoil the surprise but I think you’ll dig it. PLAY WITH 343 \nThroughout the day members of the 343 team will be online playing in Halo 5’s Anniversary Throwback playlist with anyone and everyone who cares to join us. Next week I’ll publish the gamertags you’ll want to watch out for (and you’ll recognize us by the official 343 emblems we’re rockin’.) We’d also love for you to join our official “Halo Club” on Xbox Live! MEMORIES \nWe’d love to hear from you on social all day as you share your fondest Halo memories using #15yearsofHalo. We’ll also be sharing reflections from members of the 343 team and community in a special Tuesday edition of the weekly update on Halo Waypoint. \n ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft investigated by Russian antitrust body after Kaspersky complaint Microsoft is being invested by Russian antitrust body for allegedly making it unfairly difficult for antivirus providers to compete following a major Windows 10 update. | Topic: Microsoft \nLast Thursday, Russian antitrust authority said it had opened an investigation into Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market. \nThe Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) is investigating whether the tech giant is in violation of Part 1 Article 10 of the Federal Law 'On Protection of Competition' [PDF] , which prohibits companies occupying dominant positions in the market from engaging in activities that result or can result in \"preventing, restricting, eliminating competition\" and/or \"infringing the interests of other persons (economic entities) in business activities or consumers at large\". \nThe FAS opened the investigation upon receiving a complaint from Moscow-based internet security company Kaspersky Lab, which claims to have spent \"months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft\". \nKaspersky claims Microsoft has significantly reduced the period for independent developers to adapt their antivirus software for the Windows 10 operating system to just six days, compared with two months for earlier versions. \nIn addition, when a Windows user upgrades to the latest operating system, its antivirus software is disabled, with Microsoft's Windows Defender system taking over by default. \nThe same is occurring with other user-installed apps in cases where Microsoft has a competing offering within its ecosystem, Eugene Kaspersky lamented in a blog post . \nWith only six days to make the changes necessary to ensure compatibility, third-party antivirus software providers like Kaspersky do not have sufficient time to provide customers with adequate service and risk losing them to Defender, Kaspersky claimed. \nKaspersky also said Microsoft conceals antivirus license expiration warnings and automatically activates Defender if a trial period of a third-party product expires. \nAnatoly Golomolzin, Deputy Head of FAS, said this leads to \"unreasonable advantages \" for Microsoft, adding that the FAS's priority is to ensure equal conditions for all participants of this market. \n\"Actually, Microsoft's actions aren't only making things worse for users and killing off the whole ecosystem of independent developers; they're also undermining users' trust in Microsoft: creating an illusion of security while destroying the main competitive advantage of its platform -- openness and democracy,\" Kaspersky wrote. \nHe also questioned the quality of Defender as an antivirus service, saying that \"independent lab tests\" have confirmed Defender's \"below average\" status in the security market. Kaspersky added that Windows Defender doesn't have features like built-in VPN, webcam protection, exploit protection, protection for online banking and online shopping, and proactive protection against future threats. \n\"The trend is clear: Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose,\" Kaspersky wrote. \nEarlier this month, Microsoft launched its Slack team-collaboration competitor, Microsoft Teams , as a new feature of its Office 365 platform, provoking a response from Slack in the form of a full-page ad in the New York Times. \nZDNet has contacted Microsoft for comment.

      "text": "Pinterest \nKaspersky Lab founder Eugene Kaspersky has had enough of Microsoft’s Windows Defender. The Russian billionaire has filed complaints with EU and Russian authorities demanding that action be taken against the Windows’ built-in anti-virus solution. \nKaspersky outlined his concerns in a rather long blog post titled “That’s It. I’ve Had Enough.” Essentially, he believes that Windows Defender’s behaviour is detrimental to third party security solutions; and that Microsoft is attempting to build a monopoly. This is due to Windows 10 being able to shut down and remove third party applications. \nWindows Defender is turned off by default if the computer has another anti-virus solution running. This arrangement exists to appease Microsoft’s partners who prefer to bundle anti-virus solutions with their products (and do so in exchange for a fee). In the event that an anti-virus programme stops working, Windows Defender kicks in after a few days. \nThere are also situations where Windows Defender will disable the existing anti-virus and take over. This happens in the event that a trial period expires or the owner forgets to renew his license. \nKaspersky also expressed concern for Windows’ habit of breaking applications with updates, as he suspects that this is a move to shut out third party developers. Malaysia Among Top 10 Countries Affected By Massive Hacked Server Marketplace \nThe blog post also outlines what Kaspersky thinks needs to be done to resolve the problem. He demands that Microsoft make new updates available to developers earlier than the current one week time frame; which should give them enough time to fix any issues that may happen. Interestingly, he doesn’t address the existence of the current Windows Insider programme that does precisely that. \nKaspersky also wants Microsoft to always ask if users want Windows Defender activated, especially when it involves security solutions that stopped working. \nThere’s no telling if any authority will actually look into the complaint. The EU currently has its hands full with the Google anti-trust investigation; although Russia may use the opportunity to mess with Microsoft one more time.",

      "text": "\nIt appears that developer Microsoft is going to be celebrating another year with the Halo franchise.\nIf you’re into first-person shooters, chances are you’ve played Halo or any of the other installments that have come in the series. Master Chief, main protagonist and hero of many of the Halo games, has become an icon among characters that players would immediately recognize.\nAccording to Gamespot , developer 343 held a livestream where information about Microsoft’s big event was revealed . Halo was first released on November 15, 2001. Consequently, November 15 is when the event is supposed to kick off. Fans will be able to get a plethora of information about Halo in all its glory, including a Twitch stream and special discussions with developers.\nIn a blog post by Halo Waypoint , 343 weighed in on what would take place during the stream and the special guests who would be included.\n“During the jam-packed show we’ll have a special walkthrough of the Halo Museum, talk Halo Wars 2 with Dan Ayoub & Max Szlagor, hear about some of the team and community’s fondest Halo memories, play Halo 5 with fans, talk HCS with Tashi & Strongside, take a look at the upcoming Halo Loot crate with James, answer your tweets and whatever else we end up doing when we inevitably stray from script,” 343 wrote.\nHalo 5 update on Xbox One: Spartans can look alien when it comes… https://t.co/3hsqDfreF4 #xboxone \n— Peggy (@peggyarnol) November 2, 2016 \n\nWhile you would think that the Halo series has fallen to the wayside in terms of downloadable content, 343 assures fans that there is more content coming with Halo 5 . Unfortunately, they only teased some of the plans.\n“Plans are being made for some big holiday playlist updates as well as the release of the next big Halo 5 content update,” 343 revealed. “I know you’re eager for those juicy details and we look forward to being able to share more soon.”\nCould we be seeing another game entirely? With more content coming out, the idea doesn’t seem out of the question. In the meantime, the celebration will benefit those who still enjoy assault rifles and plasma swords every now and then. 343 has confirmed that fans will be receiving free Halo content, alongside what’s being called an “Anniversary Throwback” playlist for Halo 5 .\n“What kind of birthday party would it be without goodie bags for attendees!? I don’t want to spoil the surprise but I think you’ll dig it,” 343 stated.\nHalo 5 update sees the Covenant invading Forge: Halo 5 Forge is a powerful game editing suite that allo… https://t.co/J5B2k9yDgg #halo \n— Halo News Feed (@HaloNewsFeed) October 19, 2016 \n\nIt seems that now would be a good time to jump back onto the Halo wagon if you fell off. According to a report by Gamerant , Halo 5 multiplayer DLC maps are consistently free . If you’re a newcomer to the series, it’s all the more reason to dive headfirst into the series. Unlike many other developers, content has been frequent and free for Halo 5 players. The most recent of these, Anvil’s Legacy , was released in September. Other expansions include The Battle of Shadow and Light , Cartographer’s Gift , Infinity’s Armor , Hammer Storm , Ghosts of Meridian , Memories of Reach , Hog Wild , and Warzone Firefight .\nIt’s being said that the newest Halo 5 updates will include features that work both in and out of the game. Players will be able to join live, custom games on both the XBox One and Windows 10 PC. Additionally, we’re looking at more maps for Warzone Firefight and new Forge content. Players will even get an updated spectator feature, giving the more casual player a new way to get their Halo fix.\nUltimately, it looks to be a massive overhaul to the Halo 5 title. If you own an XBox One, you’ll want to take advantage of the opportunity to beef up the game’s plethora of content.\nAre you excited for the big Halo event on November 15? Let us know your thoughts on the game in its current state in the comment section below.\n[Featured Image By 343 Industries]\n‘Halo’ 15th Anniversary To Be Celebrated Next Week, Developer 343 Talks Event And Teases Future ‘Halo 5’ Plans is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "  5screenshots An application that enables you to sync your Microsoft Outlook data with various other services around the Internet, such as Google Calendar or Dropbox Many users rely on their calendars to remember important dates, like birthdays, business meetings and other similar events. Some of the most important e-mail services offer this functionality either integrated with the client or as a standalone feature. Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook are among the most representative examples of this kind and the communication between them can be realized, but only if you are using some dedicated utilities that can transfer details from one application or service to another. Such a tool is gSyncit, a powerful add-in for Outlook, that incorporates seamlessly with Microsoft's e-mail and calendar service and software solutions. By adding an extra entry in the application's menu, this extension will make it possible for you to keep in sync all your personal data. To be more precise, with the help of gSyncit you can take care of contacts, calendar events, notes or tasks. All of those mentioned above can be synchronized with Google, while only part of them, at different levels, are available for coordination with other services like Dropbox, Toodledo, Simplenote or Evernote. The main focus when it comes to gSyncit is the configuration area, where you will be able to customize in great detail the communication parameters for each service. When accessing the dedicated 'Settings' area from Outlook, it is also possible to glance at the compatibilities of various data categories with the online services, because only for the supported functions you can adjust the sync options. Seen on the whole, gSyncit is one of those add-ins that users who depend on their digital agenda must have. Nonetheless, the feature set could definitely receive some improvements, especially insofar as the two way syncing is concerned. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS",

Specifically, interactive notifications allow users to delete new emails or set flags without the need for firing up the email client and clicking on the new message, as the whole thing can be performed thanks to the options that are included in the notification message itself. This is a feature that has been around for a while in other apps and operating systems, and Microsoft recently rolled it out for fast ring insiders . It turns out that feedback was mostly positive, so this feature is now available for all Windows 10 users who stick with the default Mail app. The quick actions are displayed in the toast notifications showing up on PC and mobile, but at the same time, they’re also available in the Action Center, should you miss the notification.

      "title": "Kaspersky: Windows 10’s antivirus integration anti-competitive",
      "text": "Eugen Kaspersky, head of the Russian security company Kaspersky Lab has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive practices in the Windows 10 operating system.\nKaspersky complains that Microsoft pushes Windows Defender on Windows 10 devices to the detriment of third-party antivirus vendors.\nWe think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own product. The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks. The company is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market, and infringes upon the interests of independent developers of security products.\nMicrosoft's own solution, Windows Defender, ships with Windows 10 to protect users on a basic level against threats.\nWindows Defender can be best described as basic protection. Independent tests by organizations such as AV Tests have shown that Windows Defender does not offer the same level of protection as most third-party antivirus solutions.\n\nWhile that is the case, it protects against many major threats that users may be exposed to while using the computer.\nMicrosoft designed Windows Defender to jump in if no third-party antivirus program is found on the computer the operating system is running on. If the user installs a third-party product, Windows Defender will disable itself automatically to avoid conflicts.\nKaspersky's lengthy complaint comes down to this: Windows 10 may deactivate installed third-party antivirus solutions during system upgrades because of incompatibilities. The operating system may furthermore push notifications that \"tell\" the user that Windows Defender protection is turned off even if a third-party product is installed, and will turn on Windows Defender a couple of days after a third-party product expires.\nIf you dissect the claims, you may come to the conclusion that there are two sides to the story. First, that it seems appropriate for Windows 10 to turn on Windows Defender if no or expired third-party products are found on the system.\nThis raises the question whose fault it is when that happens.\nSecond, that Windows 10 has its fair share of issues including those affecting the incompatibility check during system upgrades. If you upgraded Windows 10 to a new version, or from an older version of Windows to Windows 10, you may have noticed the following behavior.\nThe upgrade assistant notifies you that software XY is incompatible with Windows 10. You upgrade anyway, and install software XY after the upgrade on the system without issues and it runs just fine on it.\nKaspersky suggests two changes to level the playing field. First, that Microsoft provides third-parties with new versions of Windows and updates in \"good time\". Second, that the install and notification system changes to make it clearer to users that the process will remove third-party antivirus software.\nClosing Words It is clear that the current system of checking for incompatibilities is problematic for companies affected by it as it is likely that a percentage of users won't re-install these products after upgrades complete. Notifications about these things, and others, could be better as well to help users better understand the implications.\nNow You : What's your take on the claim?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon .

      "title": "Double File Scanner: find duplicate files",
      "text": "Double File Scanner is a free portable program for Microsoft Windows operating systems that scans selected directories for duplicate files.\nWhile there are plenty of programs out there for Windows that find file dupes, Double File Scanner is without the shadow of a doubt a convenient one to use.\nTo name a few alternatives that we have reviewed in the past: Duplicate Commander , Noclone , Doublekiller and CloneSpy .\nPrograms may use various methods to find duplicate files: from simple file name comparisons to comparing hash values, file sizes and a mix of options.\nDouble File Scanner \nDouble File Scanner computes hashes of files to compare them against each other to detect duplicates. While that is without doubt one of the better methods of finding duplicates, it does not ship with other options such as fuzzy comparisons that detect nearly identical files as well (think two images that show the same scene but have different resolutions).\nWhile that is a limitation, it may appeal to you if you have only that requirement and want to use a program that is streamlined for ease of use.\nBasically, all you do is add one or multiple directories to a scan job. Once you have added at least one folder that you want scanned for dupes -- subdirectories are included by default in the scans -- you can sit back and wait for Double File Scanner to complete the scan job.\nThe scan time depends on several factors including the folder structure, the number of files, and the processor.\nResults are sorted into groups for easy recognition. Each group lists all files that the program identified as duplicates.\n\nThe files are listed with their hash value, the name, location they are stored in, and the size.\nYou have two options to deal with duplicate files from here on out. First, you may right-click on individual duplicate files and select delete to remove them. You may also open the folder their are stored in and perform file operations using Windows Explorer instead.\nThe second option that you have is to use the program's automatic clean-up functionality. This deletes all but one file from each group which speeds up the process significantly once you have verified the findings.\nThere is little that you can do besides that. You may export the list of duplicate files and save the data as a XML or INI file, but that is about it.\nClosing Words Double File Scanner is an easy to use program that is powerful enough for most use cases. The main downside is that it does not support other find methods such as fuzzy logic. This means that you cannot use it to find nearly identical files which is mighty useful when it comes to images.\nNow You : Do you scan your system for duplicate files occasionally or regularly?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Double File Scanner: find duplicate files appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

In other words, while the Skype client for Linux is improving, the alpha flag means that Microsoft is still working on refining the general performance and adding new features, so don’t be too surprised if you come across bugs or other issues in the application. According to the official changelog, this update is just a minor release, and brings only three worthy changes, including improved authentication process with switch to Microsoft Account options. Additionally, Skype 1.12 for Linux comes enables hostless group calling, which means that if you’re part of a group call and the host leaves, the conversation can continue without any interruption.
