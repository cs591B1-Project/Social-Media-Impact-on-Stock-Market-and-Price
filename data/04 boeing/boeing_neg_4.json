      "text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia.

Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (6) St. Louis • Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. About 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, Calif. will move to plants in three other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Ala. Chicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Va. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. The company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Wash. to Tukwila, Wash. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. No cuts were proposed in the Salt Lake Valley, where Boeing has a large presence. \"To push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" The company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.",

LOUIS, Nov. 16 (UPI) -- Boeing is preparing to consolidate Defense, Space & Security facilities to streamline operations.\nUnder the new plan, the aerospace giant will reduce its facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet. Boeing will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. In California, many jobs from Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach, while others will move to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Boeing space and security chief Leanne Caret said in a press release . \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe changes also affect operations overseas, with defense subsidiaries in Australia, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia being aligned in a new global operations group led by David Pitchforth.\n\"Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration,\" Caret added. \"This will help drive our global growth in Boeing's second century.\"\nBoeing expects the consolidation efforts to be complete by the end of 2020.\n  Lockheed Martin to upgrade M1A2S training system for Saudi Arabia Thales Australia delivers Hawkei military vehicles MBDA demos laser effector",

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nUnited Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that it would postpone receiving dozens of new Boeing Co. jets to trim spending.\nThe third-largest U.S. airline will defer 61 planes from a 65-jet order for 737-700s and convert them into the new Max model with yet-to-be-determined arrival dates. Boeing will switch the remaining four to the larger 737-800 model for delivery next year. United is expected to acquire the Max 9 version of the plane.\nThe airline, among four U.S. carriers that have recently attracted investment from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , also announced a push to boost its share of budget-conscious travelers with a new no-frills fare class.\nThe basic economy class entitles fliers only to an under-seat bag, a move also intended to avoid the delays caused by passengers stowing overhead baggage, and continues the segmentation of fares that is being pursued by other carriers such as Delta Air Lines Inc.\nThe moves are among a parade of planned changes unveiled by United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz and his new management team that includes cost cuts and revenue-boosting initiatives designed to increase profits by $4.8 billion by 2020.\nThe fleet changes are among the industry's largest since Southwest Airlines Co. in June reached a deal with Boeing to defer 67 of its 737 Max deliveries scheduled for the 2019-2022 period until 2023 and beyond.\nUnited expects the fleet changes to cut capital spending over the next two years by $1.6 billion.\nBoeing and Airbus Group SE have order books for their best-selling jets stretching out for several years of production, and typically overbook knowing that some planes will be canceled or deferred. United canceled an order for 12 Airbus single-aisle planes in late 2013.\n\"We constantly work with our airline customers to meet their evolving needs, and our healthy 737 backlog of 4,321 airplanes gives us the flexibility to meet those needs,\" Boeing said in a statement.\nUnited also plans changes to flights at its three big hubs in Chicago, Newark and Houston that it hopes will add $900 million in incremental revenue by 2019. Changes include using larger aircraft on some routes and changing flight times to improve connections, as well as revamping its demand forecasting systems.\nThe Chicago-based carrier is also buying 24 Embraer 175 jets from the Brazilian manufacturer rather than leasing them from Republic Airways Holdings Inc., which is under bankruptcy protection.\nUnited said it would continue reviewing its widebody aircraft needs and consider adding more used jets in addition to the Airbus A320 family planes it is already leasing from AerCap Holdings NV.\nThe company's shares were recently up 1.2% at $63.72, trailing gains at Southwest and American Airlines Group Inc.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 15, 2016 10:57 ET (15:57 ",

      "text": "By JIM SALTER\nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.\nPrint Comment Recommend (-) Comments - of - Comments < Previous 10 Next 10 > Add a Comment Please login or register to comment.

      "text": "Email \nST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - Boeing is working to streamline its Defense, Space & Security business through facilities consolidations. \nBy the end of 2020, the Chicago based company plans to reduce facilities space by around 4.5 million square feet. Positions in Huntington Beach, CA will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach also in California. Other positions will move to St. Louis and Huntsville, AL. St. Louis should gain about 500 jobs through the consolidation. \nSome workers in Kent, WA, will move to Tukwila, WA. Boeing will close its El Paso, TX, and Newington, VA sites. \nBoeing's Defense, Space & Security business is headquartered in St. Louis. The company currently employs around 14,000 workers in the St. Louis area. \nU.S. Senator Claire McCaskill released the following statement on Boeing’s announcement : \nBoeing’s decision to move more than 500 jobs to Missouri makes perfect sense—because the St. Louis region, and frankly our entire state, offer one of the most dedicated, innovative workforces in the country, and play a critical role on our nation’s defense. These jobs will be a big win, for the company, for our economy, and for hundreds of Missourians, and I look forward to continuing to work with Boeing as it begins this exciting transition. \nSt. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger also released a statement: \nWe are very pleased by Boeing’s announcement that it is adding 500 jobs at its St. Louis County facilities. St. Louis County and the Economic Development Partnership work closely with Boeing leadership on an ongoing basis. Boeing executives tell us all the time that St. Louis County is a great place to do business. The County’s allocation of transportation funds to improve infrastructure to support the construction of 777X wing manufacturing is a direct example of how we support the company and its employees. \nBoeing leaders also appreciate St. Louis County’s skilled workforce. This addition of jobs is a testament to the skill and dedication of our workforce, collaboration with the County, and the quality of life area residents enjoy. Companies continue to recognize that St. Louis County is a great place to live and work. . @BoeingDefense is investing in customer focus areas: commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space & unmanned. pic.twitter.com/rhRMv5PcLi \n— The Boeing Company (@Boeing) October 26, 2016 Related stories ",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Boeing said Tuesday it will cut 500 jobs in its defense division nationwide, close facilities in Texas and Virginia, and consolidate some other sites over the next four years.\nThe site consolidation will reduce its overall footprint by approximately 4.5 million square feet nationwide and relocate the work of more than 3,500 employees.\nSpokesman Ken Smith said Boeing expects \"few, if any, job losses from today's announcement in Washington state,\" where the company has a large presence.\nHowever, about 1,000 defense-side workers will be moved from the company's Kent site outside Seattle, which has been shrinking for some years, to Tukwila.\nTwo facilities will close: in El Paso, Texas, and in Newington, Va.\nSmith said the company will provide assistance to employees who lose their jobs.\nIn Southern California, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala.\nWith the moves, which will begin in 2017, Los Angeles County will gain about 1,600 positions, with St. Louis gaining 500 and Huntsville about 400, Boeing said.\nThe consolidation comes as Boeing's defense business contracts.\nCongress has in recent years been limiting defense budget growth, while Boeing has failed to win the biggest new military contracts, including the loss to Northrop Grumman of the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber program.\nAnd sharp new competition from private companies such as SpaceX has cut profits in the space sector.\nIn the first nine months of this year, profit in the company's defense and space unit was down 5 percent from a year earlier.\nLeanne Caret, president and chief executive of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division, said the moves \"will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration\"\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n ",

As you can see, it looks like a pretty awful place to try to play hide and seek. But it looks like a pretty great place to play other things, including... love games. What are love games anyways? I just like mentioning stuff I don't know anything about because it makes people think I'm smarter than I really am. Which, for the record, is not very smart at all. When I was in middle school they thought I was special and scheduled me to take an IQ test. You know what I got? \"85?\" The test date and time all wrong. FUN FACT: A truck driver never denies a horn honk for a kid riding the short bus. \nThanks to Richard K, who agrees that looks like a great place to build a blanket fort en route for distant lands.",

American is actively participating in the National Transportation Safety Board ’s investigation and will continue to work with the NTSB and the other parties to the investigation of this event.”\nA representative of Boeing declined to comment. A representative of GE could not be reached.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune American Airlines General Electric National Transportation Safety Board O'Hare International Airport",

      "text": "ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday.\nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama.\nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.\nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.\nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart.\n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"\nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K.\n ",

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)  11PM HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- Boeing Co. plans to move 1,600 jobs from Huntington Beach to plants in three other Southland locations as part of a larger effort to boost efficiency, the company said.The Huntington Beach positions will move to El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 of those jobs will move to St. Louis, and 400 will move to Huntsville, Alabama.The company also plans on moving an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to nearby Tukwila, Washington.In addition, Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia.The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet.The Huntington Beach plant will remain open, but Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there.Boeing says this is all part of an effort to operate its defense, space and security business more efficiently.\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\"The company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

      "text": "× Huntsville to gain 400 new jobs from Boeing’s consolidation of defense and space sites \nST. LOUIS – Five cities that are home to Boeing facilities stand to gain jobs following an announcement by the company today. Huntsville is one of them. \nHuntsville stands to gain 400 jobs. El Segundo, Long Beach, Seal Beach and St. Louis will also benefit. \nIn a company announcement, Boeing said it is taking steps to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently through facilities consolidations and work movements that will increase employment in Los Angeles County, St. Louis, and Huntsville, Ala. \nHuntsville’s positions will be in the areas of missile defense engineering, advanced manufacturing and administrative support. \n“This Boeing announcement today of 400 additional jobs in Madison County, Alabama once again highlights Boeing’s 100-year history to our nation’s defense and intelligence sectors,” said Madison County Commission Chairman Dale Strong. “These 400 jobs will take Boeing’s footprint to just over 3,100 jobs in Alabama. This only furthers their commitment to our region and once again shows that Madison County is perfectly positioned in every aspect related to missile defense, space and national security.” \n“Boeing’s announcement reinforces our strategic pivot back to research and development after achieving much success in advanced manufacturing,” said Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle. “Huntsville is a knowledge based economy and Boeing continues to invest here because our talent pool matches the needs of their workforce requirements. Boeing has been a tremendous corporate partner, and we are thrilled to play an important role in the company’s ability to create greater efficiencies. It is Huntsville’s talent that will help Boeing meet the needs of the warfighter and, in turn, help secure our nation and that of our allies.” \n“Boeing’s expansion in Huntsville is great news for our state and a true testament to Alabama’s world class workforce. The company’s commitment to Alabama has not only made a lasting impact on our nation’s aerospace and defense capabilities, but also on our state’s economy. I look forward to the progress that will come from the additional jobs and investment in our state, and I am confident that Boeing will continue to build on its history of success in Alabama.” says Senator Richard Shelby (R.) \nBy the end of 2020 Boeing will reduce facilities space by approximately 4.5 million square feet. Along with that, many positions in Huntington Beach will move to El Segundo, Long Beach, and Seal Beach in Southern California, with others moving to St. Louis and Huntsville, Ala. \nSimilarly, many positions in Kent, Wash., will move to nearby Tukwila. Boeing also will close its El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va., sites. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nWHNT News 19 is working to get more specifics on today’s announcement and the timeline for the additional jobs for Huntsville. We’ll update WHNT.com with more information as this develops. 34.730369 -86.586104 ",

MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Xaume Olleros. (Xaume Olleros / Bloomberg) Michael Sasso and Julie Johnsson, (c) 2016, Bloomberg (c) 2016, Bloomberg \nUnited Continental Holdings will defer delivery of 61 of Boeing's smallest passenger jets as the airline seeks to close its profit gap with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. \nUnited plans to convert the order to the larger, newer Boeing 737 Max to be delivered at an undetermined date, slowing near-term capacity growth as recent hires President Scott Kirby and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy start to reshape the fleet strategy. The shift will trim spending by $1.6 billion over the next two years, according to a statement Tuesday by the Chicago-based carrier. \nThe fleet changes are part of $4.8 billion in initiatives intended to bolster the airline's profitability through 2020. Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz is looking for ways to elevate profit margins and match Delta, which has led the industry in recent years. United's operating profit amounted to 13.6 percent of sales last year, trailing Delta's 19 percent margin and American's 15.1 percent. \nUnited climbed 2.8 percent to $64.71 at 11:51 a.m. in New York, a day after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said it had invested in the airline and three major rivals. Berkshire is an \"anchor tenant\" investor, Munoz said in a meeting with analysts. United's gain was the second biggest on the Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index, which rose 1.6 percent. \nUnited unveiled other efforts to reap greater revenue and savings from its worldwide route network. Improvements in the way the airline forecasts demand and manages seats is expected to generate an extra $900 million annually. Cost-cutting moves will save another $700 million by 2020, compared with last year's level. \nCosts for each seat flown a mile, or unit costs, are expected to grow by 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in 2017, excluding fuel costs, the airline said. However, unit costs are expected to grow by less than 1 percent from 2018 to 2020, after the effect of new labor deals tapers off, the company said. \nThe airline also joined Delta in rolling out a new Basic Economy fare, which will go on sale in January with discounted tickets that have fewer benefits than traditional Economy tickets. \nCustomers buying United's new offering will not be entitled to store a bag in the overhead bin -- a departure from the practice of Delta, which already has a low-price fare. Passengers in Basic Economy will be able to bring a small personal item on-board and store it under the seat. United's approach will resemble the policy of discount carrier Spirit Airlines Inc., which charges extra for carry-on bags. \nBasic Economy will anchor United's efforts to \"segment\" its cabins, or create additional fare classes with different amenities and privileges. The company also is evaluating adding a Premium Economy cabin, which would have wider seats than traditional coach and come with more amenities. United hopes to generate another $1 billion with these new cabin offerings. \nThe airline is conducting a long-term review of its fleet plan, executives said. Potential moves range from adding more used aircraft to refining its long-haul aircraft amid an uncertain economic climate. \nThe company is also reshaping its domestic strategy. United had ordered 65 of Boeing's 737-700 jets in two batches over the past year, taking advantage of attractive prices for aircraft near the end of their production run after reviewing Bombardier's C Series to replace flying handled by regional affiliates. \nIn a switch, the carrier is bolstering its United Express regional fleet. United will now acquire 24 of Embraer's E-175 regional jets that earlier were going to be purchased by Republic Airways Holdings Inc. Republic is expected to operate the jets on behalf of United. \nMeanwhile, United is switching four of the current generation 737s on order to the -800 variant to be delivered over the next two years as planned. The new strategy will leave United with a fleet of 150 Max, including 99 of Boeing's largest narrowbody model. The U.S. planemaker plans to start delivering the upgraded 737 family next year with the Max 8, followed by the Max 9 in 2018. \nUnited joins a spate of carriers deferring aircraft deliveries, stoking concerns of a cool-down in the global aerospace market. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, International Consolidated Airlines Group and Turkish Airlines have also tapped the brakes on some deliveries in recent months. Boeing shares fell 1.7 percent to $147.45 in New York. \n\"We're excited that United will be adding even more MAXs to its future fleet, and we appreciate their confidence in the airplane,\" Doug Alder, a Boeing spokesman, said by email. \"We constantly work with our airline customers to meet their evolving needs, and our healthy 737 backlog of 4,321 airplanes gives us the flexibility to meet those needs.\" ",

      "text": "January   Governor Bentley Celebrates Boeing Bringing 400 New Jobs to Alabama November 15, 2016 Share By: Daniel Sparkman, Deputy Press Secretary & Director of Digital Media \nMONTGOMERY (Governor’s Office) – Governor Robert Bentley on Tuesday announced Boeing plans to add approximately 400 new jobs to the Huntsville area. \n“Since Boeing first came to Alabama in 1962 joining our efforts to put man on the moon, our partnership has been a strong one and it continues to grow,” Governor Bentley said. “A University of Alabama study found that Boeing’s presence in the state sustains nearly 8,400 direct and indirect jobs across Alabama. We look forward to a long relationship with Boeing and ensuring their continued growth and success.” \nBoeing announced that it is taking steps to operate its Defense, Space & Security business more efficiently through facility consolidations and work movements that will increase employment at several locations including Huntsville. The jobs will be in the areas of engineering, advanced manufacturing and administrative support. This consolidation of work into Huntsville is part of Boeing’s ongoing efforts to make the best use of resources and talent as well as grow in the global aerospace market. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Defense, Space & Security. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide. Making better use of our facilities will enhance efficiency and promote greater collaboration. This will help drive our global growth in Boeing’s second century.” \nBoeing says they expect to have the realignment and job movements completed by the end of 2020. \n###",

      "text": "\n(Adds Boeing and analyst comment, updates share price) \nBy Alwyn Scott \nSEATTLE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Boeing Co shares dropped on Tuesday after United Continental Holdings said it will convert orders for 61 Boeing 737 jetliners, worth nearly $5 billion at list prices, into newer 737 MAX models for delivery in later years. \nThe decision called into question Boeing's plans to increase production of one of its biggest moneymakers over the next two years, and its ability to generate more cash for investors. \nBoeing said United's decision would not affect its plan to increase production rates of 737s, and stressed that it continues to have orders for more 737s than it can produce. \nUnited's orders \"will switch over to MAXs on the order book when (the order is) finalized,\" Boeing spokesman Doug Alder told Reuters in an email. Boeing's 737 order backlog of 4,321 airplanes \"gives us the flexibility to meet those needs.\" \nUnited is converting its 737s to newer models, \"so it will not impact backlog at all,\" he added. \nSome analysts said United's decision would only reduce the amount of oversold jets, with no impact on output. \nBut some worried that canceling 61 current-generation planes and ordering MAXs for an uncertain date could delay Boeing's planned production increases and its cash generation. \n\"737 output is their only realistic way to increase cash flow,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Virginia. Boeing is already cutting production of the 777, its other cash cow, and 787 output is due to remain steady. \n\"Now it looks like 737 output will not grow as planned,\" he said. \nBoeing shares were down 1.3 percent at $148.98 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They fell as low as $147.31 earlier in the day. \nBoeing plans to increase 737 production to 57 a month in 2019, up from 42 a month currently, with interim step-ups to 47 and 52 a month along the way. \nOn Oct. 26, Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the company was on track to raise 737 output as planned and signaled demand remained strong for the jet even at higher production rates. \"Importantly,\" he said, \"even at the 57 per month rate, we continue to be over sold.\" \nIn addition to shifting orders for 61 Boeing 737-700 planes originally due in the next two years to 737 MAX planes United will convert orders for four other 737-700s to larger 737-800s due for delivery in 2017, United said. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Tom Brown) Read the original article on Reuters .

(Photo: Jeff Gritchen, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBoeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Va. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/2fYDGos TOP VIDEOS",

The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Wash., to Tukwila, Wash.. The two towns are 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret , president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth , managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Today's Deals",

      "text": "Posted on November 16, 2016 by Travel News Headlines - Yahoo! News \nArticle Attribution and Read More at: Article Source \nA United Airlines Boeing 747 takes off for Hong Kong from San Francisco International Airport on Oct. 23, 2016. (Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren, special for USA TODAY) \nAttention Boeing 747 lovers: The clock is ticking to catch a flight on one of the two U.S. airlines that fly the aircraft. \nUnited said on Tuesday that it expects to retire all 20 of the 747s in its fleet by October 2018. \nThe airline has long said it plans to phase out the aircraft, but reiterated its plan Tuesday during its “Investors Day” call with shareholders. USA TODAY Is Boeing about to pull the plug on the 747? \nUnited is shifting its 747 flying to newer widebody jets, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 777 models that the carrier has ordered. \nThe 747s in United’s fleet – all 747-400 variants of the jet – seat 374 passengers . \nUnited’s current Boeing 777-200s seat anywhere from 266 to 364 passengers, based on the various configurations it has for the aircraft . United’s 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliner models seat 219 and 252 passengers, respectively. USA TODAY United confirms 10-abreast seating on some of its 777s USA TODAY United adds ‘Basic Economy’ fares with carry-on bag restrictions \nDelta Air Lines is the only other U.S. carrier that currently uses 747s for passenger service. Like United, Delta also has begun to phase out its models of the jet. The carrier is on record as saying it expects to retire its last 747 by the end of next year. \nDelta spokesman Morgan Durrant tells Today in the Sky that the airline expects to have five 747-400s remaining in service by the end of 2016. Delta will use several models to replace its 747s. They include new Airbus A330s that already are being delivered to the carrier as well as new Airbus A350s that Delta expects to begin receiving next year. \nDelta’s 747s accommodate 376 passengers.",

      "text": "Luxury waterfront in a luxury community lists for $2M Waterfront with Boeing and the Seahawks as neighbors? That’s Renton. Rec Windermere Get to know what’s it’s like to have the Seahawks and Boeing as neighbors. For $1,990,000 there’s a three bedroom, one and three-quarter bathroom, 2,710 square foot house for sale on the shore of Lake Washington. Airplanes to the south. Football to the north. Most million dollar houses stand alone, fitting every amenity inside the property. Evidently, it is possible to be in a community of luxury houses that has luxurious common spaces. Basically, it looks like a very upscale banquet and convention center on-site, or a place for really big parties. Check the Sunday schedules. It might be busy then. Grid View 4175 Williams Ave N, Renton, WA 98056 The house is listed as a one story, which would suggest the elevator doesn’t get to do much, but the photos and the mention of a 1,010 square foot basement suggest there are effectively two floors. Downstairs (ground level for the elevator folks) is a fenced lawn that is part of the 6,098 square foot property. It’s good to have some place for scrimmages. Upstairs is the main living space with the casual formality of simple things done exceptionally well. The kitchen with long, stone slab counters leads to a dining area that is the backdrop for the living room. Step outside onto the balcony to check the weather or listen to a 737 fly for the first time. Your view is of the passage between the mainland and the east shore of Mercer Island, a quiet stretch of water for shipping traffic, but you’ll get to enjoy a parade of pleasure craft sailing from either the Renton docks or Newport Yacht Club. At least you won’t have to worry about tidal surges with lake front.",

      "title": "A Trade War With China Would Be Bad News for Boeing - Bloomberg",
      "text": "A Trade War With China Would Be Bad News for Boeing America’s No. 1 exporter could become collateral damage if Trump hikes tariffs. \nBoeing’s factory in Everett, Wash. Photograph: Getty Images Share on Facebook \nThroughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump railed against China and its trade practices, saying it’s sucked jobs out of the U.S. His prescription: to prosecute trade cases against the country for its “unfair subsidy behavior” and slap tariffs as high as 45 percent on its exports. If Trump makes good on his threat to spark a trade fight, chances are that the largest exporter in the U.S.—Boeing—will be one of its first casualties. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” wrote the Chinese government-controlled Global Times in an editorial on Nov. 13. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.” \nOf course, Boeing wouldn’t be the only company to take a hit in the ensuing trade war. Sales to China of everything from American autos and iPhones to soybeans and corn would likely be curtailed or halted in retaliation, according to Global Times . But no company is poised to take it on the chin harder than the Chicago-based aerospace giant. \nThis year alone, Boeing stands to reap an estimated $11.03 billion from 164 plane deliveries to China. Most of those sales are for narrow-body 737 jets, the company’s most profitable model. Since 2000 the manufacturer has delivered 967 aircraft to China, worth about $60.2 billion at 2016 prices, according to FlightGlobal data crunched by Bloomberg Intelligence. \nBoeing is also locked into long-term contracts worth about $1 billion a year with several suppliers in China. Any U.S. tariffs on those contractors would raise Boeing’s production costs, possibly hurting its competitiveness against European archrival Airbus Group. \nTo bolster its standing in China, Boeing recently announced plans to open a plant there to install seats on 737s being delivered to Chinese carriers—a move Trump also has denounced. “Boeing has to be as worried as anyone,” aerospace consultant Kevin Michaels says of the trade tensions. “It would be horrible and a huge boon to Airbus, which already has an assembly facility there.” \nBooming Chinese demand for jets is helping drive up 737 production, which is expected to rise by 12 percent to 47 jets a month next year, and 57 planes a month by the end of the decade. Longer-term, a trade war could cause Boeing to lose a chunk of the estimated $1 trillion market for airplane sales in China over the next 20 years. “Boeing would win more than 50 percent” of that market if past ordering patterns held true, says David Wireman, managing director for aerospace and defense at consultant AlixPartners. \nChina has an almost insatiable demand for passenger jets as its growing middle class takes to the skies, so it’s unlikely to completely turn away from the U.S. plane maker. Beijing has been adept at playing Boeing and Airbus against each other in a competition to provide it with the lowest-priced jets. But even if it continues to order Boeing’s planes, China could inflict pain by taxing the air frame components the U.S. manufacturer imports from suppliers like Aviation Industry Corp. of China. Or it could sporadically postpone deliveries of Boeing planes—but not Airbus gear—and blame current market conditions for the delays, says George Ferguson, senior air transport analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “That could hurt,” he says. \nSo far, Boeing hasn’t pushed back aggressively against Trump’s rhetoric. “We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win, and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security,” Boeing said in a statement. \nOne consolation prize for Boeing of a Trump presidency could come if he carries out his threat to require European nations to shoulder more of the financial costs of NATO. Boeing, the second-largest U.S. defense contractor, stands to profit from any increase in arms sales to Central and Eastern European nations nervous about NATO’s future. \nUntil more details of a Trump administration trade policy are made public, any impact on Boeing will remain uncertain. Trump’s trade advisers have suggested that the president-elect could use targeted tariffs to avoid creating conflict with the World Trade Organization. Others have speculated that Trump’s protectionist talk was aimed mainly at whipping up voter support, or perhaps gaining the upper hand in future talks. “We have seen a lot of candidates bashing China when they are running for office but end up at least toning down their rhetoric after taking office,” says Bai Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under China’s Ministry of Commerce. \nFor now, Boeing and other exporters can only hope that a Trump administration recognizes that a fracas may yield unintended results. “It would be nice to say the tariffs would have the impact of bringing jobs back home,” Wireman says. “In reality those jobs could well go to another low-cost region.” —With Dong Lyu and Kyunghee Park \nThe bottom line: Since 2000, Boeing has delivered 967 aircraft worth about $60.2 billion to China. A Trump trade war could put future sales at risk. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE",

(Jeff Gritchen/The Orange County Register/SCNG via AP) \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. Tags",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg   8:23   \nNEW YORK (Nov 17): Throughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump railed against China and its trade practices, saying it’s sucked jobs out of the US. \nHis prescription: to prosecute trade cases against the country for its “unfair subsidy behaviour” and slap tariffs as high as 45% on its exports. If Trump makes good on his threat to spark a trade fight, chances are that the largest exporter in the US — Boeing — will be one of its first casualties. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” wrote the Chinese government-controlled Global Times in an editorial on Nov 13. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.” \nOf course, Boeing wouldn’t be the only company to take a hit in the ensuing trade war. Sales to China of everything from American autos and iPhones to soybeans and corn would likely be curtailed or halted in retaliation, according to Global Times. But no company is poised to take it on the chin harder than the Chicago-based aerospace giant. \nThis year alone, Boeing stands to reap an estimated US$11.03 billion from 164 plane deliveries to China. Most of those sales are for narrow-body 737 jets, the company’s most profitable model. Since 2000 the manufacturer has delivered 967 aircraft to China, worth about US$60.2 billion at 2016 prices, according to FlightGlobal data crunched by Bloomberg Intelligence. \nBoeing is also locked into long-term contracts worth about US$1 billion a year with several suppliers in China. Any US tariffs on those contractors would raise Boeing’s production costs, possibly hurting its competitiveness against European archrival Airbus Group. \nTo bolster its standing in China, Boeing recently announced plans to open a plant there to install seats on 737s being delivered to Chinese carriers—a move Trump also has denounced. “Boeing has to be as worried as anyone,” aerospace consultant Kevin Michaels says of the trade tensions. “It would be horrible and a huge boon to Airbus, which already has an assembly facility there.” \nBooming Chinese demand for jets is helping drive up 737 production, which is expected to rise by 12% to 47 jets a month next year, and 57 planes a month by the end of the decade. Longer-term, a trade war could cause Boeing to lose a chunk of the estimated US$1 trillion market for airplane sales in China over the next 20 years. “Boeing would win more than 50 percent” of that market if past ordering patterns held true, says David Wireman, managing director for aerospace and defense at consultant AlixPartners. \nChina has an almost insatiable demand for passenger jets as its growing middle class takes to the skies, so it’s unlikely to completely turn away from the US plane maker. Beijing has been adept at playing Boeing and Airbus against each other in a competition to provide it with the lowest-priced jets. But even if it continues to order Boeing’s planes, China could inflict pain by taxing the air frame components the US manufacturer imports from suppliers like Aviation Industry Corp of China. Or it could sporadically postpone deliveries of Boeing planes — but not Airbus gear — and blame current market conditions for the delays, says George Ferguson, senior air transport analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “That could hurt,” he says. \nSo far, Boeing hasn’t pushed back aggressively against Trump’s rhetoric. “We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that US companies can compete, win, and grow our economy to provide good jobs to US workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security,” Boeing said in a statement. \nOne consolation prize for Boeing of a Trump presidency could come if he carries out his threat to require European nations to shoulder more of the financial costs of NATO. Boeing, the second-largest US defence contractor, stands to profit from any increase in arms sales to Central and Eastern European nations nervous about NATO’s future. \nUntil more details of a Trump administration trade policy are made public, any impact on Boeing will remain uncertain. Trump’s trade advisers have suggested that the president-elect could use targeted tariffs to avoid creating conflict with the World Trade Organization. Others have speculated that Trump’s protectionist talk was aimed mainly at whipping up voter support, or perhaps gaining the upper hand in future talks. “We have seen a lot of candidates bashing China when they are running for office but end up at least toning down their rhetoric after taking office,” says Bai Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under China’s Ministry of Commerce. \nFor now, Boeing and other exporters can only hope that a Trump administration recognizes that a fracas may yield unintended results. “It would be nice to say the tariffs would have the impact of bringing jobs back home,” Wireman says. “In reality those jobs could well go to another low-cost region.” Related Articles",

      "text": "Aircraft: Boeing 737-800 Seat: 2F (Business Class) \nUpon boarding we were greeted by two young, cute, chipper flight attendants. UIA has a more traditional intra-Europe business class product, meaning that business class is simply economy with a blocked middle seat. This allows the cabin size to be flexible based on demand, and on this flight there were a total of four rows of business class. \nUkraine International Airlines 737 business class \nWe initially settled into seats 3A & 3C, with the middle seat blocked. While legroom wasn’t great, it wasn’t terrible either. I was happy to see that Ukraine didn’t have the slimline seats with very limited recline that many other airlines have nowadays. \nUkraine International Airlines 737 business class seat \nUkraine International Airlines 737 legroom \nAs usual, there was a curtain separating business class from economy, and that curtain can be moved based on the demand for the cabin that day. \nUkraine International Airlines 737 business class cabin \nAlready waiting at our seats on boarding were a pillow & blanket, which many other airlines don’t even offer within Europe. \nUkraine Airlines business class pillow & blanket \nWe were also offered pre-departure beverages in proper glassware. Most European airlines don’t serve pre-departure beverages in business class, so I was quite impressed. Even though there was only one other passenger in business class, the flight attendant came around with a tray containing six different types of drinks. I had orange juice, while Tiffany had water. \nUkraine Airlines business class pre-departure beverages \nAs the flight boarded I observed the flight attendant personally greeting every single passenger with a smile, which you don’t often see, especially before sunrise. \nBy 6AM boarding was complete, at which point the crew came around business class with magazines and newspapers. At 6:05AM the captain came on the PA to advise us of our outrageously long flight time of 3hr30min (the direct distance between the two airports is just ~1,150 miles), given that airspaces we were avoiding. \nShortly thereafter the senior cabin crew member added her welcome aboard, and moments later they did a manual safety demonstration. \nWe began our pushback at 6:15AM. As I looked out the window I was fascinated by the fact that Baku Airport seems to have an A380 gate. The airport is certainly built for expansion, it would seem. \nBig gate for a small plane at Baku Airport! \nSince the cabin was empty, I decided to switch to seat 2F, so that Tiffany and I could both be in window seats. \nUkraine International Airlines 737 business class \nAs we pushed there was an Aeroflot 737 off our right wing. \nAeroflot 737 Baku Airport \nAs we taxied out, the guy in 1A was watching something on his tablet with headphones, and the flight attendant told him he had to remove the headphones for takeoff. His solution? To take off the headphones and keep watching the show at full volume. A few minutes later the flight attendant returned and said it was bothering other guests, and asked him to turn it off until after takeoff. \nWe had a high speed taxi, and at 6:25AM we were cleared for takeoff on runway 34. \n10 minutes after takeoff the seatbelt sign was turned off, and a few minutes after that the crew distributed warm towels. \nUkraine business class hot towel \nThe crew also passed out small amenity packs, containing socks, eyeshades, and earplugs. It’s not often you see that on an intra-Europe flight. \nUkraine business class socks, eyeshades, and earplugs \nUkraine business class socks, eyeshades, and earplugs \nThe views were stunning once we reached our cruising altitude. The below scenery continued for about an hour, and was only made more beautiful by the sunrise. \nUkraine business class socks, eyeshades, and earplugs \nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff the crew came through the cabin to take drink and meal orders. For breakfast they had the choice between an omelet with potatoes and chicken with vegetables. They also gave the option of dining right away or later on, which was also a nice choice you often don’t get within Europe. \nBefore the meal I was offered a drink, and ordered a coffee. The presentation of the coffee was excellent, including a cute heart-shaped UIA chocolate. \nUkraine business class coffee \nI was offered the choice between cranberries with cashews or mixed salted nuts. Not your typical breakfast starter, if you ask me… \nUkraine business class breakfast — nuts to start \nAfter that I was served the starter course, consisting of cold cuts, a roll, a croissant, fruit, and baklava. \nUkraine business class breakfast \nUkraine business class breakfast — cold cuts \nUkraine business class breakfast — baklava \nUkraine business class breakfast — fruit plate \nOnce I was finished with that I was served the omelet I had ordered, which was quite bland. \nUkraine business class breakfast — omelet \nThe crew really was lovely, one of the best I’ve had within Europe. They were friendly and seemed motivated, which you don’t see at many other European carriers. They were also incredibly vigilant about reserving the forward lavatory for business class passengers. As I figured out at check-in and the gate, many of the Ukrainian passengers were quite aggressive when it came to pushing their way forward, though the flight attendants sure were authoritative with sending them to the rear lavatories. \nBreakfast was done less than an hour after takeoff, at which point I tried to rest for a bit. Unfortunately I’m someone who can’t for the life of me sleep unless I’m in a flat bed, so I don’t think I got any real sleep. However, at least I managed to close me eyes for a bit. \nAfter that I took out my laptop and worked for a while. \nAbout 30 minutes before landing the captain came on the PA to provide us with updated arrival information. \nView approaching Kiev \nAs we began our descent, the crew distributed little circular containers that I found odd at first. As it turns out, they’re wet wipes that can be accessed by pushing down the center section and then pushing on the rear. Interesting concept, though it feels a bit cheap compared to warm towels. \nUkraine business class pre-landing towels \nI’ve never been to Kiev (though I’ve heard great things), so I quite enjoyed the views on our descent. \nView on descent into Kiev \nView on descent into Kiev \nView on descent into Kiev \nView on descent into Kiev \nWe had a smooth touchdown on runway 18L at Kiev Airport at 7:45AM. \nTaxiing Kiev Airport \nFrom there we had a 10 minute taxi to our arrival stand. It’s amazing to me how almost all of the gates at the terminal were empty, though virtually all of the UIA planes were using remote stands. Grrrr! \nUkraine International planes at Kiev Airport \nUkraine International 737 Kiev Airport \nThe one upside of remote stands is that it means you can get a great view of the outside of the plane you just flew, as was the case here. \nOur 737 upon arrival in Kiev \nUkraine 737 Kiev Airport \nThe bus ride to the terminal took about five minutes, though the bus was packed and the driver was aggressive, clearly not considering that there were probably 100 people standing in the back of his bus as he made turns. \nBus to terminal at Kiev Airport \nUpon arriving in the Kiev Airport terminal, the real adventure began… UIA 737 business class bottom line \nThis UIA 737 business class flight nicely exceeded my expectations. Like most other European carriers, business class was simply economy with a blocked middle, which is disappointing. \nHowever, every other aspect of the experience was better than what I’ve grown accustomed to with most European airlines — there were pre-departure beverages, pillows and blankets, a meal with several courses, and truly friendly flight attendants. \nOverall UIA is a very nice way to fly within Europe. Too bad that’s not true of their longhaul experience. More from One Mile At A Time",

Together the company currently employs 360 people over both locations. \nAs well as the closures, over 2,500 jobs will be moved from various sites in California and Washington state, largely to existing facilities in Los Angeles County and Alabama. \nWant to read more?

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg | November 17, 2016 : 8:23 PM MYT NEW YORK (Nov 17): Throughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump railed against China and its trade practices, saying it’s sucked jobs out of the US.\nHis prescription: to prosecute trade cases against the country for its “unfair subsidy behaviour” and slap tariffs as high as 45% on its exports. If Trump makes good on his threat to spark a trade fight, chances are that the largest exporter in the US — Boeing — will be one of its first casualties. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” wrote the Chinese government-controlled Global Times in an editorial on Nov 13. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.”\nOf course, Boeing wouldn’t be the only company to take a hit in the ensuing trade war. Sales to China of everything from American autos and iPhones to soybeans and corn would likely be curtailed or halted in retaliation, according to Global Times. But no company is poised to take it on the chin harder than the Chicago-based aerospace giant.\nThis year alone, Boeing stands to reap an estimated US$11.03 billion from 164 plane deliveries to China. Most of those sales are for narrow-body 737 jets, the company’s most profitable model. Since 2000 the manufacturer has delivered 967 aircraft to China, worth about US$60.2 billion at 2016 prices, according to FlightGlobal data crunched by Bloomberg Intelligence.\nBoeing is also locked into long-term contracts worth about US$1 billion a year with several suppliers in China. Any US tariffs on those contractors would raise Boeing’s production costs, possibly hurting its competitiveness against European archrival Airbus Group.\nTo bolster its standing in China, Boeing recently announced plans to open a plant there to install seats on 737s being delivered to Chinese carriers—a move Trump also has denounced. “Boeing has to be as worried as anyone,” aerospace consultant Kevin Michaels says of the trade tensions. “It would be horrible and a huge boon to Airbus, which already has an assembly facility there.”\nBooming Chinese demand for jets is helping drive up 737 production, which is expected to rise by 12% to 47 jets a month next year, and 57 planes a month by the end of the decade. Longer-term, a trade war could cause Boeing to lose a chunk of the estimated US$1 trillion market for airplane sales in China over the next 20 years. “Boeing would win more than 50 percent” of that market if past ordering patterns held true, says David Wireman, managing director for aerospace and defense at consultant AlixPartners.\nChina has an almost insatiable demand for passenger jets as its growing middle class takes to the skies, so it’s unlikely to completely turn away from the US plane maker. Beijing has been adept at playing Boeing and Airbus against each other in a competition to provide it with the lowest-priced jets. But even if it continues to order Boeing’s planes, China could inflict pain by taxing the air frame components the US manufacturer imports from suppliers like Aviation Industry Corp of China. Or it could sporadically postpone deliveries of Boeing planes — but not Airbus gear — and blame current market conditions for the delays, says George Ferguson, senior air transport analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “That could hurt,” he says.\nSo far, Boeing hasn’t pushed back aggressively against Trump’s rhetoric. “We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that US companies can compete, win, and grow our economy to provide good jobs to US workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security,” Boeing said in a statement.\nOne consolation prize for Boeing of a Trump presidency could come if he carries out his threat to require European nations to shoulder more of the financial costs of NATO. Boeing, the second-largest US defence contractor, stands to profit from any increase in arms sales to Central and Eastern European nations nervous about NATO’s future.\nUntil more details of a Trump administration trade policy are made public, any impact on Boeing will remain uncertain. Trump’s trade advisers have suggested that the president-elect could use targeted tariffs to avoid creating conflict with the World Trade Organization. Others have speculated that Trump’s protectionist talk was aimed mainly at whipping up voter support, or perhaps gaining the upper hand in future talks. “We have seen a lot of candidates bashing China when they are running for office but end up at least toning down their rhetoric after taking office,” says Bai Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under China’s Ministry of Commerce.\nFor now, Boeing and other exporters can only hope that a Trump administration recognizes that a fracas may yield unintended results. “It would be nice to say the tariffs would have the impact of bringing jobs back home,” Wireman says. “In reality those jobs could well go to another low-cost region.”\nwww.theedgemarkets.com/en/article/trade-war-china-would-be-bad-news-boeing\nShare this More articles on Good Articles to Share >>\nStanChart expects Bank Negara to cut OPR in 1Q17, instead of next Wed - Nov 17, 2016 [转贴] 做這3件事，讓自己明年比現在還富有 - Nov 17, 2016 Good bye at last.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nNorth Carolina Republican lawmakers in Congress, looking to stymie a key part of the Iran nuclear deal, want to keep United States banks and taxpayer dollars from financing airplane exports to Iran from Boeing Company – one of the world’s largest aircraft manufacturers and a prolific donor to politicians’ campaign coffers. \nA majority in the U.S. House on Wednesday passed a bill aimed at blocking Boeing’s intended sale of 80 commercial airplanes to Iran Air, the government-ran airline. The vote, 243-174, fell mostly along party lines with all 10 Republican House members from North Carolina supporting the legislation. \nPresident Barack Obama has said he would veto the measure, if the Senate also approved the bill. \nWhen they’re in violation of the deal that we negotiated in good faith, it would not be a prudent move on our part. \nU.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. \nPart of the bill would prohibit Boeing and other U.S. companies from using the government-supported Export-Import Bank to facilitate trade with Iran – something that’s already barred due to the federal government’s designation of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. \nThe proposed legislation would take current export restrictions further by prohibiting private banks from lending money for planes headed to Iran. The Export-Import Bank is a government credit agency designed to insure and finance U.S. exports. \nDemocrats argued such a move to limit legal exports undercuts the United States’ contractual obligations under the Iran nuclear deal, which eased economic sanctions to allow commercial aircraft exports. All three Democratic members from North Carolina – Reps. Alma Adams, G.K. Butterfield and David Price – opposed the Republican-written bill. \nIn South Carolina, home to a major Boeing manufacturing enterprise, all six Republican House members voted for the bill. The state’s sole Democrat in Congress, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, voted against the legislation. \n[Could American planes be used for Iranian terrorism?] \nWestern North Carolina U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican from Cashiers, said the United States shouldn’t promote Iran’s economic development at a time when that nation’s leaders aren’t holding up their end of the nuclear deal. \n“When they’re in violation of the deal that we negotiated in good faith, it would not be a prudent move on our part,” he said, adding that Iranian government officials should immediately rectify violations or the U.S. should “tear up the agreement and start over.” \nButterfield said Republicans shouldn’t devalue the Export-Import Bank’s overall benefit to the U.S. and international economy to facilitate trade. He said he supported Obama’s leadership on the Iran nuclear deal “with reservations” but saw the agreement as positive because it will contain Iran’s nuclear arsenal. \nThe House bill Wednesday, if it becomes law, would directly affect U.S. aircraft companies’ ability to begin exporting to Iran under the newly eased sanctions. Supporters of the bill say they worry Iranian officials will misuse the Boeing planes to ship fighters and weapons to Syria to aid the Islamic State – something Iran has been sanctioned for in the past. \nCharlotte-area Rep. Robert Pittenger, a Republican, said after the vote in a news statement: “This bill confronts the same airline that has been sanctioned by the Treasury Department for transporting fighters and weapons on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. It is beyond me how the administration can be okay with allowing Iran access to airplanes which would only further their support of terrorism.” \nThe U.S. Treasury, under Obama’s administration, has already given Boeing and another company, Airbus, permission to export planes to Iran. But, company officials have said they won’t use the taxpayer-backed Export-Import Bank to finance the deal. \nEDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE \nThose opposed to hampering Boeing’s deal say the proposed legislation would put U.S. companies at a global disadvantage as the sanctions relief has opened up new lines of trade and financing for Iran to buy airplanes elsewhere. \nRepublicans’ opposition to U.S. assistance for Boeing to sell planes to Iran means House members are defying one of the biggest lobbying and campaign spenders in Washington. Boeing was the No. 3 top spender on lobbying last year – shelling out nearly $21.9 million to influence policy, according to a report earlier this year by CQ Roll Call , a news organization that covers Congress. \nThe company’s political action committee is also one of the most prolific donors to lawmakers’ campaigns and has contributed equally to North Carolina Democrats and Republicans over the past six years. Boeing’s PAC has donated about $112,000 total in that time to North Carolina U.S. House members.",

Together the company currently employs 360 people over both locations. \nAs well as the closures, over 2,500 jobs will be moved from various sites in California and Washington state, largely to existing facilities in Los Angeles County and Alabama. \nWant to read more?

There’s one thing in common with most of the domains hosting this bad stuff: they were registered a short time ago. \nIn fact, many malware networks are programmed to frequently register new domain names to keep one step ahead of blacklists*. \nBoeing (NYSE:BA), a company that is certainly a target for malware attacks, has come up with a creative solution to weed out these potentially harmful links without relying on out-of-date URL blacklists. \nIn a patent application (pdf) filed last year and publised by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office today, the company outlines a way to flag links in emails from what it calls “newborn” domains. \nBasically, a service will ping whois to check the registration date of any domain names linked to within an email. If they are within a set timeframe, the email server could remediate risk by disabling the link, providing a warning to the recipient, or not delivering the email. \nIt’s an amazingly simple idea that I hope is put into commercial use. \n* On the same day Boeing filed its patent application, Cisco filed one (pdf) for detecting domain names registered as part of these systems.",

For one, its commercial business will always be cyclical. \nA continued focus on cost reductions and productivity improvements will mitigate cyclicality to a degree. \nLet's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares. Click to enlarge By The Valuentum Team Commercial jet and military aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: BA ) continues to benefit from strength in commercial aircraft deliveries, which has paved the way for strong earnings and free cash flow generation. The aerospace giant has now put the struggles of building the revolutionary 787 Dreamliner behind it, and we expect the plane to continue to be a favorite among point-to-point airlines around the globe. Have you ever flown in one? Share your experience in the comments section below. Nearly a decade ago, Boeing envisioned a world of increasing point-to-point travel requiring wide-body aircraft with ultra-fuel efficient economics, laying the groundwork for the blueprint of the 787 Dreamliner, a mostly-composite aircraft. Airbus ( OTCPK:EADSF ), on the other hand, had a different view of the future. The European plane maker believed that air travel would be dominated by the hub-and-spoke system where massive planes would be needed to transport passengers between global hubs. It decided to build the massive A380 superjumbo. After Airbus cut its production guidance through 2018, we think it is safe to say that Boeing can declare victory in this particular battle, though the war is far from over. Nevertheless, Boeing's operations are not without risk. For one, its commercial business will always be cyclical, and while the firm remains effectively 'sold out' for the foreseeable future, cancellations and delays with respect to deliveries could hurt growth. As past cycles reveal, however, deferrals aren't much to worry about, and a huge backlog helps to pad its delivery trajectory. More recently though, there has been some talk of oversupply in the smaller widebody market, but we think global demand will remain resilient as demand for air travel is expected to nearly double by 2035. Long-term investors look very well-positioned. Furthermore, a continued focus on cost reductions and productivity improvements should mitigate earnings pressure during weak economic times to a degree, while key defense awards will help to prop up the other part of its business portfolio. Boeing's massive backlog is simply incredible, and its cash flow generating capacity is top notch. Such free cash flow generation is the basis for the firm's solid Dividend Cushion ratio of 2, which becomes even more impressive when considering its dividend yield of nearly 3%. Be sure to learn more about the Dividend Cushion ratio! Let's continue with the analysis. Boeing 's Investment Considerations Image source: Valuentum Investment Highlights • Boeing is the largest manufacturer of commercial jetliners and military aircraft combined. Boeing also makes rotorcraft, electronic and defense systems, missiles, satellites, launch vehicles and advanced information and communication systems. The firm is a major service provider to NASA. It was founded in 1916 and is now based in Chicago, Illinois. • The aerospace giant is benefiting from a benign operating environment. Global economic growth continues (albeit modestly), air passenger traffic is healthy, defense markets are firming with renewed threats, and commercial aviation remains a long-term growth market. • Boeing's massive commercial aerospace backlog of unfulfilled deliveries gives it excellent visibility and a growth trajectory better than most other firms of similar size. Its revolutionary 787 has changed the economics of air travel, and we expect deliveries to remain robust coming years. Technical concerns with any new plane (737 MAX, 777X) are a big risk, however. • Boeing earns an 'A' rating from the credit agencies, and the firm's balance sheet remains healthy despite a recent dip in its cash balance in the first half of 2016 due to share repurchases and the timing of cash flows. We think the firm has learned from the recent global financial crisis, but cyclical end markets will always be a risk. • Boeing disappointed with its outlook for 2016, but we think the company is doing fine. It had to cut widebody deliveries as it bridges the gap to the launch of the 777X. We had to revise our fair value estimate lower, however, due to the timing of cash flows. Business Quality Image source: Valuentum Economic Profit Analysis In our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Boeing's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 26.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Image source: Valuentum Cash Flow Analysis Image source: Valuentum Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Boeing's free cash flow margin has averaged about 7.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Boeing, cash flow from operations increased about 14% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 9% over the same time period. Valuation Analysis We think Boeing is worth $124 per share with a fair value range of $99-$149. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.9%, which is above Boeing's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Boeing, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. Image source: Valuentum",

      "text": "A trio of Boeing 737 buyers have delayed or postponed their orders, leaving a Puget Sound-area analyst wondering if the world is on the cusp of an aerospace downturn. The first was Southwest Airlines . In June, it postponed delivery of 67 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft by up to six years, deferring $1.6 billion in spending into the 2020s. Next was Turkish Airlines. In October, it rescheduled deliveries for an unspecified number of the 65 Boeing 737 Max 8 and 10 737 Max 9 aircraft it planned to add to…",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nBoeing said Tuesday it will close some defense and space facilities around the country during the next four years, reducing its overall footprint by approximately 4.5 million square feet and moving the work of thousands of employees to new sites. \nSpokesman Ken Smith said Boeing expects “few if any job losses from today’s announcement in Washington state.” \nHowever, about 1,000 defense-side workers will be moved from the company’s Kent site, which has been shrinking for some years, to Tukwila. \nAbout 1,600 positions in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in other Southern California locations — El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and one that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. \n“In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,” Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. “These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.” \nThe company said it will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. \nMeanwhile, United Airlines will convert the bulk of two orders for Boeing’s best-selling narrowbody jetliner to the planemaker’s newest variant. \nThe Chicago-based airline is changing its orders for 65 Boeing jets from all 737-700s to four 737-800s and 61 737 Maxes. \nUnited said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday that it expects to receive the 737-800s next year, while delivery dates for the 737 Max jets are “to be determined.” \n“These changes will allow United to take advantage of the superior fuel efficiency of the MAX aircraft while also reducing capital expenditures by approximately $1.6 billion through 2018,” the airline said in its filing. \nThe order change comes before Boeing planned to increase its monthly production rate on the 737 from 42 aircraft a month to 47. \nThe Associated Press, The Seattle Times, and The Wichita Eagle contributed to this report Related content ",

      "text": "by IWB · November 17, 2016 \nOne amendment would prohibit the Office of Foreign Assets Control from using funds to authorise a license necessary to allow aircraft to be sold to Iran. A second would bar loans from US financial institutions to purchase militarily adaptable aircraft. \nThe ban would need to be approved by the Senate or any bill that reconciles differences in legislation by the two chambers. \nRoskam, an Illinois Republican, said in a tweet that in the vote on Thursday, “ House Democrats did not mount any significant opposition and, in many cases, joined efforts to block the sale.” \nThe news comes weeks after Boeing and Iran Air confirmed a tentative deal for the sale of passenger planes, described as a landmark for normalising the difficult US-Iran relationship. \nThe deal, valued at up to $25bn, would be the largest between a US business and Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.",

      "text": "Moonlighting Close \nA Boeing 767 operated by LAN Peru taxis to the gate at Washington Dulles International Airport on May 2, 2016. (Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority) Budget plan calls for lower per-passenger costs at Dulles 17 hrs ago 0 \nA Boeing 767 operated by LAN Peru taxis to the gate at Washington Dulles International Airport on May 2, 2016. (Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority) \nAirlines using Washington Dulles International Airport in 2017 would see a 16-percent reduction in airport costs per passenger, under the proposed budget set for adoption in December by the board of directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. \nReducing the per-passenger cost at Dulles has been a key goal not only of the airports’ authority but of Virginia state officials, who fear the airport is becoming less competitive – something that could damage the regional economy. \nState officials went so far as to allocate $50 million in taxpayer funds over two years in an effort to cut costs for airlines. \nIn the authority’s draft budget, the estimated per-passenger cost for airlines at Dulles would drop from $22.55 to $18.97. It would be the third consecutive decline from the $26.55-per-passenger cost for airlines recorded in 2014. \nAt Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the per-passenger cost, which had increased from $11.26 in 2014 to $14.15 in 2016, is projected to decline slightly to $14.12 in 2017. \nThe budget anticipates 22.9 million passenger enplanements at the two airports in 2017, up 1.6 percent from the current year, based on a projected 1.3-percent passenger growth at Reagan National and 1.9-percent growth at Dulles.

      "text": "Boeing Fighter-Jet Sales Advance Toward Final Approval November 18, 2016, 12:23:00 AM   By Doug Cameron \nBoeing Co. moved closer to extending the life of its combat-jet production lines with the State Department's approval of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth a combined $31.2 billion. \nWith that barrier cleared Thursday, the long-delayed deals now go before Congress for final approval. Lawmakers have already been informally briefed, allowing the Pentagon and Boeing to press ahead with completing terms for the government-to-government transaction. \nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Typhoons. \nMiddle Eastern countries' interest in combat jets comes despite budget pressure from falling oil prices , the main source of revenue for countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. \nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It is also trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy, but the U.S.--as it shifts to the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35--won't buy any more F-15s as it. \nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India, a deal that could require it to build the planes there. \nLeanne Caret, head of Boeing's defense unit, has made waves inside and outside the company by saying its decadeslong history of producing fighters is likely to end in the early 2020s. \nOrders for its F-15 and F/A-18 jets have been drying up for years, forcing production to slow, but Ms. Caret is the first Boeing executive to face a future without fighter production as a centerpiece of the unit's strategy. Her plan is to replace sales revenue by doing more repair and upgrade work on the hundreds of its jets already flying. \nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com  18-160023ET  ",

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. moved closer to extending the life of its combat-jet production lines with the State Department's approval of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth a combined $31.2 billion.\nWith that barrier cleared Thursday, the long-delayed deals now go before Congress for final approval. Lawmakers have already been informally briefed, allowing the Pentagon and Boeing to press ahead with completing terms for the government-to-government transaction.\nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar could still split any buy between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet.\nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Typhoons.\nMiddle Eastern countries' interest in combat jets comes despite budget pressure from falling oil prices, the main source of revenue for countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It is also trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy, but the U.S.--as it shifts to the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35--won't buy any more F-15s as it.\nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India, a deal that could require it to build the planes there.\nLeanne Caret, head of Boeing's defense unit, has made waves inside and outside the company by saying its decadeslong history of producing fighters is likely to end in the early 2020s.\nOrders for its F-15 and F/A-18 jets have been drying up for years, forcing production to slow, but Ms. Caret is the first Boeing executive to face a future without fighter production as a centerpiece of the unit's strategy. Her plan is to replace sales revenue by doing more repair and upgrade work on the hundreds of its jets already flying.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 00:23 ET (05:23 ",

      "text": "Boeing (BA) Shares Cross 3% Yield Mark November 17, 2016, 03:12:24 PM EDT By DividendChannel.com, BNK Invest Shutterstock photo \nLooking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel , in trading on Thursday, shares of Boeing Co. (Symbol: BA) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $4.36), with the stock changing hands as low as $145.11 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Boeing Co. (Symbol: BA) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index. In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Boeing Co. , looking at the history chart for BA below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield. According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, BA makes up 8.88% of the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (Symbol: ITA) which is trading relatively unchanged on the day Thursday.",

      "text": "print \nST. LOUIS (AP) — Boeing Co. plans to move about 2,500 positions to other sites, cut 500 jobs and close two facilities by the end of 2020 in an effort to make its Defense, Space & Security business more efficient, the company said Tuesday. \nAbout 1,600 positions currently in Huntington Beach, California, will move to plants in three other Southern California locations -- El Segundo, Long Beach and Seal Beach. About 500 positions will move to St. Louis County in Missouri, and 400 will shift to Huntsville, Alabama. \nChicago-based Boeing will close a plant that employs 290 people in in El Paso, Texas, and another that employs 70 people in Newington, Virginia. The company said the moves will reduce facility space by about 4.5 million square feet. \nThe Huntington Beach plant will remain open. Boeing spokesman Ken Smith declined to say how many workers will remain there. \nThe company will move an unspecified number of jobs from Kent, Washington, to Tukwila, Washington. The two towns are just 16 miles apart. \n\"In order to push ourselves farther and win more business, we need to make the most of our resources and talent,\" Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said in a statement. \"These steps will help us be a stronger partner for our customers worldwide.\" \nThe company said it also will align Boeing Defence Australia, Boeing Defense Saudi Arabia, and Boeing Defence United Kingdom into a new global operations group, led by David Pitchforth, managing director of Boeing Defence U.K. More from Associated Press: ",

      "text": "By the Editorial Board   Workers assemble Boeing 737-800 jet in 2014 at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington. (Associated Press File) \nMany U.S. House members who bemoaned the loss of good U.S. manufacturing jobs, while campaigning this fall, voted Thursday to kill some of the very best U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nBy a vote of 243-174, the House approved a bill that would prevent the sale of U.S. commercial aircraft to Iran. \nUnder the 2015 agreement by which Iran agreed to halt its nuclear power development, six Western powers, including the United States, agreed to lift economic sanctions. Iran since then has negotiated about $42 billion worth of preliminary deals to buy or lease at least 200 new commercial jets from U.S.-based Boeing and Europe’s Airbus Industries. Airbus also assembles its A321 aircraft in Alabama and buys about 10 percent of its parts from American manufacturers. \nThe bill would preclude the Treasury Department from issuing licenses that banks need to finance international transactions, and would apply to Boeing and Airbus. \nRep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee who opposes the bill, said it would adversely affect about 100,000 jobs throughout the commercial aircraft industry and its long supply chain. \nTo complete the deals, Iran would have to comply with several international protocols for multinational financial transactions. So the bill not only would diminish U.S. manufacturing but preclude Iran’s movement toward global diplomatic and financial norms. \nThe Senate should reject the bill. If it does not do so, President Obama should veto it.  ",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Boeing Co. This has not been a particularly good week for Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). On Tuesday, one of its largest customers, United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL) announced that it will defer delivery of 61 Boeing 737-700s and substitute four 737-800s in its order for delivery next year. The announcement triggered a sell-off in Boeing stock, and the share price dropped about $5 as of the end of trading on Thursday.\nThen on Wednesday the company said it will chop 500 jobs over four years in its defense division and close two plants, shifting about 2,500 employees to new work sites.\nBut the week wasn’t over yet. Late Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill blocking the sale of Boeing and Airbus commercial jets to Iran. Both Boeing and Airbus had plans in place to sell or lease about 200 planes to Iran, but the passage of the House bill forbids the Treasury Department from issuing licenses for the sale, and that means that U.S. banks will not be able to help finance any sales.\nAlthough Airbus is based in France, it is affected by the ban because at least 10% of its airplanes’ components are made in the United States.\nThe House bill is unlikely to become law in the waning days of the Obama administration, but when the new Trump administration takes over in January, with Republican control of both the Senate and the House, such a restriction might well be pushed through. Trump is also on record as opposed both to Boeing’s plan to build an assembly plant in China and to the nuclear deal struck with Iran that lifted sanctions against the Islamic Republic and enabled the country to ramp up its oil exports and do business with companies like Boeing and Airbus.\nBoeing does nothing to help its cause by announcing that it plans to fire 500 workers. The President-elect’s campaign promise to make the country great again depends on his ability to create more U.S. jobs, not jobs in China and Mexico for U.S. companies and their shareholders to profit from while American workers are left behind.\nAs for the event that started Boeing’s awful week, the United Continental deferral of delivery on new 737-700s and switching four orders to the larger 737-800s, this might have been good, rather than, bad news for Boeing. As Scott Hamilton at Leeham News points out , the switch to the larger plane and eventually to the 737 MAX family, Boeing stands to earn more profits than from the selling the smallest commercial jet it makes. Hamilton also notes that swapping one model for another is “routinely included [in] contract provisions.”\nIn the short run, Boeing has plenty of orders for the 737, and United’s deferral simply means pulling some orders forward. That should present no problem for the company.\nAnd company that makes the 737 fuselage, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. (NYSE: SPR), has actually seen its share price rise after dipping briefly following the United Continental announcement. That doesn’t sound like Boeing is making plans to trim production of the plane.\nIn Friday’s premarket session, Boeing shares traded up about 0.1% at $145.45, after closing Thursday at $145.33. The stock’s 52-week range is $102.10 to $150.59, and the consensus 12-month price target is $151.00.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. moved closer to extending the life of its combat-jet production lines with the State Department's approval of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth a combined $31.2 billion.\nWith that barrier cleared Thursday, the long-delayed deals now go before Congress for final approval. Lawmakers have already been informally briefed, allowing the Pentagon and Boeing to press ahead with completing terms for the government-to-government transaction.\nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar could still split any buy between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet.\nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Typhoons.\nMiddle Eastern countries' interest in combat jets comes despite budget pressure from falling oil prices, the main source of revenue for countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It is also trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy, but the U.S.--as it shifts to the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35--won't buy any more F-15s as it.\nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India, a deal that could require it to build the planes there.\nLeanne Caret, head of Boeing's defense unit, has made waves inside and outside the company by saying its decadeslong history of producing fighters is likely to end in the early 2020s.\nOrders for its F-15 and F/A-18 jets have been drying up for years, forcing production to slow, but Ms. Caret is the first Boeing executive to face a future without fighter production as a centerpiece of the unit's strategy. Her plan is to replace sales revenue by doing more repair and upgrade work on the hundreds of its jets already flying.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 00:23 ET (05:23 ",

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. moved closer to extending the life of its combat-jet production lines with the State Department's approval of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth a combined $31.2 billion.\nWith that barrier cleared Thursday, the long-delayed deals now go before Congress for final approval. Lawmakers have already been informally briefed, allowing the Pentagon and Boeing to press ahead with completing terms for the government-to-government transaction.\nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar could still split any buy between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet.\nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Typhoons.\nMiddle Eastern countries' interest in combat jets comes despite budget pressure from falling oil prices, the main source of revenue for countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It is also trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy, but the U.S.--as it shifts to the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35--won't buy any more F-15s as it.\nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India, a deal that could require it to build the planes there.\nLeanne Caret, head of Boeing's defense unit, has made waves inside and outside the company by saying its decadeslong history of producing fighters is likely to end in the early 2020s.\nOrders for its F-15 and F/A-18 jets have been drying up for years, forcing production to slow, but Ms. Caret is the first Boeing executive to face a future without fighter production as a centerpiece of the unit's strategy. Her plan is to replace sales revenue by doing more repair and upgrade work on the hundreds of its jets already flying.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 00:23 ET (05:23 ",

      "title": "US House votes to stop sales of Boeing jetliners to Iran",
      "text": "Washington: The House voted Thursday to effectively block Boeing Co. from selling or leasing jetliners to Iran, reflecting broad Republican opposition to the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal that allows the transaction involving 109 aircraft worth as much as $25 billion.\nThe 243-174 vote was largely along party lines and comes despite a White House veto threat. The measure would prevent the Treasury Department from authorising US bank transactions for sales of aircraft to Iran and would bar the US Export-Import Bank from financing any exports to that country.\nBoeing shares dropped on the news, falling 1.8 per cent to $145.40 at 12:50pm.\n“The world’s greatest state sponsor of terror should not be aided by the US taxpayer, by our banking system, in order to finance planes that we really don’t know they’re going to do with them,” Republican Representative Bob Dold of Illinois said Wednesday on the House floor.\nRepublicans in Congress strongly oppose the 2015 agreement between the US and five other nations, including Russia, that is designed to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran agreed to redesign and reduce its nuclear facilities in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Opposition in Congress gained traction with the election victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he wants to tear up or renegotiate the deal. \nBoeing won US approval in September to sell its first jetliners to Iran in nearly 40 years. The Treasury Department’s decision paved the way for the biggest business deal between the US and Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the US hostage crisis.\nBoeing’s last aeroplane deliveries to Iran consisted of 747 jumbos that arrived in 1977, two years before the revolution, according to the company’s website.\nEarlier this week, the House passed a bill, H.R. 6297, that also pushes back against the international accord by extending economic sanctions against Iran through 2026. The administration has waived the sanctions as part of the implementation of the nuclear agreement.\nThere’s little reason to think the measure passed Thursday, H.R. 5711, will advance much further during this congressional session. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, introduced a similar bill that would block the Ex-Im Bank from providing financing related to Iran. The measure, S. 3138, hasn’t gotten a vote in the Senate Banking Committee.\nVeto Threat\nThe White House said in a statement this week that Obama would veto the House measure. It is “profoundly in the national security interest of the United States” to keep commitments made in the Iran nuclear accord as long as Tehran keeps its promises, the administration’s statement said.\nThe administration said the restriction on Ex-Im financing was unacceptable.\n“The sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on US and non-U. S. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with Iran,” the White House said.",

F-15's for Qatar and F/A-18E/F for Kuwait Last edited by Slater; Today at 19:07 . 3   Slater Looks like Kuwait and Qatar want to drop some coin to upgrade their fighter fleets. Think there will be any issue with Congressional approval? Word on the street is this has already been approved. Keeping the production line open is definitely a good thing. \"We must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.\" -Benjamin Franklin Feedback Score 10 (100%) Nice to have money coming in, but it seems funny for such wealthy countries to buy such old fighter designs at this point in time. Would they be unable to get US approval to buy something like the F-35? Aren't there various other fighters for sale, by other countries, that are at least as good as the F-15 if not better?

      "text": "By Doug Cameron\nBoeing Co. moved closer to extending the life of its combat-jet production lines with the State Department's approval of sales to Kuwait and Qatar worth a combined $31.2 billion.\nWith that barrier cleared Thursday, the long-delayed deals now go before Congress for final approval. Lawmakers have already been informally briefed, allowing the Pentagon and Boeing to press ahead with completing terms for the government-to-government transaction.\nQatar wants to buy as many as 72 Boeing F-15 fighters that together with weapons and support could be worth $21.1 billion, the Pentagon said. However, Qatar could still split any buy between Boeing and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet.\nKuwait wants 32 Boeing F/A-18 jets at a cost of $10.1 billion, including weapons and support systems, the Pentagon said. Kuwait signed a deal earlier this year with Leonardo SpA to buy 28 Typhoons.\nMiddle Eastern countries' interest in combat jets comes despite budget pressure from falling oil prices, the main source of revenue for countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nBoeing faced having to shut down the St. Louis, Mo., production lines for both jets by the end of the decade unless it secured export deals. It is also trying to sell more F/A-18s to the U.S. Navy, but the U.S.--as it shifts to the Lockheed Martin Corp. F-35--won't buy any more F-15s as it.\nChicago-based Boeing also is trying to sell the F/A-18 to India, a deal that could require it to build the planes there.\nLeanne Caret, head of Boeing's defense unit, has made waves inside and outside the company by saying its decadeslong history of producing fighters is likely to end in the early 2020s.\nOrders for its F-15 and F/A-18 jets have been drying up for years, forcing production to slow, but Ms. Caret is the first Boeing executive to face a future without fighter production as a centerpiece of the unit's strategy. Her plan is to replace sales revenue by doing more repair and upgrade work on the hundreds of its jets already flying.\nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com\n 00:23 ET (05:23 ",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of United Continental Holdings Inc. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) currently expects to deliver about 745 to 750 commercial aircraft to its customers this year. Through the end of October the company had delivered 617 planes.\nIn October Boeing delivered 54 new commercial jets. If it can maintain that pace — or something near it — the company should easily meet its sales target. The bad news is that orders for the first 10 months of the year total just 457. Ideally, Boeing would like a 1-to-1 book-to-bill ratio, but in late September the company said it is angling for 535 new orders in 2016. Even that total may be out of reach given the recent vote in the U.S. House of Representatives killing the company’s opportunity to sell planes to Iran .\nOf the 617 planes delivered so far this year 402 have been the stalwart 737. The company has delivered 117 models of the 787 Dreamliner and 80 of the 777 series. It has delivered 10 of its 767 planes so far this year, all to FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX). It has also shipped eight of the venerable 747 jumbo jets.\nBoeing’s order backlog as of October 31 totaled 5,635 aircraft, including 4,321 single-aisle 737s; 29 jumbo 747s, of which 20 are freighters; 96 dual-aisle 767s; and 728 Dreamliners.\nFor the first 10 months of the year, here are the 10 Boeing customers who received the most new planes:\nRyanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: RYAAY): 49 planes, all 737s Southwest Airlines Corp. (NYSE: LUV): 27 planes, all 737s Turkish Airlines: 26 planes, 20 737s and 6 777s American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL): 25 planes, 16 737s, 2 777s, and 7 787s China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. (NYSE: CEA): 24 planes, 17 737s and 7 777s Air Lease Corp. (NYSE: AL): 22 planes, 15 737s, 5 777s, and 2 787s GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS): 21 planes, 17 737s and 4 777s Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK): 18 planes, all 737s Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL): 16 planes, all 737s Norwegian, Air China, United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL): 15 deliveries each The U.S. Navy also received 16 767s this year. These are being adapted for the KC-46A tanker fleet.\nOf the 228 new airplanes delivered to Boeing’s top commercial customers, 195 (86%) were 737s. Of Boeing’s total backlog, about 77% are 737s.\nAnother way of looking at Boeing’s top customers is to see which have the most orders in the aircraft maker’s backlog. Here are the 10 customers with the most orders waiting to be filled:\nSouthwest: 229 planes, all 737s Lion Air: 214 planes, all 737s Ryanair: 205 planes, all 737s Emirates: 178 planes, 28 777-300ERs and 150 777Xs Air Lease Corp.: 176 planes, 118 737 MAXs, 11 737-800s, 3 777-300ERs, 30 787-10s and 14 787-9s United Airlines: 173 planes, 99 737 MAXs, 37 737-700s, 4 737-800s, 14 777s, and 19 787s Norwegian: 148 planes, 108 737 MAXs, 21 737-800s, and 19 787-9s American Airlines: 146 planes, 100 737 MAXs, 24 737-800s, and 22 787s GECAS: 133 planes, 95 737 MAXs, 16 737-800s, 2 777-300ERs, 10 787-10s Qatar Airways: 105 planes, 10 777-300ERs, 5 777Fs, 60 777Xs, and 30 787-9s United Airlines last week shifted an order for 65 of Boeing’s 737s, switching four that are scheduled for delivery next year from 737-700s to 737-800s, and deferring the delivery of the other 61, which are a mix of 737-700s and 737 MAXs. This was interpreted as bad news for Boeing, but it was actually pretty good, as we discussed on Friday .\nOne last list: the airlines that have flown the most Boeing planes in the 100-year history of the aircraft maker. According to Boeing’s bookkeeping, and including McDonnell Douglas (MD) aircraft, the company’s best customers over the years have been:\nUnited Airlines: 1,550 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1959 American Airlines: 1,207 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1958 Delta: 1,172 Boeing and MD aircraft, including 286 from Northwest; first delivery in 1959 International Lease Finance Corp.: 763 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1978 Southwest: 712 Boeing 737s; first delivery in 1971 GECAS: 522 Boeing aircraft; first delivery 1995 Ryanair: 426 Boeing 737s; first delivery in 1999 Japan Air Lines: 374 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1960 All Nippon Airways: 364 Boeing aircraft; first delivery in 1964 Eastern Airlines: 342 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1960 British Airways: 341 Boeing aircraft; first delivery in 1965 Lufthansa: 322 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery 1960 Boeing has delivered a total of 21,318 commercial airplanes to its customers, beginning with just 8 in 1958. In 2015 the company delivered 762 new planes, the most in its history.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "6th Boeing 787 joins the Royal Jordanian fleet 6th Boeing 787 joins the Royal Jordanian fleet   Economy Class of the 787 \nA new Boeing 787 joined the RJ fleet on November 17. It landed at Queen Alia International Airport straight from Boeing manufactures in Seattle and is the sixth 787 (Dreamliner) to become part of the airline fleet. \nRJ president/CEO Captain Suleiman Obeidat, who received the aircraft upon its arrival, expressed satisfaction with the addition of this new 787 to the currently operating five aircraft of the same type, which RJ introduced at the end of 2014 as part of the plan to modernize its long-haul fleet. \nHe said that this aircraft along with the seventh aircraft which will be joining the fleet at the beginning of 2017 are on capital lease, while the first five are operationally leased. \nThe Dreamliners replace the Airbus 340s and 330s the company previously had; five aircraft of these two last models were phased out two years ago and two A330s will retire soon. \nCaptain Obeidat said the 787s paved the way for RJ to step into a significant new era, a step that pushes the national carrier of Jordan forward in terms of inflight services and route network, enhancing its regional and international competitiveness. \nHe added that all new 787s, together with the operating A320 family and Embraer jets, help RJ meet its operational needs and leverage passengers’ experience. \nToday RJ’s fleet age does not exceed five years, a young, and modern, fleet when compared internationally. \nCaptain Obeidat pointed out that the wide-body, revolutionary aircraft is capable to fly long distances with full load non stop, making it a suitable choice for RJ to run it to North America, the Far East and Europe. \nThe state-of-the-art features and high specifications of the 787s offer higher levels of comfort and luxury to the RJ clients. \nThe Dreamliners have improved ventilation and humidity levels onboard, taking the travel experience to a new level, offering passengers more comfort and significantly reducing jetlag. It is also designed to be able to monitor safety and inform the ground systems about the need of maintenance. \nCustomers in all classes experience cabin environment improvements, such as LED mood lighting, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, lower cabin altitude and enhanced ventilation systems, among other features. \nThe aircraft is built of carbon-fiber composite materials and has a powerful electrical system to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. It consumes 20 per cent less fuel than today’s similarly sized airplanes, enabling it to offer an exclusive eco-friendly performance. \nThe new planes also enable airlines to increase their cargo revenues by providing about 20 to 30 per cent more cargo capacity than the current airplanes of the same size.",

      "text": "Share Tweet Follow \nOn Wednesday, someone posted a Craigslist ad in Vietnam to sell a Boeing 777, but not just any Boeing 777, this is allegedly the the Malaysia flight 370 , the passenger plane that went missing one week ago with 239 people on board as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \nRead the ad below: \nThe ad would be pretty funny, if not for the constant reminder that 239 real people, with real families, are missing. Probably the best part of the ad is the photo that suggests where they are keeping the plane:",

      "title": "Review: Ukraine International Airlines Business Class 767 Kiev To New York",
      "text": "Aircraft: Boeing 767-300 Seat: 2H (Business Class) \nWe boarded through door L2, which is rare for a 767. At the door we were pointed left towards business class. In front of the door were a few rows of UIA’s premium economy , which is in a 2-3-2 configuration with a decent amount of legroom (UIA’s normal economy section is in a 2-4-2 configuration, which is insanely tight for a 767, where almost all airlines have seats in a 2-3-2 configuration). \nAhead of premium economy were two rows of business class. UIA’s 767 business class consists of a total of 12 seats, spread across two rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. My first impression was that this reminded me of American’s old 767-200 premium cabins , except this cabin felt even tighter. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class cabin \nWe had assigned ourselves the window seats on the right side in row two. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class seats \nOn the plus side, the legroom was plentiful. I’d estimate that the seat pitch was maybe 55″. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class legroom \nHowever, the seats were outrageously narrow. I don’t know if the picture does justice to it, but I measured, and the seat width was just under 17.5″, which would be tight even for economy. They would have been better off making the center console or armrests smaller, as these were the tightest business class seats I’ve ever sat in. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class seat \nUpon settling in I tried to find the personal television, though was surprised to find that they didn’t have any sort of personal entertainment. Instead the only entertainment option was what was displayed on the overhead monitor. \nUkraine Airlines 767 business class \nThe audio controls were located on the bottom side of the center console. Of course since there’s no personal entertainment, those were just for what was showing on the overhead monitor. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class audio controls \nSeat controls were manual, and easy to use, given that you could only adjust the recline and the legrest. As anyone who has tried to manually adjust a footrest knows, it can be a pain to use. That’s because when you push the button the footrest doesn’t actually raise, so you have to push the button while leaning over and manually raising the footrest. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class seat controls \nIn theory there were power ports located under the center armrest, though they were broken. I asked the flight attendants about this, and based on her response it seemed like they were permanently broken, rather than them just being inoperable on this flight. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class power outlets \nThe tray table extended out of the center armrest, and could be folded over. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class tray table \nAlready waiting at our seats were pillows and blankets. The blanket was made of fleece and was okay. \nUkraine International Airlines business class pillow & blanket \nThe pillow, on the other hand, was terrible, and what I’d expect in economy. As you can see below, the pillow wasn’t thick at all. \nUkraine International Airlines business class pillow thickness \nA few moments after settling in, a flight attendant came by our seats to offer us drinks, suggesting champagne. Given the plane we were stuck on for the next 10+ hours, I wasn’t in a position to turn down alcohol. 😉 At least the pre-departure beverages were served in glassware, which isn’t the case on many airlines. \nUkraine International Airlines business class pre-departure champagne \nI was impressed that we were offered refills during boarding. I should note that the entire crew was young and generally quite friendly. They weren’t over the top friendly or especially polished, but they all at least seemed well intentioned. \nThe business class cabin quickly filled up, with all seats taken within about 10 minutes of the start of boarding. The cabin was filled mostly with middle aged male business traveler types. There was an older lady seated in front of us, but otherwise it was a pretty “normal” business class crowd. \nOnce everyone was settled in, the crew rolled a cart through the cabin with newspapers, magazines, and amenity kits. \nThe amenity kit was basic, with socks, eyeshades, earplugs, a brush, a pen, and a toothbrush and toothpaste. \nUkraine International Airlines business class amenity kit \nBefore takeoff I quickly checked out the lavatory, which I don’t think they’ve refreshed in any way in the past 25 years (come to think of it, that’s true of the entire plane). There was a single lavatory for business class located at the front of the cabin, right behind the flight deck. \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class lavatory \nUkraine International Airlines 767 business class lavatory \nBy 4PM an announcement was made that boarding was complete. Moments later the captain made his welcome aboard announcement, informing us of our flight time of 10hr25min and anticipated smooth ride. A few minutes later we began our pushback. \nPushing back Kiev Airport \nAt that point the crew did a manual safety demonstration. \nSafety demo while taxiing to the runway \nWith our engines started up, we began our taxi to the runway, which was quick. Our taxi took about 10 minutes, and I enjoyed the views, given that it was a nice evening and the sun was starting to set. \nTaxiing Kiev Airport \nUIA planes at Kiev Airport \nBy 4:15PM we made it to runway 18L, where we were immediately cleared for takeoff. \nHolding short of runway Kiev Airport \nTaking off Kiev Airport \nOur initial climb out was smooth, and I enjoyed the views of the Ukrainian countryside as we climbed out. \nView after takeoff from Kiev Airport \nView after takeoff from Kiev Airport \nThe seatbelt sign was turned off five minutes after takeoff, just after we climbed above an initial layer of clouds. \nView after takeoff from Kiev \nThe views as the sun slowly began to set continued to be gorgeous, and thanks to our westbound flight, the sunset lasted for a couple of hours. \nView after takeoff from Kiev \nAfter takeoff the airshow began to be displayed on the overhead monitor. Unfortunately that only displayed for a couple of hours of the flight, as they otherwise showed movies, and in the middle of the flight turned it off altogether, so that people could sleep. \nAirshow enroute to New York \nJust 20 minutes after takeoff, one of the business class flight attendants came through the cabin to introduce herself and take meal orders. She introduced herself as Yulia, and said her colleague working with her in business class was Victoria. When she got to everyone’s seat she said “what may I call you?” \nUIA doesn’t have any menus in business class, so she read out detailed descriptions of both options. The problem was that there was a bit of a communication barrier, so many of the non-Ukrainian passengers had a hard time understanding her. \nMeal orders being taken after takeoff \nWarm towels were distributed about 20 minutes after meal orders were taken. \nUIA business class hot towels \nAt 5:20PM, a bit over an hour after takeoff, drinks and nuts were served. There was the choice of two types of nut mixes (displayed below). We both had gin & tonics to drink. For what it’s worth, they were serving Beefeater gin. \nUIA business class lunch service — nuts and drinks to start \n15 minutes later tablecloths were brought out. Service began with a salad and some bread. The salad was not especially good, as you could have probably guessed based on the below picture. I was excited they had pretzel bread, though it ended up tasting pretty stale. \nUIA business class lunch — salad and bread \nOnce the salad was cleared we were served the appetizer. While there was supposed to be a choice of starters, they were out of one option when they got to us, so we had the salmon starter with parmesan cheese and mango, which was fairly good. \nUIA business class lunch — salmon starter \nAfter gin & tonics we decided to switch to champagne. As it turns out, the champagne was a Jaume Serra Cava (six 750ML bottles retail for 16.50EUR), which was actually reasonably drinkable. \nUIA business class champagne \nFor the main course there was the choice between chicken baked in almond flakes or salmon with vegetables. \nI had the salmon (again), which was dry and not very good. \nUIA business class lunch main course — salmon \nTiffany had the chicken. \nUIA business class lunch main course — chicken \nAfter that we were offered coffee. I ordered a coffee with milk, though unfortunately the coffee tasted powdered. \nUIA business class lunch — coffee \nNext we were served dessert, which was the choice between two types of cake. We each ordered one type, and then split them. The cake was tasty. \nUIA business class lunch dessert \nUIA business class lunch dessert \nThe meal service was done 2hr20min after takeoff, meaning we had another eight hours to go. Overall the food was pretty bad for business class, though not inedible. \nAfter the meal a movie was shown on the overhead screens. I decided to try and get some rest instead of watching it, given that the audio quality was horrible (I also generally don’t have the attention span for movies). \nUIA business class inflight entertainment \nUIA business class inflight entertainment \nGiven the configuration, the seats recline into the space of the passenger seated behind you. This means if you’re in the window seat in row two, don’t expect to be able to get up without the person in the aisle seat moving. \nUIA business class legroom with seats in front reclined \nBelow you can see just how far the seat reclined. While the seat went back a decent amount, the legrest didn’t go up much. \nUIA business class seat recline \nSomehow I managed to fall asleep (even though I usually struggle sleeping when not in a bed), and when I woke up I was hoping we were almost there. Nope, as it turned out I had napped for 90 minutes, meaning we had more than six hours to go. \nI worked for a couple of hours on my laptop, though eventually that was close to dying as well. So at that point I sort of just sat there and twiddled my thumbs. \nBetween meals the crew didn’t really come through the cabin much to see if anyone needed anything. \nAbout three hours before landing I was offered a cheese plate. I had a glass of water to accompany it. \nUIA business class midflight snack — cheese plate \nThe screen was turned off for about four hours in the middle of the flight, presumably so that people could sleep without being disturbed by the light. The screen was turned on about two hours before landing, as we were over Canada. \nAirshow over North America \nAt that point the pre-landing meal service began, starting with a warm towel. \nUIA business class hot towel \nThis time around the meal was served on a tray, without a tablecloth on the tray table. The starter options were salted salmon or roast beef with cream cheese. Again, they were out of the roast beef, so the only option was salmon. \nUIA business class pre-landing meal \nThe salmon tasted a bit “wet.” \nUIA business class pre-landing meal — salmon starter \nWe were also offered a salad, consisting mostly of shaved carrots. \nUIA business class pre-landing meal — salad \nFor the main course the choice was between baked salmon with mashed potatoes and a chicken roll with sundried tomato. While I’m a big fan of salmon, I have to wonder if UIA has considered mixing up meals a bit? Salmon was available as a starter and main for both meals. \nThe salmon was okay, actually a bit better than during the main meal, but still not very good. \nUIA business class pre-landing meal main course — salmon \nThe chicken that Tiffany ordered just looked plain weird. \nUIA business class pre-landing meal — chicken \nAfter that we were offered coffee or tea and dessert. Since UIA’s powdered coffee was vile, I ordered a black tea instead, which was at least nicely presented. We were also offered a pistachio dessert, which was tasty. \nUIA business class pre-landing meal dessert \nAfter the meal we had about an hour left until our arrival in New York. \nAirshow approaching New York \nWe began our descent about 35 minutes out, and 20 minutes later the seatbelt sign was turned on. As we descended, the crew distributed packaged hand wipes and heart-shaped chocolates. \nUIA business class towels \nUIA business class pre-landing chocolates \nAirshow approaching New York \nOur descent was bizarrely low. If the airshow was to be believed, for the last 15 minutes of the flight we were flying at 600 meters (~2,000 feet), which seems like an awfully long time to be flying so low. \nWe finally had a rough AF touchdown at 8:47PM. I’m not blaming the pilots for that as I know sometimes it takes some manhandling to land a plane, but it was probably the roughest landing I’ve had all year. \nOur taxi took a while, and finally at 9PM we came to a stop. Then we had to be towed into our gate because of how tight it was, so we arrived at the gate at 9:03PM. \nOnce the door opened we were greeted by several police officers, as they were apparently looking for someone on the plane. This ended up being a mess, as the police wanted everyone to sit down, but nobody was listening (which sort of matches my experience with UIA passengers otherwise). So it was another several minutes before we were off the plane, at which point we made the fastest JFK connection of my life . UIA 767 business class bottom line \nOn one hand I had low expectations of UIA coming in, as you generally get what you pay for. However, I didn’t think UIA would be quite so bad. The service was friendly enough and food was mostly edible, though everything else about the experience was underwhelming, from the seats, to the lack of entertainment, to the lack of power ports. \nWhile UIA business class is cheap, I’d actually say that I would rather be in premium economy on a decent airline than business class on UIA. At least there I’d have a power port, personal entertainment, and possibly even wifi. I don’t remember the last time I’ve been as bored on a flight as on UIA. \nSo yeah, even with cheap pricing, I’d steer clear of UIA’s longhaul business class, personally. Ironically, their shorthaul business class is above average.

      "text": "Components Delivered for 500th Boeing 787 Dreamliner Michael Alba posted on October 16, 2016 | | 948 views Spirit AeroSystems manufactures the forward fuselage section for every Boeing commercial airplane currently in production, including the 787 Dreamliner. (Image courtesy of Spirit AeroSystems.) Airplane component manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems recently announced the successful delivery of key components for the 500 th Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Spirit manufactures the forward fuselage, along with wing and propulsion components, for all of Boeing’s current commercial airplanes. 787s Since 2007 \nSpirit AeroSystems has been manufacturing the forward fuselage structure for the 787 Dreamliner since the aircraft began production in 2007. The fully integrated, composite structure section is known as section 41, and it’s built using auto fiber placement machines that wind composite tape into a one-piece fuselage section. The structure is assembled with a proprietary assembly process, Spirit Exact, which uses pre-located holes and automated riveters. \nSpirit manufactures its components for the twin-aisle Boeing 787 Dreamliner in several locations. The forward fuselage and engine pylons are manufactured at Spirit’s facility in Wichita, Kansas. The wing fixed leading edge and wing moveable leading edge are produced in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Subang, Malaysia. Manufacturing Milestones \nThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner recently hit another milestone, with Qatar Airways placing an order for 30 787-9 Dreamliners as part of one of the largest fleet additions in the airline’s history. Having the components delivered for the 500 th Dreamliner is another big achievement for the aircraft, and Spirit AeroSystems is pleased to be a part of it. \n\"Reaching 500 is a significant milestone for Spirit, and we look forward to building on this partnership as we continue to deliver high-quality products to Boeing,\" said Spirit CEO Tom Gentile. “Spirit is extremely proud of our collaboration with Boeing and the work we do together to build the world's fastest-selling twin-aisle airplane, the 787.” \nFor more aerospace manufacturing news, check out Computer-Aided Inspection in Aerospace Manufacturing .

      "text": "View Comments Pic: The Sun UK A Boeing 777 was forced to land at the Manchester Airport as ALL the toilets on board were 'chocked'. The plane – which is normally equipped with either eight or nine toilets – was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Manchester for the passenger’s convenience as all the toilets were blocked. “Today’s Toronto-Lahore flight has been diverted to Manchester as its toilet got choked, due to something solid thrown by passengers,” the airline explained. “As all toilets are connected with a common drain line, the rest of the toilets were choked.” “Keeping in view the convenience of passengers, the flight has been diverted to Manchester where the toilets will be serviced before the flight continues its onward journey.” It took approximately five hours for the pipes to be unclogged, Manchester Evening News reports. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight was en route from Toronto to Pakistan on Saturday when the entire lavatory system was disrupted as they were over the North Sea. Following this event, the airlines reminded passengers to “strictly adhere to and read carefully” the warning signs pertaining lavatory ethics. - Malaysian Digest",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: The Sun UK A Boeing 777 was forced to land at the Manchester Airport as ALL the toilets on board were 'chocked'. The plane – which is normally equipped with either eight or nine toilets – was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Manchester for the passenger’s convenience as all the toilets were blocked. “Today’s Toronto-Lahore flight has been diverted to Manchester as its toilet got choked, due to something solid thrown by passengers,” the airline explained. “As all toilets are connected with a common drain line, the rest of the toilets were choked.” “Keeping in view the convenience of passengers, the flight has been diverted to Manchester where the toilets will be serviced before the flight continues its onward journey.” It took approximately five hours for the pipes to be unclogged, Manchester Evening News reports. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight was en route from Toronto to Pakistan on Saturday when the entire lavatory system was disrupted as they were over the North Sea. Following this event, the airlines reminded passengers to “strictly adhere to and read carefully” the warning signs pertaining lavatory ethics. - Malaysian Digest",

      "text": "\nQ. Dear Umbra, \nDoes it matter if I fly a turboprop, jet, or Boeing 787 over the ocean? \nWill \nSeattle, WA \nA. Dearest Will,\nOh — it matters, very much. Tiny as they are, some turboprop planes are able to fly only about 1,000 nautical miles in one go, and a trip from, say, Seattle to Honolulu would cover more than 2,000. I’m afraid the mathematical difficulties would become frighteningly clear somewhere over the North Pacific.\nBut I kid, Will. I believe what you’re really asking is whether the type of aircraft you ride makes a difference, carbon emissions-wise. And the answer is the same: Yes, it does matter.\nI must first point out that flying in general takes a heavy toll on the climate. Aircraft can answer for 9 percent of the United States’ transportation emissions and about 3 percent of our total emissions. Globally, flying let loose 781 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2015. Worse still, if things keep on this carboniferous path, airline emissions could triple by 2050 . Travelers would do much better to hop on a train or bus , or perhaps take up long-distance bicycling (it’ll do wonders for your quads!). But you already knew this, right, Will? Enough idling on the runway. Sometimes, there’s a flight you’ve just gotta take.\nGenerally speaking, narrow-body or single-aisle jets win for best fuel economy . Larger (wide-body or double-aisle) jets are heavier, and also have to haul more fuel. Smaller turboprops and regional jets spew more emissions per passenger — number crunchers typically measure this in terms of carbon dioxide emitted per passenger/seat per flight. But it’s not as if you can simply check a box for “narrow-body jet” and hop on to your desired destination: Smaller planes, naturally, fly shorter distances, but odds are that for a transoceanic journey, you’ll be cruising on one of those larger, double-aisled machines with a suite of bathrooms and Jurassic World on demand. So it’s probably helpful to look at a few other factors when making your travel decisions — factors you have a bit more control over.\nSuch as? How old the plane is, for one. Newer planes have much more fuel-efficient engines, weight-saving features such as lighter seats, and drag-reducing tweaks like upturned wings . And the more passengers we can sardine in there, the merrier (for the planet, if not necessarily for your elbow room) — less first-class seating means more room for others. The idea is that as more people pile in, per-person emissions go down, and airlines could even reduce their total number of flights. You can usually see what model of plane an airline uses for a particular flight when you’re shopping around, which can help you sniff out the best deal for the planet. Even better, the International Council on Clean Transportation has done much of the legwork for you, scouting out the most efficient airlines for domestic flights and transatlantic travel . Spoiler: Your hometown airline, Alaska, did quite well, Will.\nWe’ve made a lot of progress with aircraft over the years — 45 percent less fuel burn since the late ’60s — but we still have a long way to go. There are some very promising technologies on the horizon, and a limited number are already on the market. We power a handful of flights on clean, renewable biofuels , a switch that can slash 80 percent of jet fuel’s carbon footprint. Other exciting developments: ultralight carbon fiber planes! New “double-bubble” designs! Solar-powered planes! Special anti-bug coatings! (No, really: Dead-bug buildup is a real drag for plane wings.)\nHere’s hoping we can green up our global fleet swiftly. Though the EPA recently decided that aircraft emissions contribute to climate change and endanger human health (Welcome to the club, guys!), planes carried 3.57 billion passengers last year — and all signs indicate that number will increase. Heard how the mountain won’t come to Muhammad, so Muhammad has to go to the mountain? Well, if we can’t stop Muhammad from going, at least we can use our collective physics and engineering brilliance to vastly improve the plane he takes to get there.\nOptimistically,\nUmbra\nThis story was originally published by Grist with the headline What type of plane is least bad for the planet? on Nov 21, 2016.",

      "text": "Let's Pick Up A Boeing From Storage Nov.21.16 Check out AeroAnalysis! Summary \nBringing back an aircraft from storage cannot happen at a fraction of cost in cases of long term storage. \nFor passenger airlines, bringing an aircraft from storage back into service is not as interesting as for freighter carriers. \nIn the case of high jet fuel prices, the cost saving component of a brand-new jet becomes more predominant. As acquisition costs for aircraft become higher and higher due to the addition of more advanced materials and technology adding complexity to the aircraft, operating second hand or stored aircraft becomes more interesting under certain circumstances. Click to enlarge Often when some aircraft types are not sold easily to airlines, people are quick to point out the aircraft sitting in storage that in their view could be operated at a fraction of costs. In this article series I want to have a look at two things. In the first article, I want to have a look at what costs would be involved for service re-entry for a Boeing (NYSE: BA ) 747 (as an example). In the second article I want to have a look at the aircraft types that are in storage. Before looking at what it takes for a customer to have an aircraft re-enter service, it is important to have a look at why aircraft are being put in storage in the first place: Age of the aircraft: As the aircraft ages it becomes increasingly less cost efficient. That is why it pays to put older aircraft in storage. This cost inefficiency becomes clear when being compared to the newest aircraft on the market. Low demand: During the financial crisis a lot of freighter aircraft were flown to the desert for long term storage as demand for air cargo dropped. Fuel consumption of the aircraft: Fuel efficient aircraft can potentially save an airline millions of dollars over the aircraft's life span. As fuel prices drop, which has been the case in recent years, or demand picks up, it becomes increasingly more interesting to look at operating aircraft that had been in storage. Acquisition Currently a Boeing 747-8I sells for anywhere between $110-$150 million, while its freighter variant sells for $115-$180 million. Determining the aircraft's residual value is quite a difficult and dynamic task, but these days you could buy a 25-year-old Boeing 747-400 for $4 million, while you could get $10 million or more if some parts have some cycles left before replacement is required. In this article I will use the $4 million (or $3.65 million to be more precise) example. D-Check Airlines tend to put an aircraft in storage at the moment it is nearing its D-check, which is the heaviest and most costly check the aircraft will encounter. For older aircraft these checks also tend to be more costly. There is a significant chance when taking an aircraft from storage, the first thing that needs to be done is the costly D-Check. Which would add roughly $3.55 million in costs. The combined sum of the D-check and acquisition costs still is a long way from the costs of a brand new airframe. Interior refurbishment Click to enlarge To bring cabins up to par with today's expectations of comfort and quality it is likely that you will have to redo the interior of the aircraft, which is a big cost component since there are hundreds of seats in an aircraft, along with carpet, lavatories and in-flight entertainment systems. Refurbishing the interior could cost $15 million or more. Turbofans Click to enlarge Adding new turbofans could add tens of millions. Turbofans are one of the most complex systems on an aircraft and are one of the first to be stripped off the airframe if the aircraft goes into storage for a longer period. Adding new engines to the airframe again could cost up to $40-$45 million to the costs. Sum of all parts Click to enlarge Figure 1: Cost overview Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 747-8I (Source: AeroAnalysis) Looking at Figure 1 there is one important conclusion that can be drawn: While the acquisition costs are indeed just a fraction (3%) of the costs associated with the acquisitions of a new aircraft, making the stored aircraft serviceable does add to the costs significantly. Refurbishment and the installation account for the majority of the costs. So for passenger airlines it might not be very interesting to revive a stored aircraft; for freighter airlines it is already more interesting as they only pay for the conversion costs in case of a Boeing 747-400 and have no costs in case of a dedicated freighter aircraft. Additionally, the turbofans are the biggest expense, so it is key for airlines to operate an aircraft from storage that does not require new engines under the wings. The costs to bring a stored airframe back in passenger service could be 60% of the costs of a new Boeing 747-8I, while this is almost 45% for a freighter. So acquiring a stored aircraft is cheaper than owning a new jet, but it is far more costly than is often thought. Additionally, the brand-new aircraft will have a residual value while the aircraft that returned from storage will have almost none when it is put out of service. This means that the gap of roughly $45 million between our Boeing 747-400 revived from storage and Boeing 747-8I will close a bit. The Boeing 747-8I at age 25 could still be worth $15 million if it is in good shape. So the Boeing 747-400 would be roughly $30 million cheaper. That is a point where you want to look at other factors such as fuel efficiency, reliability and passenger experience. Per year the new airframe would be vastly more fuel efficient saving $1.5 million annually at a jet fuel price of $1.50 per gallon. The 25-year-old airframe would service at most 5 more years, which means additional costs of $7.5 million, narrowing down the gap to $22.5 million. As the aircraft ages its reliability declines a bit, which means that some flights are likely to be canceled. Correcting for this the gap is roughly $25 million. A replacement aircraft for these flights could cost up to $5 million, bringing the gap to $20 million. In the case of high jet fuel prices, the picture changes a bit as the cost saving component of a brand-new jet becomes more predominant. In that case the gap becomes just $16.4 million, and given the higher maintenance cost (which are hard to quantify) and customer experience, it is hardly worth it for passenger airlines to operate an old jet. For a freighter airline, it is more worth it to operate an old aircraft since it sits more time on the ground and it does transport parcels, which in contrast to passengers do not expect a certain travel experience. In the end, a few things become clear: Finding the right aircraft from storage is important to keep costs down. For passenger airlines, it is more important to transport a passenger from A to B, as cheaply as possible but also in a reliable way. This significantly narrows the pool of stored aircraft suitable for passenger service. Acquiring the hull can cost just a fraction of the new price. However, making an aircraft serviceable costs a whole lot more. As fuel prices increase operating older aircraft become less attractive. For freighter airlines, the low acquisition costs remain attractive but this has to do with the lower bars for the air cargo industry in general.

      "text": "Boeing Forecasts Demand for 3,860 New Airplanes in Southeast Asia; 1,020 in Oceania Single-aisle demand accounts for more than 75 percent of new deliveries \nMANILA, Nov. 18, 2016 – Boeing [NYSE: BA] presented its Current Market Outlook for the Southeast Asia and Oceania regions today during the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines’ 60 th annual Assembly of Presidents meeting in Manila. \nOver the next 20 years, the company forecasts a demand for 3,860 new airplanes, valued at $565 billion, in Southeast Asia; while an investment of $160 billion for 1,020 new airplanes is expected in the Oceania region. \n“Southeast Asia and Oceania remain important markets for Boeing as airlines continue to add capacity, modernize their fleets and shift their business models to adapt to this competitive market,” said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president of Asia Pacific and India Sales, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “While we see the majority of the demand being for single-aisle airplanes such as the 737 MAX, fuel-efficient twin-aisle airplanes such as the 787 Dreamliner and the 777X will also be needed, enabling airlines to profitably open new routes, never before possible.” \nThe annual report projects that more than 75 percent of the airplanes needed in both regions will be for single-aisle airplanes, as they continue to see a rise in the number of low cost carriers as well as strong annual traffic, with growth rates of 6.4 percent and 4.7 percent, for Southeast Asia and Oceania, respectively. \nWorldwide, Boeing projects a demand for 39,620 new airplanes, over the next two decades. Boeing's Current Market Outlook is the longest running jet forecast and regarded as the most comprehensive analysis of the aviation industry.

      "text": "Drexel Hamilton Highlights Upcoming Roadshows From Boeing And Others \nIt’s critical to know whether a stock you plan on buying has an ex-dividend status, because in case it does, the dividend would be paid out to the seller. The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you’ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. \nOn the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you’re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company. \nHere is the list of stocks going ex-dividend on Tuesday. Scotts Miracle-Gro Co (NYSE: SMG ) - $0.5000 dividend, 2.2112 percent yield.

      "text": "Boeing 'base station' concept would autonomously refuel military drones \nOvercoming the biggest obstacle for small drones By David Hambling  29pm \nVehicle Base Station patent \nBoeing's 'Vehicle Base Station' could be hidden on rooftops and power lines to refuel small drones on big missions. \nSmall drones are already effective weapons for urban warfare—when armed with miniature warheads, these stealthy spies can turn into lethal assassins. So far their biggest limitation is battery life, but Boeing's patent for a drone battle station sets out to overcome that. \nThe aerospace giant's ‘Vehicle Base Station’ resembles Amazon’s proposed recharging stations on street lights , but with a different mission. John Vian, a research fellow at Boeing, says the station's main applications are likely to be civil and commercial—used for firefighting and search-and-rescue, for example—but the patent has a decidedly military slant. “The unmanned aerial vehicles may monitor for undesired activity… [which] may be the placement of an improvised explosive device in roadway.” \nBefore coming up with the base station idea, Vian and his colleagues had been looking for the next big thing, and they zeroed-in on ‘fractionated systems’--groups of small ground and air robots working together to carry out tasks. “The patent arose from the recognition that these smaller smarter platforms may have limited endurance,” Vian told Popular Science . \nThe patent describes a squad or platoon of perhaps 10 to 30 drones, able to follow targets or perch and observe like a fleet of mobile CCTV cameras. When a drone runs low on power it returns to the base station, which physically replaces the drone’s batteries. With no wait for recharging, the drone can fly off again at once. The autonomous battery-swapping device would “enable long, 24/7, uninterrupted missions,” says Vian. In principle, the base station would allow drones to operate in an area for days, weeks, or months at a stretch. \nThe autonomous battery-swapping device would enable long, 24/7, uninterrupted drone missions. \nClandestine operation is part of the plan. The patent suggests a solar-powered station could be placed on a rooftop where it cannot be seen. Alternatively, the station may be attached to a power line to suck electricity directly from the grid. It could still be covert, hiding in plain sight; few people pay attention to all those black boxes attached to power lines. If some base stations are lost to enemy action, multiple spares would ensure there was always capacity. \nBoeing also envisions a line of base stations positioned at intervals of several miles, like gas stations for drones on long journeys. This would allow them to fly right into a combat zone rather than having to be dropped by aircraft. \nAccording to the patent, the base station could act as a shelter in bad weather, a sort of pigeon loft for drones. It may also be a communication hub, housing a satellite microwave link to a remote operations center. In one version of the design, the drones fly missions autonomously, uploading the data they have gathered and receiving fresh instructions each time they return. This would allow them to operate even if all radio signals were being jammed, a growing counter-drone tactic. \nThe base station might also be able to reload drones with a ‘dispensable payload.’ Fire suppressant is mentioned as an example, though this seems optimistic for small drones--bombs are a more obvious choice. Hezbollah recently released a video of small drones apparently dropping grenades on enemy positions . Similarly, the U.S.'s Switchblade , a lethal drone weighing less than five pounds, carries out kamikaze-style attacks via its on-board munitions. But a reusable attack drone has obvious advantages, especially when the potentially hazardous return-and-reload operation is carried out remotely. \nThe developers built an indoor test bed to prototype the base station concept using small drones, and they say translating the system into real life deployments would not be difficult. \n“With good engineering design, I don’t see major challenges for making this system functional,” says Boeing Commercial Airplanes Senior Research Engineer Emad Saad. “Precise relative navigation is a challenge, but can be addressed with modern sensors and good engineering design.” \nBoeing is one of the dominant players in the military market, producing aircraft like the B-52 bomber, F-15 Eagle, and AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. If the base station moves from concept to reality, it would allow swarms of low-cost drones to carry out missions at long range and over long durations, shaking up the market and maybe the entire face of warfare. Perhaps the next big thing from Boeing will be much smaller than the aircraft we usually associate with the name. Tags:",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 4:45pm Comments Share: Vice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes head Conner plans end-of-2017 retirement Industry veteran McAllister to succeed Conner as Commercial Airplanes CEO Deal to serve as president and CEO of new combined services business Moves support strategy to strengthen and grow company, Muilenburg says \nCHICAGO , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg today named Kevin G. McAllister president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran Boeing executive. \nConner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company's transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes. \n\"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,\" said Muilenburg. \"We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.\" \nMcAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business. \n\"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,\" Muilenburg said. \"He's a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience.

Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing. \n\"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,\" Muilenburg said. \"Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.\" \nDeal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition. \nBoeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas , where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future. \nDeal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's Executive Council. The appointments are effective today. \nAdditional background for reporters and editors \nA materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh , he also is chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide. \nConner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant aerospace sector. \nCommercial Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency. \nGlobal Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data optimization.
