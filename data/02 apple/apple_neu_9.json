      "text": "Apple Finally Promises a Fix to Those Spam Calendar Invites It's coming ... eventually. Apple December 1, 2016 T he days of iCloud Calendar spam might be over nearly as quickly as they started. After almost a week of building criticism over an influx of shopping-related spam calendar invites, Apple has finally released a statement saying it’s working on a fix. Late Wednesday, the company sent an iMessage to fansite iMore that said it was trying to get a handle on the problem. “We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations,” the company wrote. “We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.” While it’s a nice apology, the company was more than hazy on when exactly users can expect the spam to cease for good. Attacking the problem at the server level is a start, but adding an option to ignore calendar invites without notifying the spammer could provide a more concrete design fix. No thanks. If you haven’t noticed a decrease in spam invites yet, there are a few strategies users have stumbled upon that serve as a good stopgap measure. The easiest but perhaps most inconvenient solution is turning off your iCloud calendar completely. You could also adjust your notification settings so that you only get invites sent to your email, not your push notifications. Finally, you can create a spam calendar to redirect invites too — which might be more difficult if you’re getting spam to a shared calendar. Whatever you do, don’t decline the invitations — that just alerts the spammers to the fact that you’re alive and kicking, and probably guarantees that you’ll get more.

      "text": "13 comments TechSpot \nApple is stepping up its efforts to close the gap between its own mapping app and Google’s. According to Bloomberg , the company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor equipped minivans. This includes monitoring changes to roads, street signs, and spot areas under construction. \nUsing drones to collect the huge amounts of mapping data could prove quite challenging under current regulations. Official commercial drone guidelines introduced in August mandate that drones can only be flown during daylight hours, and licensed pilots must keep the drones within their line of sight during operation. Apple also can’t fly its drones over people and buildings. \nApple has committed to these guidelines according to FAA documents. The company is said to have hired at least one employee from Amazon’s Air division to help run its own drone team based in Seattle. \nAside from data collection using drones, Apple is also reportedly developing a new feature that will let users view the insides of buildings, thanks to its Indoor.io and WifiSLAM acquisitions, as well as a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving. \nApple suffered a critical backlash in 2012 when it decided to replace the pre-installed Google Maps on iOS 6 in favor of its own -- admittedly lacking -- mapping solution. They’ve been busy working on improving it ever since, with updated data, new imagery and new features. It’s gotten a lot better and dependable but the general consensus is that it’s still no match for Google Maps. Related Reads",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Chinese consumer watchdog demands Apple to replace all faulty batteries Further to Apple's commitment to replace battery for certain iPhone models, the government-backed China Consumers Association said a wider range of iPhones have also encountered shutdown issues and has demanded Apple to solve them. | Topic: Mobility \nApple's battery replacement program for iPhone 6s handsets manufactured between September and October 2015 is far from sufficient, as many iPhones made prior to this are also encountering sudden shutdown issues, China Consumers Association (CCA) said on its official website on Wednesday. Latest news on Asia Alibaba Cloud opens datacentre in Sydney \nMany Chinese consumers have filed complaints to the watchdog regarding iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 6s Plus models, as well as iPhone 6s models produced after September and October 2015, according to the authority, which reissued a query to Apple on Tuesday urging it to offer a more detailed analysis and solution for consumers. \nIn mid-November, the China Consumers Association questioned Apple over complaints that some iPhone models will automatically shut down even if some 50 to 60 percent of their battery life remains. The US technology giant later denied it a safety issue and launched a worldwide program to replace batteries for iPhone 6s handsets manufactured during September and October 2015. \nHowever, some Chinese consumers with iPhones that do not fall into Apple's exchange plan say they are encountering similar issues with their iPhones, while many others who do qualify for the program have complained Apple was unable to offer free battery replacements timely. \nAccording to a NetEase report , as there are too many reservations for the replacement services, consumers in Beijing are informed to wait for two weeks for a slot. In just one Apple store, bookings have exceeded 2,000, according to the report. \nIn the latest query to Apple, the CCA also demanded the US company \"give explanations to consumers in a timely manner, facilitate consumers' consultation and appointment, prepare enough components to replace batteries efficiently, and meet consumers' basic needs for normal wireless communication.\" Join Discussion",

      "text": "Tweet \nFandroids and Apple enthusiasts love to compare their devices. While the pros and cons are debatable, one feature that Android fans love to brag about is the ability to expand the storage of their device with a microSD card. There are a number of microSD cards available, and while they all look the same, they don’t all perform the same. Do you need an SDHC or SDXC card? What’s the difference between a Class 6 and Class 10 card? Don’t fret, we have you covered. Capacity \nThis is the most straightforward feature. First, “SD” stands for “secure digital.” MicroSD cards are available in SDHC and SDXC varieties. SDHC stands for “secure digital high capacity,” and SDXC stands for “secure digital extended capacity.” This should tip you off as to what the difference is between the cards. SDHC microSD cards range in storage capacity from 4GB to 32GB. SDXC cards start at 32GB and can reach a maximum capacity of 2TB. \nWhich card you choose depends on how much storage you need. You’re going to want the largest card you can afford if you take lots of photos, have tons of music or like to carry a bunch of movies and TV shows in your pocket. Of course microSD cards range in price depending on the capacity. So before you fork over your hard-earned cash on a card, make sure that your Android device can support the card. Generally speaking, less expensive Android devices only support SDHC cards, meaning you’ll be limited to 32GB max. Exactly how much storage you need will be determined by your usage, but generally speaking, anyone with a large media library, whether that is photos, videos or music, will benefit from a larger capacity card. \nFinally, the capacity of the card does not effect the quality of the digital files stored on it. Simply put, the difference between these cards begins and ends with the storage size available to you. Class \nDifferent SD cards have different read/write speeds that can impact performance. SD card manufacturers use “speed classes” to measure the read/write speed of the card. Cards are given one of four classifications: 2, 4, 6 and 10. The numbers assigned to the card correspond to the minimum transmission speed of the card. If a card is class 2, it has a minimum transmission speed of 2 Megabytes per second (MB/s). Class 4 has a minimum speed of 4 MB/s, class 6 has a speed of 6 MB/s, and so on. The speed class of the card is always directly on the card’s label, signified as a number (2, 4, 6, 10) inside the letter “c.” \nIn addition to these standard speed classes, there are two Ultra High Speed (UHS) classes. UHS cards are significantly more expensive and are designed to be used with UHS compatible devices. UHS cards have a classification of either 1 or 3, with 1 signifying a minimum speed of 10 MB/s and 3 a minimum speed of 30 MB/s. There aren’t many Android devices that support UHS microSD cards, but they will become commonplace in the future. Conclusion \nThe best microSD card for you is going to depend on how you use your phone. If you only want to make room for music, you probably don’t need the fastest card on the market. However, if you’re shooting photos in RAW format or recording in 4K, you’re going to need a better performing (and more expensive) card. \nWhat type of microSD card do you use in your Android device? Have you tried different microSD card speeds? What has been your experience with the different speeds available? Let us know in the comments!  ",

      "text": "Reddit \nAccording to a report from the The Economic Times , Apple is planning to set up a distribution center in India. The move comes as Apple is working to establish a retail presence in the country and has faced challenges due to local regulations. \nThis evening’s report claims that Apple will work with its global logistics partner, DB Schenker, who will set up and operate the center. The goal of the distribution center in India is to ensure that Apple’s products are “rarely sold out at the retail level” and to set “common pricing for offline and online sales,” thus giving Apple greater control of the supply chain in the country. \nThe iPhone market has been notoriously complex, with Apple not having a strong hold on pricing and availability alike: \nCurrently, iPhones, iPads and Mac computers are brought into India through Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chandigarh, New Delhi and Hyderabad – where value-added tax rates vary – and transferred to distributors from the airport itself. \nOne source cited in the report explained that the distribution center will allow Apple to “ease operations and streamline its logistics and supply chains.” \nAdditionally, Apple hopes that this distribution center will allow it to put a stronger hold on the enterprise Mac market by pushing more tailored options to enterprise customers. \n“The distribution centre will allow Apple to stock its products adequately, will ease operations and streamline its logistics and supply chains. It will also help in maintaining uniform price for its products, which will become much easier under the Goods and Services Tax regime,” said one of the executives. \nThis distribution marks the first of its kind in India for Apple and will be located at Bhiwandi near Mumbai. DB Schenker is one of Europe’s largest logistics company, though it wouldn’t comment on this partnership with Apple. \nApple and Tim Cook have bet big on India to help combat slowing iPhone growth around the world. The company has been working tirelessly to gain regulatory approval and set up a retail presence in the country and is nearly success if recent reports are to be believed . Apple has looked into manufacturing the iPhone in India and also plans to open an R&D center in the country . \nIt’s unclear when Apple will open the distribution center in India. Guides",

      "text": "Adam Berry—Getty Images for Apple On Wednesday, Apple started selling red-colored products to benefit HIV/AIDS research. There are more direct ways to give. \nBefore you rush out to buy a red iPhone case to support AIDS research this holiday season, you might want to consider whether your donation is being put to its best use. \nSince 2006, Product (RED) has partnered with a number of major corporations, including Apple and Gap, to donate a part of their proceeds to AIDS research. On Wednesday, for instance, Apple ramped up the number of red-colored products—like the iPhone 7 battery pack case and Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones—for which it will donate an undisclosed percentage of profits to charity. \n(RED)’s CEO Deb Dugan told USA Today this week that the organization has hauled in $360 million since its creation and has affected the lives of 70 million people who suffer from HIV/AIDS. However, (RED) has come under fire in recent years by critics who say the group’s ad spending outpaces the impact the program has on AIDS-related causes. \nIn 2007, Ad Age reported that Product (RED) retail participants had invested $100 million in (RED) advertising, but had raised just $18 million to support AIDS research itself. The findings raised the question: Is there a need for a retail middleman between a donor and a charity ? \nIn short, no. If you’re looking to make the biggest impact on AIDS research, your best bet is likely to donate directly to an AIDS-related organization. There are a number of reputable charities you can choose from, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation , amfAR and the Gay Men’s Health Crisis , said Sandra Miniutti, vice president of marketing for Charity Navigator, which rates philanthropic organizations. \nBut if you are already shopping at Apple or another partner, buying (Red) can benefit HIV/AIDS research. Apple products in particular account for one-third of the company’s donations since 2006. \nHere’s a complete list of AIDS-related philanthropic organizations recommended by Charity Navigator. ",

      "text": "An Apple ad launch often creates a bit of a fanfare, and its latest, \"Bulbs,\" for the new MacBook Pro, has already clocked up more than 1.7 million views on YouTube since its launch on November 17. \nThe ad features a series of light bulbs bursting, in a montage showing inventions and discoveries such as the steam engine, gravity, binoculars, the typewriter and even a loo roll.\n\nOne of its biggest fans is Ken Segall, who joined agency Chiat Day as creative director back in 1997 and is credited with writing Apple's \"Think Different\" brand campaign the same year. It was also around the same time that Steve Jobs came back to the tech company and the two worked together as client and creative shop until 2000.\n\nWriting on his blog this week , Segall recognized some similarities with \"Think Different,\" which shows a montage of ground-breaking people – rather than inventions – such as Martin Luther King, Maria Callas and Mahatma Gandi, calling the new MacBook Pro ad \"one of the greatest commercials Apple has ever made.\" \nLet's take a look at the two ads. \nAre they really so similar? Segall calls the use of the montage in \"Bulbs\" as \"the oldest trick in the advertising book,\" but hails the familiar creative device as one which is \"so artfully constructed, and so intensely energetic from the start, it literally embodies the ad's concept. That being: ideas have tremendous power.\" \nThe major difference between the two is that \"Think Different\" was all about positioning Apple as a seminal brand, whereas \"Bulbs\" is ultimately a product ad, a gripe of Segall's. But he concedes: \"This is the new century version of 'Think Different,' and I very much love it.\" \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video] Thursday Dec 1, 2016 at 12:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

Apple's ‘Think Different’ ad creator says its new commercial uses ‘oldest trick in advertising book’ By Lucy Handley; special to CNBC.com | CNBC – 36 minutes ago Print An Apple ad launch often creates a bit of a fanfare, and its latest, \"Bulbs,\" for the new MacBook Pro, has already clocked up more than 1.7 million views on YouTube since its launch on November 17. \nThe ad features a series of light bulbs bursting, in a montage showing inventions and discoveries such as the steam engine, gravity, binoculars, the typewriter and even a loo roll. \nOne of its biggest fans is Ken Segall, who joined agency Chiat Day as creative director back in 1997 and is credited with writing Apple's \"Think Different\" brand campaign the same year. It was also around the same time that Steve Jobs came back to the tech company and the two worked together as client and creative shop until 2000. \nWriting on his blog this week , Segall recognized some similarities with \"Think Different,\" which shows a montage of ground-breaking people – rather than inventions – such as Martin Luther King, Maria Callas and Mahatma Gandi, calling the new MacBook Pro ad \"one of the greatest commercials Apple has ever made.\" \nLet's take a look at the two ads. \nAre they really so similar? Segall calls the use of the montage in \"Bulbs\" as \"the oldest trick in the advertising book,\" but hails the familiar creative device as one which is \"so artfully constructed, and so intensely energetic from the start, it literally embodies the ad's concept. That being: ideas have tremendous power.\" \nThe major difference between the two is that \"Think Different\" was all about positioning Apple as a seminal brand, whereas \"Bulbs\" is ultimately a product ad, a gripe of Segall's. But he concedes: \"This is the new century version of 'Think Different,' and I very much love it.\" \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook . 10 things you need to know before European markets open Business Insider UK Finance - 13 minutes ago Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denied reports he had told four EU ambassadors that he was personally in favor of allowing free movement of people within the bloc.

Apple’s speed in issuing a battery replacement program indicates that it found some kind of hardware flaw, but it’s equally possible that a software bug is causing battery issues at the same time.\nTrending right now:\nSomehow, the NES Classic wasn’t the hottest game console this Thanksgiving iPhone 7 orders reportedly drop as Apple goes big on the iPhone 8 DirecTV Now is off to a really bad start See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Google Maps in iPad giving direction (Photo : Getty Images/guntsoophack yuktahnon) Advertisement \nApple previously using sensor-packed vehicles to keep its maps up to date will now use drones to improvise the maps. Recently, the company gets FAA approval to use drones to collect the data which includes capturing photos and videos and other traffic data. \nAs written in Bloomberg , \"The Cupertino, California-based Company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans.\" \nApple will now give a tough competition to Google by using drones. Previously in 2012, Apple replaced Google Maps with Apple Maps on iOS. Till now, Google Maps is better and Apple Maps is criticized by users for inaccurate data and driving directions. \nApple wants to use this drones to examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor the areas. Collected data will be sent directly to Apple teams and they will continuously update the Apple Maps app to provide the latest information to users. \nIt is heard that Apple is developing some new features for Maps like improvements to car navigation and views inside buildings which let users explore different places without actually visiting them. These features are already in Google Maps. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation restricts flying to daytime hours and requires licensed pilots to operate the equipment. There is also a restriction to fly over people and buildings which will affect the latest data collection. \n\"Apple could be hoping to get its indoor mapping service to Apple Maps sometime next year, along with a tool that would tell users when and where to change lanes during navigation. Apple is still assembling the team that will help it take advantage of drones\", says Fortune . \nApple is continuously trying to improve its Maps app but still Google is way ahead. Now with this new technology Apple is expected to do something better to compete with Google Maps.  ",

Make sure have a brush toothpick like this one: http://amzn.to/28ZUTfO Make sure the bristle is hard and not soft or it will not work. You should be able to get these or something similar at CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, etc. You can also use a pipe cleaner with hard bristle such as this one: http://amzn.to/2980Wwi I assume no responsibility of damaged or broken phones so do at your own risk!

NEW Xbox One Wireless Controller Review / 3.5mm Port, Better Bumpers, OTA Updates published: 08 Jul 2015 NEW Xbox One Wireless Controller Review / 3.5mm Port, Better Bumpers, OTA Updates NEW Xbox One Wireless Controller Review / 3.5mm Port, Better Bumpers, OTA Updates published: 08 Jul 2015 views: 65468 \n►Buy the New Xbox One Controller On Amazon - http://bit.ly/AmazonNewXboxOneController Today, we\\'re reviewing the new Xbox One Wireless Controller with those sought after feature upgrades such as the 3.5mm audio port, improved bumpers, and over the air updates. Let\\'s take a closer look at the new features in this hardware review. Most people know about Xbox one controllers by now so we\\'re talking exclusively about the new features. First off it has wireless over the air updates which is an improvement over the last controller which required a micro usb connection for updates. It\\'s a good feature, but that\\'s more of a technical fix. Comparing the two controllers, they look identical with the exception of the new port. The most obvious advancement is the addition of the 3.5mm audio port which will let you connect any standard headphones no matter how crazy they look. And there\\'s menu settings for adjusting the sound and chat volume from the controller. So if your headphones don\\'t have a built in volume adjustment, you still have control. The other feature is improved bumpers. Many gamers complained that the Xbox One bumpers felt good for clicking, but actually holding them down felt difficult due to the pushback. Although they look identical, the pushback has been reduced on these new controllers and you can definitely hear an audible difference. Testing it out with Sunset Overdrive, it\\'s a great option to be able to have headphones plugged in to my control and it sounds fine. You\\'ll most likely get the best audio over HDMI or optical, but that\\'s not an option f...

Aerial robots will monitor road changes, signs and construction then send data to Apple Maps users to get the most up-to-date road information. Apple will also be mapping inside venues like sports arenas, airports and malls. With the popularity of Google Maps and the navigation app Waze, it will be interesting to see how Apple’s new plan will ride out.

      "text": "Reddit \nAnalysts appear to be piling in on Apple, with a second firm questioning ‘strategic issues’ within the company. \nJust a couple of days after UBS said that it was ‘unclear’ whether Apple had the same strategic approach it had under Steve Jobs’ leadership, Oppenheimer has predicted that the company is in for a ‘decade-long malaise’… We believe Apple lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging); instead will become more reliant than ever on the iPhone … We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise. The risks to the company have never been greater. \nBusiness Insider notes that Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz points to the same issues raised by other analysts. They believe that iPhone sales will peak in 2018; the company lacks the ability to raise prices across its iPhones, iPads and Mac products; and they see a clash between “Apple’s primary role as the hardware platform … with its secondary role as the software and service provider.” \nIt’s notable that both firms do, however, also have praise for Apple. UBS said that Apple has at least figured out its areas of interest and that the company’s culture remains strong under Cook, while Oppenheimer believes that there are no immediate concerns about AAPL’s performance. We believe its strong profitability, a cash hoard for protection, and one last ‘growth’ hurrah from the tenth-anniversary phone will keep investors interested in the company. Our Perform rating is unchanged for now. Guides",

      "text": "Opinion How Apple could make international travel easier The iPhone and Apple Watch are already capable travel companions, but improvements to Maps, Apple Pay, and SIM-switching would go a long way. Macworld | Dec 2, 2016 4:03 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe new Line motion graphic plug-in makes it easy to create Indiana Jones-style travel maps—some effort required. More like this The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nFor the last several weeks, I’ve been in India. Some of that time I’ve spent traveling around, seeing the sights, and some of it I’ve spent with my head down working, just as usual—albeit in a time zone where most of the people I know are asleep. \nMy devices have made the trip with me: MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch. For the most part, my experience traveling with them has been pretty positive. I can get my email, and iMessage or FaceTime my family back home with little interruption, and run most of the apps that I’m used to having at my fingertips, day in and day out. \nBut for all of that, there are still some weak spots in Apple’s tech when it comes to being a global traveler. In many cases, Apple has the systems in place, they’re just not—as writer William Gibson once said—“evenly distributed yet.” Maps \nOne of the trickiest parts of navigating a new country is, well, navigating a new country. As someone who traveled in their youth without the benefit of a smartphone, I’m all too glad to be able to carry an Internet-connected, GPS-enabled computer in my pocket. Relay \nWith no transit or directions in Apple Maps in India, I’ve had to rely on third-party apps—I’m using Google Maps, but Macworld just reviewed Relay as well. \nBut Apple’s own offerings fall a little short in my experience. I’ve found Apple Maps to be virtually useless in India. Yes, I can get a map overview or satellite imagery, but directions and transit information are nonexistent. Building databases of all that information is challenging, to be sure, and it often means working with a lot of partners. But not being able to get simple walking directions to a nearby restaurant is kind of a nonstarter, so I’ve been using Google Maps, which works much better. \nThat said, I’ll give Apple Maps credit for this much: I appreciate that when I look at a local restaurant, it’s at least smart enough to pull information from the local restaurant-rating site, rather than relying on spotty U.S.-only information. Payments \nThank god for the glories of credit and debit cards—I’m not sure where I’d be without them, especially given India’s current cash woes. But international transactions are still kind of a pain. Buying things online with a credit card in India requires a two-factor style system, where a one-time password is texted to your phone. Cards from the U.S. don’t really seem to handle this—and some sites don’t support international cards—which means if you don’t have an Indian card and an Indian bank account, you’re basically out of luck. \nThere’s a huge potential upside here for Apple, if it can expand Apple Pay. Even in the U.S., Apple Pay is still in its growth stage, but its benefit to international travelers would be enormous. Not only would the security aspects of Apple Pay help protect against fraud, but in theory supporting Apple Pay for online transactions would be able to sidestep restrictions like the ones I’ve encountered. \nIndia is a particularly interesting case, as the government is in the process of creating a unified payment system to push people towards cashless transactions. Whether Apple Pay would be compatible with that or simply provide an alternative, it might help travelers and citizens equally as well. Keep it SIMple \nOf course, the biggest issue when traveling internationally with your smartphone is being able to use your smartphone. The good news is that most modern smartphones, the iPhone included, work pretty seamlessly on networks around the globe, since they can at least fall back to the older GSM-based network. The latest standard, LTE, is still limited in many places, India among them, but I can at least get 3G/4G service and data—as long as I have a local SIM. \nHopefully, someday we won’t have to deal with these tiny little SIM cards anymore. \nI’ve discussed the problems of international data before , and I’d still like to see Apple take a more proactive approach in making the iPhone easier to use abroad. With carrier subsidies dying out in the U.S., the trend is hopefully towards unlocked phones, but the SIM installation process can still be frustrating and complex—and who likes keeping track of all those little cards anyway? \nInternational data from one’s provider is, of course, always an option, but it’s overpriced and doesn’t provide you with a local number, which can often be handy. Perhaps future versions of the iPhone will feature an Apple SIM that works with multiple carriers, as Apple has deployed in the iPad, or perhaps a new SIM-less technology will eventually make life easier on globetrotters. Keeping in touch \nI will say that thanks to being able to associate my iMessage and FaceTime IDs with my email address instead of just a phone number, it’s been a snap to keep exchanging texts and calls with my family back home. That’s one of Apple’s abstraction layers that’s made life a lot easier while abroad, and it’s shown that the company does create technology that can be a boon to the traveler; I’d just like to see more. \nAfter all, the last thing any of us want to do while we’re exploring the world is have to worry about whether or not our technology will work.

      "text": "Translate \nGame on Google. Apple is breaking out the drones in a bid to improve its Maps app and challenge Google’s ever-popular Maps offering. \nApple, according to a report from Bloomberg is putting together a team of robotics and data-collection experts with the mission of updating its map data at an accelerated pace. That’s where the drones come in. The company’s current fleet of minivans decked out with camera and sensors simply are not cutting it. \nApple will use drones to examine street signs, track changes to roads and keep track of areas that are under construction, a source told Bloomberg. All data would then be sent to Apple’s Map team which will quickly implement the updated information to the app, the unnamed source said. \nAnother source said Apple is working on new features for Maps, such as views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation. \nApple, as expected has declined to comment on the rumors. \nApple last fall filed an application with the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones for commercial reasons, according to the Bloomberg report. The FAA gave Apple the go-ahead this past March to “operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,” a document obtained by Bloomberg indicated. \nApple plans to use drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix GmbH for its data collection project.

      "title": "Apple family",
      "text": "Edit \nThough the extended family is quite large, only four Apple family members regularly appear in Ponyville : Applejack , Apple Bloom , Big McIntosh , and Granny Smith . Each of the Apple siblings' coat color corresponds to another sibling's mane color: Applejack's mane corresponds to Apple Bloom's coat, Apple Bloom's mane to Big McIntosh's coat, and Big McIntosh's mane to Applejack's coat. Parents Edit \nThe whereabouts of Applejack's parents is touched on in the episode Apple Family Reunion . At the end of the episode, the shot fades to a view of Sweet Apple Acres as two shooting stars fly through the sky. The shooting stars are meant to represent Applejack's parents according to storyboard artist Sabrina Alberghetti . [1] In Crusaders of the Lost Mark , Applejack makes explicit mention of her \"mom and dad\", saying they'd be proud of Apple Bloom for getting her cutie mark if they \"were here.\" \nLauren Faust had previously mentioned that the whereabouts of Applejack's parents has not been planned, and that the show was unlikely to mention that they've passed away. [2] Faust stated that she had wanted Applejack's parents to be deceased, and was holding back from defining it in the hopes that some of the show's restrictions were relaxed further down the line. [3] At the 2016 Middle Equestrian Convention in Poland, My Little Pony character designer Kora Kosicka stated in response to a fan question that Applejack's parents are dead. [4] Extended family Edit Some members of Applejack's extended family. Applejack's extended family is introduced as \"The Apple family\" in the episode Friendship is Magic, part 1 , when Applejack invites Twilight Sparkle and Spike to brunch. Applejack sounds off the following ponies: Apple Fritter , Apple Bumpkin , Red Gala , Red Delicious , Golden Delicious , Caramel Apple , Apple Strudel , Apple Tart , Baked Apples , Apple Brioche , Apple Cinnamon Crisp , Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith. Apple Cider , Apple Cobbler , Apple Honey , Apple Munchies , Gala Appleby , Jonagold , Lavender Fritter , Peachy Sweet , Perfect Pie , and other ponies are also among those present, but are not referred to by name. Apple Strudel first appears in Family Appreciation Day , wearing a Tyrolean hat and traditional dress. \nApplejack later explains to Twilight in Applebuck Season that her relatives had all gathered for the Apple family reunion, and had been working at their own farms at the time, and were unable to lend a hoof to Applejack. However, several of them, including Apple Bumpkin, Apple Cobbler, Apple Fritter, Apple Honey, Apple Munchies, Gala Appleby, Peachy Sweet, Perfect Pie, and Red Gala, help prepare Applejack's surprise party in The Last Roundup , and Caramel Apple appears in the same episode. Applejack's aunt Apple Brown Betty is mentioned in The Ticket Master , but does not appear until Apple Family Reunion. Another relative, Applejack's cousin Braeburn , is introduced in Over a Barrel . He lives in the frontier town of Appleloosa , along with many more apple farmers. \nThe Cutie Mark Chronicles establishes that Applejack is related to the Oranges , who Applejack calls Aunt and Uncle Orange ; toys refer to the latter as Mosely Orange. Apple Bloom's cousin Babs Seed is introduced in One Bad Apple , mentioning that she has a \"big sis\" . Babs Seed never told her \"big sis\" but in the end of One Bad Apple Applejack makes her promise that she'll tell her \"big sis\" when she gets bullied for not having a cutie mark. Great uncle Honeycrisp is mentioned by Applejack in issue 3 of the comic The Return of Queen Chrysalis . Great uncle Needle is mentioned by Big McIntosh in issue 10. \nGranny Smith refers to her parents and siblings as \"the Smith family\" in Family Appreciation Day. \nIn Pinkie Apple Pie , it is suggested that Pinkie Pie is a possible cousin to the Apple family, but all evidence given leaves this unclear. The same episode also introduces cousin Goldie Delicious , who mentions Applejack's great-great-great-great uncle Apple Tart. \nIn Somepony to Watch Over Me , Granny Smith goes to visit great aunt Pine Apple. \nGranny Smith's father , looking injured but otherwise the same as when his now-elderly daughter was young (as shown in Family Appreciation Day, Apple Family Reunion, and Bats! ), appears in modern day in Leap of Faith and a flashback in Where the Apple Lies . The founding of Ponyville Edit \nGranny Smith recounts how the Smith family came to found Ponyville in the episode Family Appreciation Day. As nomadic \"pilgrim pony folk\", they traveled Equestria collecting and selling seeds and looking for a suitable place to settle down. Princess Celestia gave them the land near the Everfree Forest and while searching the forest for food, Granny Smith discovered the zap apples . Ponies came from all around to purchase the family's Zap Apple Jam, and Ponyville began to grow around Sweet Apple Acres. Apple family reunion Edit The Apple family dancing at the reunion. According to Granny Smith, the Apple family gathers for a reunion at Sweet Apple Acres once every 100 moons , as shown in Apple Family Reunion. There are races, apple snacks, a hay ride around the farm, and a family photograph is taken. More names and ponies appear at the reunion; named are Granny Smith's Auntie Applesauce and cousin Apple Rose , as well as three others, Apple Dumpling , Apple Leaves , and Half Baked Apple , along with the already-established names Apple Tart and Golden Delicious. Also seen at the reunion is Hayseed Turnip Truck , who is part of the family photo and also photographed helping rebuild the barn with Big McIntosh. Absent from the reunion but present in a past family photo is \" Apple Bud \". Present at the reunion in at least one shot but absent from the family photo are \" Apple Bottom \", \" Apple Bread \", \" Apple Slice \", \" Brown Sugar \", Cherry Berry , Cloudchaser , Orange Swirl , \" Dosie Dough \", Emerald Green , Fiddly Twang , \" Flounder \", Full Steam , \" Gingerbread \", Golden Harvest , Mr. Greenhooves , Helia , \" John Bull \", \" Kazooie \", Lucky Clover , Meadow Song , \" Pitch Perfect \", \" Pomegranate \", \" Princess Erroria \", Shoeshine and Sweetie Drops ; \"Apple Bread\" is photographed at a picnic table with Apple Bloom, Big McIntosh and Applejack, Orange Swirl appears without her wings or cutie mark, Emerald Green appears with wings, \"Princess Erroria\" mostly appears without her wings, and Fiddly Twang, \"Kazooie\" and \"Pitch Perfect\" wear parts of the same costumes as in Luna Eclipsed . Sweet Apple Acres Main article: Sweet Apple Acres \nSweet Apple Acres is the family farm/orchard located near Ponyville, home to Applejack, Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith. Sweet Apple Acres has a large apple orchard, as seen in Applebuck Season. Aside from apples, corn and carrots are also grown and harvested. In Spike at Your Service , Spike counts exactly 24,567,837 blades of grass in Sweet Apple Acres. Other depictions",

      "text": "There are There is an iCloud Calendar Spam problem on the iPhone, iPad and Mac. Apple is finally recognizing the issue and plans to take steps to address it, but there are things you can do to stop iPhone spam calendar invites.\nAdvertisement\nWe’ve been inundated with iCloud calendar invites for knock off products like Ray Ban, Uggs and other fashionable brands. These pop up as a notification and stick as a bubble notification on the Calendar app on the iPhone and iPad until you accept or decline.\nYou shouldn’t do either of these, as both options notify the spammer that your email address is real and a target to be pursued on future iCloud calendar spam invites.\nPut a stop to iCloud spam on iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nWe are also seeing a rise in iCloud Photo Sharing spam that comes in with annoying ads that come through as fake photo sharing notifications.\nApple finally addresses this issue, stating that they are working on it, but for now you need to fix this issue on your own.\nApple’s statement on iCloud calendar spam. They’re sorry and they’re working on it. pic.twitter.com/oaSHSywVxG\n— Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) November 30, 2016\nAdvertisement\nHow to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam There are two ways you can stop calendar spam. The easiest is to move it to a calendar that you delete, but you can also turn off iCloud Calendar invites that go to the app. The second option will send all of your invites to email, even the ones you want to see, but if you get a lot of iCloud Calendar spam, this may be the best option.\nOpen your iPhone Calendar Tap on Calendars Tap on Edit and then Add a calendar under iCloud Name this Spam and tap done. Go back to the main screen and tap on the spam invite. Tap on calendar and then choose the Spam calendar. Go back to the main screen and Tap calendars at the bottom. Tap edit in the upper left. Tap on Spam and scroll down to delete calendar. If you have multiple invites you can add them to this at once, otherwise you need to do this every time you get an iCloud spam invite.\nPut an end to iPhone calendar spam.\nUsers who get many iCloud spam invites can go to the iCloud website and change the setting so that these invites go to your email instead of to your calendar.\nAdvertisement\nSign into iCloud using your Apple ID Click on Calendar. Then on Settings in the lower left. Click on Preferences. Choose Advanced. Click on Email to “your email” and then on Save. That’s all you need to do to stop calendar spam on the iPhone, iPad and MacBook.

      "title": "Apple admits what caused your iPhone battery issue",
      "text": "Reddit \nApple made a statement about the iPhone 6s this morning in China, adding details to a battery issue reported by users in China and the USA. This battery issue has affected a “small number of iPhone 6S devices,” said Apple. In addition to what was reported by Apple earlier, they’ve revealed details on the exact cause of the device switching off as it reaches 40% battery. It would seem that this is not a bug, but a sort of feature – as Apple says: “an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions.” \nThe statement from Apple says that one of the conditions under which an iPhone might shut off completely is “extremely cold temperatures.” That’s not what’s been happening with the iPhone 6s, but it is a reason why an iPhone might shut off. Apple goes on to note that “to an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage.” \nApple’s newest statement on the 30% battery shutdown issue showed that devices manufactured between September and October of 2015 were not made correctly. This run of iPhone 6s units “contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs.” Apple said that because of this error, batteries in these iPhones “degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur.” \nApple has not found any other factors that might cause unexpected shutdowns in the iPhone 6s. Apple’s statement covers the iPhone 6s only, and only those models manufactured between September and October of 2015. Apple has provided a Serial Number Entry point for users around the world to identify the devices affected by this replacement. \nThe newest statement comes from the China-based face of the Apple Store. There the message can be read in Chinese as well as English. This message was first published on the 2nd of December, 2016.",

Well, regardless of where you come down on the debate, Apple could already be moving its focus away from the iPhone 7. That's according to a report from Digitimes indicating that the Cupertino giant is scaling back orders from suppliers due to a declining demand for this year's device. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The ubiquitous sources found on the supply chain also suggested that the hype surrounding the Jet Black variant has died down, with the iPhone 8 (or whatever it ends up being called) likely set to arrive next September. © Veniamin Geskin ‏ Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price Of course, we've heard a lot of speculation already about the future handset, with the 10th anniversary edition tipped to feature everything from a 3D camera to a bezel-less, OLED display. This news also comes after a report that Apple is currently working on around 10 prototypes for the 2017 smartphone. But with that said, it's also unlikely that the company is simply shifting away from its recently released device with the best part of 10 months still to go in its life cycle. As always, the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle. While this year's minimal upgrade naturally may have created less excitement, Apple will always have one eye on the future regardless of circumstance.

Apple also made this update available today to developers.\nThe update doesn’t come with a ton of changes. But it does fix a bug that appeared in public beta 4 : that some versions of iTunes would delete content from the recently introduced TV app. Also if you’re on an iPod Touch, the TV app won’t crash or show the error message “TV is unavailable.” \nBut the new version of iOS does still have the problem that the TV app can’t be restored after it’s deleted.\nThe SOS emergency feature, which first debuted on the Apple Watch and appeared for the iPhone in 10.2 public beta 2 , is still restricted to India.\nThese public beta updates are the best way to get access to the latest stuff coming out of Apple. If you’re already part of Apple’s Beta Software Program, you’ll be able to download the new version as an over-the-air (OTA) update. If you’re not part of the program, you can sign up now by going here . It’s free.\nOr if you don’t feel like downloading each and every one of these public beta updates, you can just wait for final version of iOS 10.2 to roll out to everyone. Which should happen in the next few weeks.\n",

      "title": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google - Chicago Tribune",
      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google Mark Gurman and Alan Levin, (c) 2016, Bloomberg (c) 2016, Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n--- ",

      "title": "Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 versus Apple A10 Fusion",
      "text": "\nThe two leading mobile processor companies are Qualcomm and Apple. Qualcomm’s processors are found in many of the leading handsets while Apple’s processors is found at the heart of every recent iPhone and iPad. The latest and greatest System-on-a-Chip (SoC) from Qualcomm is the Snapdragon 821 and the current processor from Apple is the A10 Fusion. While both companies are certainly working on their next generation products, these two processors represent some of the best mobile processor technology that is available in a handset.\nYes, there are others like the Samsung Exynos 8890 and the Kirin 960 and I will be making a general SoC showdown piece just after I have finished this one. However today we turn our attention solely to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 and the Apple A10 Fusion, which is best?\nAnd this is where we stumble, even before we get out of the gate. What does “best” mean? Best performance? Best power efficiency? Best GPU? Best wireless modems? There are lots of ways to characterize a SoC. So before we go on to look at aspects like performance and power efficiency, here is a side by side comparison of the features of these two SoCs.\nSpecifications I will start with a caveat. Neither Qualcomm or Apple are very forthcoming about the internals of their processors. Qualcomm does a slightly better job than Apple, but still a lot of this information is what I have gleaned from various articles across the Internet. If you know of any extra information, please let me know.\n  Snapdragon 821 A10 Fusion Process Technology 14 nm 16 nm CPU 64Bit Quad-core, 2x Kryo 2.4 GHz + 2x Kryo 2.0 GHz 64Bit Quad-core, 2x Hurricane 2.34 GHz + 2x Zephyr Core scheduling Per core Per cluster GPU Adreno 530 650MHz 6 core RAM type LPDDR4 @ 1866MHz LPDDR4 4G LTE X12 LTE Cat 12/13 Not included. iPhone 7 uses third party modem chips Charging Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 10W? Graphic APIs OpenGL ES 3.2, Open CL 2.0, \nVulkan 1.0, \nDX11.2 OpenGL ES 3.0, Metal Video Up to 4K Ultra HD video capture @ 30FPS. Up to 4K Ultra HD video playback. 4K video recording at 30 fps. Video playback up to 4K, 30 frames per second Codecs H.264 (AVC) + \nH.265 (HEVC) H.264 (AVC) + H.265 (for Facetime?) Wi-Fi 802.11ac 802.11ac So breaking it down a bit we see that both the Snapdragon 821 and the A10 Fusion are quad-core processors using Heterogeneous Multi-Processing (HMP). In a HMP SoC, not all the cores are equal (hence, heterogeneous). Both SoCs have two high performance cores and two energy efficient cores. This system was popularized on mobile by ARM with its big.LITTLE system. ARM has been a leader in this field and has contributed lots of source code to projects like the Linux kernel. If you want to know more about big.LITTLE then please read how the Samsung Galaxy S6 uses its octa-core processor .\nThe Snapdragon 821 is Qualcomm’s first HMP system using its own Kryo cores, however it has used HMP before in processors like the Snapdragon 810 which used four Cortex-A57 cores plus four Cortex-A53 cores. Qualcomm still uses ARM’s big.LITTLE system for other processors in its range including the Snapdragon 652 which uses four Cortex-A72 cores plus four Cortex-A53 cores.\nAlthough the A10 is Apple’s 4th generation 64-bit ARM compatible processor, this is the first time that Cupertino has designed a quad-core processor and the first time it has used HMP. One big difference between the Snapdragon 821 and the A10 Fusion is that the 821 can use all of its cores simultaneously where are the A10 can only swap between using the high performance core cluster and the energy efficient core cluster. This is similar to the situation with earlier implementations of big.LITTLE back in 2013 .\nBesides the CPU, the GPU is a vital component inside a SoC. Qualcomm uses its own in-house GPU and now so does Apple. This is the first time Apple is using its own GPU. Previously Apple used PoweVR GPUs from Imagination Technologies, however it has now started using its own design, which is probably based heavily on the PowerVR, but as usual there are no details available, in fact the GPU doesn’t even have an official name! When it comes to API support, the Adreno 530 GPU from Qualcomm supports OpenGL ES 3.2 and Vulkan 1.0, whereas Apple supports OpenGL ES 3.0 and its own Metal API.\nThere are two more differences worth mentioning. First, the Snapdragon 821 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology, which allows handset makers to offer fast charging in their handsets (upto 18W), whereas Apple doesn’t yet support any kind of fast charging. Second, the Snapdragon 821 includes Qualcomm’s X12 LTE modem whereas the A10 Fusion doesn’t have a built-in modem, instead it uses third party modems on auxiliary chips. 3 out of 4 iPhone 7 models use modems from Qualcomm.\nPerformance This is one of the most hotly debated processor topics, not only on mobile but on the desktop, in servers and on supercomputers. Before we dive in there are a few things we need to understand. They key thing to remember is that energy efficiency and performance are not friends. The greater the performance the more power is used. There are various equations that specify the relationship between power and performance, the most notable being P=CV^2f, where P is Power, C is the capacitance of the process node, V is voltage (in this case raised to the power of 2) and f is the frequency.\nSo, if you run a CPU at a higher clock speed it uses more power. Likewise if it is built on a smaller fabrication process then it uses less power, as C will be less. Most crucially the lower the voltage the lower the power usage. On the desktop power usage isn’t too much of a problem. A PC is connected to the mains and there are big cooling fans. Of course on mobile things are different. Smartphones run from batteries and they mustn’t get too hot!\nThe Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 uses Samsung’s 14nm fabrication process where as the Apple A10 uses TSMC’s 16nm process. So technically the value of C will be higher on the A10, meaning more power is used. Both processors are clocked at around the same maximum clock speed (2.4 vs 2.34GHz) however we can’t compare the clock frequencies of the smaller cores as the frequency for the A10 fusion isn’t known (well not by me at least). At this point overall performance will come down to things like memory speeds, L1 and L2 cache sizes and the number of instructions per clock that the CPU can execute.\nRelated videos: Instructions per cycle - Gary explains The Cortex-A73, a CPU that won't... What is a GPU and how does it work?... What is cache - Gary explains The other thing of note is the difference in OS and OS design. Android is based on Linux while iOS is based on BSD. Android uses Java while iOS uses Objective-C & Swift. So at one level trying to gauge the overall performance of the Snapdragon 821 and then compare it to the performance of the A10 Fusion while trying to eliminate any OS and architectural differences is hard.\nI have run performance tests using the Google Pixel (for the Snapdragon 821) and the iPhone 7 (for the A10 fusion), which leads me to my last caveat, there could be faster Snapdragon 821 devices out there which might give slightly different results. Likewise the screen resolution differences between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will have an impact on GPU performance. I have also read that the 32GB model of the iPhone 7 (which I am using) has slower internal storage than the 128GB or 256GB models.\nI ran two sets of tests, first I used some of the various benchmark apps that exist on both Android and iOS (AnTuTu, Geekbench and Basemark OS II). Then I ran some of my own home brew benchmarks, but more about those later.\nHere are the results:\n\nAs you can see the Apple A10 Fusion as used in the iPhone 7 is faster than the Snapdragon 821 as found in the Google Pixel. The difference in performance varies significantly. AnTuTu puts the difference at just 6% where was the Geekbench Single Core tests give the A10 a massive 126% advantage. The remaining tests says that the A10 is around 30% faster.\nSo let’s breakdown the AnTuTu results a bit and see what are the strengths and weaknesses of each processor:\nAnTuTu Test A10 Fusion Snapdragon 821 3D 44996 (28917, 16079) 56890 (36443, 20447) UX 52071 (8168, 11180, 21587, 4528, 6617) 45278 (8209, 4833, 9027, 19639, 3570) CPU 41655 (14512, 14632, 12511) 32403 (12204, 8129, 12070) RAM 11568 6521 AnTuTu performs four types of test: 3D, UX, CPU and RAM. For the 3D part the Adreno 530 in the Snapdragon 821 performs better than the GPU in the A10 Fusion (44996 for the A10 vs 56890 for the 821). Although the Snapdragon wins the 3D tests, the A10 is the victor for the remaining tests. For some of the individual tests the Snapdragon 821 and the A10 are neck-and-neck (e.g. the CPU multi-core test and the UX data secure test), however there are tests where the A10 is clearly the winner. In particular the RAM tests shows quite a difference between the two processors.\nMy second set of tests use my own home brew set of benchmarks. Cross platform benchmarking is full of pitfalls and possible rabbit holes. The first problem is that Android uses Java as its principal development language where as iOS uses Objective-C or Swift. This means that an app written for one platform can’t be easily ported to the other just by recompiling. Another problem is the use of run-time libraries. For example, if an app needs to manipulate some data (compress, encrypt, copy, whatever) there are various functions provided by the respective languages and the operating systems that can help with that. But for a benchmark that means that the app is now testing the efficiency of the run-time libraries and the OS and not necessarily the hardware.\nThere are various ways to write apps which work on both platforms. One is to use an SDK which supports multiple platforms, another is to use C. The C programming language is kind of the lingua-franca of the computing world. Almost every computer platform has a C compiler including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.\nFor my benchmarks I use both approaches. One set of tests uses the LUA programming language which is supported by various SDKs across Android and iOS. The other set of benchmarks uses C.\nI have two LUA based tests. The first of my custom benchmarks tests the CPU without using the GPU. It calculates 100 SHA1 hashes on 4K of data and then does some other CPU stuff, I call it “Hashes, bubble sorts, tables and primes.” The result is the time taken to complete the test.\n\nAs you can see the iPhone 7 is the clear winner by a significant margin. The second test is slightly different to the first in that it also involves some graphics, 2D graphics in this case. The benchmark uses a 2D physics engine to simulate water being poured into a container. The app is designed to run at 60 frames per second and two drops of water are added every frame. The benchmark measures how many droplets are actually processed and how many are missed, the maximum score is 10800. The Pixel scores 10178 while the iPhone 7 scores 10202.\n\nFor the C language tests I took the C benchmark code which I used in my article Java vs C app performance – Gary explains and recompiled it for iOS. The actual iOS app is written in Objective-C, for the UI etc, however the benchmark code is exactly the same C code as run on Android using the NDK.\nSee also: Java vs C app performance – Gary explains May 3, 2016 The first test repeatedly calculates the SHA1 of a block of data. The second calculates the first 1 million primes using trial by division. The third repeatedly runs an arbitrary function which performs lots of different mathematical functions (multiply, divide, with integers, with floating point numbers etc). In each case the time taken to complete the test (in seconds) is measured. Here are the results:\n\nAs you can see in this case the Snapdragon 821 beats the Apple A10 fusion in every test. Now this is a bit of a conundrum. If the previous benchmarks were more ambiguous, giving the lead sometimes to the Snapdragon and sometimes to the A10 then this could just one of the results that tips in favor of the Qualcomm processor. However, almost unanimously the benchmarks declared the A10 the faster processor.\nSo why do my C language benchmarks show a clear victory for the Snapdragon 821? There are a number of possible answers: a) The C compiler in the Android NDK is better than the C compiler in Xcode, or b) due to the HMP nature of both processors then it is possible that the “big” cores on the A10 didn’t get a chance to run and the tests executed on the smaller cores, or c) there are some unknown performance optimizations that normally run that didn’t kick-in, or d) there is something wrong with my iOS app (as I am not that familiar with iOS app development).\nPower As I have mentioned above, it is possible to create a high performance processor if you can afford to use lots of energy and you have a way to dissipate the heat. On mobile that isn’t possible, so it is important to look at the efficiency aspects of both processors. Testing the power efficiency of a mobile processor is hard. There are various ways to do it including dismantling the phone and connecting lots of wires to the circuit board! However for this test I will try to get an idea using software and a bit of math.\nFirst of all I set each phone’s display to minimum brightness and left it on the home screen doing “nothing”. After an hour I looked at the battery usage to try and gauge how much the display consumes with the processor practically idle. The Pixel used 5% of its battery and the iPhone used 4%. This sounds about right as the screen on the Pixel is bigger, has a higher resolution (i.e. more pixels to power) and is slightly brighter when on minimum. The iPhone 7 has a 1960 mAh battery and the Pixel has a 2770 mAh unit. That means that the iPhone used 78 mAh to power the screen for 1 hour while the Pixel used 138 mAh.\nI then ran Epic Citadel for one hour (in the guided tour mode) on both phones. The iPhone 7 used 20% of its battery and so did the Pixel. We know that 4% and 5% respectively of that usage was for the screen, so the iPhone used 16% of 1960 mAh and the Pixel used 15% of 2770 mAh. That works out to 319 mAh for the iPhone and 415 mAh for the Pixel. This result is to be expected as the GPU on the Pixel is working harder than the GPU on the iPhone as it has more pixels (no pun intended) to render per frame. In fact the Pixel has double the number of pixels than the iPhone, that is a lot of work for the GPU!\nI performed a similar test for video playback. Using VLC on both Android and iOS I played a video file for one hour. The iPhone used 11% of its battery while the Pixel used 10%. So the iPhone used 7% of 1960 mAh and the Pixel used 5% of 2770 mAh. That works out to 137 mAh for the iPhone and 138 mAh for the Pixel.\n\nUnfortunately that means it is hard to definitely declare the winner here. The iPhone has a smaller battery which some might take as proof that it is more power efficient, however it also has a lower resolution display. It is interesting to note that the iPhone 7 Plus has a bigger battery than the Pixel but the same resolution display. When playing 3D games the iPhone 7 uses less power, however the GPU is working less (maybe 50% less). When playing video both devices uses almost identical amounts of battery power.\nWrap-up Millions of Qualcomm and Apple processors are being used right now in handsets all across the globe. When taken as a whole package including the CPU, GPU, ISP, DSP, and modem there are pros and cons on both sides. Clearly both processors are advanced pieces of tech. The Snapdragon 821 is the more rounded processor since it contains an integrated LTE modem, the same type of modem that is used by the iPhone 7, plus support for quick charging and more graphic APIs (OpenGL ES 3.2 + Vulkan). And this fits with Qualcomm’s business model, the Snapdragon series are mobile processors that are sold to OEMs to build phones, tablets, set-top boxes, media players, whatever. The A10 is designed specifically for one thing, the iPhone (and maybe later the iPad).\nAs for performance, it seems clear that the A10 Fusion has the upper-hand, however not by much, but that does depend on the workload. In some of AnTuTu sub-tests the Snapdragon 821 matched the performance of the A10 and for my home brew tests written in C then the Snapdragon 821 actually beat the A10!\nIn terms of power efficiency it is hard to say, power is used by some many components in a smartphone including the CPU, GPU, memory, various Wi-Fi and cellular radios, etc. But from what I see there isn’t much between the two SoCs.\nAs a final word, I know this article will stir up various “fanboy” sentiments, all I can ask is that you remember that there are lots of problems in the world and lots of reasons why people get angry with each other, however which smartphone you use shouldn’t be one of them.",

      "text": "Reddit Back in November of last year, Apple confirmed plans to build a new stunning waterfront flagship retail store on the Chicago River. At the time a few renders of Apple’s plans for the location were floating around courtesy of architect Foster + Partners, which Apple has worked with on several projects including the design of the company’s Spaceship campus , as well as the redesign for London’s Regent Street store . But Apple has rapidly made progress on demolition of the existing site and construction on the new store in recent weeks, as evidenced by these photos sent in by a reader ( Thanks Tim King! ). The new approximately 20,000 sq ft. store will replace a vacant food court located at a 401 N. Michigan Ave. office building and overlook the Chicago River with some public outdoor space surrounding the structure. This is what the site looked like right before Apple began demolition back in May: But Apple quickly demolished that: Not long after, Apple quickly started framing out the store and you can already see the shape of the building and grand staircases that you’ll recognize from Apple’s renders: Here’s a view looking out from the store: Here’s the current state of the site: And this is what Apple plans for the finished building to look like according to its original renders: \nIt’s unclear when Apple plans to wrap up construction on the building as the winter season approaches, but it’s possible the outdoor area could be ready to go in time for the spring.",

      "text": "TWEET Spammers have discovered a new method to infiltrate your life. Over the past few months, Apple users have been reporting strange iCal invites from miscellaneous accounts that clearly aren't legitimate. These fake invites are hard to handle: Unlike email, calendar invites can't be marked as spam, and declining the invites will alert the spammers that the iCloud account is active — which could lead to even more invites. What are you supposed to do? \ncool new icloud feature: calendar spam An iOS update would best remedy this situation, but there are a couple workarounds that can help you in the meantime. Here's what you can do if you receive spam calendar invites: Reroute push notifications to iCloud email By default iCal will send event invites to your iPhone as a push notification, but you can change this setting to reroute invites to your iCloud email. Not only will this prevent fake invites from bombarding your phone, but your email account should identify these events as spam and rightly filter them as such. To change this setting, you'll have to visit the iCloud Calendar page on a computer (you can't access iCloud.com on mobile Safari). Click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner of the screen to access Settings. From that menu, select Preferences. Then hit the Advanced tab and change the Invitations option from \"In-App Notifications\" to \"Email to iCloud Address.\" There is a downside to this: Now all calendar events will be sent to your iCloud email, meaning you'll have to routinely check it if you want to see invites from family or friends. Disable the iCloud calendar The above option is suited for users who actively use iCal — this one is for those who don't ( Google Calendar is better anyway, right? ). If your iCloud calendar is expendable, just head to your iPhone's Settings and select iCloud to disable the app. All push notifications from the spammers will halt. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "TWEET Apple recently unveiled its new generation of MacBook Pros. As the saying goes, \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" — in this case it's the elimination of support for a number of Mac computers. An internal memo obtained by MacRumors revealed the company's plans to add four devices to its vintage and obsolete products list on Dec. 31. They are as follows: — MacBook Pro (15-inch, early 2011) — MacBook Pro (17-inch, early 2011) — Mac mini (early 2009) — MacBook (13-inch, mid-2009) This designation means Apple or any Apple Authorized Service Provider will no longer provide hardware service or repairs for these products unless owners obtain service in California or Turkey , where Apple will continue to provide support until Dec. 31, 2018. Apple classifies vintage products as \"those that have not been manufactured for more than five and less than seven years ago.\" An Apple device then becomes obsolete when its discontinuation reaches the seven-year mark.

      "title": "Universal: What&apos;s new for Macy&apos;s parade",
      "text": "A little slice of of the Big Apple will again be marching through the streets of Universal Studios in Orlando this holiday season. The Macy's Holiday Parade is marking its 15th anniversary in the theme park.\n\"When we came down here 16 years ago with a germ of an idea of building another parade … we never really thought it would last this long. We though we would do it for four or five years and have a nice run,\" Amy Kule, executive director of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade , said Friday.\nUnlike the New York version, which runs once a year, the Universal version has many encore performances, running from Dec. 3 through Jan. 1.\n\"How much fun is that to have a parade every single day?” Kule said.\nNew elements that park visitors will see include a large ground-based \"ballonicle\" representing Mother Ginger from the \"Nutcracker\" ballet. A more traditional, up-high balloon is Virginia of \"Yes, Virginia, fame.\"\nBack in the late 1890s, little Virginia O'Hanlon was taunted by classmates who said Santa Claus wasn't real. Undaunted by the prospect of \"fake news,\" she decided to write to New York Sun.\n\"Her dad had always said if it’s printed in the Sun, it’s so,\" said John Piper, vice president at Macy's Parade Studio. \"So she wrote a letter to the editor of the New York Sun and sent it in. And the editor answered her in the paper, 'Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.'\"\nAt Universal, the Virginia balloon's handlers wear bibs that say \"Yes, Virginia\" on the front and \"There is a Santa Claus\" on the back.\nSome flesh-and-blood parade performers in the Universal parade got makeover this year, said Lora Wallace, show director.\n\"We changed the look of our skaters at the beginning, we changed the look of our lead elf stilt as she leads the parade,\" Wallace said. \"We added penguins, we added [dancing] jingle bells. There’s so much to look at.\"\nStep-off time for Macy's Holiday Parade is 5 p.m. through Dec. 18 and then at 8 p.m. on Dec. 19 and thereafter.\nOther returning holiday elements at Universal Orlando include concerts by Mannheim Steamroller (7 p.m. on Dec. 3, 4, 10, 11, 17 and 18) on the Music Plaza Stage and, next door at Islands of Adventure, the \"Grinchmas Who-liday Spectacular\" runs multiple times daily through Jan. 1.\nThese activities are included in regular park admission.

      "text": "Posted on 12/02/2016 4:11:04 PM PST by Swordmaker \nApple has posted the following statement on their Chinese website: \nWe care deeply about our customers and take seriously concerns they have about their Apple products. After hearing reports from iPhone customers whose devices unexpectedly shut down, we thoroughly looked into these reports, and collected and analyzed devices. \nWe found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It’s important to note, this is not a safety issue. \nTo help our customers who are experiencing this issue, we are replacing batteries in affected devices, free of charge. iPhone 6s owners can easily find out if their device is eligible by typing in their devices serial number on the iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues web page. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused customers. \nWe also want our customers to know that an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the devices electronics from low voltage. \nWe looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly. After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports. \nWe encourage any customer who experiences an issue with an Apple product to visit an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or to contact Apple Support . \nMacDailyNews Take: Problem identified and free replacement program initiated and communicated. Good job, Apple!",

Photo: Google Maps Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google 1 / 14 Back to Gallery \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. Latest News",

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) In this photo taken Friday, Dec. 4, 2015, the Apple Maps app displays transit directions in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Photo: Eric Risberg, Associated Press Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nRecently released drone video shows the new campus of Apple Inc. located in Cupertino, California. In a brochure mailed out to local residents in 2012, Apple said the new 176-acre campus would include wooded walking areas, restaurants and a 100,000 square foot fitness center. On the company's website, Apple says it expects to move in around 12,000 of its employees when the project is complete in early 2017. The campus will become the company's new headquarters and is located about one mile east of its current headquarters in Cupertin Media: Wibbitz \nFive years after Google Maps appeared on the iPhone, Apple’s mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. ALSO New Nintendo console may feed your nostalgia, if you can get one \n“There’s a huge data-quality issue there, and I don’t think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,” Craig Federighi , Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies’ mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple’s latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google. \nSince Apple Maps was created, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit, improving search results, and allowing outside services such as Uber and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone project continues this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nLast year, Apple filed for an exemption from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response in March, the FAA granted Apple approval to “operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography and videography,” according to one of the documents. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple’s project. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon’s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. The Apple team is reportedly being assembled in Seattle, where Amazon has its headquarters. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports and other high-traffic buildings like museums, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved through a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth . Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \nMark Gurman and Alan Levin are Bloomberg writers. Email: ,  ",

      "text": "Apple scrubs VP of Special Projects Paul Deneve's bio page from website By Friday, December 02, 2016, 07:48 pm PT (10:48 pm ET) Apple this week removed Apple VP of Special Projects Paul Deneve's bio from its Apple Leadership webpage, suggesting the executive has changed roles or is no longer with the company. Paul Deneve's Apple bio prior to removal. Prior to the change, Deneve's headshot was one of only 19 featured prominently on the Executive Profiles page of Apple's press information mini-site. The link to his bio is now inactive and forwards to a generic landing page reading \"The page you're looking for can't be found.\" Whether Deneve stepped down, changed positions or is no longer affiliated with Apple is unclear. According to his LinkedIn profile , Deneve is still serving as an Apple vice president, though information from the business-oriented social network is circumstantial at best. Deneve began his professional career as a European marketing and sales manager at Apple in 1990. He made a move to the world of fashion by serving as managing director at Courreges in 1997, then president of Nina Ricci and Lanvin in 2003 and 2006, respectively. Before returning to Apple in 2013 to head up \"special projects\" under CEO Tim Cook, Deneve held the position of CEO at French label Yves Saint Laurent, now known as Saint Laurent. Upon his return, Deneve applied lessons learned from the fashion industry to marketing Apple's first wearable device, the Apple Watch. Last year, for example, the executive helped create a large floral-themed installation that took up all 24 windows at storied London department store Selfridges. Topics:",

Subscribe Apple's New iPhone 7: No Headphone Jack, But Awesome Camera \nTaking a look back at another week of news from Cupertino, this week’s Apple Loop includes the complications of OLED screens in the iPhone 8, details on the wireless charging and unibody chassis for the next iPhone, Apple's battery issues with the iPhone 6 family, a larger iPad for educational markets, the patents for a circular Apple Watch, the rise of calendar spam in iCloud, the throttled iPhone 7 GPU, and Apple's mapping push. \nApple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days ( and you can read our weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes ). \nOLED Issues for iPhone 8 \nFollowing on from last week's look at the iPhone 8 screen technology, more details on the screen technology Apple hopes to use in 2017's flagship smartphone have been published by the Wall Street Journal. The move to OLED screens has been long-discussed, but there are complications, as Forbes' Amit Chowdhury reports : \nOne of Apple’s biggest suppliers for displays is also one of its biggest competitors: Samsung. Samsung Display is just one out of several technology companies that can mass produce OLEDs. So to reduce its dependence on Samsung for smartphone components, Apple has been selecting other companies to build its displays such as LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp. \nBut LG Display is far from Samsung Display at OLED production capabilities. And Sharp’s parent company Foxconn has been focusing less on OLEDs due to the higher manufacturing costs. Plus Japan Display is reportedly talking to Innovation Network Corp. of Japan for a financial bailout. Interestingly, Japan Display is also investing in advanced LCD panels known as “Full Active.” The Full Active LCD panels use film instead of glass so that it could offer better flexibility and image quality. Exploded iPhone 7 (image: IHS Markit) \nMore Good News For Wireless Lovers \nThe screen is not the only part of the iPhone 8 package under the leaky microscope. Forbes' Gordon Kelly looks at some of the other powerful rumors of the week, including how you are going to charge 2017's iPhone, a new flagship size, and the unibody chassis: \n1. Three (not two) premium 2017 iPhone models will be launched, including a new flagship 5.8-inch model 2. All three new models will switch to glass unibody chassis 3. Wireless charging will be introduced across the range (thanks to the conductivity in their glass chassis) 4. LCD screens replaced by thinner, brighter, more efficient OLED panels \nRead all the details here . \nApple's Battery Issues Are Growing \nThe China Consumer Association has had some stern words with Apple over the battery issues affecting a range of handsets in the iPhone 6 family. Apple acknowledged a small number of iPhone 6S devices with this problem at the end of November ( Forbes Brad Moon has details on the replacement service being offered ). The Chinese authorities believe that the issue is more widespread, and want a better explanation from Tim Cook. \nAfter Apple published the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues,” many consumers continued to send replies to the China Consumers Association reporting their situation. After collecting these reports, we discovered the shutdown malfunction also exists in the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, in addition to iPhone 6s devices produced between September and October 2015. The aforementioned models were among the devices suspected of malfunction problems in the China Consumer Associations’ letter sent out on November 15. Meanwhile, consumers have opinions and suggestions about the execution of Apple’s “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues.” \nForbes' Gordon Kelly is examining the fallout : \nRight now Apple appears to have engaged in a potentially dangerous stand-off with both angry customers and a Chinese government watchdog but - in the same mould as its infamous “Just avoid holding it in that way” response to what became Antennagate with the iPhone 4 - it appears to be one that cannot last. \nIn short: unless every affected user has already come forward and the China Consumers Association is prepared to make a U-turn on its claims, then the pressure will build on Apple to concede the problem is wider than a two month manufacturing spell on a single iPhone model. Apple's iPad Pro 9.7 (photo: Getty Images) \nA Larger iPad For Schools \nLast week's Apple Loop reported on a potential 'educational model' of the iPad. This week the supply chain has some more details on what could be a ten-inch iPad model. With some nifty engineering, the larger screen will be surrounded by smaller bezels, leaving the 10.9 inch iPad taking up the same footprint as the traditional 9.7 inch model. And that's not all that's different : \nThat leads to the second change, which is the removal of the home button. This has been a point of discussion for some time and its removal is expected to be part of the visual change the iPhone 8 will make when it is presumably launched in September 2017. Many consumers (especially in the BRIC countries where repair costs run high) already use the virtual home button that can be found under iOS accessibility options to protect the physical home key. \nThere is no word if Apple will move to this virtual button, if a new form of virtual home button will be devised, or if there will be a ‘hot’ area in the user interface to act as an on-screen button. It’s already possible to call up the task switcher by pressing at the side of the screen, so a press at the lower edge could conceivably be used as a ‘home’ function. ",

Subscribe This Bulletproof Iphone Could Save Your Life \nmay be famed for its Reality Distortion Field but, as increasing numbers of iPhones fall victim to a serious battery problem I first reported last week , the Chinese government has dismissed Apple’s attempts to downplay the situation and attacked the company for failing to “meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication.” Apple's 2017 iPhone is expected to be extremely impressive, but right now the company's problems lie in the past. iPhone 8 concept image credit: Veniamin Geskin \nIn an official statement (via Quartz ) the China Consumers Association, a government watchdog group, has issued Apple with a formal warning and demanded both action and an admission of wider culpability: \n“After Apple published the ‘iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues’ many consumers continued to send replies to the China Consumers Association reporting their situation. After collecting these reports, we discovered the shutdown malfunction also exists in the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, in addition to iPhone 6s devices produced between September and October 2015. The aforementioned models were among the devices suspected of malfunction problems in the China Consumer Associations’ letter sent out on November 15. Meanwhile, consumers have opinions and suggestions about the execution of Apple’s “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues.” \nAs a result, on November 29, the China Consumer Association once again sent a letter to Apple expressing our wish that Apple provide a thorough analysis, reason and solution for the malfunctioning iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6s phones produced between September and October 2015. In addition, as for the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues,” some consumers have questions about its terms and [we] ask for a timely clarification. [We also request] Apple improve the convenience of the booking and consultation systems [for battery replacement], prepare enough components to replace batteries efficiently, and meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication.” \nAnd yet Apple’s latest response is only likely to further annoy both the Chinese watchdog and all affected users. In a follow up statement (notably written in both English and Chinese) Apple has once again denied the issue extends beyond iPhone 6S models produced between September and October 2015 or requires action beyond its existing replacement program : \n“After hearing reports from iPhone customers whose devices unexpectedly shut down, we thoroughly looked into these reports, and collected and analyzed devices...We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly. After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.” \nApple also rather disingenuously pointed out that “an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature” - but this bears no relevance to the many shutdowns being reported by users in everyday scenarios. \nIn fact even former Apple executive and so-called ‘father of the iPod’ Tony Fadell recently tweeted that his iPhone is shutting off unexpectedly “every other day”: Ex-Apple senior executive Tony Fadell confirms the battery problems with his iPhone. Image credit: Twitter \nHe also confirmed his problem is not limited to the iPhone 6S, but the iPhone 6S Plus which Apple still claims is unaffected: Fadell confirms his iPhone battery problem is with a model Apple current denies is affected. Image credit: Twitter \nSo What Happens Next? \nRight now Apple appears to have engaged in a potentially dangerous stand-off with both angry customers and a Chinese government watchdog but - in the same mould as its infamous “Just avoid holding it in that way” response to what became Antennagate with the iPhone 4 - it appears to be one that cannot last. \nIn short: unless every affected user has already come forward and the China Consumers Association is prepared to make a U-turn on its claims, then the pressure will build on Apple to concede the problem is wider than a two month manufacturing spell on a single iPhone model. \nAnd, quite frankly, if there is culpability then there is a clear and recent precedent that shows admitting it is not commercial and marketing suicide. Last month a Reuters poll on Samsung showed consumers were happy with the brand after the company made a full apology and recalled devices following the high profile Galaxy Note 7 battery fires. \nAfter all everyone makes mistakes, it’s how you respond to them that matters most… \nNote: Apple has been contacted for further comment. This story will be updated if/when a comment is received. \n___ \nFollow Gordon on Twitter , Facebook and Google+ \nMore On Forbes ",

      "text": "Chargers that are not made for Apple devices are not safe, investigators warn consumers . The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), a UK a non-profit that represents trading standards professionals, says the majority of counterfeit chargers are dangerous the BBC reported Friday .  \nCTSI tested 400 fake chargers for Apple devices and found only three of them had enough insulation to protect against electric shocks. The rest failed a basic safety test.\n“Only buy second-hand electrical goods that have been tested and only buy online electrical goods from trusted suppliers,” said CTSI Chief Executive Leon Livermore . “It might cost a few pounds more but counterfeit and second-hand goods are an unknown entity that could cost you your home or even your life, or the life of a loved-one.”\nAnother operation targeted local charity shops, antique dealers and secondhand shops and found 15 percent of 3,019 used electrical goods were non-compliant with UK standards.\nThe operations were conducted by UL, a global independent safety science company. UL applied a high voltage to the chargers bought in eight different countries, including the US, Canada, Colombia, China, Thailand and Australia.\n“Criminals across the globe are using online platforms to lure you in with cheap deals for fake items, many of which are dangerous and have been known to overheat and cause house fires,” said Toby Harris , chair of Trading Standards.\nHow to Keep Yourself Safe \nThe CTSI recommends that people safeguard their family and home from the threatening chargers by using only genuine charger made and licenced for use with device. Overcharging your phone or tablet is also a bad idea. Going to sleep while your device is plugged to the charger and putting in under a pillow or in contact with bedding could lead to fires. Lastly, CTSI recommends that people never use a damaged charger with a cracked case, or worn out cable or a charger that is not working properly.\nHow to Spot Dangerous Chargers: \nCTSI recommends people look out for counterfeit adaptors by looking at:\n1. Plug pins \nMake sure there is at least 9.5 mm between the edge of the pins and the edge of the charger (9.5 mm is about the width of a ballpoint pen). If the distance is less than 9.5 mm there is a risk of electric shock when plugging in and unplugging the charger from a socket.\nPlug the charger into a socket but don’t switch it on or connect it to your appliance. If if doesn’t fit properly then the pins might be the wrong size or length. This could lead to overheating, arcing and mechanical damage in both the socket and the charger.\n2. Markings \nCheck for a manufacturers' brand name or logo, model and batch number. Also check for a CE safety mark. However, consumers should be aware that it can be easily forged.\n3. Warnings and Instructions \nChargers’ instructions should include information on conditions and limitations of use, how to operate the charger safely, basic electrical safety guidance and details of how to safely dispose of the charger when it is no longer required.\nRelated Articles \nApple Cutting Back on iPhone 7 Orders Apple iOS 10.1.1 iPhone Update Has Glitches with Battery and Earpods",

      "text": "Apple Drops Hints About Autonomous-Vehicle Project December 03, 2016, 02:29:00 AM   By Tim Higgins and Tripp Mickle \nApple Inc. took its biggest step toward acknowledging it is working on autonomous vehicles, writing a letter to U.S. regulators offering feedback on proposed guidelines for the emerging technology. \nThe letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offered no details on the project, but said Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \nThe five-page letter, dated Nov. 22, appears on the NHTSA website. It isn't clear when it was posted. \n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nThe letter comes as the Obama administration rushes to put guidelines in place to help guide self-driving development. Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving project had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing and General Motors Co. this year competed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program.

      "text": "iPhone 8 Will Bring Back The Golden Age Of Apple iPhone 8 Will Bring Back The Golden Age Of Apple December 3, 2016 0 iPhone 8 Will Bring Back The Golden Age Of Apple \nThe tech giant Apple is ramping for its biggest iPhone sales success ever next year, according to estimations KGI the new iPhones in 2017, expected to include three new models, which will definitely empower the tech giant Apple’s growth with unprecedented demand. iPhone 8 Will Bring Back The Golden Age Of Apple \nAfter three consecutive quarters in which sales are plummeting iPhone, the iPhone 8 is said to be launched in 2017 will revitalize Apple’s revenue, or at least that’s what the analyst Kuo Ming-Chi believes. \nIn a note sent to investors and collected by 9to5Mac, reliable KGI Securities analyst said that the tech giant “Apple will debut three new iPhones in 2017: one major redesign (colloquially dubbed “iPhone 8″) and two iterative updates to the existing 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus”. \nKuo Ming-Chi, known for his impeccable knowledge on issues of Apple, said the Cupertino giant will sell between 120 million and 150 million units of the iPhone 8 in the second half of 2017, a figure that would mark an unprecedented milestone in the history of Apple. \nThe analyst says the tech giant Apple will generate these record sales thanks to new products and features to be included in their new phones. \nKuo Ming-Chi said that the iPhone 8 OLED display will be the main engine to reach this rumored Apple lawsuit because it is a type of display ever seen on any Apple phone. However, the other two phones will keep the LCD screen, despite having the same design of OLED display and metal that will have the iPhone 8 in August, says Kuo Ming-Chi. \nThe reports also suggest that “wireless charging will feature on all models, making the “less-exciting” devices still very compelling for consumers. The iterative devices will look similar in design to the iPhone 7 but replace their aluminium body with a glass casing, potentially including new cameras and the usual CPU/GPU upgrades”. \nWhile the ability to charge wirelessly will be present in all three models, none could be loaded in this way without a base load to be sold separately, according to Kuo said in an earlier report. What it will be, an iPhone 8 or iPhone 7S ? \nInformation and differences between the three iPhone that Apple will release in 2017 begin to take shape. According to Kuo, the iPhone 8 will be the phone with more interesting design, because its screen will be OLED, will not have bezels or Home button and will have a higher screen size 5.8 inches, unlike the iPhone 7 Plus it is the largest Apple phone available currently which has a 5.5-inch screen. \nThe two iPhone 7S will also have the new design similar to the iPhone 4 glass, but its internal specifications will not be improved too much. An increase in the number of megapixels, as well as increased power in the GPU and CPU, are some of the expected features. ",

      "text": "FarkIt \nYoky Matsuoka, who joined Apple Inc. in May as an executive to help run health technology initiatives, has left the iPhone maker, according to people familiar with the matter. \nMatsuoka was hired to lead teams involved with the company’s HealthKit tracking software, the CareKit tool for managing patient medical care, the ResearchKit framework for conducting medical studies via Apple devices, and related machine learning algorithms. Matsuoka reported to Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who also runs the teams related to the Apple Watch, health research, and fitness applications. \nMatsuoka didn’t reply to an e-mail requesting comment. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nBefore joining Apple, Matsuoka led technology efforts as a vice president at Alphabet Inc.’s Nest Labs. She is credited with developing the technology that helps Nest thermostats automatically adapt to things like environmental conditions and past usage. Matsuoka was a pioneer in robotics, having helped invent a lifelike robotic hand. She is also a co-founder of Google X, the lab that produced Google Glass. Related Apple Inc ResearchKit will enable iPhone users to take part in medical research \nIn recent years, Apple has poured significant resources into machine learning, software that allows computers to analyze and adapt to new data without being explicitly programmed, across its product lines while promoting health and fitness with multiple devices. \nThe company has stocked its health teams with industry experts since before announcing the Apple Watch in 2014. Michael O’Reilly, an Apple vice president in charge of medical research and related technologies, was formerly the chief medical officer at health technology firm Masimo Corp. In 2013, Apple hired Jay Blahnik, a famed fitness instructor and Nike Inc. consultant, as a director of the company’s fitness applications. \nApple is working to expand the iPhone’s health-tracking software into a diagnostic tool, Bloomberg News reported in September. The company’s current application is a repository of data rather than a tool that can analyze and make recommendations based on the information. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook referenced this ambition at Startup Fest Europe in May by comparing the human body to a car. \n“If you need an oil change, it comes on and says check the oil,” Cook said. “It has all of these things in it that alert you that you need to do something. What is the equivalent for the body?” \nApple met with Food and Drug Administration officials this year to discuss future cardiac-related devices and diagnosis applications, according to e-mails obtained by MobiHealthNews through the Freedom of Information Act. O’Reilly told the FDA that Apple is developing “several projects that will be of interest” to the agency, MobiHealthNews reported. \nOther notable Apple departures this year include online retail vice president Bob Kupbens, global marketing vice president Hiroki Asai, and managers on Apple’s autonomous car project.

      "text": "apple iphone issues in china s plus review camera More Something odd is happening with iPhone 6 and 6S devices in China — they’re randomly shutting down, and the Chinese government is not happy about it.\nIt’s becoming such a big problem that the China Consumers Association (CCA) has issued a formal warning to Apple, demanding action from the company. Apple, however, is denying that the issues extend beyond some older iPhone 6S models. The issue has affected a “considerable number” of people, according to Reuters . The devices shut down and do not turn on again, despite the battery still having about 50 to 60 percent of its juice remaining. Plugging in a charger doesn’t help, and reports suggest plugging into a computer is the only way to turn the device back on.\nMore: Apple has begun its massive purge of apps from the App Store\n“In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cell phones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who’ve reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,” the organization says on its website .\nThe CCA is state-approved, but it is not an official regulatory association.\nApple has been having a tough time expanding in China, due to heavy competition from Chinese smartphone manufacturers. In June, the Cupertino, California, company had to stop selling iPhone 6 devices due to complaints by another manufacturer that Apple stole its design . Apple is appealing the decision.\n“After hearing reports from iPhone customers whose devices unexpectedly shut down, we thoroughly looked into these reports, and collected and analyzed devices … We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly,” said Apple in a statement . “After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.”\nMore: China to Trump: Don’t be ‘naive,’ or iPhone sales could suffer\nThe iPhone maker may run into more problems next year if President-elect Donald Trump is set on erecting trade barriers with China. The country has threatened that iPhone sales will “ suffer a setback ” if Trump goes ahead with high tariffs on Chinese imports.\n“None of the previous presidents were bold enough to launch an all-out trade war against China,” according to the state-run Global Times. “They all opted for a cautious line since it’s most consistent with the overall interests of the U.S., and it’s most acceptable to U.S. society.”\nApple seems to be in a standoff with both angry consumers and an angry China Consumers Association, and if it turns out that there really is a serious issue affecting a much wider range of iPhones, Apple could potentially be in for a costly replacement program.\nUpdated on 12-2-2016 by Christian de Looper: Added news about CCA giving Apple a formal warning.\nChina to Trump: Don’t be ‘naive,’ or iPhone sales could suffer Apple may face questions after iPhone 7 Plus reportedly explodes following drop Apple planning a second research and development center in China",

      "text": "AP \nApple's head of special projects Paul Deneve no longer sits within the company's top leadership team, meaning he has stopped reporting directly into CEO Tim Cook.\nApple blog MacRumors noticed on Friday Deneve had been removed from the executive profiles page on Apple's website. \nOn Saturday, Financial Times reporter Tim Bradshaw tweeted that Apple confirmed Deneve is still with the company, but now reports into COO Jeff Williams, who also oversees Apple Watch and its health initiatives . Apple did not elaborate on why the change was made.\nDeneve's LinkedIn profile continues to state he is a vice president at Apple.\nDeneve joined Apple in 2013 from Paris-based luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, where he was chief executive.\nQuite what Deneve has been working on since joining the Apple isn't entirely clear. His former executive bio page simply listed him as \"vice president of special projects at Apple, reporting to Tim Cook\" and he hasn't given interviews to the press or appeared on stage at the company's events.\nHowever, he has likely played a helping hand introducing Apple to the fashion world, particularly with the launch of the Apple Watch, which was quickly adopted by models, designers, and fashion magazine editors.  And while Deneve keeps a low profile, he was recently photographed at the glitzy San Francisco Mid-Winter Gala. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNOW WATCH: This animated map shows where marijuana is legal in the US \n",

      "text": "Apple users who've been receiving a bunch of unwanted Calendar invites lately now have a workaround.\nOver the past few weeks, spammers have been sending many iOS Calendar users invitations to events that advertise shopping deals. With these invitations, users are caught in a catch-22 -- clicking the \"decline\" button on the invitation will continue the cycle of spam by validating the person's email address. The same issue is happening with the iCloud Photo Sharing function, where invitations to view photos or albums are filled with spam messaging. Because both use the invite function synced across iOS and iCloud systems, this kind of spam can't be caught by standard spam filters.\nThe issue arises from the iOS Calendar function that automatically sends any calendar or Photo Sharing invitation to each of those apps respectively, bypassing the user's inbox. This allows spammers to avoid the spam-fighting filters of email inboxes by continually sending messages via calendar or Photo Sharing notification, regardless of whether users accept or decline the invitation.\nApple users have been hitting the forums discussing ways around the issue. The programming forum StackExchange crowdsourced solutions and came up with the following workaround: Using a desktop computer, log into the iOS Calendar function, select \"preferences,\" then \"advanced,\" then switch how invitations are received in the\"invitations\" section by clicking away from \"in-app notifications\" to the\"email to\" option. This will turn off the function that automatically pushes event invitations into the Calendar app and forces them into the regular inbox, meaning that users can delete the invitation rather than being forced to accept or decline it.\nAlternatively, a TechCrunch tutorial recommends creating a new and separate calendar to filter spam events into, just like how a spam filter works in most email inboxes. Unwanted messages can be directed to this new spam-specific calendar by opening the invitation and selecting the new calendar destination, then repeating for all invitations from the spam senders. From there, users can delete the spam calendar invitations without notifying the spammer that their address is valid. The key is to hit \"delete and don't notify\" to make sure that spammers don't receive the message.\nFor Photo Sharing, the only way to fix the issue is by turning off iCloud syncing features, as 9to5Mac explains. Users can navigate to the \"settings\" menu and hit \"disable\" for the iCloud Photo Sharing feature.\n  Business Technology Washington Post",

      "text": "print Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. Drew Angerer/Getty Images \nAn Apple official wrote that Apple is \"invested\" and \"excited\" about autonomous driving software in a recent letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \nIt's the strongest official public sign that Apple is currently working on self-driving car software, an open secret that Apple has never publicly confirmed. \nIn the Nov. 22 letter , Apple Director of Product Steve Kenner wrote that Apple \"is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \nThe rest of the comment in response to recently proposed guidelines by the NHTSA is primarily concerned about the regulation and paperwork surrounding vehicles in the development phase before they are publicly released. \nIn one example, Apple expects that a company testing these kind of autonomous driving features could rapidly iterate \"multiple times within a four-month period.\" \n\"In addition, Apple expects companies may add functionality or change a particular design or function multiple times within a four-month period. This rapid iteration should not require multiple Safety Assessments, which would be a significant administrative burden for both NHTSA and companies,\" Apple wrote. \nThe letter offers several insights into Apple's overall automotive strategy. 'Internal development vehicles ... never to be used by the general public' \nAn unmarked Apple van. Alexei Oreskovic Another priority for Apple is reducing the amount of paperwork it needs to publicly submit to run internal vehicles for development. \n\"To Apple’s knowledge, the [FMVSS] exemption process was intended for, and remains focused on, the sale of new motor vehicles to the public—not on the safe and controlled testing of development vehicles on public roads. However, the Policy suggests that companies must seek an exemption for public road testing of internal development vehicles not fully compliant with FMVSS .\" \nApple's preferred solution? It would like to perform tests without seeking an official exemption, which would slow down the process and possibly reveal secret details of Apple's progress. \n\"While NHTSA does not have the ability to amend the FAST Act, it can amend the Policy to state that exemptions are not required for the controlled testing of internal development vehicles on public roads, provided they will never be used by the general public,\" Apple writes. \nBecause Apple is so secretive, you're unlikely to ever see an Apple autonomous test vehicle on public roads. More likely, Apple is testing them on private courses such as Gomentum Station, in California . The story so far \nApple's current car software, CarPlay. Matthew DeBord/Business Insider Apple's work on an electric car is not a secret. However, Apple has never officially confirmed the existence of a project. Tesla CEO Elon Musk once called it an \" open secret .\"\n\"It's going to be Christmas Eve for a while,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said about the project. \nApple essentially has a separate organization of about 1000 people called \"Project Titan\" working on automotive projects in industrial facilities in Sunnyvale, California and other satellite facilities. \nWhen the project started in 2014, Apple wanted to build a complete electric car as a competitor to Tesla and other automotive companies by 2020. The automotive driving component was planned as a feature for an update. \nThe project hit some snags and there was political infighting in the division. Earlier this year Apple brought on Bob Mansfeld — a long-time respected Apple engineer — who decided to cut back and set new goals. \nNow, Apple is primarily working on autonomous driving software, and taking some interesting approaches, like using virtual reality to test and collect data. \nAt the end of 2017, the company will look at the progress made so far, and figure out what to do with the project, according to reporting from Bloomberg . Venturebeat first reported the NHTSA comment . Read the entire comment:",

      "text": "Tweet \nIt is a couple of weeks since Apple announced a battery replacement program for iPhone 6s handsets suffering with random shutdown issue. At the time, the company gave nothing away about what the root cause of the problem was, but now it has opened up. \nIn a posting on its Chinese website, Apple confirms that the shutdown problems were indeed related to a battery problem. Specifically, the company explains that it was \"a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been\". \nAffected customers are directed to make use of the battery replacement program , but it is quick to point out that the shutdown is actually by design rather than being a fault. Customers are advised that \"an iPhone is actually designed to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extremely cold temperature. To an iPhone user, some of those shutdowns might seem unexpected, but they are designed to protect the device’s electronics from low voltage\". \nExplaining the results of its battery investigation on its Chinese website Apple says : \nWe found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs. As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It's important to note, this is not a safety issue.",

      "title": "Apple to use drones to improve maps data",
      "text": "Apple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said.\nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added.\nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps.\n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year.\nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field.\nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product.\nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents.\nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data.\nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents.\nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations.\nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said.\nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person.\nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise.\nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said.\n---\nBloomberg's Alex Webb and Olga Kharif contributed.\n Technology Bloomberg",

At the time, the company gave nothing away about what the root cause of the problem was, but now it has opened up. In a posting on its Chinese website, Apple confirms that the shutdown problems were indeed related to a battery problem. Specifically, the company explains that it was \"a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been\". Affected customers are directed to make use of the battery replacement program,… [Continue Reading]",

      "text": "Do you remember those bygone days when the iPod was Apple 's pride and joy, and the little white player changed the way we listened to music on the go? I do, and trust me on this, the iPod was a really big deal. But once the iPhone debuted in 2007, the iPod's luster faded fast.\nEnlarge Image iPhone 6S and iPod Classic, which one sounds better?\nPhoto by Steve Guttenberg/CNET I own an iPhone 6S and a sixth-generation 160GB iPod Classic, so I wondered, is the Classic a better-sounding device than my iPhone? Funny, I never got around to comparing them before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The Classic design is nine years old, the 6S has newer and better digital converters, but since it's not a dedicated music player, there may have been design sacrifices favoring the 6S' primary job as a smart phone.\nTo get started, I loaded the same Apple Lossless files into the Classic and the 6S and listened with Audio Technica ATH MSR7 ($250, £199, AU$349), V Moda Forza Metallo ($130, £120; by the way, an Audiophiliac review is in the works), and Etymotic ER4 SR headphones.\nRight away they sounded different -- the 6S was fine, but the Classic was brighter. With indie rockers Alt-J's \"An Awesome Wave\" album, their music sounded a little sluggish over the 6S, and livelier on the Classic. As I continued listening, there was no decisive winner between these two, my opinions changed with different tunes and swapping between headphones . The 6S consistently had a fuller and fleshier balance; the Classic was cooler, but clearer overall. With Antonio Sanchez' hard-hitting solo drumming score for the film \"Birdman\", the Classic unleashed more visceral dynamics, while the 6S flattened them. Still, some listeners might prefer the 6S' softer and sweeter presentation.\nTo up the ante, I hooked up my AudioQuest DragonFly Red ($199, £169, AU$320) digital converter-headphone amplifier to the iPhone 6S' Lightning connector, and the sound clarified, the bass firmed up, the music's dynamics kicked a lot harder, and that transformation tilted the balance in favor of the 6S. Unfortunately, the Classic can't be used with the Red, so for any audiophiles out there clinging to their Classics, it's time to move on.\nEnlarge Image An iPhone 6S, shown with an AudioQuest DragonFly Red, and Audeze EL 8 headphones\nPhoto by Steve Guttenberg/CNET Apple killed the iPod Classic in 2014, but if you want one for nostalgia's sake, you can still find used, new and refurbished 'Pods on the internet. In praise of that old design, I've never found a portable music player easier to use than a Classic, but a lot of music players, including the FiiO X1 Gen 2 ($100, £99), Sony Walkman NWZ-A17 ($300), Astell & Kern Jr ($499, £399, AU$699), or the Cowon Plenue D ($299, £199, AU$429) sound a whole lot better than a Classic or a 6S.\nSo if you really care about the sound of your tunes and have already invested in a great set of headphones don't even bother with a smartphone or an iPod -- buy one of the high-resolution music players I just mentioned. The DragonFly, or another outboard digital converter/headphone amp is also a viable option.\n ",

By: FE Online | Updated: December 2, 2016 9:22 PM Under the new program, it has been said by Apple that iPhone 6S devices made between September and October 2015 have a small issue with the battery but is not a major security problem. (Reuters) \nApple iPhone 6S customers can get their battery replaced and if you want to check if your phone is eligible for the replacement Apple has a new tool. Under the new program, it has been said by Apple that iPhone 6S devices made between September and October 2015 have a small issue with the battery but is not a major security problem. In a page set up by the company, consumers can locate the details of the new program under which there is the new tool which can be checked if the iPhone you possess qualifies for the replacement. \nThe new tool by Apple enables the user to enter the serial number of the smartphone and check it their iPhone is eligible. In a previous post by 9to5Mac, it put out information about the serial numbers on the list. According to that report the 4th and 5th letter of the serial number determined if the phone was qualified for replacement. The numbers were Q3 to Q9 and QC, QD,QF, QG, QH, and QJ. \nAlso read | Meet the iPhone hacker who is building the ‘Google’ of self-driven cars \nIf you have an iPhone 6S and wish to find the serial number, you need to go to Settings>General>About. Go down to the serial number option. Enter that serial number on the Apple Support page and you will know if your iPhone is eligible for replacement or repair. Do remember to check the country code as well while searching for the serial number as it will tell you what needs to be done to replace the phone battery. Apple’s support page is available at apple.com/in/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/ \nAccording to Apple, some of the iPhone 6S devices have been shutting down unexpectedly even when having 30 to 40 percent battery already left in the device. The smartphone starts again only when plugged back in. Apple has said that after examining the device of its eligibility and the fault and then replace the battery free of cost. Interestingly, if your display screen is broken, make sure you pay for that as they cannot replace batteries if the screens are broken. \nWatch what else is making news: \nMake sure you delete all your data before giving the phone for repairing and shut down the ‘Find my iPhone’ option also. Users have also reported about a battery drain issue in the latest iOS 10.1.1 update, as their iPhones have been unexpectedly shutting down even if they have 50 percent charge left. This is happening to the latest iPhone 7 as well, but there has been no word on this from the company till now. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "Comment \"Designed by Apple in California\" is now available in eight countries. iMore. \nThis week, Apple has released its first ever book -- yes, a book that is printed on paper-- to commemorate Apple's achievements in the last 20 years. The book is dedicated to Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs. \nEntitled \"Designed by Apple in California,\" the book's price range is not far off from the company's electronic products. It is currently sold for $199 for the smaller version at 10.20 by 12.75 inches, and for $299 for the larger version at 13 by 16.25 inches. \nAll versions are hard bound, covered in linen, with each page printed on custom-milled-and-dyed paper using low-ghost ink and the eight-color separation technology. Each page is also adorned with matte silver edges. \nThe book contains 450 photos of Apple products within the last two decades, captured by Andrew Zuckerman, the famous American filmmaker, and photographer known for his ultra- real-looking subjects propped up against white backgrounds. \nJony Ive , Apple's Chief Design Officer, says of the book, \"This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years... We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they (the products) exist while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.\" \nSome analysts praise Apple's publication saying the book is a reinforcement of Apple's phenomenal stand today and how humbly it began. Charles King, the Principal Analyst at Pund-IT, a US-based advisory company, says that the new book \"reminds people just how great your products are, thus justifying their happiness and your success.\" \nTim Bajarin, President of Creative Strategies, says that the book is a good way to help people understand Apple's design philosophy, which \"in many ways still sits at the heart of technology and its future.\" \nOthers see nothing special with the publication. As Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University says, \"Companies will occasionally publish books about their history.\" But he adds that the kind of book Apple just published is meant for employees and investors, not consumers. Chiagouris is also critical of the book's price offering, saying that Apple is taking advantage of its millions of die-hard fans who are willing to shell out $299 for a book. \nBajarin sees otherwise, saying that the book can be a resource for design professionals who want to take inspiration in Apple's work. He also adds that the book is intended for a narrow audience. \n\"Designed by Apple in California\" is currently available in eight countries on Apple.com and selected retail stores. ",

But now, the tech giant has finally seemed to publicly acknowledge that there is indeed an Apple car in the works. In early December, a letter from Steve Kenner , Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was discovered, in which Apple offered “comments on the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy.”\nNow why else would the Cupertino company do that unless it had some serious skin in the game?\nIn the letter, which is dated November 22, 2016, Apple notes that it “uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal,” and further, that it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\nMore : Study shows that most knockoff Apple chargers are unsafe\nKenner further noted that when executed properly, “automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without. It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production.”\nUltimately, Apple said, “In order to best protect the traveling public and keep up with the pace of innovation, NHTSA should expedite requests for exemption and interpretation and petitions for rulemaking. NHTSA and Congress should also continue to explore new tools and authorities like those outlined in Section IV of the Policy — including expanded exemption authority — with the goal of fostering innovation, improving regulatory flexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology.”\nAll this seems to suggest in no uncertain terms that Apple knows what it wants, and it’s a future in cars.\n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said Friday. “There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.”\nApple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need to know about ‘Project Titan’ Apple reportedly in talks with self-balancing motorcycle startup Lit Motors Apple reportedly in talks to buy supercar maker McLaren",

      "text": "(Corrects to clarify that Shenmao Technology did not say it bought tin from the Wa mine)\nBy Yimou Lee and Joel Schectman\nYANGON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From a remote corner of northeastern Myanmar, an insurgent army sells tin ore to suppliers of some of the world's largest consumer companies.\nMore than 500 companies, including leading brands such as smartphone maker Apple, coffee giant Starbucks and luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co, list among their suppliers Chinese-controlled firms that indirectly buy ore from the Man Maw mine near Myanmar's border with China, a Reuters examination of the supply chain found.\nThe mine is controlled by the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which the United States placed under sanctions for alleged narcotics trafficking in 2003. The seven companies extracting tin from the mine are all owned or controlled by Wa military and government leaders, Wa officials and people with close ties to UWSA leadership told Reuters.\nThis potentially puts companies, which also include industrial conglomerate General Electric, at risk of violating sanctions that forbid \"direct or indirect\" dealings with blacklisted groups, according to a former and a serving U.S. official and lawyers with expertise in sanctions enforcement.\nSeveral sanctions experts said the U.S. government was unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin. Still, it may force them to shift to new suppliers, they said.\nA Treasury Department spokeswoman said U.S. sanctions \"generally prohibit U.S. companies from engaging in any direct or indirect transactions or dealings with individuals or entities\" on a blacklist, but declined further comment on specific circumstances.\nThe situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex.\nFollowing a 2012 U.S. regulation, companies have spent billions of dollars scrutinizing whether certain minerals used in their products come from mines controlled by armed groups in Central Africa.\nBut the regulations do not require them to assess the origins of minerals from other conflict zones.\nApple, Tiffany and GE, and other companies contacted by Reuters, said that to fulfil those regulations they looked to an audit programme designed by the industry group Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).\nA CFSI programme director said the group was \"aware of tin exports from Myanmar to other countries and of security and human rights issues in Myanmar\". The group said it was updating its audit requirements to include \"a broader definition of conflict-affected and high-risk areas\".\nTin supply chain expert at monitoring group Global Witness, Sophia Pickles, said companies must not wholly outsource due diligence responsibility to a scheme that has exclusively focused on central Africa.\n\"Companies, not schemes, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that supply chains are responsible,\" she said.\nCIVIL WAR\nMost of the tin mined globally is used as solder in electronics, for making batteries and plating.\nThe Man Maw mine roiled the global tin market when huge quantities of high grade ore were discovered around 2013. Annual production is now estimated at about 33,000 tons of tin concentrate, more than a 10th of global output of the metal.\nThe mine is controlled by the UWSA, the strongest of the myriad armed groups that have kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war for decades. Reuters visited the remote mine last month, the first international media organisation to do so.\nInterviews with officials running the mine, UWSA leaders and executives at Asian tin suppliers, together with an examination of public disclosures of suppliers made by companies in regulatory filings, indicate Wa tin likely ends up in an array of products made by U.S. and other international companies.\nTin from Man Maw provides revenue critical to the survival of the self-proclaimed Wa State and its rulers, who have refused to disarm or participate in Myanmar's peace process. \"There are dozens of trucks carrying tin ore to China every morning,\" the head of the Wa territory foreign affairs office, Zhao Guo An, told Reuters. \"Tin mining is the pillar of our economy. It's the biggest source of income.\"\nWhile Washington has lifted most sanctions on Myanmar, some have been kept in place, including those aimed at the UWSA. The group and several of its leaders are blacklisted under the Kingpin Act over accusations of trafficking in heroin and methamphetamine. UWSA leaders deny involvement in narcotics, saying the accusations are a smear by political opponents.\nRead More Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions advisor at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the findings highlighted the need for thorough due diligence.\n\"The facts suggest potential sanctions risk for the parties involved,\" Kucik said.\nThe world's No. 1 tin producer, Yunnan Tin Co Ltd, told Reuters that some tin it bought was from the Wa mine, the source of almost all Myanmar's tin exports.\nMandy Gan, a tin analyst from China's leading mineral research company, Asian Metal, and another tin expert, both of whom visited the UWSA mine this year, said many other Chinese smelting firms supplying global consumer goods makers also bought tin from the Man Maw mine.\nSanctions experts said even the indirect use of the tin might be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions law, which does not require authorities to prove intent. A U.S. government official involved in Myanmar policy consulted on Reuters' findings said the government was likely to investigate any ties to the UWSA.\nStill, Washington-based sanctions attorney Erich Ferrari said it was unlikely the Treasury Department would initiate an enforcement action against companies for an issue so deep in the supply chain. Once the ties were publicized, however, authorities could impose penalties if the companies did not wind down the transactions and find new suppliers, he said.\nSUPPLY CHAIN\nThe chain connecting some of the world's best known brands with a mine in one the most inaccessible corners of Southeast Asia has many links. ((For a GRAPHIC, click on: http://tmsnrt.rs/2giJmcq))\nOne key intermediary is state-owned Yunnan Cultural Industry International (YCII), based in Yunnan, southwestern China, which said in a statement on its website that it enjoys \"a long-term, stable strategic partnership\" with the UWSA statelet.\nYCII declined several interview requests.\nYCII is, in turn, a major supplier of tin to the world's top producer, Yunnan Tin, also based in Yunnan.\nYunnan Tin supplies many companies, including big contract manufacturers such as Foxconn Technology Co. It also supplies major solder makers such as Shenmao Technology, whose clients include Pegatron Corp, another large contract manufacturer. Both Pegatron and Foxconn count Apple among their clients.\nTim Lin, an executive overseeing sourcing at Taiwan-based Shenmao, said about a quarter of its supply of the metal came from Yunnan Tin. While it was possible Yunnan Tin bought tin from Myanmar, sourcing from the country was not regarded as problematic by the audit programme Shenmao follows, he said.\n\"Myanmar is not considered a conflict-affected area by CFSI...As long as smelters present a certified sourcing document, that's acceptable for us,\" said Lin.\nIn the last two years, Yunnan Tin has also shipped more than 12,000 tons of metal to the United States, according to shipment data from U.S.-based trade tracking company Panjiva.\nMore than 500 publicly traded companies in the United States say their suppliers use tin from Yunnan Tin or Yuntinic Resources, its San Mateo, California-based division, according to a review of the supply chain disclosures consumer companies make to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nTwo members of Yunnan Tin's board, vice chairwoman Yang Yimin and secretary and vice general manager Pan Wenhao, confirmed in interviews that a \"portion\" of the company's tin came from the UWSA-operated mine.\n\"We certainly buy tin indirectly from Myanmar,\" Pan told Reuters. \"We don't specifically pay attention to where they source their materials from.\"\nYunnan Tin mixes the Wa tin with metal from mines in central and southwestern China, said Pan, before processing it into products such as tin paste.\nThat means it is impossible to say for certain which shipments from the company contain Wa tin, but Pan estimated Yunnan Tin's purchases from the mine account for about a third of its total annual tin consumption, or at least 16,500 tons.\nApple said in a statement it worked with suppliers to help them meet stringent standards, \"and those who are ultimately unable or unwilling to comply are removed from our supply chain\".\n\"While we have no evidence of illegal tin from Myanmar in our products, we'll continue to investigate, address any issues we find and do all we can to raise standards and protect human rights,\" it said. Foxconn said it \"enforced stringent supplier management requirements in accordance with international and local conflict minerals legislation and has proactively communicated these requirements to our suppliers\".\nIt added that less than 1 percent of its tin was procured from Yunnan Tin, all of which was used in products for a \"single, non-U.S.-based customer\". Pegatron Corp said it carried out \"annual due diligence on suppliers and encourage them to source from validated conflict-free supply chains\".\n\"Pegatron will continue working with customers and international organizations to investigate and source minerals responsibly,\" the company added.\nFROM JEWELLERY TO APPLIANCES\nCompanies that sell consumer products in the United States are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to publish their suppliers of tin and other minerals.\nAmong the companies listing Yunnan Tin, Tiffany said one of its suppliers had indirectly sourced a \"very small amount of tin\" from the Chinese smelter for use in silver solder for jewellery and hollowware.\nThe company added that, as Yunnan Tin was certified as conflict-free by the CFSI, \"use of this smelter by our vendors is consistent with our Conflict Minerals Policy\".\nStarbucks said small amounts of Yunnan Tin metal, sourced from second or third party suppliers, went into the ovens in its coffee shops. The company had received no information indicating it was using minerals from Myanmar, a spokeswoman said, but was pushing suppliers for more detailed sourcing disclosures.\nA GE spokesman said the company strived to use ethical sourcing in its mineral supply chain, adding it had \"noted the concerns raised by Reuters and will address them through our internal process and with our external partners\".\nA spokeswoman from discount retailer Target said in a statement it was \"committed to responsible business conduct\".\n\"We take these allegations very seriously, and we are looking into this,\" the statement said.\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon, JR Wu in Taipei, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Paul Carsten in Beijing and Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong; Editing by Alex Richardson)",

      "text": "Those hoping for another peep under the hood of Apple's mysterious car project are in luck. It's only a peep though.\nIn a November letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , a US government agency that sets and enforces safety standards for vehicles, Apple said it's \"investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation\" and is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nThat's the closest we've come to a public acknowledgement from the company that it's got something in the works regarding self-driving or autonomous vehicles. So far, details about an Apple car effort, supposedly called Project Titan, have surfaced in news stories the company has declined to verify.\nThe remarks could line up with an October report that said Apple has turned away from the idea of building an actual car and instead is focusing on designing the brains required to make a given vehicle autonomous , technology the company could license to carmakers. Given the uncertainty surrounding Project Titan, though, it's impossible to say for sure.\nWhen asked to comment, Apple would say only that \"there are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nSelf-driving vehicles have revved up the tech industry's imagination. Other companies exploring the field include Google, which has been testing driverless vehicles for several years now; Tesla Motors, in the headlines last June and July over a fatality involving the Autopilot system in some of its cars ; and Uber, which showed off its first autonomous car , a Ford Fusion hybrid, this past May in Pittsburgh.\nApple's 5-page letter to the NHTSA is a response to an agency request for public comment on the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy , a document the agency calls a \"starting point that provides needed initial guidance to industry, government, and consumers.\" The deadline for comment was November 22, the date of Apple's letter, but it's not clear when the letter was posted online by the government.\nIn the letter, Steve Kenner, director of product integrity at Apple, talks up the potential of self-driving cars, acknowledges the need for strong safeguards and says safety can be achieved without putting the brakes on innovation.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience -- to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without,\" Kenner writes.\n\"It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.\"\nAmong the main points in the letter:\nWhile ensuring safety, the NHTSA should streamline the process that governs how and when companies can test self-driving cars on public roads; companies should consider the ethical dimensions of autonomous vehicles, including how self-driving cars could affect jobs and impact public spaces; companies should share data on crashes and near misses to improve safety but should adhere to principles designed to \"protect individuals' fundamental right to privacy.\" Here's the letter in full: Share your voice 0 comments Join the conversation",

      "text": "The Apple rumormongers simply won't let talk of an Apple Car die.\nJust months after reports indicated that there was, in fact, no Apple Car on the way, now a new document is sure to stoke the fires of Apple fans' hopes that the company's logo will grace an automobile in coming years.\nSEE ALSO: If Apple is building a car, this is where it may test it\nA letter Apple sent to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in November, surfaced by Venturebeat on Friday, includes passages that indicate the company is interested in being a part of the autonomous automobile movement.\nAddressing the NHTSA's proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy , Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, wrote, \"Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nThat last line is the money phrase: including transportation.\nAlthough a number of reports have told of a secret Apple Car project and automobile industry hires by the company that may or may not have to do with the creation of an Apple car, this is the most direct phrasing from the company indicating an interest beyond dashboard systems like Apple's CarPlay .\n\"[Apple] is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nLater in the letter, Apple makes a number of comments related to automated car safety, innovation and rule making, areas that would seem to go far beyond CarPlay. Sure, Apple has a stake in the automated car industry even it it doesn't make its own vehicle, but such a detailed document, addressing such specific areas makes it difficult to believe that Apple doesn't at least have some ambitions of one day rolling out its own vehicle.\n\"Apple commends the Department of Transportation and NHTSA for facilitating a national conversation about the safe and ethical development and deployment of automated vehicles,\" the letter continues.\n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously.\"\nIn a statement to the Financial Times , addressing the letter, an Apple spokesperson doubled down on the car talk.\n\"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" Apple's spokesperson told the paper on Saturday. \"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nIf these combined statements aren't about a future Apple Car, Apple sure is working hard to sound like it's working on one.\nAs Apple completes work on its new campus with its 20,000-car, solar panel-laden car garage, it's possible that an Apple prototype electric vehicle might already be parked there.\nSo now, let the Apple Car rumors begin anew as we count the months and years Tesla enjoys before having to compete with Apple or, maybe, being acquired by the most valuable tech company on the planet.\nBONUS: Jaguar could become Tesla's closest competitor — with this fancy, all-electric SUV",

      "text": "A lock screen requires you to enter a password or code to resume using the computer. While Apple’s mobile devices offer plenty of lock screen options, Macs tend to stay away from the subject (unlike the new Microsoft computers, which are more lock-oriented). A Mac will lock down automatically if you close the lid, but figuring out how to lock it when you’re stepping away for a moment isn’t as intuitive as you’d think.\nFortunately, there are ways to enable your lock screen and control it with shortcuts and commands. Don’t worry about stepping away from your Mac ever again! Just follow our guide and set up some better security.\nSet a password lock Some Mac devices don’t automatically lock when you put them to sleep. All someone has to do is tap a key, and the computer will pop back on again. This can be a problem if you don’t regularly log out but still want to protect your data! To solve the problem, you have to turn your sleep screen into a lock screen. Fortunately, this is an easy change to make—here’s what to do.\nView photos\nMac Lock Screen More Start by going to System Preferences . You can either search for it, or go to your Apple Menu and select the gear icon. From here select Security & Privacy . When this window opens, make sure that you are in the General section, which should be the first tab. The first section in General is all about your passwords. You will see several checkboxes that can be checked here. The first option says “ Require password after sleep or screen saver begins .” Choose this option. There’s a dropdown menu that allows you to choose when the lock function engages, anywhere from a few seconds to 8 hours. Choose the option that makes the most sense for you—for example, if your screensaver frequently comes on while you’re thinking, you may want the lock screen to wait several seconds before engaging. If you want an immediate lock screen, then choose the “ Immediately ” option. There you go! Two final things to note here. First, since this lock also affects screensavers, you may want to pay a visit to your screensaver settings and make sure that they are acceptable with the knowledge that you will have to type in your password every time it turns on. Second, if you try to make any other changes to your passwords, including changing the time or turn the lock screen off, you’ll need to input the password. Only try this if you know the password for the profile that you’re on.\nMore : Want to erase everything on your Mac?

      "text": "\nGoogle and Apple are now long-time enemies. They continue to fight in the smartphone, tablet, smart TV and wearable markets (among others), but recent rumors suggest they are also taking this fight to the road, where self-driving cars are said to rule in the near future. Today we are getting more solid confirmation the iPhone maker is jumping on the self-driving wagon.\nApple has revealed a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, expressing their position on how self-driving vehicle regulations should be handled in the years to come. While the iPhone maker is not confirming its involvement in the market, the sole fact that they have taken the time to write to U.S. regulators means their interest in self-driving cars is strong. This makes previous rumors much more credible than ever.\n“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” -Steve Kenner, Apple Director of Product Integrity\nThe document goes on to mention matters regarding security, privacy and the benefit of sharing data across companies. Their idea is that companies should share data that could be used to improve all self-driving systems. This would make vehicles more secure for drivers (riders?), as systems could learn from a broader collection of data. But Apple also wants the government to care about privacy, something they should consider when regulating said data.\nApple reportedly abandons ‘Project Titan’ self-driving car plans What’s going on with Apple and McLaren? Apple then goes on to talk about giving a fair chance to newer manufacturers. It seems more established car makers have an easier time testing vehicles in public roads, while newcomers need to go through more obstacles to get a car out there.\n“Both Congress and NHTSA have long recognized that manufacturers need to conduct limited and controlled testing on public roads. In fact, Congress recently enacted a provision in the FAST Act explicitly allowing established manufacturers to test on public roads without pursuing exemptions from FMVSS. But the FAST Act does not provide the same opportunity to new 10 entrants.” -Steve Kenner, Apple Director of Product Integrity\nYou can read the whole letter by downloading the PDF file here . It is pretty interesting to see this new technology making it to the world, especially considering it will be a life-changing experience. Now we just have to wait and see what Apple has for our future.",

      "text": "Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions \nRumors about Apple's ambitions in the transportation sector have circulated for years (AFP Photo) AFP December 04, 2016 San Francisco - \nApple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in a letter asking the government to make it easier to develop self-driving cars. \nThe company is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Apple said in a November 22 letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering Apple's opinion about draft regulations for the sector. \n\"Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously,\" the company's director of product integrity Steve Kenner wrote. \nApple issued the letter because it is \"investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,\" an Apple spokesman said in an email to AFP. \n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" \nRumors about Apple's ambitions in the sector have circulated for years. \nThe company has a separate organization called \"Project Titan\" that is developing automotive projects. \nAlthough Apple has never officially confirmed the project, several of CEO Tim Cook's comments have fueled speculation. \nAfter a $1 billion investment in a Chinese ride-hailing service called Didi Chuxing, he spoke of \"some strategic things that the companies can do together over time.\" \nHowever, in early September, The New York Times reported that the group had narrowed its ambitions, laying off dozens of staff as part of the project's \"reboot.\" \nInstead of designing and producing a complete self-driving car, the group will now concentrate on developing underlying technologies for autonomous vehicles. \nIn its letter, Apple urges the NHTSA not to penalize new participants in the sector by restricting the testing of cars under development on public roads, for which established automakers generally have exemptions. \n\"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" it says. \nApple also encourages data sharing, particularly for accidents, saying that would enable the industry to \"build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone.\" \nMost major auto manufacturers and many technology groups are currently developing autonomous vehicles, considered to be the future of the automobile, along with electric power, with first production models promised for around 2020.

      "text": "Those hoping for another peep under the hood of Apple's mysterious car project are in luck. It's only a peep though.\nIn a November letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , a US government agency that sets and enforces safety standards for vehicles, Apple said it's \"investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation\" and is \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nThat's the closest we've come to a public acknowledgement from the company that it's got something in the works regarding self-driving or autonomous vehicles. So far, details about an Apple car effort, supposedly called Project Titan, have surfaced in news stories the company has declined to verify.\nThe remarks could line up with an October report that said Apple has turned away from the idea of building an actual car and instead is focusing on designing the brains required to make a given vehicle autonomous , technology the company could license to carmakers. Given the uncertainty surrounding the allegedly named Project Titan, though, it's impossible to say for sure.\nWhen asked to comment, Apple would say only that \"there are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\"\nSelf-driving vehicles have revved up the tech industry's imagination. Other companies exploring the field include Google, which has been testing driverless vehicles for several years now; Tesla Motors, in the headlines last June and July over a fatality involving the Autopilot system in some of its cars ; and Uber, which showed off its first autonomous car , a Ford Fusion hybrid, this past May in Pittsburgh.\nApple's five-page letter to the NHTSA is a response to an agency request for public comment on the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy , a document the agency calls a \"starting point that provides needed initial guidance to industry, government, and consumers.\" The deadline for comment was November 22, the date of Apple's letter, but it's not clear when the letter was posted online .\nIn the letter, Steve Kenner, director of product integrity at Apple, talks up the potential of self-driving cars, acknowledges the need for strong safeguards and says safety can be achieved without putting the brakes on innovation.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience -- to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without,\" Kenner writes.\n\"It is vital that those developing and deploying automated vehicles follow rigorous safety principles in design and production. Such principles should not, however, inhibit companies from making consequential progress; there is no need to compromise safety or innovation.\"\nAmong the main points in the letter:\nWhile ensuring safety, the NHTSA should streamline the process that governs how and when companies can test self-driving cars on public roads. Companies should consider the ethical dimensions of autonomous vehicles, including how self-driving cars could affect jobs and impact public spaces. Companies should share data on crashes and near misses to improve safety but should adhere to principles designed to \"protect individuals' fundamental right to privacy.\" Here's the letter in full: ",

      "text": "Apple iCar as imagined by Autocar\n\nLatest news suggests tech giant Apple is talking with US authorities to create a car which will revolutionise personal mobility\n\nBillions of dollars in research operations, more than 1000 developers, mysterious workshops – the Apple iCar looks set to revolutionise personal mobility, bringing with it technologies that promise to alter the way we have traditionally used and perceived the car.\n\nWhile Apple has refused to confirm or deny the project, a letter sent by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner to US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) authorities in November 2016 seems to suggest the project is ongoing. “To maximise the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” says the letter, seen by the BBC, suggesting Apple is trying to pave the way to enter the car market on equal terms with its established rivals.\n\nIn the letter Apple also proposes that car companies share data from crashes and near-misses in order to pool data on autonomous technology and thereby design better systems. However, it also acknowledges that this should only be done if does not breach an individual's privacy.\n\nAutocar understands that behind a heavy veil of secrecy, the Apple iCar has now progressed to what insiders describe as committed project status. Here we outline the electric car every established automotive manufacturer secretly fears.\n\n*The story behind the Apply iCar*\n\nBehind the pre-fabricated aluminium façade of a large building at the rear of an industrial estate in Sunnyvale, California , USA, work is progressing on what could possibly be the most significant car to emerge since Karl Benz’s ground breaking Benz Patent-Motorwagen first introduced the world to the motorised carriage 130 years ago. \n\nThe nondescript factory unit, located at 960 Kifer Road, houses an electric car workshop run by Apple – the US-based electronics giant whose iconic products have revolutionised the way we work, use our free time and converse with one another on a day-to-day basis. Known simply to Apple employees as SG6, the otherwise unremarkable building has been the subject of intense speculation since Sunnyvale city council documents revealed a secretive shell company formed by Apple had leased the site in November 2015.\n\nThe electric car development being carried out at the heavily shielded workshop in the middle of Silicon Valley is treated with the same all-encompassing confidentiality as work being focused on other future Apple products. Precious little about its operations are known outside the tight-knit circle of engineers, software specialists and construction experts posted there.\n\nAnyone who enters the five-acre complex is asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that legally binds them to remain tight lipped on anything they have seen, heard or experienced at the site. Not that many outsiders are invited to visit the facility, which is remarkably plain looking for a company with such an enviable reputation for design excellence as Apple.\n\nThe only hint that activities being run by Apple in Sunnyvale are of an automotive nature is a fleet of Dodge Caravan prototypes that regularly frequent its forecourt, and which have also been sighted at the GoMentum Station, a former naval base in San Francisco with over 20 miles of paved streets guarded by the military that’s often used by car makers for testing purposes. According to automotive industry experts, the modified MPVs, leased by Apple, are being used to test autonomous driving technology, which is thought to be under consideration for the so-called iCar – the name given to what’s being billed as Apple’s next big thing.\n\n*Need to know basis*\n\nAs it stands, no one outside the company knows for sure if Apple, whose market capital is presently ten times that of BMW at a staggering $581 billion as of May 2016, intends to enter the automotive industry with its own electric car or, as has recently been suggested, is simply developing technology to integrate into the future models of traditional car makers. However, with more than 1000 employees from backgrounds as diverse as body-in-white engineering and autonomous software coding, already claimed to be involved of the so-called iCar, many, including the world’s financial community, are clearly betting on the former. \n\nWhen asked about the long-rumoured electric car last year Apple president, Tim Cook, has only added to its mystery, saying, “I don’t have anything to announce about our plans. But I think there’s some significant changes in the automobile industry over the next several years with electrification and autonomous driving. And there’s a need for a focus on user interface. So I think there’s a lot of changes that will go on there.”\n\nIn a more recent shareholder meeting, Cook was again pushed on the subject of the Apple car. His vague reply? “Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve it was so exciting you weren’t sure what was going to be downstairs. Well, it’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while”. This immediately led analysts to surmise that, contrary to earlier indications, development of the iCar was indeed well underway but still some way off.\n\nThose who have held talks with the Apple president during the past 12 months, including executives from Audi, BMW, Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors and Mercedes-Benz are under no illusion of the company’s intentions. They are convinced Cook has already given the go-ahead to the partly autonomous iCar and expect it will be launched by 2021 as a precursor to a fully autonomous successor model to be introduced around 2026 as regulatory conditions are altered to allow features such as fully automated parking.\n\nApple’s goal? An initial 500,000 sales annually, according to those that have met with Cook. That might not sound like much for a company that manages to shift some 230 million smartphones each year. However, it is an acceptable target for a company new to the automotive scene and 10 times what another one of California’s electric car start-ups, Tesla, managed in 2015. As a further point of reference, combined sales of the BMW i3 and i8 totalled just 29,500 last year.\n\nTo ensure wide spread appeal for the Apple car, Cook is relying on the implementation of what automotive business leaders interviewed by Autocar describe as “disruptive technologies” – a term given to features that are expected to significantly change the face of motoring in much the same way the touchscreen altered our use of the mobile phone: highly efficient electric propulsion, rapid charging, autonomous driving capability, gesture control, holographic displays, wireless internet functions, artificial intelligence... the list goes on.\n\nThe iCar will get you from A to B, but it's set to be much more than mere transport for masses. Like the iPhone, it has been conceived to also be a personal assistant with a level of connectivity far beyond that of any existing car of today.\n\nTo achieve this, Apple has already allocated billions of dollars to development programs like the electric driveline program being carried out in Sunnyvale. At the same time, Apple has been active in purchasing technology and patents, either through takeovers or joint ventures similar to that which it recently announced with ride hailing start-up Didi Chuxing, China’s equivalent of Uber. Autocar research also reveals the company is investing heavily in production process management in a move that’s expected to see the iCar introduce a new assembly process that will allow it to be built cheaply yet highly efficiently at a number of different sites.\n\nDespite all the pervading secrecy that surrounds its activities, Apple’s entry into the automotive field is expected to take a similar path to that which has seen it come to dominate the personal electronics field with its iconic design-led products.\n\nFamously founded in garage of former president Steve Jobs’ parents in 1976, Apple wasn’t the first to offer a digital music player in the iPod. Nor was it first to place a smartphone on the market with the iPhone. Neither did it invent the tablet computer with its iPad. It only entered these respective markets once it was convinced it had a product that significantly redefined them, possessed true customer appeal and, although expensive compared to rival products, proved attainable for most willing to sign up to contracts with outside partners.\n\n*Apple iCar battery*\n\nThe expectation is, just like Apple’s popular products today, the iCar will feature a highly contemporary design, high-quality materials and an innovative interface providing a whole new level of connectivity through features such modified versions as its Siri speech recognition, Force Touch and multi-aperture digital camera technology.\n\nWord out of South Korea also suggests Apple has inked an agreement that will allow it to independently develop its own hollow lithium ion battery cells using patented technology from energy storage specialist Orange Power. The hi-tech batteries, which are claimed to provide increased energy density due to unique cooling properties, could be used in combination with highly efficient new-generation electric motors already being tested by Apple at a separate research centre close to its Sunnyvale facility and its own proprietary power electronics in move providing the iCar with zero-emissions compatibility. \n\nBeyond this, there is mounting evidence that Apple is also planning to integrate its own autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and crash prevention technology into the iCar as part of a broader plan that could allow it to form the centre piece of a car-hailing operation through Didi Chuxing.\n\n*The product is king*\n\nOne of the factors driving Apple’s plans for its own car are predictions the growth of digitisation, increasing automation, the rise of connectivity solutions and new mobility sharing models will revolutionise the automotive industry within the next 15 years. A report tabled by McKinsey and Company earlier this year suggests the automotive industry will significantly diversify towards on-demand mobility solutions, creating up to $1.5 trillion in additional revenue in global car sales by 2030.\n\nWhile Apple is yet to official confirm it plans to stretch beyond its current portfolio of products with its own uniquely branded car, one former Apple employee, who has asked to remain anonymous due to confidentiality agreements signed during a period of employment at the company, says the building blocks of such a project are already well-established. “They can say what they like, but they can’t deny the iCar, or whatever they like to call it, is not already under development. Such an enormous undertaking requires huge planning and it can’t be held secret forever,” he says. \n\nAutocar’s source reveals product development is central to operations at Apple, suggesting there is traditional flexibility in the way management signs off on products. “At this stage of development there won’t be a strict timeline, as various departments and developers will be working on solutions to different tasks. As with the iWatch, Apple may well decide to delay the introduction of the iCar if it is not convinced goals are being met.” \n\nWhat is known is for sure that Apple’s president Tim Cook has provided the iCar project with a working title: Project Titan. He has also set about assembling a team of experts from a range of different industries to complete the herculean task of conceiving, designing and developing a car from scratch. While the number of Apple employees working directly on the iCar is currently put at around 1000, this is expected to increase to over 1800 within the next year or so as development moves into top gear.\n\nBacking up reports that the iCar had been upgraded to a “committed project” last September, fully integrating it into Apple’s vast product development operations, Cook has already set about making a number of key changes to Project Titan following an internal review that back in February led to the departure of Apple’s product design boss, Steve Zadesky, who had acted as the head of its secretive electric car operations.\n\nZadesky, a former Ford engineer, had worked on the iPod and iPhone, and was seen as a possible successor to Cook himself. He is succeeded by Apple veteran Bob Mansfield, who has the task of expanding the iCar’s focus more toward autonomous driving in a move that now sees it working both on the hardware and software solutions in-house.\n\nNo stranger to Apple, Mansfield joined the company in 1999 and was one of its leading executives under former founding president, Steve Jobs. After overseeing hardware engineering development of some of the most popular Apple products of the past decade, including the MacBook Air, iMac and iPad, he stepped back from Apple’s day-to-day operations in 2012. Instead of retiring from the scene completely, though, Mansfield was retained by Apple as an adviser to special projects, including the Apple Watch.\n\nIn his new role, Mansfield answers directly to Apple president Cook, unlike his predecessor, who reported to the company’s highly respected hardware boss, Dan Riccio, who in turn reported to Cook.\n\n*Apple icar Autonomous driving*\n\nThis realignment of hierarchy within the Apple ranks is a attempt to streamline development of the iCar after a decision to not only equip it with the latest in electric driveline knowhow but also cutting edge autonomous driving technology by reducing the restraints of vertical management.The allure of working for Apple has attracted many highly regarded people to the Project Titan. Among the more prominent names contributing directly to the development of the iCar is the former development boss at Tesla and Aston Martin, Chris Porritt. Other high profile recruits from Tesla include former senior powertrain engineer, John Ireland; engineering manager, David Nelson; CNC programmer, David Masiukiewicz and driver assistance specialist, Hal Ockerse.\n\nSuch has been the brain drain at Tesla, that its founder, Elon Musk, was moved to comment on the iCar, saying it was “obvious” Apple was working on its own car. “It’s pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it,” he said. \n\nBeyond Tesla, Apple has also hired Megan McClain, a former Volkswagen engineer; Doug Betts, who was previously responsible for quality at Fiat Chrysler; Paul Furgale, an autonomous driving program specialist from the Swiss Institute of Technology in Zurich;*, *Kevin Harvey, previously of Andretti Motorsport; Sanjai Massy, an engineer who worked at Ford; Stefan Weber, a former Bosch engineer who specialises in driver assistance systems; Vinay Palakkode; a researcher from the Carnegie Mello University; and Lech Szumilas, an autonomous driving expert from Delphi and Xianqiao Tong, who rose to promience developing driver assistance system for chip maker NVIDIA.\n\nAlso high on Apple’s list of recruitments are battery specialists, including Mujeeb Ijaz, who previously headed up technical operations at A123 Systems. Joining him are a number of inductive charging specialists, including, Kurt Adelberger, who previously worked for Google and Nan Liu, and is a graduate from the University of Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nMore recently, Apple hired Dan Dodge, who formerly ran BlackBerry’s automotive software division and developed the highly regarded QNX software platform used in a variety of in-car infotainment systems.\n\nWhile there is a heavy engineering and software developer presence within the iCar ranks, it's the design and user interface that is arguably more important to its success. The man responsible for the styling of Apple’s first car, Jonathon Ive, has worked for the company since 1992 and led the design teams for a range of products including the iMac, iBook, MacBook Pro, Power Mac G4, iCube, iPod, iPhone, PowerMac G5 and iPad. A self-confessed car connoisseur, he uses a Bentley Mulsanne as everyday transport and is also the owner of a rare Aston Martin DB4 among other classics.\n\nIve heads a team that includes a number of designers with strong automotive credibility, including Marc Newson, the man behind the Ford 021C concept car. Also on board is Julian Hoenig, who has worked for Lamborghini and Audi, as well as Aaron von Minden, who was involved in the styling of the fabric covered BMW Gina concept car.\n\nIn preparation for its launch, Apple has been active in trademarking and registering possible names for its new car. The internet search agent Whois revealed it registered a number of internet domain names, including apple.car, apple.cars and apple.auto via the company MarkMonitor in January 2016. While the move could simply be to stop opportunists snapping up the names and then selling them on at inflated prices later, Apple has a history of registering domain names shortly before a new product appears. \n\nGround zero for the iCar right now is the workshop at 960 Kifer Road in Sunnyvale. In this Silicon Valley suburb, which is also home to a long established Mercedes-Benz research and development centre among hundreds of ambitious start-up companies, Apple is rumoured to be developing elements of its newest product under the cloak of a shell company called SixtyEight Research.\n\nThe leasing of the 8919m2 site, formerly used by Pepsi as a bottling plant, was first made public by Sunnyvale City Council in March 2016. Since then, no modifications have been made to the exterior of the complex, though neighbours report windows at the rear of the main building on the industrial estate have been blanked out to shield what goes on inside. There have also been reports of rolling test bed equipment being delivered to the site. \n\nThe location of Apple’s iCar development workshop in Sunnyvale is significant as it is just five miles from a former FedEx site at 335 Brokaw Road in Santa Clara that has also recently been leased by Apple. It is also a similar distance from Apple’s headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino.\n\nThe shell company behind the workshop, SixtyEight Research, is as mysterious as the iCar itself. Registered in California in 2015, its limited website presence suggests it is a marketing operation, although many believe this is merely a fictional reference to hide its true role in the development of the iCar.\n\nFurther adding to the intrigue, SixEight Research is named on documentation as being the importer of a 1957 Fiat Multipla 600 from the UK to the US in 2014 – a move that has led to rumours that the production iCar could take the form of an upright one-box MPV-style car similar in dimensions to the Volkswagen Budd-E revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show last January.* *\n\nShortly after the leasing of the industrial complex in Sunnyvale sent internet chat rooms into overdrive over the apparent acceleration of project Titan, further word began to spread within automotive industry circles about a heavily cloaked research and development laboratory established by Apple in Berlin, Germany .\n\nInitial reports suggested the new Berlin site was being used as a testing base for electric motors being sourced from a German supplier, possibly Bosch or ZF. However, the official line from Cupertino sources is the laboratory is being run as part of a strategic operation for Apple Maps – the navigation app that appears set to play a crucial role in Cook’s plans to provide the iCar with autonomous operation.\n\nThe mapping laboratory, which employs around 25 people, was set up following the joint €2.8 billion purchase by Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler of Nokia’s mapping division Here, which by no coincidence is also based in the German capital. Apple’s primary goal? To poach high ranking officials from Here as part of efforts to produce the world’s most accurate mapping app as part of the iCar’s arsenal of new-age technology. \n\nAs secretive as its heavily cloaked development operations are the production plans for the iCar. Looking to establish a business model similar to that of the iPhone and controversial Chinese electronic manufacturer Foxconn, Apple has attempted to court a number of established car makers in recent years with the view towards outsourcing assembly of its new car.\n\nFor a while it appeared Apple may have secured a highly prized partner in BMW. But after Apple boss Cook inspected production of the i3 at a factory in Leipzig, Germany in August 2015, BMW allegedly pulled back on the idea, its newly installed chairman, Harald Krueger, fearing the closeness to Apple may be playing into the arms of a potential future rival by revealing its own production secrets despite telling journalists at last year’s Frankfurt motor show that rumours suggesting the iCar could be based on the i3 as a “nice idea”.\n\nA similar liaison with Mercedes-Benz has also been confirmed by insiders at parent company Daimler, who suggest Apple was interested in entering into a joint venture with the German car maker for the eventual production of the iCar. However, aggressive manoeuvring by Apple officials is claimed to have annoyed Mercedes-Benz boss, Dieter Zetsche, who lashed out at the electronics giant when asked about the company’s relationship with Apple, telling journalists, “We don’t wish to be contract manufacturers like Foxxconn”.\n\nFurther talks with Fiat Chrylser boss, Sergio Marchionne, were subsequently abandoned when it was revealed the Italo-American company had partnered with Google for the development of autonomous driving technology. \n\nWhile it appears to have struck out with plans to attract an established car maker, one plausible line of thinking is that Apple is now looking to commission an automotive production specialist such as Magna to assembly of the iCar. Nothing is official, though it is interesting to note that BMW recently pulled production of the Mini Countryman out of Magna’s Austrian facilities, suggesting capacity has been freed for the production of a new car, possibly the iCar.\n\n*Read more:*\n\n*Is the Google Car in trouble?*\n\n*Apple is holding talks with the interest of buying McLaren - read more here*\n\n*Opinion - why Apple would want to buy McLaren *",

      "title": "Apple confirms it is working on self-driving cars | Technology | The Guardian",
      "text": "Apple , better known for laptops and mobile phones, has admitted for the first time that it is working on technology to develop self-driving cars.\nThe company, which has been rumoured to be interested in the automated car market for the past two years, confirmed its previously secret initiative in a statement to the US highways regulator.\n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” the letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) stated.\nThe letter offered no details of the project, instead highlighting the “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles”, which it described as a life-saving technology, potentially preventing millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year.\nAlthough fully automated cars are not expected to be in use in the UK for several years, trials have already taken place both in Britain and the US. \nThe UK government is keen to ensure the country is at the forefront of a fast developing market that could be worth £900bn by 2025, according to a KPMG study. Earlier this year, ministers launched a consultation on changes to motor insurance rules and the highway code aimed at allowing self-driving cars to be on the roads by 2020.\nThe business secretary, Greg Clark , said at the time: “The global market for autonomous vehicles presents huge opportunities for our automotive and technology firms. The research that underpins the technology and software will have applications way beyond autonomous vehicles.”\nRumours of Apple’s interest in the car market surfaced early last year . Dubbed Project Titan, the internal initiative was reportedly staffed by more than 1,000 engineers and other personnel working at top secret labs in Sunnyvale, California, some of whom were pulled from important consumer product teams. \nBut the letter from Kenner, dated 22 November but which has only now emerged, is the first time the company has admitted it is investing in driverless car technology.\nKenner’s letter leaves open the possibility that Apple will go on to design and produce a car of its own, rather than merely provide its technology to an existing manufacturer. Earlier this year the company was rumoured to be in talks to take over the British car manufacturer McClaren. \n“To maximise the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” Apple writes.\nKenner argues that manufacturers should pool their data as they develop automated systems, to help everyone identify unusual situations or “edge cases” that cars might encounter on the roads.\n“Companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,” Kenner writes. “By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive data set than any one company could create alone.”\nHowever, the letter adds: “Data sharing should not come at the cost of privacy.”\nApple urges the regulator to continue “thoughtful exploration of the ethical issues” of self-driving cars.\n“Because automated vehicles promise such a broad and deep human impact, companies should consider the ethical dimensions of them in comparably broad and deep terms.”\nThe letter says these considerations include privacy, how the cars’ software systems make decisions and the impact on employment and public spaces.\nKenner ends the letter by stating: “Apple looks forward to collaborating with NHTSA and other stakeholders so that the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles can be realized safely, responsibly, and expeditiously.” \nSeveral large tech companies and traditional car manufacturers are already working on automated vehicle technology. Uber has raced ahead of its competitors, deploying Ford Fusions in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which do not require hands on the wheel, as part of the company’s regular taxi service.\nIt is also developing a driverless car in partnership with the Swedish carmaker Volvo.\nThe electric car company Tesla is also involved, although it raised concerns earlier this year about the implications of driverless vehicles after one of its cars using autopilot mode was involved in a fatal crash .\nLast month, a Google self-driving car collided with another vehicle after the latter ran through a red light.",

      "text": "Conflicting rumors of Apple's connected car plans have been swirling for some time. But a new letter written by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sheds some light into the company's plans. In the letter , Kenner writes that Apple is \"excited\" about the potential of automated transportation, and that the company is \"investing heavily\" into machine learning that could support such systems.\nFurther Reading Ford to mass-produce a completely self-driving car within five years \"Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal,\" Kenner states in the letter. \"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\"\nApple states that companies making self-driving vehicles and connected cars should follow \"rigorous safety principles,\" however those rules shouldn't prevent companies from making \"consequential progress.\" Also, the letter emphasizes the necessity of sharing \"crash and near-misses\" data to improve this technology, but that shouldn't compromise user privacy.\n\"By sharing data, the industry will build a more comprehensive dataset than any one company could create alone,\" the letter states. \"This will allow everyone in the industry to design systems to better detect and respond to the broadest set of nominal and edge-case scenarios.... Data sharing should not come at the cost of privacy. Apple believes that companies should invest the resources necessary to protect individuals’ fundamental right to privacy.\"\nToward the end of the letter, Apple makes a point to say that \"established manufacturers\" and \"new entrants\" should be treated equally \"to maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition.\" Otherwise, newcomers may be at a disadvantage since they would have to apply for regulatory exemptions. This comes as big car manufacturers like Ford reveal plans to develop self-driving vehicles in the coming years.\nThe letter does not, however, detail anything about Apple's \"Project Titan\" or any actual vehicle Apple might be working on. Details about Project Titan have been scarce at best, but rumors of Apple's automated car efforts have been mixed . Last year, Apple reportedly had a few hundred people working on the project, but The New York Times recently reported that Apple shut down numerous parts of the project and laid off dozens of employees. The letter doesn't really shed light on specific plans, but it does reveal the nature of Apple's support for automated car technology. While it's uncertain if we'll ever see an Apple-branded car on the road, it is certain that Apple wants to develop self-driving car technology and advance that part of the automotive industry.",

      "text": "Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Apple shows ambition to get into self-driving car race Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. By: Reuters | Washington | Published: December 4, 2016 5:12 AM “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. (Reuters) \nApple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles. \nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company’s most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker’s plans for expanding into transportation. \n“The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote. \n“Executed properly under NHTSA’s guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience – to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.” \nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying “established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.” \nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces. \nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions. \nApple’s letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement. \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” he said. \nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point “safety assessment,” calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators. \nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems. \nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year. \nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc’s Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG , Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co. \nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment. \nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory. \nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a “comprehensive regulatory review” of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration’s guidance on self-driving vehicles.
