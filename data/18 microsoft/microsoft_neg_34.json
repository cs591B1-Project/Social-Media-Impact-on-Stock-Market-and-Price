      "text": "​The United States isn’t really Microsoft’s most successful market in the mobile business and new statistics coming from AdDuplex confirm it, showing that Windows Phone 8.1 continues to be the more popular choice in Redmond’s smartphone ecosystem. According to these stats, no less than 80 percent of all phones running Microsoft’s mobile operating systems are powered by Windows Phone 8.1, while 4.0 percent of them are still on Windows Phone 8.0. As far as Windows 10 Mobile is concerned, its share is only at 15 percent, and as AdDuplex puts it, “this presents a major obstacle in UWP adoption for mobile-first Windows apps.” In terms of devices, Lumia 640 is currently the leading Windows Phone model with a share of 26.2 percent, followed by Lumia 635 with 22 percent. The Lumia 950 is far behind with 3.8 percent, while the XL is not even in top 10. More interesting is that the HTC One M8 with Windows has a share of 3.4 percent in the U...",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nMoves hoped to smooth approval of $26 billion LinkedIn purchase\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft Corp. has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAfter the merger, the people said, rival networks would have access to Microsoft's Outlook add-ins program -- which allows third-party tools to integrate with Outlook -- and Outlook APIs, or application programming interface, which allows discrete programs to communicate with one another. Some of the networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nMicrosoft's Outlook offers email and calendar management.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft (MSFT) would allow for the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn (LNKD) , such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people. In addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE) to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-offers-eu-concessions-over-outlook-access-1479817034).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump calls for day-one executive actions, outlines first 100 days (http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-calls-for-list-of-day-one-executive-actions-outlines-first-100-days-1479775808?mod=mktw).\nMost students don't know when news is fake, Stanford study finds (http://www.wsj.com/articles/most-students-dont-know-when-news-is-fake-stanford-study-finds-1479752576?mod=mktw).\n-Natalia Drozdiak ; 1649ET\n ",

      "text": "Pinterest \nMicrosoft may be working on an emulator that will allow x86 apps to run on ARM powered machines. This doesn’t sound like much, but it could be a signal that the company is laying the groundwork for the long rumoured Surface Phone. \nThe significance of this discovery lie with Microsoft’s Contiuum; which allows apps to run on both PC and mobile devices. At the moment, this feature is only confined to Universal Windows Apps as they need to be designed to work on both architectures. This limitation has held back the deployment of Continuum, which was envisioned as allowing all apps to work across multiple devices. \nInterestingly, the emulated is currently rumoured to be ready for release with the Fall 2017 update for Windows 10; codenamed Redstone 3. Microsoft has embraced a Minecraft inspired naming scheme for its Windows 10 updates. \nReleasing the x86 emulator would bring the possibility of a Surface Phone closer to reality, as it fixes a gap in Microsoft’s plans. However, it is not entirely clear if the company is still interested in making a mobile device.",

      "text": "Microsoft Patches All Windows Versions with October 2016 Security Updates Posted November 23, 2016 in category Uncategorized Comments 0 \nMicrosoft has released a total of 10 safety updates this Patch Tuesday, out of which no less than 5 are rated as important, which includes here an update aimed at Adobe Flash Player. \n1st and foremost, IT admins should really prioritize the deployment of MS16-118, which can be a cumulative safety update for World-wide-web Explorer. All versions of the browser which might be still supported by Microsoft are targeted by this patch, and also the firm says that a successful exploit could bring about an attacker gaining the identical rights because the logged-in user. \nThis involves getting the target pc to load a specially crafted webpage hosting code to exploit the vulnerability, so customers whose machines aren’t but patched should really stay clear of clicking on links coming from unknown or untrusted sources. \nJust like World wide web Explorer, Microsoft Edge is also getting a cumulative safety update with MS16-119. The aforementioned information and facts is valid right here too, with Microsoft saying that Edge customers really should avoid suspicious links for the reason that crafted web pages may be the only way for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. \nMS16-120 is known as a security update for buy microsoft software online element which resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, .NET Framework, Office, Skype for Enterprise, Silverlight, and Microsoft Lync. Buyers of any of these solutions must steer clear of links and documents that they do not trust, and Microsoft explains that 1 solution to cut down the dangers of exploits is lowering user rights to standards and removing administrator privileges. \nMS16-122 really should be prioritized because it patches flaws in Microsoft Windows, in line with the official documentation offered by Microsoft. This update is labeled as vital at the same time. \n“The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if Microsoft Video Handle fails to effectively deal with objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code within the context of your present user. Nonetheless, an attacker ought to first convince a user to open either a specially crafted file or perhaps a plan from either a webpage or an e-mail message,” the business explains. \nAnd final but not least, there is MS16-127, which can be the crucial safety update for Adobe Flash Player that’s also delivered by way of Windows Update. Flash Player comes pre-installed in Edge and Online Explorer, so Microsoft is updating it by way of Windows Update whenever Adobe releases patches too. \nMethod reboots will probably be needed when installing these updates, so IT admins ought to save perform on computers exactly where the whole pack is deployed just before initiating the course of action.",

      "text": "Microsoft Patents Tech That Makes the Windows 10 Lock Screen Extra Personal Posted November 23, 2016 in category Uncategorized Comments 0 \nMicrosoft has patented a brand new technology that tends to make it possible for the lock screen to become a additional private space, displaying sensitive data that you simply wouldn’t otherwise want other individuals to become able to see. \nThe lock screen could be the part of your operating system that virtually every person can see with out even logging in with their credentials, but Microsoft has identified a technique to make use of the lock screen inside a more personal way. \nWorking with biometrics, Windows 10 could sooner or later be able to provide users with access to private data around the lock screen, the patent reveals. Particularly, a new security technique would be in a position to let you easily authenticate and get access to a customized lock screen which would include info which you select to show. \n“If it can be determined that the measure of self-assurance satisfies 1 or extra criteria, then individual details associated using the user is selectively rendered to the lock screen whereas the computing device is in the locked state,” the patent explains. \n“If it determined that the measure of confidence does not satisfy the 1 or additional criterion, then such personal facts could be suppressed from the lock screen. The foregoing method may well also be applied to selectively supply or deny access to particular functionality in the computing device by way of the lock screen.” \nIf this technology ever makes it to our computers, then the lock screen can turn out to be a more beneficial replacement to the desktop, giving us with rapid access that would only be readily available right after logging in. For example, sticky notes or messages can be displayed directly around the lock screen without the need of us getting to supply our usernames and passwords. \nFor the moment, yet, this is nonetheless in patent stage, and it could take a though until it really is integrated in office 2010 standard , but it’s extremely clear that Microsoft is currently looking into solutions to maximize the complete prospective of every tiny OS feature. Such as the lock screen, that is definitely.",

      "text": "Microsoft Exploring Edge Browser Demand on iPhones and Android Phones GO Firm trying to find out how many people want Edge on non-Windows systems, including rival mobile platforms Nov 23, 2016 07:41 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft is working at full speed on making Edge browser a better rival to Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, but it’s no secret that adoption of its app is impacted by exclusive availability in Windows 10. Redmond, however, might be looking into ways to address this problem, and is now exploring the demand for Edge browser on rival mobile platforms, including Android and iOS. Fahad Al-Riyami, who is a Technology Strategist at Microsoft, is asking users on Twitter to vote if they want to see Microsoft Edge browser on Android and iOS, linking to a post on Microsoft Community forums where this request was originally posted. The forum post dates back to August 2, 2015, which is only a few days after Windows 10 was officially introduced, but in the meantime, it reached 5 pages of discussions because of users who asked Microsoft to bring Edge browser on Android and iOS. Microsoft: No plans to bring Edge on non-Windows platforms Back in 2015, Microsoft clearly said that Edge would remain a Windows 10-exclusive for a while, pointing out that there were no plans to bring the browser to older versions of Windows or Android or iOS. The company explained that it wanted first to get Edge right on Windows and then explore other possibilities, such as rolling out a mobile version of the browser for Android and iPhone users. Furthermore, Microsoft also discussed the possibility of bringing browser extensions on Windows 10 Mobile devices, saying that this was indeed part of their Edge expansion plan, admitting however that it could take more time to do it because of the screen size and the battery impact. Edge is definitely evolving, and the upcoming Creators Update is projected to bring even more browser features, but its future beyond Windows is not yet known. Microsoft seems to be considering bringing Edge on non-Windows operating systems, but for the moment, it’s all just an idea.",

      "text": "4K streaming is still in its infancy for the most part, but companies like Netflix are pushing the new resolution especially when it comes to own productions.\nBut Netflix 4K streaming is quite demanding: First, you need a monitor or TV that supports the 4K resolution.Then you need a fairly speedy Internet connection, and the right plan on Netflix that enables support for 4K streams on top of that.\nIf you want to watch 4K on your television, you furthermore need it to support that through native apps, or have a device connected to the TV that supports 4K streaming.\nMicrosoft announced recently that the company's own Edge browser is the only web browser out there that supports Netflix 4K streams.\n\nWhile that may be interesting for those of you who use a 4K monitor when they work on their computer, it is the following requirement that may torpedo the availability of the viewing experience significantly.\nYou may only watch Netflix in 4K using Microsoft Edge if the computer is equipped with an Intel 7th generation Kaby Lake processor.\nKaby Lake was officially announced on August 30, 2016 but shipments to OEMs and manufacturers began in the second quarter already.\nEven recent devices, take Microsoft's new Surface Book for instance, are not equipped with a Kaby Lake processor yet. There are not many PCs out there just yet that ship with a Kaby Lake processor.\nThis leaves users who bought the CPU individually, for instance to upgrade an existing PC or build a new rig instead. But Kaby Lake processors are not readily available on the majority of PC hardware shopping sites either.\nThe situation will get better over time, but it seems unlikely that many Windows 10 users will be able to enjoy the Netflix premiere of the new Gilmore Girls season in 4K glory.\nMicrosoft Edge is also the only browser out there for Windows to support 1080p streaming on Netflix. All other browsers on Windows support up to 720p playback only.\nMicrosoft noted on top of that that Edge is also the browser to pick on mobile devices, as it offers better battery performance than other browsers. The company bases this on tests that it ran recently comparing the battery live of Edge to that of Chrome, Opera and Firefox . Google and Opera Software tests came to other results however, so take this with a grain of salt.\nIf you are one of the lucky few whose system meets all the requirements, enjoy!\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post 4K Netflix in Browser?

      "text": "Microsoft Apologies For Dead Rising 4's Racial Grunt 22 Add Comment \nXbox just sent an email to its users to promote the upcoming release of Dead Rising 4 on Xbox One and Windows 10 PC. Doing that, anyway, it causes an uproar about possible racist content, but what really caused that is very... weird. I mean, it's really hard to see racial content in such promotional email, even though Microsoft already issued an apology about that. \nBasically, the email included a zombie saying \"NNNGGGHHHHAAAA\", which, apparently, someone thought could be re-built into a racial insult to many of the Xbox users. Major Nelson was instantly notified about that and issued an apology on Twitter: \"Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time.\" Advertisement \nThey say it's all publicity whether it's good or bad, but in this case, with such big companies being very careful about never offend nor insult any share of their audiences, it's surely something Microsoft needed to take a stand and clarify immediately. They did it. And we still don't understand how can you read a racial insult into a zombie grunt. Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time. — / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 22, 2016 More about",

Data alerts are a recently released Power BI feature, which allow you to be notified whenever a tile on your dashboard meets a particular criteria. With this new connector, you can combine the power of Power BI data alerts with the hundreds of actions available for Flow to take meaningful actions. For example, you can send an e-mail to a Security Group with the value of the alert. Post to a Slack channel with a link to the tile. Create a card in Trello based on the alert name.\nData alerts are fully synchronized across platforms; set and view data alerts in the Power BI mobile app for iPhone, Power BI mobile app for Windows and in the Power BI service. They are not available for Power BI Desktop.\nRead more about it here .",

(Reuters) US President Barack Obama awarded the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom – the highest civilian honour in the United States – to 21 key figures at a star-studded ceremony at the White House on Tuesday.\nObama presented the prestigious medal to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda for philanthropic work, former basketball players Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and actors Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro and Robert Redford.\n“It’s useful when you think about this incredible collection of people to realize that this is what makes us the greatest nation on earth,” Obama said.\nThe medal is given annually to those who have made outstanding contributions to the national interests of the United States, to security, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavours.\nOther recipients this year were rock star Bruce Springsteen, soul singer Diana Ross, Native American community leader Elouise Cobell and NASA moon landing computer scientist Margaret H. Hamilton.\nTV talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, who was also awarded the medal, conducted a “mannequin challenge”, a video that features people frozen in place, with the recipients.\nObama leaves office in January after eight years, with Republican businessman Donald Trump taking charge.",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nThe safeguards would, for example, allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business professionals' network XING, into an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week.\nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 10:06 ET (15:06 ",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft Corp. has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAfter the merger, the people said, rival networks would have access to Microsoft's Outlook add-ins program -- which allows third-party tools to integrate with Outlook -- and Outlook APIs -- or application programming interface, which allows discrete programs to communicate with one another. Some of the networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nMicrosoft's Outlook offers email and calendar management.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in bidding for LinkedIn, has pressed for publicly. No outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. Regulators in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil have cleared the acquisition.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the concessions on the acquisition last week. Following the submission, the EU extended its deadline to Dec. 6 to complete its review of the merger. That could be extended further if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also available on other social-media sites, such as Facebook Inc., and that Facebook in particular should be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nHowever, Salesforce continues to press for regulatory scrutiny. \"We believe this deal raises significant antitrust and data privacy issues,\" said Burke Norton, Salesforce's chief legal officer.\nMr. Norton wrote in an October blog post that the issue is not whether Microsoft allows other service providers to integrate their offerings with its products and services, but \"the much richer and irreproducible interactivity data, or metadata, to which Microsoft alone will have access.\" Microsoft's exclusive access to that information, Salesforce contends, will confer an unfair advantage over competitors.\n--Rachael King contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 13:28 ET (18:28 ",

      "text": "  23 screenshots A simple to use Microsoft Office add-in that allows you to import, analyze and export data, as well as to generate detailed reports IMPORTANT NOTICE OfficeReports is a powerful Microsoft Office add-in that enables you to collect and analyze data from multiple sources. The add-in allows you to append the data, by modifying tables, entries and to generate detailed reports on the whole data set or focusing on specific categories. You may inspect each variable individually. Useful Office add-in OfficeReports is a reliable tool when it comes to handling large amounts of data imported from several types of sources. The add-in supports extracting data from files created with Microsoft Excel, SPSS , Triple-S, SurveyMonkey, as well as from an OfficeReports database. You can easily select the segments you wish to view or edit, by selecting the variables form the tree structure. Additionally, right before importing the data, you may append the structure, by adding new intervals or categories. You can fill these new entries with data from other variables, by merging two or more categories, as well as creating a custom variable. After loading the desired data into the specific Microsoft Office application, you may operate several modifications and generate reports. Detailed report creator and data exporting Once the data is loaded into the editor, you may create benchmarks, apply filters, create a report template, as well as edit the data in the tables. You may render the values and variables as a chart, a grid chart or as multiple graphs. The ‘Edit Selected Table/Chart/List’ is dedicated to appending items created with OfficeReports. Moreover, you may easily export the data to several file formats, for further editing. You may export it to a specific OfficeReports window, or to other formats that are compatible with SPSS, Excel or SurveyMonkey. In other words, the add-in allows you to prepare the database for survey generating. Report and survey editor OfficeReports is a useful tool for users who work with large amounts of data and who create multiple reports daily. The Microsoft Office add-in allows you to edit data tables, as well as create your own information sets, by entering the values or to analyze the entries as percentages/numbers. Additionally, you can easily generate a report that reflects the entire data set or only the selected fragment. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS LIMITATIONS IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION 14 days trial You cannot create charts or tables You cannot edit infographics The Filter function is not available The Text List function is not available You cannot generate reports",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Takes Digt Apple; Claims Surface Made Two-in-One Category Popular Nadella in a recent interview took jibe at competitors He added that Surface has been popular in two-in-ones Nadella added that Microsoft will remain in phone market \nMicrosoft's Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella in a recent interview took a jibe at competitors while talking about the popularity of Surface devices. Nadella said the Surface made the two-in-one PC category popular. \nTalking to The Australian Financial Review, he said, \"I mean, take even Surface. Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster but it's actually a two-in-one.\" \nNadella indirectly pointed to Cook's comments back in 2012 about two-in-one devices. Cook claimed that the hybrid devices came with \"too many trade-offs\" as pointed out by CNET. Not too long ago, Nadella was claimed to be more popular among his employees as compared to Steve Ballmer with an approval rating of 88 percent at the end of 2015. The company CEO in the interview claimed that Microsoft is not afraid to take risks. \"The key in any momentum we have is that you have to have some amount of boldness in taking risk, and knowing that you are not always going to get it right.\"\nAdding further, he said that the Redmond giant is not working on a product just because a competitor is doing better in that category. \"We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" added Nadella. \nOn Microsoft's presence in mobile space, he stated, \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" \n\"There are a few companies that are at the cutting-edge of AI, in whichever way you look at it,\" Mr Nadella said. \nHe also touched upon artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered bots becoming the next interface that can shape interactions with the help of apps and devices . \nNadella confessed that some companies are ahead of Microsoft in AI. \"There are a few companies that are at the cutting-edge of AI, in whichever way you look at it.\" \nBut he stressed that Microsoft has the best capabilities around speech recognition. \"But when you just look at the capability around speech recognition, who has the state of the art? Microsoft does ... What is the state of the art with image recognition? Microsoft again, and those are not subjective they are judged by objective criteria,\" he said.",

The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft has offered to allow rivals to access Outlook add-ins to display profiles from social networking sites other than LinkedIn. Microsoft is also reportedly allowing PC makers like Dell and HP to disable a LinkedIn shortcut that’s packaged on the desktop of some machines.\n\nMicrosoft originally released its social connector for Outlook as a separate add-on around seven years ago, allowing Facebook, LinkedIn, and Windows Live contact integration into Outlook. The connector is now built into recent copies of Outlook, and it largely serves as a way to integrate...",

      "text": "Tweet \nRacism is something that’s in the news a lot at the moment following Donald Trump’s election victory and the rise of the alt-right. The unfortunate side effect of all this is companies occasionally get criticized for doing something that isn’t the slightest bit racist, but could be viewed as such, if you chose to do so. \nCase in point, a day or so ago Microsoft sent out a promotional email for Dead Rising 4 with the subject heading \"NNNNGGGHHAAAA\". That’s a zombie groan right? Nope, apparently, it’s the N-word. \nSome people saw the email heading and got offended, as people seem to do these days, and criticized Microsoft for the racial slur. \nInstead of saying, \"You’re all idiots, it’s a zombie groan\", Microsoft did the modern thing and apologized, even though there was nothing to apologize for. \nXbox’s Larry Hryb aka Major Nelson tweeted this response: Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time. \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 22, 2016 \nFor the most part, the comments following the tweet are complaining that Hryb felt the need to apologize for something that isn’t offensive, and rightly so. \nPeople will see what they want to see. Racism is seen everywhere these days, even where it doesn’t exist. Should Microsoft’s marketing department be criticized for not realizing that someone somewhere might interpret \"NNNNGGGHHAAAA\" as a racial slur? No. Should Microsoft apologize for something that -- at worst -- was an innocent mistake, but which, in truth, is just the sound of a zombie hungry for brains? No. \nWe should stand against racism in all its forms, and fight against it wherever it arises, of course we should. But similarly, we should stand against idiots who get offended about everything, even innocent onomatopoeia.",

Simpson: American Crime Story , among others. \nLastly, for all the audiophiles out there, the company is allowing customers to buy music albums for $0.99 each, which equates to discounts of up to 93% in some purchases. \nWith that being said, most of these deals expire within the next 4-7 days, so if you're considering purchasing any of the discounted content, now's probably the best time to do so. You can view all of the deals in the Windows Store by navigating to the \"Black Friday Deals\" section. Tags",

      "text": "\nIn today’s Ask the Admin , I’ll look at why Microsoft has discontinued EMET and how Windows 10 mitigates many of the threats that EMET was designed to counter.\n \n \nMicrosoft last released an update to its free Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) for Windows in January, but has since decided to retire the product. EMET was born out of Microsoft’s Trustworthy Computing initiative, a project designed to increase trust in the company’s software at a time when privacy and security issues in Windows were threatening to taint Microsoft’s reputation. With gaps of 3 to 4 years between major OS releases, EMET was needed to defend organizations against zero-day vulnerabilities.\nTo learn more about EMET, see What’s New in Microsoft EMET 5.2 on the Petri IT Knowledgebase .\nEMET was successful in protecting users between Windows releases, but there were also drawbacks. As a bolt-on solution, the protection techniques were not as robust as those built-in to the OS, which led to hackers finding ways to bypass EMET relatively quickly. The protections provided by EMET could lead to performance and reliability issues in applications, due to the low-level access required that was used in ways the OS wasn’t originally designed for. And finally, EMET didn’t keep pace with developments in Windows, and although Microsoft supports EMET 5.5 in Windows 10, the protections weren’t always as good as those now integrated into the OS.\nWindows 10 – Software-as-a-Service It shouldn’t come as any surprise that Microsoft has stopped developing EMET. Because of how Microsoft now ships Windows as a service, it’s possible to build the latest defense mechanisms into the OS and have them shipped to customers in a timely manner. Additionally, many of EMET’s security features were designed to protect customers using Internet Explorer (IE), and while enterprises will continue using IE for legacy applications, Windows 10 has a new default browser, Edge, that was designed with security in mind from the get-go. Windows 10 also includes security features, such as Device and Credential Guard, that make the OS more secure than previous versions of Windows when used in an enterprise environment.\nFor more information about Windows 10 Credential Guard, see Windows 10 Enterprise Feature: Credential Guard on the Petri IT Knowledgebase .\nMitigation technologies previously built in to EMET — such as DEP, ASLR, and Control Flow Guard (CFG) — are built in to Windows 10, and there are also new features to help stop hackers bypassing User Account Control (UAC) and exploiting browser vulnerabilities.\nSponsored Microsoft will support EMET 5.5 until July 31 , 2018, but believes the best way to deliver a secure OS in the modern era is to update Windows on a regular basis to make sure mitigation technologies are not an afterthought but integrated into the OS.\nThe post Microsoft Retires EMET Security Tool appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffman\nA Wall Street Journal report claims that Microsoft has offered to open up Outlook to rivals in order to win European Union approval of its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. This change does not address the complaints of Salesforce.com, however.\nCiting “people familiar with the matter,” the publication says that Microsoft’s concessions all concern Outlook, the software giant’s email and personal information management solution, and not an explicit promise to let rivals access the treasure trove of user data in the LinkedIn social network.\nSalesforce.com lost out on its own bid to acquire LinkedIn and has since mounted a furious campaign to convince antitrust bodies around the world to prevent Microsoft’s acquisition. Key to this complaint is an unfounded claim that the Microsoft deal will “stifle innovation,” a key phrase aimed at raising the eyebrows of antitrust regulators.\n“If Microsoft gains ownership of LinkedIn, the company will have the ability and incentive to use LinkedIn’s one-of-a-kind dataset to enhance its own products, while preventing competitors from accessing and effectively utilizing that same data,” Salesforce.com chief legal counsel Burke Norton wrote in a public plea . “The result will fundamentally change the marketplace in a way that will be harmful to consumers. Even more damaging, Microsoft could end up stifling future innovation in the market at large by further extending to the cloud the same monopolistic position upon which Microsoft has built its traditional franchise.”\nThe Salesforce.com complaint also hints at why the Microsoft concession involves Outlook rather than opening up LinkedIn’s data. In its complaint, Salesforce.com notes that the biggest problem with Microsoft’s LinkedIn acquisition, from an antitrust perspective, is that it will allow the software giant to improve not just its own CRM solutions, but also existing dominant businesses such as Microsoft Office, of which Outlook is a key component.\nSponsored “This is a familiar pattern with Microsoft,” Mr. Norton claims, citing 20-year-old business practices that Microsoft used to harm long-gone competitors such as Netscape. “Microsoft Office controls over 80 percent of its market because Microsoft bundled its products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook) with Windows to exclude competitors and make it harder for new ones to enter the market. Adding LinkedIn data to its data pools would allow Microsoft to extend its existing Office and Windows monopolies further into enterprise software markets. Indeed, Microsoft’s own people are foreshadowing this turn of events.”\nLeaving aside the fact that Microsoft has never bundled Office with Windows, it’s fair to say that fears of Microsoft using 20-year-old business tactics today—with a CEO that is twice removed from the days of Bill Gates—are completely unfounded. And yet, while it’s not completely clear from the Wall Street Journal’s description of the EU concessions, it does appear that Microsoft is striving to overcome such worries.\nAccording to the report, will allow social networks that compete with LinkedIn to have the same access to Outlook that LinkedIn will enjoy. They will do so via “Outlook’s add-ins program,” which allows third parties to integrate with the application at a fairly deep level. Some social networks already use this technology to integrate with Outlook, as it turns out. And in the most recent generation of these solutions, such add-ins can work in Outlook on Windows and Mac, in mobile Outlook apps, and in Outlook on the web for both consumers and businesses.\nThis in no way addresses the Salesforce.com complaint, of course.\nSponsored The ability to integrate rival social networks into Outlook will give those services equal footing in that Microsoft solution, yes. But that will also benefit Microsoft, as it simply makes Outlook all the more desirable as the central location that integrates users’ various social networks. And Salesforce.com, which doesn’t own such a network, will not benefit. Nor will it be sure it can access LinkedIn data in its own solutions.\nBut the concession does still address a key need: With regulators in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa having already approved the deal—Microsoft says it does not require regulatory approval in China, Japan, and South Korea—the EU is the only regulatory agency standing in the way of the acquisition. And EU antitrust laws tend to focus more on competition than on consumer harm. So allowing rivals services the same access as LinkedIn within Outlook could indeed be enough to push the deal through. Assuming, of course, that they’re not listening to the increasingly strident pleas from Salesforce.com.\n \nThe post Microsoft Offers Concessions to EU to Win Approval of LinkedIn Acquisition appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Betting Big On Quantum Computing, Focusing Approach On Topological Qubits 23 November 2016, 9:00 am EST By Kalyan Kumar Tech Times Microsoft has unveiled big plans to tap the commercial market of quantum computers and announced the formation of a core team to carry out research into topological qubits. ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nBetting big on quantum computing, deemed as the future of computing, Microsoft has spoken out its intent to tap the commercial market with the roll out of quantum computers using topological qubits for delivering unprecedented performance. \nThis was outlined in the official Microsoft blog , which talks about \"investing in the real, scaleable quantum computers for solving real-world problems.\" Boosting Cloud Computing \nMicrosoft strategy is multi-pronged and it thinks a foray into quantum computing will indirectly boost its share in cloud computing as well as address the challenges in areas of medicine and environmental issues where AI solutions are being tried. \nThe new plans also mark a move away from the Station Q laboratory from where the bulk of Microsoft's quantum computing related work is concentrated. \nThis also endorses the line advocated by Michael Freedman, who is heading Station Q that Microsoft must try topological mathematics as a way for moving qubits. \nThat implies shifting gears from theory to practice as seen in the decision to absorb researchers as Microsoft employees under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence and Research Group. It manages Microsoft's research into AI and will embed breakthrough products in existing platforms like Office 365, or incorporate them into Azure cloud offerings. Why Qubits? \nMicrosoft has made the focus explicit — qubit, which is the unit of quantum information. These are building blocks for multiple solutions in quantum in contrast to the existing sequential computers. \nHowever, in accomplishing the commercial roll out, there are too many hurdles to overcome. First of all, cold environments are a must for the devices to ward off adverse external influence on the system's quantum state. \nAmong the virtue of topological qubits, prime is the ability to withstand heat or electrical noise and the stay in a quantum state for a longer time. That makes it outstandingly practical and effective. \n\"A topological design is less impacted by changes in its environment,\" Microsoft official Todd Holmdahl said . \nAs Microsoft is aiming to build a quantum computer, the software to run the same is also a top priority. That is to make sure that the system can solve complex problems from day one. Microsoft's Core Quantum Computing Team \nHolmdahl will be leading the Quantum Computing project with a mandate to create the required hardware and software. \nAccording to analysts, the choice of Holmdahl makes sense given his extensive involvement in the development of projects like Xbox, the HoloLens and Kinect. The common factor is they all started out off as research projects and turned into consumer products. \nGiving a serious dimension to the quantum foray is the hiring of two prominent quantum computing scientists. \nCharles Marcus, a senior professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at Copenhagen and Leo Kouwenhoven, a distinguished professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Multidisciplinary Workforce \nMarcus noted that there is a need to get over the hump and create machines that never existed, and it is imperative that the way of doing business must change. \n\"We need scientists, engineers of all sorts, technicians, programmers, all working on the same team\" he added.

The CDN offers developers a global solution for delivering high-bandwidth content by caching the content at physical nodes across the world.\nMicrosoft yesterday announced the general availability of token authentication with Azure CDN. This feature is available in the Azure CDN from Verizon Premium offering. Even existing Verizon Premium customers can take advantage of this new feature. Token-based authentication is a great tool to handle authentication for multiple users. Main benefits of token authentication include:\nEasily scalable, no need to store user login information on the server. Mobile application ready solution. Provides security, each request must contain the token and after the token expires user needs to login again. Prevents attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF, also known as session riding).

      "text": "Sony and Microsoft just released new versions of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Plus, all the new fall games are out, and you’ve probably already fallen behind on the latest and greatest. Black Friday is a perfect time to upgrade your gaming gear, with deals on hardware, games, and more. \nWe’ve gone through the array of deals out there to find the best of the best whether you’re looking for a new consoles, new controllers, or new games, so you can spend less time reading advertisements and more time playing. \n(Note: We try to list the “regular” price of an item, which is usually the MSRP — manufacturer’s suggested retail price. The actual going rate of a particular model may be far below that, so it never hurts to comparison shop.) \nThe best gaming deals of Black Friday \nIf you’re a PlayStation 4 fan, you’re probably looking at either a PlayStation 4 Slim or the new, 4K-gaming enabled PlayStation 4 Pro.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Outlook not syncing? Microsoft says it's rolling out a fix after lengthy disruption Microsoft has been having email issues for just shy of a week. A fix is finally rolling out, but will it tell customers what went wrong? \nThousands of users around the world have been reporting Outlook.com syncing issues on Down Detector. Image: Down Detector \nMicrosoft has been having issues with Outlook.com for the past week, but the company says it's found a fix, which it's currently deploying. \nA mystery bug has prevented Outlook.com users from accessing or syncing their accounts from apps and smartphones since last Thursday. Six days on since logging the issue, Microsoft today said it's rolling out a fix that should soon resolve the connection problems for users. \n\"We've completed the fix and are deploying it throughout the affected environment. While the fix is being deployed, some users may begin to access and synchronize their Outlook.com accounts while using applications or mobile devices,\" Microsoft says on an Office 365 status page . \nFor those who still can't sync their accounts with mobile devices, the company is recommending they log in to Outlook using a web browser, which is exactly what many users have been forced to do for the past week. \nIt's not clear from Microsoft's posts what the root cause of the issue is, nor why it's taken so long to close the report. However, Microsoft noted on Wednesday that it was deploying the fix to \"affected infrastructure\". \nDown Detector's heat map suggests most issues with Outlook are being reported by users in Europe. \nThe site's comment section has also piled up with nearly 10,000 reports that match Microsoft's description. Many users report being been unable to access Outlook from apps on iOS and Android for the past two to three days, but others report issues syncing since last Thursday. \nSome are also reporting Hotmail has been unavailable for several days, while others say the disruption is also affecting the Outlook client on desktop. \nZDNet has asked Microsoft to shed light on the cause of the syncing issues and will update the story if it receives a response. \nOutlook has been undergoing a major migration since 2015 as part of Microsoft's effort to align Outllook.com with its Outlook client. \nHowever, as of April 2016, it had migrated less than half of its 400 million Outlook.com accounts . It was also moving Outlook.com to Office 365's more modern infrastructure, and rolling different groups across to the new system in separate batches. \nIt's unclear whether the migration has been completed yet. Readers from Thurrot.com in August reported receiving a notification from Microsoft that it was currently upgrading Outlook.com and that it would complete its Outlook migration in the first half of 2017.

      "text": "(Michael Ainsworth/AP) \nMicrosoft Cortana — a virtual assistant picking the winner of every NFL game on Bing — had its best week of the season in Week 11 , going 11-2 in outright picks to bring its overall record on the year to 92-67 (57%). \nCortana's two losses came by picking the Bengals, who fell at home to the Bills, and the Chiefs, who lost in K.C. to Tampa Bay. Still, it was a nice week from Cortana, who has overall been streaky this year. All the while, FiveThirtyEight's ELO model remains well ahead of Cortana, at 98-59 (62%). \nThis week, which features no byes and three Thursday games because of Thanksgiving, sees Cortana and Vegas disagree on just one match-up. Vegas inexplicably likes the Chargers on the road in Houston, whereas Cortana gives the Texans the edge. Elsewhere, Cortana gives the Patriots a very nice 69% chance to beat the Jets, and, in the best game of the week, the Broncos a 53% edge over the Chiefs. \nAs always, Cortana only picks the outright winner of each game. It does not make picks against the spread, though we like to include the point spread (in parentheses, courtesy of Vegas Insider ) for comparison. You can find Cortana's predictions by searching \"NFL schedule\" on Bing (picks made prior to the Thursday night game). \nHere are Cortana's Week 12 picks: \nMinnesota Vikings at Detroit Lions (-2) — Lions 63% chance to win Washington Redskins at Dallas Cowboys (-7) — Cowboys 72% chance to win Pittsburgh Steelers (-9) at Indianapolis Colts — Steelers 55% chance to win San Diego Chargers at Houston Texans (+1.5) — Texans 64% chance to win Tennessee Titans (-5) at Chicago Bears — Titans 55% chance to win Jacksonville Jaguars at Buffalo Bills (-7.5) — Bills 78% chance to win Cincinnati Bengals at Baltimore Ravens (-4.5) — Ravens 55% chance to win Arizona Cardinals at Atlanta Falcons (-4) — Falcons 64% chance to win San Francisco 49ers at Miami Dolphins (-8) — Dolphins 79% chance to win Los Angeles Rams at New Orleans Saints (-7) — Saints 67% chance to win New York Giants (-7) at Cleveland Browns — Giants 72% chance to win Seattle Seahawks (-5.5) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Seahawks 64% chance to win Carolina Panthers at Oakland Raiders (-3.5) — Raiders 64% chance to win Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos (-3.5) — Broncos 53% chance to win New England Patriots (-8) at New York Jets — Patriots 69% chance to win Green Bay Packers at Philadelphia Eagles (-3.5) — Eagles 66% chance to win NOW WATCH: New doping tests are stripping Olympians of their medals — here are the countries that dope the most \n\nMore From Business Insider \nA scary scene hit the NFL as Luke Kuechly was carted off the field in tears after suffering another apparent head injury \nNFL WEEK 11: Our official predictions for who wins this weekend \nMicrosoft Cortana has made its picks for Week 11 of the NFL",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft website) Microsoft has been rumored to launch a Surface Phone that operates on Windows 10 Redstone 2 in the first quarter of 2017. \nThere has been scarce information regarding the much-awaited Microsoft Surface Phone. However, new reports reveal that it will finally be launched next year along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. \nGadget enthusiasts have been waiting for Microsoft to release its flagship smartphone, which could potentially rival the top smartphone makers, Apple and Samsung. A lot were expecting an October launch or even after that. However, less than two months from now, 2016 is coming to a close and there are still no signs of the Microsoft Surface Phone. \nAccording to reports , the Microsoft Surface Phone will redeem the less-impressive smartphones that Microsoft had released in the past. It is expected to boast of impressive specs and features. To top it all, it may run on the upcoming Windows 10 operating system's highly anticipated update for handheld devices, the Redstone 2. \nApparently, the Microsoft Surface Phone will also be the brand-new smartphone line outside of the Lumia branding. There have been rumors that in 2017, the phone will also be introduced along with the launch of the new iteration of the tablet-laptop hybrid device called Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The tech giant has not released any confirmation on this yet, but there are speculations that both devices may be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 in February. If not, at least, any time in the first quarter of next year. Advertisement \nThere are also reports saying that the mystery Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 is engineered not only by Microsoft but also by Hewlett Packard (HP). The upcoming device may retain Lumia's positively received technologies like the Glance and ClearBlack. However, these rumors should be taken with a grain of salt, unless the company confirms it. \nAs for the specs, there are speculations that the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will be powered by the Snapdragon 830 processing chip. It will also be boasting brand-new security features since it is targeting the business and enterprise sectors of the market.  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Needs To Learn How To A/B Test 11/23/2016",
      "text": "Microsoft made another email blunder on Monday when it sent an email promoting \"Dead Rising 4,\" the fourth installment of a zombie apocalypse game planned for release on the Xbox One gaming console in early December.\nThe email subject line attempted to imitate the moaning of the undead with the phrase “NNNNGGGHHHAAAA,” but instead was interpreted by many on social media as a racial slur.\nThe technology giant has since apologized for the mishap on Twitter, where the company’s PR representative Larry Hryb wrote: “Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time.”\nThis is not the first time Microsoft has sent insensitive promotional email content. In July, Microsoft found itself in hot water after an email sent from a Microsoft University Recruiter encouraged interns to get “lit,” or intoxicated, on a Monday night.\nThe email also referred to the recipients as “bae,” a term of affection often reserved for a significant other as it is a shortened version of \"babe\" or \"baby.\"\nIt would appear that Microsoft has yet to learn the importance of A/B testing, a critical juncture of email marketing campaigns that can help safeguard brands from such cultural no-nos. A/B testing, or split testing, is the practice of comparing two versions of the same email (or web page or mobile application) to see what version elicits the highest and most positive engagement rates. \nWith A/B testing, marketers can test a wide variety of email components to optimize conversion rates, including the recipient’s name, subject line, email frequency and the amount of content within the body of the email itself. Jordie van Rijn, an email marketing specialist and blogger at emailmonday.com, provides a list of 150 different ways to A/B test an email.\nA recent study of more than 300 email marketers representing brands with more than 100 employees by Clutch reveals that only 23% of marketers incorporate A/B testing into their email marketing campaigns.",

      "title": "InPage Zero Day Used in Attacks Against Banks",
      "text": "Microsoft Patches Zero Day Disclosed by Google November 8, 2016 , 2:57 pm \nResearchers at Kaspersky Lab today disclosed the vulnerability after a number of attempts to privately report the bug to InPage were ignored. \n“We have informed the vendor of the affected software of the existence of the vulnerability, but have received no reply, while the attacks continue,” Kaspersky Lab said in a statement. “We have also informed the Indian CERT and received the reply that the organization’s specialists are looking into the issue.” \nKaspersky Lab said it’s possible a number of criminal or nation-state actors are using this exploit since it has recorded several different attacks against banks in Asia and Africa, as well as others targeting government agencies. The exploit is spreading via phishing campaigns, and was discovered during a separate investigation in September. \nIt was then when Kaspersky Lab researchers found a file with a .inp extension that was analyzed and found to contain shellcode inside a Microsoft OLE file, a file format that has been used in a number of Office exploits dating back to 2009. The researchers detected a number of different payloads and command and control servers used in the respective attacks. A list of C2 servers and indicators of compromised has been published as well. \nKaspersky Lab’s analysis of some of the emails shows that the attackers used other exploits using .rtf and .doc files in conjunction with the InPage exploit. The attacks dropped different versions of particular keyloggers and backdoors on victims’ machines. The vulnerability in question is in a parser in the main InPage module. \n“The parser in the software’s main module ‘inpage.exe’ contains a vulnerability when parsing certain fields,” Kaspersky Lab said. “By carefully setting such a field in the document, an attacker can control the instruction flow and achieve code execution.” \nThe shellcode found in the document first looks for certain patterns in virtual memory space before launching a decoder that obtains an instruction pointer and decrypts the next stage of the attack. At that point, a downloader grabs and executes the payload. \nKaspersky Lab researchers said the attacks are similar to attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the Hangul Word Processor against government targets in South Korea. Researchers at FireEye last year found such an attack and linked the payloads and command and control infrastructure used to North Korea . \n“Despite our attempts, we haven’t been able to get in touch with the InPage developers,” Kaspersky Lab said. “By comparison, the Hangul developers have been consistently patching vulnerabilities and publishing new variants that fix these problems.”",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/ Xbox) Shown in photo are the various Xbox consoles over the years \nMicrosoft's Xbox Project Scorpio is being positioned to be a lot better than Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro as the former will support 4K resolution. It has now become one of the most sought after and highly anticipated releases for 2017. \nXbox Project Scorpio is reportedly capable of running video games at 4K resolution, something that the PlayStation 4 Pro is unable to do according to reports . This feature of the upcoming gaming console just might propel it ahead of its greatest rival in the market. \nSony and Microsoft have been in a fierce competition over the years when it comes to their respective consoles. \nEvidently, Microsoft believes that the birth of Project Scorpio will pave the way for next generation consoles and will signal the end of traditional consoles produced by the company. Advertisement \n\"We think the future is without console generations,\" said Aaron Greenberg, head of Xbox games marketing in an Engadget interview. \"We think that the ability to build a library, a community, to be able to iterate with the hardware – we're making a pretty big bet on that with Project Scorpio. \"We're basically saying, 'This isn't a new generation; everything you have continues forward and it works.' We think of this as a family of devices.\" \nPrior to the announcement of the Xbox Project Scorpio, Microsoft released an update version of the Xbox One known as the Xbox One S. Its closest competitor, Sony, subsequently released the PlayStation 4 Slim and the PlayStation 4 Pro. \nThe PlayStation 4 Slim created quite a stir among gaming enthusiasts because of its lightweight design and its more affordable price compared to the Xbox One S. The Slim version is priced lower than $300. \nThe Project Scorpio console is going to be released in the holiday season of 2017. Microsoft's previous launches took place around November so it is highly likely that eager players can get their hands on the new gadget by then. \nPhil Spencer , head of Xbox, announced on his Twitter account last August that the upcoming console already started production.

      "text": "Posted on November 23, 2016 by Brian ( @NE_Brian ) in General Nintendo , News | 0 Likes \nEach time Xbox boss Phil Spencer is asked about Nintendo, he offers nothing but praise for the company. That was no different when AusGamers recently sent a question his way about the big N. \nSpencer actually started out by mentioning how he’d “love to see Mario on Xbox.” He also believes “Nintendo has the strongest first-party of anybody”. Spencer later added, “they’ve been incredibly important for the games industry, they do a great job with younger audiences, and if we ever had a chance to work with them in the future, I would absolutely do it.” \nWhen asked if seeing Nintendo franchises on Xbox was something the team could look at seriously, Spencer fully stated: \n“I’d love to see Mario on Xbox. As someone who’s been in this industry and played games forever, I’ll still say it: Nintendo has the strongest first-party of anybody. They’re just fantastic and the memories that they have instilled in so many of us, who’ve played their games and had those delightful experiences, having those on Xbox would be great. Obviously we have Minecraft on Nintendo and when that opportunity came up to work with them on Minecraft, you know, some people might look at it and say ‘why would you even do that?’, but with Nintendo, it’s been a great partnership on Minecraft. In fact they put Mario in Minecraft on Wii U with the mash-up skin pack. And continuing to work with them on that and building a stronger relationship… I mean if that paid dividends down the road that lead to something else, that would be fantastic. I know I get questions all the time on would I ever like to see Banjo in Super Smash Bros. and I’m, like, “yes, I would do that in a second”. And certain people think I’m saying that as some sort of PR answer and I’m, like, why wouldn’t you? \nAnyway, I’m a big Nintendo fan and I think they’ve been incredibly important for the games industry, they do a great job with younger audiences, and if we ever had a chance to work with them in the future, I would absolutely do it.”",

      "title": "ownCloud Now with Plug-in for Microsoft Outlook",
      "text": "November 23, 2016 at 10:00 AM EST ownCloud Now with Plug-in for Microsoft Outlook \nColorado Springs, CO, November 23, 2016 --( PR.com )-- A new plug-in for Microsoft Outlook means that ownCloud users can now send their files easily and securely, even when sharing entire folders. Instead of attachments, the plug-in automatically adds links to the corresponding file in ownCloud, without the user having to change his normal workflow. The plug-in is fully integrated into Outlook, easy to use, and works with secure SSL encryption. Integrated split functionality also offers an added layer of security. It ensures that the link to the files and the password needed for downloading them are automatically sent separately. To facilitate proactive virus protection, all the data is checked for malicious software prior to being deposited on the sender's ownCloud server. In view of the current security problems caused by crypto viruses, many companies are already implementing protocol to prevent sending or receiving attachments by email. The ownCloud Outlook plug-in provides a simple and safe alternative to those limits, which in no way restricts users at a company, and still offers a maximum in security. The Outlook plug-in was originally developed by BW-Tech GmbH as an extension to its own ownCloud-based file sharing solution epiKshare. Following the necessary customizations, the plug-in is now available for all ownCloud users. Under this link , both subscription and community-based users of ownCloud can download the plug-in and try it out first for 30 days free of charge. English and German versions are available for Microsoft Outlook 2010, 2013, and 2016. Holger Dyroff, CEO of ownCloud GmbH in Nuremberg, views the plug-in as an important addition to the platform: \"Outlook is still the default solution for emails, calendars, and tasks at many companies. With the new plug-in, we are opening up a new dimension in secure email-based file sharing for the more than ten million ownCloud users. Many Microsoft Exchange operators have explicitly asked us for an Outlook plug-in. Thanks to our partnership with BW-Tech, we are now able to make one available for the market!\" Further advantages of the plug-in benefit ownCloud users who frequently transfer large amounts of data or send out mass mailings. Since only the links and access data for the downloads are sent, size limitations do not need to be observed on the source or destination mail servers when using the plug-in. At the same time, network traffic and the memory load on the mail and file server are reduced, thus significantly lowering costs. The option available for setting a time limit for accessing the files or folders is viewed by Frank Böttcher, COO of BW-Tech GmbH, as an important additional advantage of the plug-in: \"The sender decides whether he wants to set a time limit for accessing the files or folders or not. The default access time has no limit set, but he can also enter an expiry date, after which the data can no longer be accessed.\" The ownCloud plug-in for Outlook costs $5.50 per user per year.

      "text": "\nSAP has recently announced that Microsoft is adopting their HCM solution SuccessFactors. Microsoft will use SuccessFactors to provide HR services and improve employee engagement among its 114,000 full-time employees. Instead of using custom solutions based on its own Dynamics AX HCM features, Microsoft has decided to go with SuccessFactors. SuccessFactors is the global leader in cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software. Its human capital management application suite integrates onboarding, social business and collaboration tools, a learning management system (LMS), performance management, recruiting software, applicant tracking software, succession planning, talent management, and HR analytics to deliver business strategy alignment, team execution, and maximum people performance to organizations of all sizes.\nWhen asked about their decision to go with SAP SuccessFactors, Vivan Mirchandani, senior director, Business Operations at Microsoft gave the following reply,\n“While Dynamics 365 has a robust enterprise offering, key modules in [the] scope of the implementation, including succession planning and learning, are not part of our current offering, given Microsoft’s business needs and requirements, it makes sense to partner with a company that extends our cloud platform and integrates with our ecosystem.”\nLast month, Microsoft and SAP announced their expanded partnership to provide public cloud services for the SAP SuccessFactors HCM Suite. SAP’s cloud -based HCM solutions will be made available on Microsoft Azure over the next five years. It is the first time SAP is offering its SuccessFactors solutions in a third-party public cloud.

      "title": "Pale Moon profile backup tool",
      "text": "Pale Moon profile backup tool is a free program for Microsoft Windows devices to backup and restore Pale Moon browser profiles.\nThe program was designed to make the back up and restoration process as easy as possible. All it takes to do either is to launch the program and click once or twice in the interface to run the process.\nPale Moon, just like Firefox, uses a profile-based user system. Each user profile contains is an independent configuration for the browser that includes customizations, extensions, themes, browsing data, bookmarks and more.\nPale Moon profiles are stored under C:\\Users\\Martin\\AppData\\Roaming\\Moonchild Productions\\Pale Moon\\Profiles on modern versions of Windows. This is not the case however if a portable copy of the web browser is used.\nPale Moon profile backup tool  \n\nThe Pale Moon profile backup tool has two caveats when it comes to its functionality: it does not work with portable versions of the web browser, and it does not work if custom profile locations are used.\nThe single reason for that is that the tool does not ship with options to set a custom user profile path.\nTo use it, download the program from the official Pale Moon website and run it afterwards.\nThe interface displays backup and restore buttons prominently. You may want to check the options on first start. There you will discover that compression is enabled by default, and that the backup tool will only keep one backup per day by default. You can disable the second option by unchecking the overwrite backups option.\nThe second option that you have is to set a different backup paths. The default backup paths stores all profile backups in the PM backup folder of the Documents folder.\nOther than that, it is just a matter of hitting backup to back up the profiles, or restore to restore the profiles using a backup.\nThe backup process backs up all profiles found in the default profile location that Pale Moon uses. Restore likewise restores all profiles of the selected date.\nClosing Words Pale Moon profile backup tool is mostly designed for users who don't use other means of backing up their profiles. The thing that it has going for it is that it is portable and really easy to use.\nThe downside is that it will always back up all profiles, and that it does not work with custom profile locations or portable versions of the browser.\nIt is easy enough to back up Pale Moon profiles manually as well. The easiest option is to simply copy the profile or profiles, and store them in another location.\nYou can use sync software or backup software for that to assist you in the process.\nNow You : Do you back up your browser profiles?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Pale Moon profile backup tool appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "It was back in June last year that Microsoft confirmed that Oculus Rift owners will soon be able to play Xbox One games on the headset. Xbox One owners would have the ability to stream their games to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. It has taken more than a year for the company to actually make this happen because it has only just now confirmed when Oculus Rift Xbox One game streaming is going to go live. Microsoft confirmed last year that Xbox One owners will be able to stream games to Oculus Rift and even use their Xbox One controller to play them. No specific games were mentioned back when this announcement was made and it also wasn’t revealed how many games would receive support for streaming to the Rift.\nThe company has now announced that Rift owners will now be able to stream their Xbox One library to the Rift by using the new Xbox One Streaming to Oculus Rift app. Some of the most popular games like Halo 5: Guardians , Forza Horizon 3, Gears of War 4, and more will be supported. Additional titles will get support for streaming to Oculus Rift next year.\nThe new Xbox One Streaming to Oculus Rift app will connect to the console via the home network. Once a connection has been established, the console’s video output will be streamed to the Rift headset and projected on a massive screen that users can view in three immersive virtual reality environments. To be clear, the games themselves won’t be VR, you will just play them on a big screen in a VR environment.\nThe Xbox One Streaming to Oculus Rift app will be available for free from the Oculus Store starting December 12th.\nFiled in",

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo 1/2 left right A Microsoft logo is seen a day after Microsoft Corp's $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn Corp, in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo 2/2 \nBRUSSELS EU antitrust regulators are set to give conditional clearance to Microsoft's ( MSFT.O ) $26 billion takeover of professional social network LinkedIn ( LNKD.N ), three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. \nAs part of the EU approval, the U.S. software company will make some minor changes to concessions submitted last week following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said. \nThe deal, Microsoft's largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robin Emmott) Next In Technology News",

      "title": "Xbox One Games Can Be Played On Oculus Rift Starting December 12",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft had promised that Xbox One games would be playable on the Oculus Rift headset in a sort of cinema mode, not dissimilar to Sony’s Cinema Mode on PlayStation VR for even regular PS4 games. Now, we finally know when this functionality will be made available- starting December 12, Xbox One owners will be able to stream their Xbox One library to Oculus Rift headsets.\nNow, it is important to remember that playing a standard game in VR does not make it a VR game- in fact, it just replicates the experience of playing it on a gigantic screen. Moreover, the experience is likely to not be as effective as if the game were being played locally, simply because streaming will introduce some latency, and latency in VR can be detrimental to the experience.\nStill, until Microsoft’s native VR strategy comes into focus with the launch of the Scorpio next year, it looks like this is the best that Xbox owners can get. It’s a neat little bonus, if nothing else.",

The description says this is a \"brand-new, unused, unopened and undamaged item in original retail packaging.\" \nRelated: Best Black Friday deals UK \nThere's no doubt the Surface Pro 4 is one of the best tablet hybrids you can buy, with top performance, solid battery life, and an untouched version of Windows 10. \nWe reviewed the core i5 version of Microsoft's high-end hybrid, with 8GB RAM and found it provided stellar performance, and we're sure the 4GB variant will manage to maintain the speedy user experience. \nThe tablet was so impressive when we used it, we concluded Microsoft had produced \"the best Windows tablet ever made.\" \nOver at Amazon, the customers are raving about the Surface Pro 4, too, with one remarking: \"It is by far the best device I’ve owned and I could go on for quite a while about how great it is.\" \nBUY NOW: Surface Pro 4 for £629 at eBay.co.uk \nAnother says: \"Best screen I have seen up there with the best clear sharp and we'll saturated. Full OS Windows 10 works a dream. Surface pen is brilliant works really well with one note. Fan is very quiet and does its job. Easily a laptop replacement. Best 2 in 1 on the market.\" \nSo there you have it, what are you waiting for? \nLet us know if you go for the deal in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "Microsoft is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday.\nMicrosoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn’s lnkd rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition.\nThe second plank of the concession is important because of the company’s battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros.\nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue.\nThe deal, Microsoft’s msft largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nHowever, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens’ worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users’ privacy.\nThe deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce .com crm , which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it.\nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment.\nAuthorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions.\nThe bulk of LinkedIn’s $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.",

      "text": "\nThe Xbox One Scorpio is going to be the most powerful console ever made- Microsoft have shouted that fact from the rooftops to ensure that we get it, and at this point, we do. But even knowing that, the simple fact that Microsoft mandate parity with standard Xbox One systems does raise the question of whether or not that power can ever be put to good use.\nAccording to Thomas Grip of Frictional Games, who have brought us the excellent SOMA and Amnesia: Dark Descent , and who are currently working on the Amnesia Collection for PS4, there is still a lot that that power can be put to use for, even if gameplay parity is mandated.\n“I think there is still a lot to be done,” Grip said, in an interview with GamingBolt. “As long as the biggest difference for a more powerful machine is not in gameplay-related stuff (such as map collision RAM use), then you can easily tweak. For instance you can make simpler lighting, and so on. This is what you do for most PC Games already.”\nThoughts on Grip’s comments? Let us know in the comments section below.",

      "text": "Obama Pokes Fun at Bill Gates as He Awards Him Presidential Medal of Freedom The Microsoft co-founder and wife Melinda were honored for their significant philanthropic work. \nU.S. President Barack Obama jokes with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates before presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 21 Americans during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House. Image credit: Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images Gene Marks November 23, 2016 \nYou know you’ve made it when the president of the United States teases you about your lack of game. \nThis week, 21 luminaries from multiple industries -- including Ellen DeGeneres, Michael Jordan, architect Frank Gehry, Diana Ross, Tom Hanks, NASA engineer Margaret Hamilton and Bill and Melinda Gates -- were awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the United States’ highest civilian honor. \nRelated: This Is Bill and Melinda Gates' Prediction for the Future of Online Education \nPresident Obama opened his remarks at the White House by joking about the genesis of the Gates’ relationship. \n“We came close to missing out on Bill and Melinda Gates’s incredible partnership because apparently Bill’s opening line was, 'do you want to go out two weeks from this coming Saturday?' He’s good with computers, but you know… Fortunately Melinda believes in second chances and the world is better for it,” Obama said. \nCiting the couple’s tireless work to provide medical care, education, clean water and a safe and healthy environment to millions, the president commended the pair of “impatient optimists” for their continued fight to improve the world. \nPres. Obama presents Bill and Melinda Gates with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. https://t.co/0eXXKsdH3I https://t.co/omMFVGOm6N — ABC News (@ABC) November 22, 2016 \nFounded 16 years ago, today the Gates Foundation has a presence in all 50 states and more than 100 countries and is responsible for providing $36 billion in grants. \n\nNina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "text": "81 shares \nMicrosoft hasn’t had much luck when it comes to smartphones. Windows phones are a tiny part of the market, even though Microsoft continues to advance its mobile OS, and there have been a handful of flagship devices . \nBut CEO Satya Nadella isn’t ready to give up. If anything, it seems he’s approaching the market with newfound vigor. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review , he says Microsoft will “continue to be in the phone market, not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” ",

Yesterday, some users started reporting that they were unable to access Outlook.com, while some reported that they weren’t able to sync their Outlook email accounts on their mobile devices. As it turns out, this issue has been affecting users for at least a week — according to Microsoft’s status page for Outlook , the firm started looking into the “potential problem” which prevented users from accessing their Outlook.com email on the 17th of November.\nThankfully, Microsoft has finally found a fix which is currently rolling out to users. If you were affected by this issue, you should be able to regain access to your Outlook emails — if not, just wait a few hours and this should be fixed. On the status page for Outlook.com, Microsoft stated:\nWe’ve completed the fix and are deploying it throughout the affected environment. While the fix is being deployed, some users may begin to access and synchronize their Outlook.com accounts while using applications or mobile devices.\nInterestingly enough, Outlook’s status page still states that the service is “having issues” — which will likely get updated once the fix for the syncing issue is fully rolled out to users. While Microsoft didn’t reveal what exactly caused this issue, our guess is that it might be related to the rollout of the new Outlook.com experience .\nMicrosoft engineers will provide another update on this issue at 8:30 PM UTC (that’s 20:30 GMT), and we’ll make sure to update this article if there’s anything noteworthy.\n",

      "text": "Looking for a new excuse to stare at your phone all day during Thanksgiving?\nMicrosoft today announced that the Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now out for iOS and Android as a free app. Microsoft’s version of the single-player card game has become iconic, since it has long come built-in with the Windows operating system. I certainly have a lot of memories wasting time on my dad’s Windows 95 PC with Solitaire. The Solitaire Collection has reached more than 119 million unique players in the last four years, according to Microsoft.\nThe Solitaire Collection, which is already available on Windows 10 and Windows 8 devices, also comes with the card games Spider Solitaire, Pyramid, FreeCell, and Tripeaks. While technically free, the app has in-game ads that you can disable with a premium purchase. However, iOS and Android users will have free access to the premium version until December 31.\nThe app also has Xbox Live integration, so you can log into your Live account and earn achievements.\n",

      "text": "By WindowsITPro\nMicrosoft is making a significant investment in its quantum computing division with the addition of several new executives, including the appointment of long-time Microsoft executive Todd Homdahl who will lead the scientific and engineering effort.\nMicrosoft has also hired two leaders in the field of quantum computing, Leo Kouwenhoven and Charles Marcus. The company will soon bring on Matthia Troyer and David Reilly, two other leaders in the field.\nThe team will work to build a quantum computer while also creating the software that could run on it, Microsoft says in a blog post .\nThe investment comes months after Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that quantum cloud computing could arrive in as soon as 6 years .\n“Microsoft’s approach to building a quantum computer is based on a type of qubit – or unit of quantum information – called a topological qubit,” the company says. “Using qubits, researchers believe that quantum computers could very quickly process multiple solutions to a problem at the same time, rather than sequentially.”\nUltimately, Microsoft wants to “create dependable tools that scientists without a quantum background can use to solve some of the world’s most difficult problems… that could revolutionize industries such as medicine and materials science.”\nHolmdahl previously worked on the development of the Xbox, Kinect and HoloLens, while Marcus and Kouwenhoven are both academic researchers that have been working with Microsoft’s quantum team for years. Microsoft has provided funding for an “increasing share” of the topological qubit research in their labs.\nMarcus says that without cooperation between scientists and engineers, a quantum economy will never be realized.\n“I knew that to get over the hump and get to the point where you started to be able to create machines that have never existed before, it was necessary to change the way we did business,” Marcus said in a statement. “We need scientists, engineers of all sorts, technicians, programmers, all working on the same team.”\nThis article was originally posted here at WindowsITPro.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 21 minutes ago with 5 comments \nAs of today, Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now available on iOS and Android. The company says that Solitaire been one of the most played games on Windows over the past 25 years, so now it wants to bring the game to other platforms. \nOf course, this is not the Solitaire that we all grew up with. That was a free game that came with Windows, along with Minesweeper , Hearts , and FreeCell . The modern version of the game, Microsoft Solitaire Collection , uses a freemium model, so it's free to play, but you'll have to pay if you don't want to see advertisements. \nIf you download the game for iOS and Android, you'll get the Premium Edition for free until the end of the year, which Microsoft says is a $1.99 value. This includes \"no ads, game boosts and double coins for all Daily Challenges.\" \nThe game will have Xbox Live integration on both platforms, as it does in its Windows apps. This means that you can sign in with your Gamertag and your progress and game data will sync with the cloud, no matter which device you're playing on. \nMicrosoft says that Solitaire Collection has reached 119 million unique users since it launched four years ago for Windows 8. This is impressive, considering that the company announced that it had reached 100 million less than three months ago . \nYou can download Microsoft Solitaire Collection from the iOS App Store here or from the Google Play Store here .

      "text": "Microsoft is developing its own quantum computer hardware Microsoft is developing its own quantum computer hardware By Joel Hruska   10:00 am Comment \nFor the past few years, practical quantum computing breakthroughs have been led by companies like Google and D-Wave, working in partnership with NASA. As we’ve determined that D-Wave’s computers are , in fact, quantum computers, interest has grown in building quantum computing solutions that can solve different types of problems more efficiently than D-Wave can. To date, D-Wave’s products have been based on sparsely connected groups of qubits. While this approach has been generally proven to work, it limits the types of problems that the machine can solve. Now, Microsoft is publicly throwing its own hat into the ring with a new quantum computing initiative — and a new type of system known as a topological quantum computer. \nIn a new blog post, Microsoft announced that it has hired new leaders in the quantum computing field and is expanding its efforts to develop its own machine. Leo Kouwenhoven and Charles Marcus are both experts in the field and Kouwenhoven is credited with discovering evidence that Majorana particles, which were predicted theoretically in 1937, actually exist. Both men have collaborated with Microsoft for years, but the Redmond-based company hasn’t talked much about its quantum aspirations much to date. Microsoft has also created an introductory video explaining quantum computing, as shown below: \nSo why are companies building quantum computers? It’s not because there’s any real hope of miniaturizing them or building them with conventional semiconductor technologies; quantum computers require supercooling and incredibly advanced manufacturing techniques that make them unlikely for wide deployment. What quantum computing promises is the ability to compute certain types of problems far more quickly and efficiently than conventional systems can manage. In some cases, quantum computers are believed to be theoretically capable of solving problems that classical machines wouldn’t solve before the heat death of the universe. \nHarnessing this kind of power for science means developing new types of software as well, and Microsoft is devoting a considerable amount of effort to creating programs that could run on quantum computers. As with much of quantum computing, it’s not clear when or if these efforts will bear fruit. But a fully functional quantum computer that could be applied to problems that D-Wave’s quantum annealers can’t solve would be a revolutionary breakthrough. It might never shrink to the size of something you can fit in your pocket, but it wouldn’t take many quantum computers to change the world. \nMultiple companies like IBM are also working on making quantum computing available via cloud infrastructure . If it works, it implies that while quantum computers might be relatively few in number, their benefits could be much more widely distributed. \nThis MIT Technology Review article delves deeper into an explanation of topological quantum computing and the difficulty of building one, if you’d like more information.
