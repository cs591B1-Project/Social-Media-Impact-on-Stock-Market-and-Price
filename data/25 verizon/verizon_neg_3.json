      "text": "Verizon releases Ellipsis 8 HD Android tablet Verizon's new Ellipsis 8 HD tablet is targeted at the budget-minded crowd. (Source: Verizon) Verizon has started selling its new Ellipsis 8 HD just in time for the holiday season. Does the budget Android tablet stand out from a flooded market? by Sam Medley, 2016/11/12 Android Tablet Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here Verizon is hoping that consumers in the market for a cheap, budget-oriented Android tablet will take a look at the new Ellipsis 8 HD. The new tablet is a refresh of Verizon’s own Ellipsis 8, which has been on the market for a while. The Ellipsis 8 HD gets it’s name from the 1920x1200 IPS display, an improvement from the Ellipsis 8’s 720p panel. The device is equipped with an octa-core Snapdragon 617 SoC, 3 GB of RAM, an 8 MP rear camera, a 5 MP front-facing “selfie” camera, and 16 GB of onboard storage (expandable to 128 GB via micro SD). The tablet also sports 4G LTE connectivity through Verizon’s network. Powering everything is a 5,100 mAh battery, which Verizon estimates will net up to 14 ½ hours of use. The tablet runs Android Marshmallow 6.0.1. The Ellipsis 8 HD continues Verizon’s trend of releasing low-specced budget tablets that they hope will be used for 4G access. The current Ellipsis 8 has a 1.5/5 rating on Verizon’s site, which doesn’t bode well for the updated iteration. Other options at this price point (such as Asus’ Zenpad 8 and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab 8) have similarly specs, so Verizon will face steep competition in the smaller, budget-oriented Android tablet space this holiday season. The Ellipsis 8 HD can be purchased for a flat $249, bought with a 2-year contract for $49.99, or paid over 24 months for $10.41/month.  ",

      "text": "0 Verizon Providing False Data Usage Results I cannot remember if there's another thread about this but I do see A LOT of people on social media complaining about this. I'm sure y'all are experiencing this as well and I want to hear how bad it is for you and what you've done to attempt to get it fixed. According to Verizon, in the past 48 hours, we have used 5 GB of data. No way... not possible. My fiancé and I have been connected to wifi 90% of the time. When we were out and about, I would stream 6-8 songs from  Music at the very most. Again, I'm talking about within the last 48 hours. As far as I know, 6-8 songs, even at super high quality, cannot come out to being 5 GB used. My fiancé watched the Michigan football game on his phone last night but he was connected to wifi during that time. Both our phones also have WiFi Assist off (always has been). We already went through customer service and we did everything they recommended. I talked to customer relations and the woman we talked to doesn't see anything wrong with our account or usage. My fiancés phone vs. the Verizon system has nearly a 1.75 GB difference. Mine is only off by around 400-500 MB. Anyone have similar experiences? Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

      "text": "Andrew Myrick Nov 13th, 2016 \nIt’s no secret that stock quantities of the Pixel XL are strained as Verizon and Google have sold out of the device multiple times since its release. Now it seems that Verizon is continuing to have issues after it was revealed that Big Red would be delaying shipments of the Pixel XL. Image courtesy of PhoneArena \nPhoneArena obtained a screenshot of an email received by one reader who was informed that the device would be delayed until the end of November. The kicker here is the email wasn’t received until the day that the device was initially supposed to be for shipment for the 128GB Pixel XL. \nIt’s apparent that Google is strained for resources here, but this feels a bit underhanded to not give customers more notice about when their device will be shipping. Have you been affected by this recent strain of delayed shipments? Give us a heads up in the comments below.",

      "text": "Sprint has Verizon executives sweating and trembling with fear according to its new ads Sprint has Verizon executives sweating and trembling with fear according to its new ads Posted: Tags : Sprint - Sprint + Back in August, we told you about Verizon's television ad starring Jamie Foxx which called Sprint a \"cut rate\" network . The ad followed Sprint's decision to persuade former Verizon pitchman Paul Marcarelli (\"Can you hear me now?\") to come out of retirement . Sprint has been trying to pound the same statistic into consumer's heads, mainly that the nation's fourth largest carrier has scored within 1% of Verizon in reliability tests (based on Sprint's analysis of Nielsen drive test data).In addition, Sprint's rates can save Verizon customers (T-Mobile and AT&T subscribers too) 50% of their monthly bill. By offering consumers a network that is just about as reliable as Verizon's pipeline at a price that is half of what Big Red subscribers pay, Sprint says that its competitive service has Verizon executives \"stressin.\" As a result, they are sweating bullets in the boardroom and are generally going bonkers, if you believe Sprint. You might have noticed the ads in rotation this weekend while you watched your favorite NFL team play. If you missed them, we have both the 30 second version and the 15 second spot. Sprint doesn't have famous stars in its T.V. commercials to use against Verizon like T-Mobile has (Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande), but there is more than one way to skin a cat; especially when that cat is the number one rival in your industry. \"Customers have caught on and they’re smarter than Verizon gives them credit for. They recognize the savings they get with Sprint, along with a network that’s better than it ever has been. We wanted to have some fun in a new set of ads, characterizing what we expect the mood to be at Verizon’s headquarters. By contrast, Sprint employees and executives feel very positive about the momentum at our company, the new pricing offers for customers and our network improvements.\"-Roger Sole, chief marketing officer, Sprint Sprint's new ads say that it has Verizon executives stressing Popular galleries",

      "text": "What’s the issue with manufacturers underestimating demand and poorly planning out inventory channels ?\nSome Verizon customers are receiving a delay of shipment notice from the carrier, pointing out to them that while these people have “great taste,” that taste has meant that many people agree with them. And too many agreed to buying the 128GB Google Pixel XL from Big Red, so much so that the ol’ Checkmark is pushing delivery dates out by 15 days. This example came from a reader to PhoneArena. \nVerizon is the only carrier retailer for the Google Pixel, though the phone works on all major carriers in the US . Demand for the 128GB SKUs of the Pixel and Pixel XL have proven more challenging than the 32GB ones.\nThe post At least one Verizon 128GB Pixel XL delayed from shipping for two weeks appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

The constant fight for subscribers in order to get or stay on top results in good chunks of change for advertising agencies, too, so who is on top from the big four US carriers when it came to ad spending last month. Why, the Big Red carrier, of course. As you can see in the slideshow below, Verizon spent more than $90 million on 15 spots, with the most expensive run being the multiple fist pumps clip with Jamie Foxx. AT&T, on the other hand, spend much less, but still it ran the \"Work Things\" video you can see below for $20.8 million estimated worth at mostly Fox, CBS and ESPN. Next in line is Sprint with $51 million spent, mostly for Paul the Sprint guy commercial. T-Mobile counts on viral marketing and lets its plans speak for themselves mostly, as it spent the least from the major four carriers by a large margin, despite that its most run clip features a celebrity like Ariana Grande. Given the increase in postpaid smartphone subs of more than a million in Q3, T-Mobile obviously gets a good bang for its advertising buck.

      "title": "Verizon: Irrational Fears",
      "text": "Summary \nVerizon is down nearly $10 from the highs back in July. \nThe dividend yield has rarely been above 5% in the last 20 years outside of the financial crisis. \nThe fears of rate hikes are likely irrationally hitting the stock though more downside probably exists for Verizon. The stock market is a very peculiar place. One month a stock like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ ) can surge above $55 and within a few months the stock is down nearly $10 on limited news. A very volatile move for a company with a mostly stable business. The story is ultimately one of where investors got too bullish and now the fears are potentially reaching irrational levels. The investment thesis back at the end of August was that the stock was heading back down to $50. With support broken, the question now is where Verizon becomes a buy. When the momentum in a stock is broken, just about any excuse can send a stock lower. From the Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) security breach to subscriber growth concerns, the market slowly turned less bullish on Verizon. Now the Trump victory apparently has investors in the top domestic wireless players doubly fearful in the stocks. First, the thought is that apparently Sprint (NYSE: S ) could be in play for a merger with T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS ) though Trump has already stated a preference for blocking the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). Second, the fear is that a business friendly environment will push bond yields higher and make the high yielding Verizon stock less appealing. The ironic part is that a Sprint/T-Mobile match up would actually reduce the competition in the domestic wireless market. The pricing wars would likely decline as a strong third player wouldn't need to compete against each other. As well, Trump has already stated a desire to block companies from getting bigger. The yield fears appear equally as irrational. Trump doesn't take office until January 20, or more than two months from now. In addition, the infrastructure plans and proposed business tax cuts that could help spur the economy and cause interest rates to rise are far from done deals. While good ideas, Trump must convince Congress that the plans will pay for themselves or find solutions that contain the deficit. Either way, the implementation of such plans will take time likely measured in years and not days. Clearly, the ultimate downside risk to the economy and bond equivalent stocks like Verizon are higher interest rates caused by either fast growth or spiraling debt. The first option could actually help the wireless giant return to revenue growth from a strong economy. Either way, the Fed is only talking about raising the federal funds rate to 0.75% when meeting on December 14. The rate is far below the 5% dividend now offered by Verizon. Outside of the financial crisis, the dividend yield rarely topped 5% in the last 20 years. Buying the stock at this point is a different story. Verizon is in a clear downtrend now and logically isn't going to bottom until possibly $42 where previous support existed. Click to enlarge The key investor takeaway is that the market is already pricing in irrational fears of rate hikes and the worst possible outcomes of a Trump presidency months before he even takes office. Let Verizon come in further and some of the momentum reverse before making this wireless giant a long-term dividend play. Disclosure: I am/we are long TWX.

      "text": "Verizon buys LQD WiFi to expand its IoT strategy into “smart cities” Posted MIT’s new MoVR system makes wireless VR possible with any headset \nVerizon today has made another acquisition to build out its IoT business: the carrier has purchased LQD WiFi , a developer of outdoor interactive displays that provide WiFi connectivity along with news, emergency alerts and community information. They also act as sensors collecting crowd, weather and other data. \nThe financial terms of the deal are not being disclosed. LQD WiFi, based out of New York, had raised only $1.73 million in funding from unknown investors. Founder and CEO Randy Ramusack is a Microsoft veteran, having worked as the CTO of Microsoft Switzerland and the CIO of Microsoft UK, among other roles and places. \nLQD’s main service is called Palo, a kiosk-style structure that serves both as a WiFi station as well as a place for people to interact with information on the Palo itself. In this regard, it competes against the likes of Link NYC , which was borne out of Google’s Sidewalk Labs and its Intersection project. Link already has a small network of devices in New York City and earlier this year announced it was also coming to London (but has yet to go live). \nWhile Link will work with BT in the UK and taps into Google’s own WiFi efforts in the U.S., LQD will give Verizon its own entry point into providing smart city and connected consumer services. \n“We designed Palo, from day one, to be part of the community, offering Wi-Fi, public safety features and a unique, interactive community engagement platform,” said Ramusack in a statement. “Palo’s human-scale touch screen lets users explore and connect with the local community creating multiple ways to engage, through an innovative, purposeful and curated experience.” \nIt looks like Palo kiosks are planning to be piloted in at least one metro area, New Rochelle in New York. \n“We want New Rochelle to be an ideal place to live and work. We recognize that a healthy future depends increasingly on robust digital infrastructure, based on cutting-edge technology that can connect residents and businesses alike in a friendly, accessible way. Our partnership with LQD will accomplish all of these goals,” said New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson. \nThis is the fourth acquisition this year made by Verizon to build up its Internet of Things business, which is a complement to Verizon’s other acquisition strategy based around consumer-focused media companies (among those, it’s in the process of buying Yahoo and last year acquired AOL , which owns TechCrunch). \nOther acquisitions in IoT have included Sensity Systems to add LED light controlling technology; telematics company Fleetmatics for $2.8 billion in August; and Telogis for more connected car technology. \nIn both the case of the media acquisitions and these more enterprise-focused B2B investments, Verizon is essentially pursuing the same strategy: the company wants to build out more services to offset declines in more traditional, legacy areas of its business, including fixed-line services. It has the money to invest in exploring what might form the next generation of its business: Verizon last year reported $132 billion in revenues and has a steady flow of sales from a wireless business with 113.7 million customers. \nAnd the idea seems to be to continue investing in and developing these, presumably as a way of Verizon both extending its own WiFi footprint, and of course its wider advertising network and way of collecting interesting (anonymised) data that could be used to grow that business. \n“LQD’s Palo technology hubs capture Verizon’s vision of delivering citizen engagement experiences by connecting people with their communities while providing critical security, transportation and wayfinding solutions as well as Wi-Fi capabilities,” said Mike Lanman , SVP, Enterprise Products and Internet of Things at Verizon, in a statement. “This transaction uniquely positions us to utilize our unmatched infrastructure, platforms and network at scale to deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play.” 0",

      "text": "Russia’s Sberbank, an investor in Uber, announces its next $250M venture fund Posted Verizon buys LQD WiFi to expand its IoT strategy into “smart cities” \nIt’s perhaps not widely know that Uber has Russian investors. But it does, in the form of Russian bank Sberbank, which invested as part of its first international fund a few years ago. \nSberbank has now announced its second 10-year venture fund put at US$200-250M in size. Portfolio companies in the first fund included Uber and eToro. Unlike the first fund this one isn’t financed by Sberbank alone, but involves private investors and companies. \nSome of them are of Russian origin but the fund managers are said to be in talks with Chinese investors. It will also target industries from fintech to AI, marketplaces, sharing economy, and cyber security. Rounds covered will be A, B and C, with the average ticket size starting at $5 mln. \nSpokeman Lev Khasis, Sberbank’s first Deputy Chairman told TechCrunch that the previous 10-year Sberbank fund, “Moneytime”, was started in 2012. It specialized in A and B round investments in fintech companies. So far, US$40M out of US$100M has been invested in 10 companies, yielding 1 exit. 0",

      "text": "Verizon’s shipment for Google Pixel XL delayed due to high demand By 0 \nIf you’re very much excited to finally receive your pre-ordered 128GB Google Pixel XL , you might want to temper your expectations. Some users have apparently received notification from Verizon , the only carrier selling the devices in the US, that the supposed shipment of the smartphone has been delayed by more than two weeks.

      "text": "Verizon acquires LQD WiFi to humanize the citizen engagement experience Media contacts Bella Perrone T. 415-712-5843 \nNEW YORK – Seeking to accelerate communities’ smart infrastructure and ignite the new fabric of urban spaces, Verizon today announced that it has purchased substantially all of the assets of LQD WiFi LLC., a private company based in New York. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. \nMike Lanman, senior vice president, Enterprise Products and Internet of Things at Verizon, said: “LQD’s Palo technology hubs capture Verizon’s vision of delivering citizen engagement experiences by connecting people with their communities while providing critical security, transportation and wayfinding solutions as well as Wi-Fi capabilities. This transaction uniquely positions us to utilize our unmatched infrastructure, platforms and network at scale to deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play.” \nLQD Founder and CEO Randy Ramusack said: “We designed Palo, from day one, to be part of the community, offering Wi-Fi, public safety features and a unique, interactive community engagement platform. Palo’s human-scale touch screen lets users explore and connect with the local community creating multiple ways to engage, through an innovative, purposeful and curated experience.” \n“LQD is thrilled to join Verizon to redefine the urban space. As a world leader in wireless technology and smart communities, Verizon’s expertise, global scale, and leading media platforms will enable us to deliver on our mission to provide an unbounded flow of information to all people. By bringing Palo to the streets, we’re connecting cities to their citizens, citizens to their neighborhoods, and enhancing communities across the country,” Ramusack continued. \nNext-generation urban technology is becoming increasingly important as citizen’s expectations for smart city infrastructure increases. With LQD’s technology, Verizon aims to address key community needs such as fostering economic development, bridging the digital divide, facilitating transportation and traffic management and enhancing personal security and urban planning. LQD and Verizon are currently designing solutions for municipalities, private developers, academic institutions and entertainment venues. Verizon also sees opportunity to promote civic innovation and deliver data driven solutions leveraging the open data platforms of cities. These solutions will help communities better inform and engage with their constituents. \nNew Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said: “We want New Rochelle to be an ideal place to live and work. We recognize that a healthy future depends increasingly on robust digital infrastructure, based on cutting-edge technology that can connect residents and businesses alike in a friendly, accessible way. Our partnership with LQD will accomplish all of these goals.” \nNew Rochelle City Manager Charles B. Strome, III. said: “These attractive kiosks will invite residents and visitors to engage with our city, for everything from parks, cultural events and local businesses, to job opportunities and emergency messaging, and they will connect with the world around them through high-speed public Wi-Fi.” \nVerizon has developed an array of connected solutions including intelligent parking, lighting, traffic management and security that improve livability, resiliency and public safety for local communities. LQD’s assets will be integrated with the market- leading smart community infrastructure from Sensity Systems, which Verizon acquired last month. Verizon’s Smart Communities organization, which is a part of its IoT business, is also simplifying the creation of IoT applications through its ThingSpace platform. Tags:",

      "title": "Getting to Know: NET10 Wireless",
      "text": "By AndroidGuys \nMost wireless customers are familiar with the big-name brands in Verizon, AT&T , T-Mobile, and Sprint. Relatively few buyers, though, are as well-versed when it comes to the topic of Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO). \nIt might surprise you to know that companies like MetroPCS, Boost Mobile, and Cricket Wireless operate on the T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T networks, respectively. These network operators license the towers and coverage from the tier-one providers and offer their own phones, rate plans, and customer service. NET10 Wireless is one such MVNO worth closer inspection. About \nAs a company that operates almost virtually, NET10 doesn’t have any towers of their own, nor do they have any retail presence. Moreover, you won’t find paper bills, activation fees, or overage charges. \nUsing both CDMA and GSM technologies , NET10 lets customers bring their AT&T , T-Mobile , Sprint, Verizon, or unlocked GSM phones. Rate Plans \nCustomers can choose from a number of options spread across various types of plans. For those who only needed the barest of necessities, the pay-as-you-go provides buckets of minutes. The Monthly Talk, Text, and Data plans range from $35 up to $75 per month and come with variable amounts of high speed data. \nThe Upgrade Plans give buyers the opportunity to earn phone credits for paying their bills after determined periods of time. The $60 option, for instance, allows for the $300 credit after 18 months on the plan. On the other end, the $80 choice lets you do so after only six months. \nShould you wish to connect more than one line of service to another, the Family Plans run anywhere from $75 to $170 per month. As of November 2016 the plans work out as follow: $75 per month – 2 lines with 3GB data each $90 per month – 2 lines with 5GB data each $130 per month – 3 lines with 5GB data each $170 per month – 4 lines with 5GB data each Handset Selection \nAs one might expect, the handset selection through NET10 leaves something to be desired. With that said, it’s quite affordable to purchase a phone through the MVNO. Indeed, there are phones that cost as little as $10 each; the top of the line ends up around $280. \nAnother option for potential buyers is to lump a phone and rate plan together for one monthly rate. Going this route opens the door to a larger selection of phones, including much more current and powerful devices. \nWhere things shine for NET10 is in its ability to support existing phones from other carriers. Those of you who have access to an existing phone, or who might have purchased an unlocked phone elsewhere, can bring the device to NET10. As of today you can get a SIM Card for as low as $.99 and activate immediately.",

      "text": "Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article \nVerizon is at it again, announcing its latest acquisition in the Internet of Things (IoT) space on Monday. The telecom giant has scooped up LQD WiFi, a privately-held company that develops outdoor interactive displays and kiosks for smart city use cases. \nTerms of the deal have not been disclosed. \nVerizon has been steadily putting different parts of its IoT strategy together this year, primarily based on specialized acquisitions in well-defined vertical markets. The provider purchased smart LED lighting provider Sensity Systems for an undisclosed amount in September. Verizon also this month closed its acquisition of Dublin-based fleet and mobile management company Fleetmatics Group for $2.4 billion, a deal first announced in August. \n[Related: Verizon To Acquire IoT Startup Sensity Systems To Add More Smart City Control To ThingSpace ] \nLQD WiFi, a New York City-based company, founded in 2014, specializes in connected kiosks called Palo Unified Technology Hubs. These interactive \"hubs\" can provide information to citizens, such as public safety announcements, public transit information, upcoming events and directions. The Palo kiosks also provide free public Wi-Fi, area lighting, and 911 calling. \nLQD's assets will be integrated with technology from Sensity Systems as part of Verizon's \"Smart Community\" infrastructure efforts, according to the Basking Ridge, N.J.-based service provider. Through its recent acquisitions, Verizon has been developing smart city solutions, including intelligent parking, lighting, security and traffic management. Verizon's Smart Cities and Communities business unit, a branch of its IoT organization, is using its web-based ThingSpace platform to develop these solutions. \n\"LQD's Palo technology hubs capture Verizon's vision of delivering citizen engagement experiences by connecting people with their communities while providing critical security, transportation and wayfinding solutions as well as Wi-Fi capabilities,\" said Mike Lanman, senior vice president, of enterprise products and IoT for Verizon in a statement. \nAccording to a statement from Verizon, both companies are already working on IoT solutions for municipalities, private developers, academic institutions and entertainment venues. \nVerizon, similar to telco competitors like AT&T, is pursuing IoT in an effort to offer more strategic, digital services while offsetting the declining demand for legacy voice and connectivity services. \nVerizon said that the Palo kiosks will be piloted in New Rochelle, N.Y. \n\"LQD is thrilled to join Verizon to redefine the urban space. As a world leader in wireless technology and smart communities, Verizon's expertise, global scale, and leading media platforms will enable us to deliver on our mission to provide an unbounded flow of information to all people,\" said LQD founder and CEO Randy Ramusack. \nVerizon did not disclose when it expects the LQD transaction to be completed.",

      "title": "Verizon Buys LQD WiFi, Expanding IoT Business with Interactive Kiosk Palo",
      "text": "11/14/16 AT 3:49 PM Close \nVerizon is expanding its IoT business by purchasing LQD WiFi, which comes with a network of outdoor, interactive kiosks that offer free Wi-Fi. \nAll assets of LQD WiFi, a private company in New York, were bought by Verizon, the company announced Monday. The terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. \n“This transaction uniquely positions us to utilize our unmatched infrastructure, platforms and network at scale to deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play.\" said Mike Lanman, senior vice president, Enterprise Products and Internet of Things at Verizon. \nLQD’s main feature is Palo, the street-smart kiosks that provide free Wi-Fi, local community information for the public, as well as public safety and transit announcements. Palo also provides security cameras, emergency calling and area lighting. \n\"Palo's human-scale touch screen lets users explore and connect with the local community creating multiple ways to engage, through an innovative, purposeful and curated experience,\" said LQD Founder and CEO Randy Ramusack in a statement. \nHe added that LQD is “thrilled” to join Verizon. \n\"Verizon's expertise, global scale, and leading media platforms will enable us to deliver on our mission to provide an unbounded flow of information to all people. By bringing Palo to the streets, we're connecting cities to their citizens, citizens to their neighborhoods, and enhancing communities across the country,\" added Ramusack, who previously worked for Microsoft. \nThe kiosks could provide help to those don’t have web-access. A third of U.S. adults do not have high-speed internet at home. \nVerizon, which generated about $132 billion in revenues in 2015, says its goal is to address needs from the community with LQD’s technology by promoting economic development, bridging the digital divide, facilitating transportation and traffic management and increasing personal security and urban planning. \nLQD and Verizon are now designing “solutions for municipalities, private developers, academic institutions and entertainment venues,” the company announced. \nAlthough it was not confirmed in the announcement, it seems like the New Rochelle area in New York will test the Palo kiosks in their community. \n\"These attractive kiosks will invite residents and visitors to engage with our city, for everything from parks, cultural events and local businesses, to job opportunities and emergency messaging, and they will connect with the world around them through high-speed public Wi-Fi,\" said New Rochelle City Manager Charles B. Strome III. Related Stories Where The Verizon-Yahoo Acquisition Stands \nAlso in New York is Link NYC , which is similar to Palo. Link NYC launched earlier this year and vows to replace almost 8,000 pay phones across the five boroughs over the next eight years with new kiosks called Links. The spots offer Wi-Fi, phone calls, allows people to charge their phones and provides city services, maps and directions. \nWhile Links aided users, the spots also brought some trouble. Some people stayed at the kiosk too long and prevented others from being able to use them, while Link tablets were used inappropriately, annoying residents and businesses nearby. Link NYC eventually ended up removing the web browsing on all Link tablets, it announced in September . Link NYC said it was looking into other solutions, like time limits. \nLink NYC was launched by the city of New York and is funded through advertising.

Boom does provide full postpaid Verizon network roaming coverage for data in addition to voice and messaging. Boom's plans are very competitive vs. Selectel, probably many could save money or get more for their money with a Boom plan vs. Selectel.\n\nI admin. quite a few phones with service on both Boom and Selectel and am happy with both companies although Boom is new so those accounts are 6 mo. or less old so time will tell. In most cases lately Boom is getting the business when we look at best cost for the account's needs though. I hope Selectel decides to stay competative, maybe they are waiting to see if Boom is still around after 18 months or so, I hope they both thrive.",

      "title": "Getting ready to switch away from AT&T to Verizon - anything I should consider?",
      "text": "0 Getting ready to switch away from AT&T to Verizon - anything I should consider? I'm getting ready to switch to Verizon after 21 years with AT&T. Four weeks ago I bought a Verizon pre-paid SIM and put it in my everyday phone I've been using for the past year - the iPhone6S. My main reason for considering the switch is because Verizon recently installed a new cell site about 3/4 mile from my house, and now coverage around my house and work is great - it rarely switches to VZW Wi-Fi unless the phone is in my pocket. Also, Verizon continues to add cell sites all over the city and now surpasses the number of sites for all other carriers. Meanwhile AT&T hasn't added a site in a few years. Pricing for the amount of shared data we use (15-18 MB/month) is about the same between the 2 carriers, so that is not a factor. Below are the pros and cons I've come up with concerning switching - comments or considerations welcome. Pros (in priority order) Superior coverage around home and around the city Better battery life due to better coverage I like the SMS format for email-to-SMS messages Cons (in priority order) Sound/Voice quality when calling non-HD Voice phones is poor - muffled, garbling, fluttering, digital artifacts, audio dropouts Slow handoff/selection from site-to-site: While driving around my phone will often hold onto a weak signal from a distant cell site even though there's a closer site nearby. This often leads to some of the poor sound quality issues mentioned above - though calls don't completely drop as much as AT&T. Verizon must have a better tolerance for poor call quality. Poorer coverage than AT&T in our frequent vacation spot - Lake Tahoe, and the drive between Reno & Tahoe. Occasional delayed SMS Seems to use more data unexplainably - though that shouldn't be a cost factor if I get the right plan No NumberSync Occasional delayed voicemail? Once Voice-over-LTE interoperability between carriers becomes reality, that will likely help negate my #1 priority con. From what I've read that's still supposed to happen by the end of the year - though they've missed previous deadlines.",

      "title": "Verizon to test pre-commercial LTE-U small cells in unlicensed 5 GHz band",
      "text": "Nov 11, 2016 4:47pm Verizon's test application details the spectrum bands in which the company plans to run its LTE-U tests. \nVerizon filed an application with the FCC to conduct tests of small cells running both 802.11 Wi-Fi technologies as well as LTE in the unlicensed 5 GHz band. \nVerizon noted the effort is part of the carrier’s ongoing efforts to roll out LTE-U technology. The technology promises to allow Verizon to expand its services into unlicensed spectrum bands, thereby giving customers faster speeds and more network capacity than Verizon can provide solely with its licensed spectrum holdings. \n“The purpose of the proposed testing is to evaluate the technical performance of pre-commercial LTE-U equipment, operating in downlink-only mode in the UNII-1 and UNII-3 portions of the 5 GHz band, in a highly controlled field environment in order to assist in the ultimate development of commercial products,” Verizon said in its Special Temporary Authority (STA) application with the FCC . “The testing will benefit the public interest by enabling the pre-commercial testing of new products outside of a lab environment but in a controlled and managed manner.” \nAccording to a separate filing , Verizon will conduct the tests in Oklahoma City, Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, and Irving, Texas. \nVerizon said the tests will involve a total of 40 small cells, both indoor and outdoor. “The LTE small cell will simultaneously transmit a single 20 MHz signal in a 5 GHz band and an LTE in the PCS band or AWS band. Mobile devices will operate near the small cell sites with the transmitter parameters,” Verizon said. “LTE mobile devices support PCS/AWS FDD operation with an LTE uplink in the PCS/AWS bands but are receive only for LTE in the 5 GHz band. Mobile devices also support 802.11 modes in the requested 5 GHz band.” \nHowever, Verizon said its LTE-U tests are separate from the coexistence test plan recently released by the Wi-Fi Alliance . “In addition to the product development testing described above, Verizon and our partner companies intend to conduct separate and independent LTE-U/Wi-Fi coexistence testing in a real-world environment at a Verizon facility using a coexistence test plan being developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance,” Verizon said. “This test plan is a product of extensive technical collaboration between the Wi-Fi Alliance, and Verizon’s partner companies and would be modified as appropriate based on the specific environment to be used for the testing. This Wi-Fi Alliance test plan will initially be used for joint coexistence testing to take place within a Wi-Fi Alliance certified lab.” \nVerizon’s comments are notable because the Wi-Fi Alliance’s coexistence test plan has generated a significant amount of conflict between cellular companies like Verizon and Wi-Fi proponents like Google. \nThe Wi-Fi Alliance’s coexistence test plan, created at the urging of the FCC, is designed to show whether LTE-U technologies would interfere with existing users of unlicensed frequencies like Wi-Fi users. Representatives from Verizon and T-Mobile have said they will use the coexistence test plan hammered out through the Wi-Fi Alliance before they deploy any LTE-U equipment. Read more on",

Financial terms weren't disclosed. The goal of the acquisition is enhancing \"citizen engagement experiences\" using LQD's Palo technology hubs in urban spaces -- kiosks that provide information including community news/info, wayfinding, public safety announcements, transit updates and upcoming events, along with free public Wi-Fi. LQD and Verizon are designing solutions for municipalities, private developers, academic institutions and entertainment venues, the companies say. ",

      "text": "Amy Sedaris in go90’s ‘Thanksgiving’ Trailer By - Nov 13, 2016 \nVerizon’s innovative go90 streaming service just put up a trailer for their brand new show “Thanksgiving”, starring Amy Sedaris , Chris Elliott, and Bridey Elliott. Check it out above! \n“Thanksgiving” is an eight-episode comedy series that will take place almost in real time over a four-hour span of the fictional Morgan family’s annual Thanksgiving dinner. The Morgan family is full of awkward, colorful, and flat-out oddball characters. \nThe show will root into some of the humor and dysfunction that usually arises in family situations and around the dinner table during Thanksgiving celebrations. It was created by Bethany Hall (“30 Rock”) and Daniel Powell (co-creator of “Inside Amy Schumer”). \nIf you are interested and want to follow the show, tune in to go90.com or download the go90 app from the app store, to get both the show and a variety of sports, reality, and live music streams. \n“Thanksgiving” premieres on Wednesday, November 16 and ends on Wednesday, November 23. So after you wrap up the show you can go enjoy your own Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family! SHARE",

      "text": "Verizon Planning Limited Small Cell LTE-U Testing November 14, 2016 - Written By Daniel Fuller \nAs the industry’s news outlets are focused on the US carriers’ race for commercial 5G, it can be easy to forget that the same LTE technologies we’re using right now, and slight variations of those, are being implemented and improved daily to deliver speed boosts and better coverage while customers wait for 5G to hit the ground. One of the main channels being used for these improvements is LTE operating on unlicensed spectrum bands, or LTE-U . It’s essentially the wild west of network technology, which is why the Wi-Fi Alliance has put forth a proposed coexistence plan for some of the US carriers looking to use it, and carriers are still testing the waters with it. One of those carriers is Verizon, who recently sent in a couple of applications to the FCC that seem to indicate that they’re getting ready to start field tests, and they plan to use small cells to do it. \nAccording to Verizon’s filings, they’re going to be making heavy use of bands in the PCS and AWS range, around the same area that normal LTE networks currently operate. 5GHz bands, on the other hand, are going to be used in a more passive, receiving-only capacity on the testing device end. While this is mostly for technical and licensing reasons, an added quirk is sacrificing the speed of including the 5GHz bands in the aggregated LTE-U stream’s upload speeds in order to get better download speeds. \nInterestingly, Verizon will also be making use of 802.11 Wi-Fi technologies in their small cell array, meaning increased speeds at the expense of range. This works since Verizon’s test plan will only be taking place in four markets within the States, and all within the scope of only 40 small cell nodes, but viability for a wider rollout may be questionable without a significant investment of money, manpower, and time, which could harm Verizon’s 5G ambitions. Testing will mostly take place in North Carolina, with Oklahoma City, Raleigh and Cary being the test cities. Irving, Texas will also be in on the fun. At this time, start and end dates for testing have yet to be announced. Post navigation",

      "text": "Verizon Acquires LQD WiFi and Palo IoT ‘Smart City’ Hub November 15, 2016 - Written By Mihai Matei \nYesterday, Verizon Wireless announced the acquisition of private company LQD WiFi LLC. in the pursuit of expanding its IoT (Internet of Things) business into cities and public urban areas. Although the terms of transaction have not been disclosed, Senior VP of Enterprise Products and IoT at Verizon, Mike Lanman, said that “This transaction uniquely positions us to utilize our unmatched infrastructure, platforms and networks at scale and deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play.” \nThese aforementioned “technology hubs” called Palo (and previously referred to as Beacon) have been initially unveiled by LQD WiFi LLC in 2013 at the New York City Reinvent Payphones Design Challenge. A year later the company partnered with frog, and in 2015 both frog and LQD have managed to develop and build a business strategy and the brand’s vision, along with the proper hardware. But in more recent news, Verizon Wireless has now acquired LQD (a frog Ventures portfolio company) and the official frog design website reads that, following the acquisition “Palo will be installed in forward-thinking cities, academic campuses, and entertainment venues across North America.” However, according to the PRNewswire press release, the city where Palo hubs might make an appearance first seems to be New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. Citing New Rochelle Mayor, Noam Bramson, “We want New Rochelle to be an ideal place to live and work. We recognize that a healthy future depends increasingly on robust digital infrastructure, based on cutting-edge technology that can connect residents and businesses alike in a friendly, accessible way.” The Mayor also added that the city’s partnership with LQD “will accomplish all of these goals.” \nLQD’s Palo technology hubs offer free Wi-Fi, public safety announcements and features, information on nearby points of interests and tourist attractions, volunteering opportunities, maps, emergency alerts, taxi beacons and more. The Palo hub has been designed with touch-free input in mind and can be voice activated, but also carries a human-scale touchscreen. According to the press release, LQD’s IoT assets will be integrated with Verizon’s smart community infrastructure acquired by the carrier from Sensity Systems last month. Post navigation ",

      "title": "Verizon acquires LQD WiFi, provider of Palo technology hubs",
      "text": "Nov 14, 2016 12:47pm Image: LQD WiFi website \nMaking another play into smart city territory, Verizon has bought pretty much all the assets of LQD WiFi, a private company whose main product is a kiosk-style structure that looks to compete with the likes of LinkNYC. \nNew York City-based LQD offers a kiosk called Palo, which it says creates an integrated network of community technology hubs that connect, inform and support communities. The founder and CEO, Randy Ramusack, was Microsoft Switzerland’s CTO and director of Technology Policy for International Organizations from 2005 to 2012, leading global policy, strategy and partnerships with national government leaders and international organizations. \nVerizon didn’t disclose terms of the transaction, but Tech Crunch reports that LQD WiFi had raised about $1.73 million in funding from unknown investors. \nRELATED: LinkNYC access points start appearing in New York City \n\"LQD's Palo technology hubs capture Verizon's vision of delivering citizen engagement experiences by connecting people with their communities while providing critical security, transportation and wayfinding solutions as well as Wi-Fi capabilities,” Mike Lanman, senior vice president of Enterprise Products and Internet of Things at Verizon, said in a press release . “This transaction uniquely positions us to utilize our unmatched infrastructure, platforms and network at scale to deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play.\" \nPalo, from day one, was designed to be part of the community, offering Wi-Fi, public safety features and a unique, interactive community engagement platform, according to Ramusack. \n\"LQD is thrilled to join Verizon to redefine the urban space,” Ramusack stated in the release. “As a world leader in wireless technology and smart communities, Verizon's expertise, global scale, and leading media platforms will enable us to deliver on our mission to provide an unbounded flow of information to all people. By bringing Palo to the streets, we're connecting cities to their citizens, citizens to their neighborhoods, and enhancing communities across the country.” \nWith LQD's technology, Verizon said it aims to address key community needs such as fostering economic development, bridging the digital divide, facilitating transportation and traffic management and enhancing personal security and urban planning. \nLQD and Verizon are currently designing solutions for cities, private developers, academic institutions and entertainment venues. Verizon also sees opportunity to promote civic innovation and deliver data-driven solutions leveraging the open data platforms of cities. \nIt marks yet another acquisition on the part of Verizon to build its IoT business. In September, Verizon said it inked a deal to acquire Sensity Systems, a Sunnyvale, California-based startup that makes connected LED lights for smart cities. In June, Verizon announced the acquisition of Telogis, which had raised more than $126 million to back its “location intelligence platform.” And in August, Verizon announced it would spend $2.4 billion to acquire Fleetmatics, an Ireland-based company that provides GPS vehicle management and other services to companies with mobile workforces.

      "text": "Verizon \nAll of the major wireless carriers have posted their numbers for Q3 in 2016, so now we get to see what direction things are moving in. Honestly, none of the numbers should be a huge surprise to anyone since this is the way the industry have been moving for the past few years, but there might still be a couple things that shock you. \nVerizon and AT&T come in at #1 and #2 on the list, which falls into the “no duh” column. Bringing up third place sits T-Mobile who should absolutely be proud of the momentum they’re riding, especially when you look at the net adds for the carriers. \nVerizon is adding subscribers at a faster clip than AT&T, but T-Mobile is pretty significantly outpacing both of them. They’re adding postpaid customers over four times faster than Verizon and over six times faster than AT&T, which is impressive no matter how you slice. However, AT&T still has nearly twice as many customers as T-Mobile, as does Verizon. Sprint, unfortunately, didn’t post a particularly remarkable quarter in terms of growth. \nThis might shock you, though; T-Mobile is making less money per customer than any of the other major carriers. Yep, if you look at the blended ARPU which measures how much revenue each customer generates for the carrier, T-Mobile is dead last and AT&T is leading the pack. Not only is AT&T generating roughly $10 more per customer than T-Mobile, but they have roughly 65 million more customers to make money off of. \nIn T-Mobile’s defense, they were only 10 cents behind Sprint on that metric. Poor Sprint. About the Author: Jared Peters \nBorn in southern Alabama, Jared spends his working time selling phones and his spare time writing about them.

As such, we're sure that many would like to know that Best Buy has a couple of promotions on the LG G5. If you're willing to get the LG G5 on a monthly installment plan with either Verizon or Sprint, Best Buy will hand you a free $300 gift card. The retailer is also offering a free gift card when customers get the LG G5 on a monthly payment plan with AT&T, but its value if of $100, which isn't as big of an incentive. Just in case you need a refresh, the LG G5 comes with features such as a full metallic modular body, a 5.3-inch IPS display running at 1440 by 2560 pixels, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset with a quad-core Kyro CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of expandable integrated storage. In the imaging department, the LG G5 is equipped with a decent camera setup consisting out of a 16MP primary camera and a 8MP secondary sensor.

From November 17th to November 23rd, Big Red will waive the Activation Fee and Upgrade Fee. The former will cover new lines, lines added to an existing account, and lines brought over from another carrier. The latter covers devices purchased using an upgrade, including early upgrades.The Activation fee is normally $20, and the Upgrade Fee on a device purchased with the Device Payment plan is also $20. To take advantage of Verizon's largesse, you must have a 4G enabled smartphone in the Device Payment program.If you're planning on adding a line at Verizon, or upgrading to a new handset, you might want to put it off until the sale starts on November 17th.Thanks for sending this in!",

      "title": "Verizon Acquires Space Age Wi-Fi Kiosk Maker LQD",
      "text": "Verizon has ramped up its effort to create more connected cities by buying a maker of wireless hot spot kiosks for urban areas.\nLQD WiFi, acquired by the telecom giant on Monday, sells futuristic 15-foot-tall towers that can be placed on city sidewalks, in parks or elsewhere to provide Wi-Fi to people nearby along with large screens that passersby can use to look at maps, learn about tourist attractions, and get safety warnings like news of an approaching hurricane. The company is still at an early stage, but it has a deal with New Rochelle, NY to install a total of 160 of its kiosks around the city starting next spring.\nTerms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed.\nVerizon vz has been looking for new growth opportunities as its core wired and wireless telecommunications markets slow. One promising area is the growing use of connected devices, also known as the Internet of things, which includes everything from traffic sensing street lamps to self-driving cars. Still, Verizon reported only slightly more than $600 million of IoT revenue in the first nine month of the year, less than 1% of its total revenue.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nVerizon said it planned to expand LQD’s kiosks, initially created by design firm Frog Design, beyond city street deployments to schools, entertainment venues and privately run spaces. The Palo’s screens can also display advertising or other promotional content.\nThe goal is “to deploy elegant and engaging community technology hubs that connect, inform, inspire and support people where they live, work and play,” Mike Lanman, who oversees Verizon’s enterprise products and Internet of things businesses, said in a statement.\nNew Rochelle plans to use its kiosks to promote parks, cultural events and job opportunities, in addition to providing free high-speed Internet connections, city manager Charles Strome said. The kiosks will also be used to broadcast emergency messages.\nCompeting urban kiosks with a greater number of features have run into controversy. New York City replaced hundreds of pay phones with Wi-Fi hubs from LinkNYC this year. But the company had to disable an Internet browsing feature after some people used the hubs to watch pornography.\nVerizon’s smart cities effort includes many other components, such as selling smart street lamps that vary the amount light based on how many people are nearby, security cameras that can trigger alerts on their own when they detect abnormal behavior, and traffic sensors to help ease congestion.",

The smartphone comes with a fairly attractive specs sheet, even though it’s been about two and a half years since its release. If you’re shopping for an attractive water resistant handset on the cheap via Verizon, this is your best bet. \nThe Galaxy S5 comes with a 5.1-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display, a 16-megapixel rear camera, a 2-megapixel front camera, the quad-core Snapdragon 801 SoC, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of expandable storage, Android 4.4 KitKat (upgradable to Marshmallow), and a 2,800 mAh battery. The seller is offering the handset in Black and White color variants. \nThe water resistance on the handset makes it a very attractive offering for prospective buyers out there. One caveat here is that the device is only compatible with Verizon networks. But barring that, this is a pretty sweet deal.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock November 15, 2016: Markets opened mixed Tuesday as the blue chips got off to a slow start. Both the financials and real estate gave back some recent gains and the industrial sector lagged until finally breaking into the green about 90 minutes before the closing bell. The energy sector skyrocketed on a sharp increase in crude oil prices. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $45.81 a barrel, up 5.8% for the day. December gold added 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,224.50. Equities were headed for a higher close before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.24% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.71%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded down 1.25%.\nThe DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Tuesday was Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) which traded up 2.43% at $47.30. The stock’s 52-week range is $43.79 to $56.95. Trading volume was 10% above the daily average of around 13.6 million. The company had no specific news Tuesday.\nMicrosoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) traded up 2.40% at $59.11. The stock’s 52-week range is $48.04 to $61.37. Volume of roughly equal to the daily average of around 26.4 million shares. The software giant had no specific news.\nChevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) traded up 2.22% at $108.96. The stock’s 52-week range is $75.33 to $109.66, a new high set earlier this morning. Volume was about 25% above the daily average of around 6.8 million shares. The crude price surge led both DJIA energy giants to solid gains in Tuesday’s trading session.\nExxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) traded up 1.74% at $86.76. The stock’s 52-week range is $71.55 to $95.55. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 10.6 million shares. The company had no specific news Tuesday, but, like Chevron, higher crude prices are always good news.\nOf the Dow 30 stocks 18 are on track to close higher Tuesday and 12 are set to close lower.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",
