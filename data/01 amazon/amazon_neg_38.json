      "text": "A constant drumbeat of sharp headlines has heralded former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, president-elect Donald Trump’s chief strategist, as an open anti-Semite. The attack is rooted in nothing more credible than an unverified accusation by a crusading left-wing journalist, namely that Bannon had “proudly” told her five weeks earlier, “ We’re the platform for the alt-right .” To be fair, though, critics have amply demonstrated that during Bannon’s tenure Breitbart harbored some pretty noxious ideas – reflected in click-bait headlines, inflammatory columns, and virulent comment sections.\nBut have you seen the putrescence a few clicks away at Amazon.com ? Caution: examining the links below may necessitate gloves or at least hand sanitizer. Amazon’s offerings include:\n• Holy Serpent of the Jews: The Rabbis' Secret Plan for Satan to Crush Their Enemies and Vault the Jews to Global Dominion\n• It’s the Jews, Stupid! Who and What These Evil Vipers Are\n• The Ruling Elite: the Zionist Seizure of World Power\nAmazon certainly does not write all its book summaries, but they are unbylined, so inexperienced visitors might reasonably assume that – just as Marriott.com writes its own hotel descriptions – Amazon’s blurbs are the company’s. And some are shockingly indecent:\n• Gas-chamber poison Zyklon B was “merely used as a pesticide in order to improve the inmates’ health and reduce, not increase, camp mortality,” according to the site’s central summary of Breaking the Spell: The Holocaust: Myth & Reality .\n• “That certain Jews have always and still do work to establish Jewish hegemony over the world is not doubted by informed researchers,” says Amazon’s main description of the classic anti-Semitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion .\n• With the playfully named Mein Side of the Story : Key World War 2 Addresses of Adolf Hitler , the site appears to crow, “This is Hitler’s side of the story, revealed in his own spoken and written words.”\nAmazon could start to rein in hateful book descriptions fairly quickly, but cracking down on the teeming spite in user comments would be difficult. Still, the “alt-right” bile in Breitbart’s comments section is supposedly damning evidence against Steve Bannon, so consider two samples from Amazon’s hundreds of five-star blurbs praising anti-Semitic books:\n• “ God forbid these poor persecuted people get negative light for once. So innocent that they've been kicked out of over 150 countries.”\n• “Thank God someone is finally exposing the Jewish lie (the Holocaust) that has been used to enslave the world ever since WWII.”\nAnd, of course, as with most of its inventory, Amazon invites you to LOOK INSIDE! books like The Myth of German Villainy ; and it provides friendly links to other classics of Holocaust denial when you buy, say, Did Six Million Really Die ? The Truth At Last .\nAmazon’s prices for purchasing these rancid tomes are both too high and too low. Some out-of-print books cost well over a hundred dollars . Amazon is said to make between 14 percent and 40 percent on its third-party sales. Now who’s peddling anti-Semitism ? Conversely, many of the worst Jew-hating propaganda tracts like Planet Rothschild and Mein Side of the Story are available free for Kindle Unlimited digital subscribers.\nAmazon cannot sidestep responsibility for profiting off books that justify atrocities by saying the site is a public square where all content is treated equally, because it’s not. The company has removed, for example, a seduction manual on turning “no into yes” and a “how-to” guide for pedophiles . Rape and child molestation are awful, of course, but isn’t genocide against Jews at least as bad?\nIn fact, Amazon’s official policy calls “products that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance” as “ prohibited listings .” So why does Amazon profit from books it claims to prohibit? The First Amendment (“Congress shall make no law…) does not apply to private businesses, so the company can and must act swiftly to tame its feral anti-Semitic subculture. Amazon can censure – but not censor – hateful and false works by:\n1) devoting company resources to identify and ostracize them, perhaps even providing expert rebuttals;\n2) implementing site-wide boilerplate clarifications that summaries do not reflect Amazon’s opinion; and\n3) donating proceeds from their sales to Holocaust education and research. One mechanism: raise prices and lower demand through a Hatred Tax on offensive books.\nCompared to the Amazon cesspool, Breitbart’s nasty streak seems rather tame. Three of the ten “most incendiary” Breitbart headlines , according to CNN, are:\n• “Science proves it: Fat-shaming works”;\n• “Trannies whine about hilarious Bruce Jenner billboard”; and\n• “Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy.”\nOuch.\nOf course, Amazon sells Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition and Deceit , Conspiracy of the Six-Pointed Star , and The Synagogue of Satan .\nGiven its dominant market share and the diffuse nature of America’s “anti-Semitic community,” Amazon.com is almost certainly the nation’s go-to vendor of Holocaust-denying and Jew-bashing literature.\nSo why has Bannon become the poster child for Web sites that foster hate? Why not Jeff Bezos, who founded and still runs the demonstrably more pernicious Amazon? Could it be because Bezos makes political donations overwhelmingly to Democrats , spent millions of dollars to promote same-sex marriage , and has repeatedly tangled with the president-elect ?\nEither the hateful content of these Web sites is sufficient to classify both Bannon and Bezos as anti-Semites, or neither. Does Breitbart need tidying up, so it can crowd out vile voices with more constructive ones? Sure.\nBut Amazon needs a power wash.",

This is alternative to the current Tesco deal where you get Gears 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider for £199.99 which is a better deal IMO but, Im just putting this out there. maybe good for those with Amazon credit to spend etc? As an added note, MS are brilliant with these consoles for warranty so while Amazon only give 30 days on these as they are technically open box, MS will offer a full warranty when registered with them.

He had the original Fitbit band, but it kept catching on things and falling off easily. To prevent losing it, we decided to buy some bands that buckle instead.

      "text": "Review Kobo Glo HD review: This is a great e-reader for the money If you’re not an Amazon fan, the Kobo Glo HD could be the e-reader you’ve been searching for. TechHive | Nov 23, 2016 4:00 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Seamus Bellamy Learn more on Kobo eReader Store The Kobo Glo HD delivers all the features you want in an e-reader without any unnecessary bloat. We also appreciate its ability to read a diverse selection of file formats, but we have reservations about... \nThe Kobo Glo HD isn’t Rakuten’s most recent e-reader. At the time of this review, that title belonged to the Kobo Aura One. It’s not the company’s least expensive e-reader, either—that would be the Kobo Touch 2.0, which we hope to review soon. The Kobo Glo HD is, however, Rakuten’s most well-rounded E-Ink device. Priced at $130, the Glo HD incorporates many of the more desirable features of the pricey Kobo Aura One at a price point that puts it closer to Amazon’s special-offer-free Kindle Paperwhite ($140). \nPick up the Kobo Glo HD and the first thing you’ll notice is how good it feels in your hand. Its backside is covered in a layer of grippy, perforated rubber that makes the device easy to hold. On the downside, that material did prove difficult to keep clean during testing, picking up fingerprints and filth from coffee shops far more easily than the smooth plastic bodies of other e-readers we’ve tested. \nThe Kobo Glo HD measures 6.18 x 4.53 x 0.36 inches, and it weighs just over six ounces. That’s the same heft as the Kobo Aura Edition 2, but it’s lighter than Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite. So it’s no big deal to hold the Glo HD during extended reading sessions, even if you’re cursed with president-elect-sized hands. The Glo HD feels sturdy enough, but I noted a couple of issues with its build quality that caused me some concern. \nFirst, the device’s mini USB charging/data port didn’t align with the hole in the Kobo Glo HD’s cover. I’ve seen this sort of thing lead to the port becoming detached over time. Second, and less troubling, there’s a seam along both sides of the e-reader’s rubber back plate where it meets the rest of the device’s enclosure. After a couple of days, I found these seams got jammed up with debris that was floating around in my backpack and had to scrape it out with a knife. Seamus Bellamy \nhe Kobo Glo HD is as close to a Kindle Paperwhite as you can get, without buying a Kindle Paperwhite. \nAs with the rest of Rakuten’s current lineup of E-Ink devices, the Kobo Glo HD doesn’t suffer from an abundance of buttons. Most of your interactions will be made using its touchscreen, with the exception of turning it on or off. The Kobo Glo HD’s power button, which is recessed into its top, is easy to press intentionally, but difficult to hit accidentally. And as with all E-Ink devices, the Kobo Glo HD sips power. A single charge of its battery can get you through up to two months of use—though your results will vary depending on how much and how often you read. \nThe Kobo Glo HD comes with a 6.0-inch touchscreen that splits the difference between readability and energy efficiency. With resolution of 300 ppi, text appears crisp and just as legible as what you’ll see on the Kobo Aura One or on Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite, Voyage, and Oasis. And Rakuten makes it easy to tweak text size, font settings, and line spacing. Like all Kobo e-readers, the Kobo Glo HD provides 11 font choices and 48 text sizes. Font height and sharpness can be adjusted, too. I also found that JPEG and BMP files, as well as images embedded in PDFs, looked great even if they weren’t originally grayscale. \nThe Kobo Glo HD’s backlighting failed to impress me, however; in fact, it’s a complaint I have across the Kobo product line. Lighting is consistent across most of the display, but the e-reader’s normally sharp text becomes slightly blurry if the backlight is pushed beyond 40 percent. This isn’t a deal breaker, but it is disappointing. Seamus Bellamy \nThe Kobo Glo HD’s recessed button makes this e-reader difficult to turn on by accident. \nThe Kobo online ebook store isn’t as comprehensive as what Kindle users enjoy through Amazon’s Kindle ebook marketplace, but it offers a large enough variety of reading materials to keep most people happy, provided their reading tastes don’t lean towards the esoteric. And all Kobo e-readers support Pocket and OverDrive integration, allowing you borrow digital books from your local public library and read saved offline content harvested from the web. As useful as these two features are, they feel like a stopgap measure designed to compete with Amazon’s excellent subscription Kindle Unlimited Service—an all-you-can-eat book buffet. It’s also important to note that Kobo’s online store provides no access to periodicals. If you’re interested in reading newspapers or magazines on your e-reader, you’ll want to consider shopping for an Amazon device instead. Attempting to read a graphics-heavy PDF copy of Foreign Affairs on the Glo HD proved frustrating, to say the least. \nThe Kobo Glo HD can open a broad array of document and image files, including EPUB, EPUB3, PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, HTML, MOBI, PDF, TXT, HTML, RTF, CBZ and CBR—provided they’re not protected by any form of DRM. I found that the performance of these files on the e-reader varied greatly. EPUB, MOBI and text files all opened up quickly and were responsive to my input. Reading PDFs, as in the example above, was a laggy nightmare. \nNo matter what you prefer to read, the Kobo Glo HD should provide you with Ample room to store it. While it doesn’t come equipped with the ability to use removable storage like the Kobo Aura H2O does, its 4GB of internal memory is spacious enough to hold thousands of books and documents. \nThe Kobo Glo HD is a good option for those who prefer to find their reading material online, through their local library, or who just don’t like the idea of filling their electronic library with Amazon’s DRM’d content. It offers all of the features most people might find desirable in an e-reader, without any of the unneeded bloat.

      "text": "In a bid to meet increasing demand for online shopping in the upcoming holiday season, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) announced its plan to build its third Nevada fulfillment center in North Las Vegas.\nThe other two existing Nevada fulfillment centers are located in Reno and North Las Vegas. These employ more than 1,500 full-time hourly associates.\nAccording to Amazon, the new facility spanning 800,000 square feet will create more than 1,000 full-time jobs. It will focus primarily on larger consumer items such as big screen televisions, kayaks and patio furniture.\nAmazon stated that it pays competitive wages and gives healthcare and other full-time benefits. In addition, the company offers programs like Career Choice to help employees pursue courses related to fields that are in demand.\nFulfillment centers are giant warehouses that help online retailers store and ship products and handle returns quickly. These are important for providing the level of service that customers have come to expect from Amazon.\nOver the past few years, Amazon has invested heavily in setting up fulfillment centers across the country to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. The need to expand fulfillment centers has been fuelled by growing demand for online shopping. Prompt and accurate delivery of products is crucial to the success of online retail companies.\nIn our view, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share while expanding globally to retain its leading position. For this, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates.\nThough increased expenses could hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe these are necessary to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market.\nAMAZON.COM INC Price \n \nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote \nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include Cognex Corporation ( CGNX - Free Report ) , Itron, Inc. ( ITRI - Free Report ) and Teradyne Inc. ( TER - Free Report ) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nCognex Corporation delivered a positive earnings surprise of 24.92% in the trailing four quarters.\nItron, Inc. delivered a positive earnings surprise of 30.55%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\nTeradyne Inc. delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.26% in the trailing four quarters.\nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit \nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

      "text": "With its desirable features, pocketable size, and reasonable price tag, Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite has been a safe bet to gift or recommend to voracious readers since 2012. After its most recent design refresh, Amazon’s mid-range e-reader rivals e-readers that cost considerably more.\n\nThe third-generation Kindle Paperwhite measures 6.3 x 4.5 x 0.36 inches, and it weighs just over 7.0 ounces, whether you opt for one with Wi-Fi or with both Wi-Fi and 3G. That makes it heavier than Amazon’s pricier Kindle Oasis and Kindle Voyage, but lighter than the larger Kobo Aura One or Amazon’s $80 vanilla and feature-lite Kindle. For the first time, Amazon is offering the Paperwhite in white, as well as black. This, along with the a more matte look for the e-reader’s logo and a rubberized back plate are the only notable cosmetic changes this time around.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "The $130 Kobo Aura Edition 2 e-reader is an odd duck. It occupies the mid-point in the Kobo product line, and it boasts such desirable features as backlighting, long battery life, and the ability to open a diverse array of file types. But a number of e-readers, including the Kobo Glo HD, deliver many of the same features—plus higher resolution—for nearly the same price.\n\nMeasuring 6.26 x 4.45 x 0.33 inches, the Kobo Aura Edition 2 boasts lightly smaller dimensions than the 2015 iteration of Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite. It’s lighter than the Paperwhite, too, weighing 6.35 ounces versus 7.5 ounces. This, along with its grippy, textured back, makes holding the Kobo Aura Edition 2 more comfortable for extended reading sessions. There is a drawback to that smaller size, however; the bezel around its display is atypically shallow, so I found myself accidentally turning pages when my thumb would drift over to its touch-sensitive display. That’s irritating.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the “hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book” and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \n ",

By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Amazon jammed a number of great features $80 entry-level Kindle e-reader ($100 if you want to be free of Amazon’s “special offers”). It’s lighter than the combined weight of the company’s Oasis flagship with its battery cover attached, and with no backlight to power, it can run for far longer than more capable e-readers—a month or more, depending on your reading habits. And did we mention its sub-$100 price tag? Unfortunately, after spending the last several weeks using one, I don’t believe any of those perks compensate for this new Kindle’s copious shortcomings.\n\nWeighing a mere 5.7 ounces and measuring 6.3 x 4.5 x 0.36 inches, the 2016 Kindle is light and compact enough to allow for long, comfortable reading sessions, even if you’re holding it with one hand. It feels surprisingly sturdy, too. I love the more-expensive Kindle Oasis for its size and weight, but I live in constant fear of dropping it or discovering that the heavier stuff it shares space in my backpack with has destroyed it. Not so the latest Kindle. It should survive most casual abuse, but be aware that it’s waterproof or even water resistant.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Rakuten Kobo Aura Edition 2 TechHive Rating Learn more on Kobo eReader Store With other, more capable e-readers available at around the same price, we can’t think of any reason why anyone should invest in the Kobo Aura Edition 2. Consider buying it if you find it on sale.... \nThe $130 Kobo Aura Edition 2 e-reader is an odd duck. It occupies the mid-point in the Kobo product line, and it boasts such desirable features as backlighting, long battery life, and the ability to open a diverse array of file types. But a number of e-readers, including the Kobo Glo HD, deliver many of the same features—plus higher resolution—for nearly the same price. \nMeasuring 6.26 x 4.45 x 0.33 inches, the Kobo Aura Edition 2 boasts lightly smaller dimensions than the 2015 iteration of Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite. It’s lighter than the Paperwhite, too, weighing 6.35 ounces versus 7.5 ounces. This, along with its grippy, textured back, makes holding the Kobo Aura Edition 2 more comfortable for extended reading sessions. There is a drawback to that smaller size, however; the bezel around its display is atypically shallow, so I found myself accidentally turning pages when my thumb would drift over to its touch-sensitive display. That’s irritating. Seamus Bellamy \nThe Edition 2’s display is adequate, but it is neither as bright nor as legible as other similarly priced e-readers. \nThe 212 ppi resolution isn’t impressive either. It’s considerably lower than the top-shelf Kobo Aura One and the Kobo Glo HD, which costs just $10 more. Those e-readers boast 300 ppi resolution, as do all three of Amazon’s best Kindles. I read Earnest Hemingway’s For Whom The Bell Tolls on both the Aura Edition 2 and the 2015 Kindle Paperwhite, and while I didn’t experience eyestrain after reading the Kobo, I couldn’t get past how poor the Edition 2’s text looked in comparison to Amazon’s e-reader. The Paperwhite’s page transitions seem smoother, too. I haven’t liked any of the Kobo’s backlights, which render text murky when they’re cranked up. It’s almost like reading through a film. The Kobo Aura Edition 2’s backlight is much brighter at maximum brightness than the Paperwhite’s at its max, but there’s not much of a difference at the lower levels that most people will actually use. \nThe Kobo Aura Edition 2 provides 4GB of internal storage; unlike some of the other Kobo models, there’s no microSD card slot that would allow you to add to that. Still, the only time that might be a concern is if your reading habits entail loading up on larger files, such as PDFs. Like the rest of the Kobo, this model can read a broad range of document types, including CBR, CBZ, EPUB, EPUB3, HTML, MOBI, PDF, RTF, and TXT, as well as BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF image files. Just don’t expect this e-reader to render them quickly, particularly if you’re reading graphics-laden PDFs or examining high-resolution JPEGs. Flipping through such pages can be a lag-filled nightmare. Oh well, at least you won’t have to worry about the battery conking out mid session, it’s rated to last up to two months with moderate use. I’ve found this estimate to be accurate. Seamus Bellamy \nThe Kobo Aura Edition 2’s power button is tucked up in the corner of the device’s textured plastic back plate. \nBut here’s the thing: at $120, the Kobo Aura Edition 2 costs almost as much as an ad-free Kindle Paperwhite, which delivers a higher-resolution display. If you’re not in love with the idea of owning an Amazon device, the Kobo Glo HD is a much better value than the Kobo Aura Edition 2. Buy it instead.

But we recommend paying a little extra to avoid Amazon's \"special offers\" option that puts ads on the Paperwhite's... \nWith its desirable features, pocketable size, and reasonable price tag, Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite has been a safe bet to gift or recommend to voracious readers since 2012. After its most recent design refresh, Amazon’s mid-range e-reader rivals e-readers that cost considerably more. \nThe third-generation Kindle Paperwhite measures 6.3 x 4.5 x 0.36 inches, and it weighs just over 7.0 ounces, whether you opt for one with Wi-Fi or with both Wi-Fi and 3G. That makes it heavier than Amazon’s pricier Kindle Oasis and Kindle Voyage, but lighter than the larger Kobo Aura One or Amazon’s $80 vanilla and feature-lite Kindle. For the first time, Amazon is offering the Paperwhite in white, as well as black. This, along with the a more matte look for the e-reader’s logo and a rubberized back plate are the only notable cosmetic changes this time around. \nNo matter the lighting conditions, you’ll find the Paperwhite to be infinitely legible. Like its more expensive siblings, the Paperwhite houses a 6.0-inch, 300 ppi E-Ink display. Onscreen text appears as sharp as the text you’ll find in any dead tree-edition book. Four side-mounted LEDs light the display, to ensure that the text is readable in any environment, be it while perusing a book on the beach or reading in your darkened bedroom while your partner sleeps next to you. We found the lighting to be fairly consistent with only a small amount of shading in the top and bottom corners. The Kindle Voyage and Oasis offer more even display lighting, thanks to the presence of more LEDs, but they cost considerably more. Seamus Bellamy \nThe Kindle Paperwhite has the same amount of storage and the same display resolution as the Kindle Oasis, but at a fraction of the cost. \nIn addition to the clarity that the Paperwhite’s display and lighting afford, Amazon’s type engine ensures that readers who require larger text in order to read comfortably, prefer a different font than the default one their book was downloaded with, or who prefer different line spacing (depending on whether or not the document can support it) are accommodated. It even supports OpenDyslexic—a typeface designed to mitigate some of the issues that can cause dyslexic individuals reading difficulties. \nThat covers how you’ll read on the Paperwhite. Now, let’s talk about what you’ll read. \nWith 4GB of onboard memory, the Kindle Paperwhite has the capacity to store thousands of books—a definite win for anyone taking a long trip off the grid. Amazon’s collection of available electronic publications is arguably the largest in the world. The bad news is that any book you purchase from the Kindle Store is DRM protected—locking you into using Amazon’s devices and apps in order to read them. The good news is that Amazon makes it possible to share your purchased content with your family members. If your reading habits border on the voracious, it’s also possible to sign up for Amazon’s all-you-can-read Kindle Unlimited service for $10 per month. You can also borrow books from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, and Amazon Prime members can read books in the Prime Reading catalog at not additional cost. \nAs for content from outside of Amazon’s walled library, anyone with a computer can transfer DOC/DOCX, ePub, MOBI, PDF, RTF, and TXT files to their Kindle via USB—but the reading experience for such documents typically isn’t as smooth as what you’ll get from publications curated by Amazon. It’s also possible to wirelessly download Instapaper clippings to the Paperwhite. Interacting with the service on the device, however, leaves much to be desired. Seamus Bellamy \nAs with many e-readers these days, the Kindle Paperwhite has no physical buttons except the one used to power it on and off. \nNavigating between Amazon-purchased materials and other publications is significantly easier, due to the Kindle’s touch-friendly interface. One exception to this is the UI’s on-screen keyboard, which is slow to respond to input when searching your collection, browsing the Kindle Store for a new book, or entering a Wi-Fi password. But this isn’t unique to the Paperwhite. Amazon’s other e-readers suffer from the same issue. \nOn average, reading for a few hours a day with the e-reader’s backlight set at 40 percent, I found that I was able to squeeze around a month out of a single charge of the Paperwhite’s battery. That’s a respectable amount of juice for an E-Ink device. \nThere’s not much to dislike about the Kindle Paperwhite—it excels at fulfilling its raison d’être. It’s perhaps 80 percent as capable as more sophisticated e-readers—the Kobo Aura One and the Kindle Oasis, for example—which cost far more. There’s still room for improvement \nDespite the fact that its display lighting levels are adjustable, the latest Paperwhite lacks the ambient light sensor that would enable it to automatically adjust its luminosity according to ambient conditions. It’s also worth mentioning that if you’re upgrading from one of Amazon’s older Kindle keyboard e-readers, you might be disappointed to discover that the Paperwhite—along with the rest of Amazon’s current lineup of E-Ink devices—lacks the capability to play sound; audiobook lovers need not apply. Finally, unlike earlier Kindles or Amazon’s Kindle Voyage and Kindle Oasis, the Paperwhite lacks physical buttons. To ‘turn’ a page, it’s necessary to tap or stroke the display. While not a deal breaker, it makes reading one-handed something of a pain. \nFinally, while you can get a Wi-Fi enabled Paperwhite for $120, it comes burdened with Amazon’s ‘special offers,’ a euphemism for advertisements plastered on the device’s lock screen. The only way to avoid the ads is to pay an additional $20, either up front or down the road. If you’re offended by this, check out the Kobo Glo. It can’t match the wide variety of paid and free reading options available for the Kindle, but you won’t have to pay a ransom to avoid ads. \nMSRP for the model we reviewed—with Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity and without special offers—is $210. The same e-reader with special offers and Wi-Fi only is priced at $140, while the Wi-Fi model with special offers goes for $120.

The company has been particularly focused on talking with sports broadcasters in recent months , conducting conversations with the NFL, NBA, and MLB in regards to including live sports as a centerpiece of the service. Pricing for such a service would be unclear, but the goal would be to encourage people to sign up for Amazon's $99-a-year Prime program, which already includes on demand streaming.",

      "text": "Getty Images An employee arrange items for distribution at the Amazon fulfillment center in Spain. Amazon.com sellers have for years e-mailed Jeff Bezos personally when they were unable to resolve their problems elsewhere.\nJeff@amazon.com has evidently been overburdened by complaints.\nFrom a surge in counterfeiting and a constant fear of suspensions to sudden policy changes that left sellers sitting on mounds of inventory, it's been a tumultuous year for merchants. As consumers prepare to open their wallets for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, sellers are on edge. \n\nChris McCabe, a former Amazon employee who now helps suspended sellers get reinstated and stay compliant, has in the past resorted to forwarding cases to Bezos when the standard seller support route failed. Elevating cases to the CEO's office no longer leads to quick resolution.\n\"Messages to Jeff are now resulting in the same canned generic responses,\" said McCabe, who worked at Amazon from 2007 to 2012. \"That's becoming just an ordinary queue.\" \n\nWelcome to holiday madness, 2016. \nshow chapters Amazon counterfeits threat to businesses      Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 4:46 PM ET | 03:55 Here's the version that Amazon is touting. \nIn a press release on Thursday, the Seattle-based company said that it's gearing up for a \"record-setting\" season by making more products on the third-party marketplace available to Prime members and providing tools to help sellers ship items faster. \nThe marketplace of small businesses and entrepreneurs now accounts for half of all units sold. Amazon has rolled out tools to let those merchants submit deals, adjust pricing to meet market demand and promote items on the mobile app. Sellers include brand creators, private label owners and retailers of other people's products. \n\"We're dedicated to making the fulfillment technology that Amazon develops available to sellers,\" Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace, said in the release. \nWhile that all may be true, many sellers describe an environment of chaos that's designed solely for the benefit of consumers. \nHaving the widest selection at the lowest prices with the fastest shipping leaves buyers with a diminishing reason to shop elsewhere and sellers increasingly reliant on Amazon. The site accounts for 38 percent of U.S. consumer e-commerce, according to Slice Intelligence . \nOnline sales is expected to jump 17 percent this holiday season, compared with 3.3 percent for all of retail, according to data from eMarketer . At $94.7 billion, e-commerce will represent 10.7 percent of the total, the highest ever. \nFor Fred Ruckel, the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving have been punishing. Ruckel is the creator of the Ripple Rug , a cat activity mat. Sales of Ripple Rug, long a best seller in its niche category, have plunged 85 percent in the past two weeks since Amazon took over the listing page, altering the text and eliminating all but one of the photos. \nAmazon shares An Amazon representative told Ruckel the company assumed control to improve the listing. Instead, Ruckel said the changes were \"immediately detrimental.\" He's yet to get an explanation. \n\"I have called every single day since losing control,\" Ruckel said in an e-mail, adding that he's sold 10,000 units on Amazon this year. \"Biggest holiday week and I cannot even say 'makes the perfect gift.' So bizarre.\" \nAmazon didn't offer CNBC.com a response to Ruckel's story. A spokesperson said in an e-mail that, \"We think of sellers as customers. Our dedicated Seller Support team is available 24x7 to assist sellers by investigating issues and taking the appropriate actions.\" \nAmazon is closing out November on a tear, with the stock having bounced back from a postelection slump. The company is poised for record profit and its fastest year of sales growth since 2011. \nShare prices have gained 16 percent this year, closing on Tuesday at $785.33. \nInvestors aren't paying much attention to the darker side of Amazon, the one that's rife with infringement and seller complaints so familiar to Ruckel and McCabe. \nCounterfeiting has become such a problem that Amazon filed its first two lawsuits ever against infringers last week. In October, Apple filed a lawsuit against a seller of knock-off chargers and cables on Amazon. \nIn addition to legal action, Amazon has tried clamping down on infringement by forcing third-party sellers to show proof that they're selling authorized products of big brands like Nike and Hasbro. The company is also suspending sellers at a hastened pace. \n\"It's like a zombie you can't kill.\" -Lesley Hensell, partner at eGrowth Partners At eGrowth Partners, an Amazon sellers' advocate, business has doubled this month, said Lesley Hensell, a partner at the Dallas-based firm. Suspended sellers are seeking reinstatement, and other clients are aiming to get certain products relisted after Amazon booted them for various reasons.\nA recent development, according to Hensell, is an \"at-risk\" alert that sellers are seeing for items deemed unsafe or inauthentic. On their dashboard merchants can see metrics related to their performance, including how many problematic items they've sold based on user feedback.\n\nHensell said these notifications could be helpful, serving as early warnings of what needs to be fixed. However, she said many of the alerts are referring to old issues that her clients already settled in recent months. So instead of providing clarity they're just causing confusion.\n\"It's particularly frustrating for our clients,\" Hensell said. \"They paid us money, we got them cleared, and now all of the sudden it's back. It's like a zombie that you can't kill.\" \n\nOf course, there's still plenty of potential prosperity for businesses on Amazon. The user base of 300 million-plus keeps growing, and Amazon continues entering new markets, whether its custom printed T-shirts , groceries or automobile research.\nshow chapters Amazon looking into live sports package: Reports      22 Hours Ago | 03:21 In 2015, Amazon introduced Launchpad, a site to help start-ups get discovered and to give customers access to a broader array of products. As part of the rollout, Amazon partnered with CircleUp , a site that independent retail brands use to raise money from investors. \nCircleUp currently has 141 products on Launchpad, including leak-proof reusable bags from BlueAvocado, infant cereal from NurturMe and a Belle Chevre do-it-yourself cheese kit.\n\n\"Amazon has dramatically lowered the cost of distribution, enabling more small brands to reach huge audiences,\" said Ryan Caldbeck, CEO of San Francisco-based CircleUp. It's also forcing traditional stores to support start-ups because \"if they don't, these big retailers will lose sales as people go to Amazon for a wide variety,\" he said. \nNo matter the category, merchants have to be more vigilant about protecting their brand on Amazon as well as promoting it. \nOn Cyber Monday 2015, sellers received orders for over 23 million items, an increase of more than 40 percent from the prior year, Amazon said. Competition for visibility is fierce, and consumers are increasingly starting their search at Amazon, not Google . \nAdd it all up and Amazon is becoming a big advertising business. Ad sales are predicted to climb 9.1 percent this year to $1.3 billion, according to eMarketer, as sellers seek prime placement in a crowded market.\nWorldwide digital ad revenue Click to edit 2015 2016 2017 Google $53.05 $63.11 $72.69 Facebook $17.08 $25.94 $33.76 Yahoo $3.32 $2.98 $3.00 Microsoft $2.75 $3.16 $3.54 Twitter $1.99 $2.26 $2.53 Verizon $1.34 $1.41 $1.47 Amazon $0.94 $1.21 $1.32 Source: eMarketer \"It's silently becoming an advertising giant,\" said Alasdair McLean-Foreman, CEO of Teikametrics, whose software helps Amazon sellers manage shipments, optimize restocking and run ads. \"It shifts the economics, and now you're paying to get first-page placement.\"\nThe frustration for many sellers is that their costs continue to rise because of the competition, but Amazon isn't fixing their problems. \nAs long as the company keeps serving customers with more products and now content at the best prices, seller issues will likely stay on the backburner. \nThat's the Bezos way. He's obsessed with pleasing the buyer, and according to experts who study brand affinity, Amazon is doing that job exceedingly well.\n\"The health of the customer relationship overall is very solid,\" said Steve Beck, managing partner of management consultancy cg42. \"Trust in the brand is very high.\"",

This applies to all platforms – that’s PC, PS4, and Xbox One. \nThe offer is available from Amazon directly, but doesn’t extend to the digital versions of any of the three platforms. Digital codes are on sale, but nowhere near as low as $10. \nTake a look at all three deals from here: PC , PS4 , Xbox One . \nThe Division’s second DLC, Survival, came out this week on PC and Xbox One.

The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Published:",

      "title": "Amazon Echo Dot 2nd gen review: A delightful and cheap way to get started with voice assistants",
      "text": "9 Surprising value for the money \nAmazon's Echo success took me a little by surprise. It seemed like we went overnight from questioning the idea of a voice assistant in a speaker to almost everyone owning an Echo and companies rushing to add Alexa support for their services and products. Part of what seemed like a quick success is due to the Echo Dot, the smaller cheaper version that you can sprinkle around the house in places where you don't care about excellent sound quality. \nThe second generation Echo Dot builds on that. Unlike the first one, you can order it directly from Amazon without having to use another Echo. It also has better voice recognition and it's cheaper at $49.99. At that price, it isn't hard to imagine grabbing one for the kitchen, a couple of rooms, and maybe even the hallway, especially because thanks to Echo Spatial Perception (ESP), different Echo devices will work together to only answer from the one nearest to the voice issuing the command. \nI've had one Echo Dot for more than a month now and I've been able to test it out through different scenarios. The short answer is that I'm impressed and I think it's easily the cheapest way to get into voice-controlled assistance. But before I get on with this review, I feel like I should point out a couple of things. One, I don't have a Google Home device yet (I'm getting one soon), so I can't compare the two just yet. Two, I don't have several Echo devices, so I couldn't test the ESP or see how they work together in a multi-room setup. Three, I'm using the Echo Dot in Lebanon, but it's only available officially in the US, UK, and Germany, so a couple of features didn't work as expected. They're pretty minor, though. \nAnd four, yes, I know this is an always-listening device and there are lots of privacy concerns about this kind of technology. I don't have an answer or excuse for that. I guess you either decide the convenience is more important to you than the small risk of potential misuse, or you don't. That's your choice and I'm not about to try to convince you of my point of view. The Good At $49.99, this is in impulse-buy territory. Bluetooth input and output You can use the Echo Dot as a speaker for your phone, or send audio from the Dot to another speaker via Bluetooth. You can also control Bluetooth playback coming from your phone with audio commands. Standard ports MicroUSB and 3.5mm plugs are used for power and audio-out. No need for any proprietary cables. Color LEDs When it's listening, playing, muted, or in any state, the colored LEDs are cool. Great microphone It picks up my voice from across a 450sqft room, without shouting. Decent sound For its size, the Echo Dot makes a surprisingly decent desk speaker. Mute button Stop the Dot from listening to you whenever you need some privacy. Family friendly Adding household members lets you benefit from everyone's media collection and manage joint to-do and shopping lists. Versatile Use it as Bluetooth speaker, a connected WiFi speaker, a voice controlled assistant, or a music streaming \"stick\" connected to a bigger speaker. Alexa skills Thanks to IFTTT and first-party Alexa integrations, it's easy to get plenty of hardware and services to play nice with the Dot. The Not So Good The lower side of the Dot attracts lint and dust like a magnet. Alexa app It's just a web wrapper. Everything takes way more time than it should were the app native. Triggers but not actions You can use Alexa to trigger home automation skills directly or through IFTTT, but you can't have Alexa react to something that happens by playing a chime or notifying you of an event. No central Alexa command list There should be a list of commands you can ask your Echo based on the skills you have enabled, instead of checking each skill separately to see its possible commands. Timer audio is the same All timers play the same audio cue when the time is up, so if you set several ones, there's no way to know which one is up. Hardware design and build \nThe second generation Echo Dot ships in a small box that's about the size of the Dot itself, with a charger, a MicroUSB cable, and a couple of manuals. \nThe Dot is a short cylinder that looks more like a puck than a speaker. It's 3.3\" wide (approx. 8.4cm) and 1.3\" tall (approx. 3.3cm) so it's very easy to blend it in any décor, whether it's a desk, a console, a countertop, a beside table, or any other setting. \nThe top houses the buttons: volume up and down, mute, and an action button to trigger Alexa on demand. It also has the openings for the 7-microphone array and speaker. The colored ring that lights up is all around the top's circumference. \nThe sides are relatively clean. There's an Amazon logo on the front, a MicroUSB and 3.5mm plug on the back. The former is used to power up the Dot, the latter lets you connect it to a standalone speaker if you want more sound power out of your setup. \nThe bottom of the Echo Dot is a rubber material that works well for gripping it to any surface and not letting it slide out of its place. However, it's a huge dust and lint magnet. Good thing you can wipe it out easily with a slightly damp towel. \nThe colored ring on the top lights up with different LED patterns depending on what the Dot is doing. It's red when muted, white when you're manually adjusting the volume, blue with a little bit of turquoise when it's listening, and it rotates blue and turquoise as it processes any query. There are more color patterns, but these are the ones you're most likely to come across. \nOverall, the shape and design of the Echo Dot are nothing to talk about — and that's a good thing. The colored LEDs are the most flashy part of the hardware and I think they add an air of futurism. The Dot doesn't look or feel flimsy, and it doesn't attract any attention. The size is appropriate for what it is being marketed toward (namely small rooms or connected to bigger speaker systems). Echo Dot 2nd generation next to the Bose SoundLink Mini II Echo Dot and Alexa setup \nSetting up the Echo Dot second generation involves grabbing the Alexa app from the Play Store , signing up with your Amazon account, adding a new Echo device, and choosing the WiFi network you want the Dot to connect to. Here are a few screenshots from the process. Next Voice training \nOne of the first things you'll have to do once Alexa is set up with your Echo is voice train it to recognize the way you speak. I have an American accent, so I could easily get it to understand what I was saying. For the longest time, Alexa (and thus the Echo) could only understand the US accent, but with Echo devices being sold in the UK and Germany now, support has been added for British English and German. That means more people can get Alexa to recognize their queries. \nI don't have a lot of trouble communicating with Alexa. Voice recognition might be faster and a bit more accurate with OK Google, but Alexa is no slouch. Although I suffered through a few false \"Alexa\" wake-ups, since I speak Arabic around the pharmacy and some phonetic combinations in Arabic can potentially sound like \"Alexa,\" most of the time I was able to trigger Alexa on demand, even from the opposite corner of my store's 450sqft (approx. 42sqm) main room. It even picks up what I say when I speak a little louder while inside the adjacent stock room. Left: Sometimes Alexa has trouble understanding what I say. Right: But most days, we're good. Introduction to the Alexa app \nAlthough most of your interaction with the Echo Dot happens with voice, there's an important text-based component within the Alexa app. On Android (and based on the screenshots, also on iOS), the app is nothing but a web wrapper. And that's a huge letdown. It takes longer than necessary to do anything, because you're always waiting for a webpage to load. Even on a 4G connection, the app is slow. Opening the menu, switching to another section, changing the settings, adding a skill, any of these take a few seconds too long. I even encountered several instances where the app decided I didn't have a connection, although I was obviously on 4G. Closing and reopening it solved the problem, but that's not an issue that should happen in the first place if the app was native. \nWith that said, let's take a look at the Alexa app ( sigh , \"app\" feels weird to say in this case). The home page is where you'll find the cards with all of your voice query history and a few hints whenever necessary. \nThe side menu lets you jump to the different app sections, including Now Playing , Skills , Settings , and the Things to Try list of voice actions to give to Alexa. \nThe list of previous voice commands on the home page takes the form of expandable cards that you can use to view more information about your query, delete a specific command from your history, and even revisit should you miss Alexa's answer or not fully understand what she said. Alexa settings and customized options \nThe Settings page is probably where you'll spend the most time in the Alexa app at first. This is where you get to personalize Alexa and the Echo Dot to your liking. It's divided into a couple of sections for the Echo devices linked to your account and then your account preferences in general. Echo settings \nStarting with the settings for your Echo devices, there's a lot you can change, including the WiFi network they connect to, pairing a remote, changing the name, choosing an address and location, a default language, the temperature and distance units, and de-registering said Echo device from your account. \nThe Echo Dot can get pretty loud if you set it to the highest volume, so I chose volume 7-8 in general for all notifications, alarms, and timers. You can make the Echo Dot play a sound whenever it gets triggered and when it stops listening to you, but I turned that off. It can be useful if your Echo Dot is hidden in a cabinet connected to a bigger speaker, or if you're often issuing commands without looking at it, but I placed it on my desk, so I always have line-of-sight access to its colored ring of lights. \nOh and if you don't like saying \"Alexa,\" you can change it to \"Amazon\" or \"Echo.\" I think Alexa is the most personal, whereas Echo is a bit meta and punny (you say echo and echo answers back, geddit?). Amazon just does nothing for me. So I stuck with Alexa . Thankfully, that name isn't very popular around here. \nOne of the most surprising features of the Echo, I have to admit, was its Bluetooth capability. I knew it had Bluetooth support, but I wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out that you can both receive and send audio via Bluetooth, which means that you can use the Echo Dot as a speaker for your phone, or send audio wirelessly from it (Spotify, Amazon Music, TuneIn, etc) to another speaker. Receiving audio from my S7 Edge, but it can also send audio to the Bose SoundLink. \nThanks to this, the Dot became an impromptu desk speaker for my phone. I love listening to music while I work, so when the source is local music or Google Play Music, I can easily say \"Alexa, connect to my phone,\" and the Echo will find my S7 Edge and start playing the music coming from it. The awesome thing is that I can control playback with voice commands too. \"Alexa, pause,\" \"Alexa, volume 6,\" \"Alexa, play,\" \"Alexa, next,\" they all work with Bluetooth audio coming from my phone, regardless of the app being used. I tested it with locally saved podcasts on Pocket Casts, and streamed music from Google Play Music and Spotify. \nSurprisingly, this feature makes the Echo family one of the best Bluetooth speakers/receivers for Android devices. I can imagine someone buying a regular Echo or connecting an Echo Dot to a more powerful speaker via a 3.5mm cable, and using them as voice-controlled Bluetooth speakers for their Android phones. Music services and list managers \nBack to the Alexa service settings, you can choose which music services and list managers you prefer. Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn are supported directly on the Echo devices (the last one doesn't require an account), and you can pick a default service between them all, which is cool because I don't feel like specifying \"on Spotify\" each time I issue a music playback command. \nAs for task managers, Amazon can manage your to-dos and shopping lists by itself, but you can also integrate with Any.do or Todoist. As an avid user of the latter, I immediately jumped on that. Other settings \nPlenty of other things can be customized with Alexa. You can choose a calendar provider, different sources of news for your daily flash briefing including NPR, the weather, and more. \nAlexa also lets you follow your favorite teams from a few supported leagues. Most of them are American, given that the Echo family was officially available only in the USA for a long time and has just crossed the pond to the UK and Germany. Adding a team from an unsupported league - say Real Madrid from La Liga - doesn't work, but Alexa might answer a few questions about that team if it's also playing in a supported league (Champion's League). Can't you live in the US and follow Barcelona? Or be in the UK and love Inter Milan? Ugh. Amazon really needs to pick up on the team selection. Support for Formula1 and Tennis would also be quite appreciated. \nOne of the last few things you can change are your addresses for the traffic update and extending invitations to family members to access their media content too and manage joint task and shopping lists. Alexa Skills \nSkills are the heart of Alexa's smarts. After opening up development to everyone, the number of skills has ballooned significantly and it's been a bit rough to find good skills among all the ones available, so thank goodness for the new full Amazon.com pages that made them easier to browse. \nInside the Alexa app, you can check popular skills, browse by categories, and view the Skills you have activated. I've linked Alexa to my Blink security cameras, my Fitbit account, my Wink Hub 2, and enabled a couple of other skills like Bartender and Lyrical. \nAdding a skill is as easy as tapping to enable it, signing in with your account if necessary, and approving the connection to Amazon and Alexa. \nEach skill page inside the app shows you a list of available commands, so you can consult that should you forget what to say to get Alexa to answer you. That page is also where you can disable the command. And whenever you trigger a skill, you get a card in the home feed with Alexa's answer. Left & Middle: Blink and Fitbit skill pages. Right: Home card for Fitbit voice query. \nAs I used the Dot more and more, and added a few more skills to Alexa, I kept wishing for a centralized list of commands that I can issue to my Dot. Each developer can implement voice commands in a certain way and I had trouble remembering the exact wording of some specific queries, so I often found myself digging into the app, looking for the skill in question, and opening its page to see the command. It would be very easy for Amazon to add a central list of voice queries that automatically updates based on what's enabled on your account. Smart home \nThere's also a separate smart home component inside the Alexa app, but it can only control lights and thermostats. I don't have a thermostat, and I am still waiting for my GE Z-Wave lights to ship from Amazon, so for the time being, I couldn't use Alexa for any smart home automation tasks. \nThe thing to remember though is that even if Alexa doesn't officially support any smart home devices and groups that aren't lights or thermostats, the IFTTT integration allows you to create any rule to automate any supported gadgets. With IFTTT applets, I was able to trigger my Wink Hub's shortcuts via voice commands and even get Alexa to play music on my S7 Edge. There's a lot more to try and discover, I'm just scratching the surface here. A few IFTTT Alexa applets I've enabled. Echo Dot as... A full-time always-on assistant \nIf you ask Echo device owners, I'm sure many will tell you that they love using their speakers in the kitchen. For setting up timers, managing tasks, adding items to the shopping list, listening to recipe steps, and enjoying to music while they work, the Echo and its smaller Dot sibling are just perfect. \nIt's very easy to get Alexa to set up different timers for you, but the letdown is that the sound notification at the end is the same. So if you've set 30 minutes for the pie, took a bit of time to prepare the steak and then set 12 minutes for it, you won't know which one is done when the timer rings. Unless you know how long it took you to prepare the steak after setting the pie's timer, you can't tell if the timer is for one or the other. \nShopping and task list management is, thankfully, a bit more straightforward. You can rely on Amazon to add and organize things for you, or you can integrate with a service like Todoist or Any.Do. I use the former and I've found it works very well with Amazon. Alexa created a shopping list in my Todoist for itself and any item I add through a voice command gets sent to it. I can mark it as done either in Todoist or in the Alexa app, and the action gets reflected on the other one. Managing tasks is the same, except they get sent to Todoist's Inbox, and I was happy to see that I could specify due dates in my voice command and Todoist would interpret them well. \nIt's also very easy to use the Echo Dot to stay on top of news through the Flash Briefing, to ask about the weather, traffic, time in different cities and countries if you work with people across timezones, and even get general knowledge info, stay on top of your Fitbit goals, and more. \nAs a full-time voice assistant, the Echo Dot sitting on my desk has been doing a good job of keeping me on task several times during the day. I don't need to interrupt my writing or work to know whether Artem and David are about to wake up, I just ask Alexa what time it is in California. I don't need to open Todoist to add a task that I just remembered or that just popped up, I just ask Alexa to do it. Writing articles about deals or gadget releases in different currencies is a lot easier by letting Alexa do the conversions for me while I keep typing on my keyboard with zero interruptions. And I don't forget hot water brewing on the stovetop for my tea because I just set a timer for 10 minutes and Alexa rings to remind me. A music speaker \nI've already gushed over how oddly convenient the Echo Dot has been as a desk speaker. I love telling Alexa to connect or disconnect from my phone so I can play music over Bluetooth from it, but what I love even more is controlling playback by initiating it (\"trigger play music on my phone\" through an IFTTT command), and then pausing, stopping, handling the volume, and more, all with just voice commands. \nThe Dot has other music capabilities though. On its own, it can connect to Spotify, Amazon Music, and a few other services. I linked it to my Spotify account and was able to either trigger playback on the Dot directly through a voice command or by sending music to it from my phone thanks to Spotify Connect: the Dot shows up as an available device ready to get in on the action. \nIf you don't want to use the Spotify app, the Alexa app has a pretty barebones music player too. It shows the now playing song, lets you control volume and set up shuffle and repeat modes, and lists your music listening history on the Dot. The queue, however, doesn't seem to work with Spotify: you only get the currently playing song. \nI also love the TuneIn integration, although it has some quirks. Getting to play local radio stations without a radio felt a bit like magic, especially since I didn't need a TuneIn account and the playback was flawless with nary a break or buffer even when my connection was very slow. The only hiccup was my struggle to say some station names, specifically ones that have an Arabic name or ones that share the same name with other stations. Alexa had no trouble recognizing \"NRJ Lebanon,\" but there are so many stations named \"Mix FM\" and no way to tell it which one I wanted. \nWhile the sound quality is nothing to write about, the Echo Dot doesn't have anything to be ashamed of. It gets pretty loud and doesn't really distort. It's better than my S7 Edge's built-in speaker and is definitely the most convenient Bluetooth speaker I have used for my Android phones. It's also one of the smallest and cheapest WiFi speakers you can buy and a very viable alternative to the Chromecast Audio (thanks to the 3.5mm cable connection to bigger speakers) with voice commands as a bonus. A central controller for your smart home \nI wasn't able to test the Echo's full ability as a smart home device, but using it with Blink, IFTTT, and Wink, I had a lot of fun at first triggering Away and Home mode on my Wink Hub 2, arming and disarming my Blink system, asking Blink when the last recorded event was, and more. As time passed, I settled into a few routines that made sense to me, the rest feeling more gimmicky. \nHowever, the one thing I kept wishing for was a way to use the Echo Dot as an action, not a trigger. I'd love for it to chime when Wink detects the pharma's door as open, to notify me when Blink records a motion clip, to remind me to move when my Fitbit's stats are still low toward the end of the day, and so on. (I know there's a way to make that work with spoken notifications on Android and the Echo Dot as a Bluetooth speaker, but it's not easy or well integrated.) \nBut for now that's not possible, even though it's technically feasible; Alexa can only trigger things and not respond to them. I'm hoping Amazon opens up development further down the line to add these capabilities. Surprising value for the money \nHonestly, I wasn't expecting to enjoy the Echo Dot and Alexa as much as I do. It's true that I see a lot of missing features, a few hiccups here and there, and the Alexa Android \"app\" is a big turnoff, but I keep coming back again and again to one point: this thing costs $49.99. With Black Friday coming up, it'll also be discounted to $39.99, which makes it even harder to argue with the value-for-money proposition. \nIn the kitchen, on your desk, in your bedroom, in the hallway, the Dot can blend and fit seamlessly in any setting, and provide additional value. It's a surprisingly convenient Bluetooth speaker for your Android phone, a good enough WiFi speaker on its own, and a relatively cheap way to smart-up any existing audio system in your house. Alexa has a lot to learn still, but voice recognition works very well, even from across the room, and the number of integrations with other hardware and services makes it even more useful as time passes by. Plenty of companies are rushing to add Alexa support so things are only going to get better. \nI can talk for hours about what you can do with the Dot and Alexa, but truth be told, it's a lot easier to give you the purchase link and let you try it for yourself. You can grab one in black or white today for $49.99 or wait a day or two to see the price drop to $39.99 for Black Friday. (I think you can also grab it now and nicely ask an Amazon customer support agent to reimburse you for the price drop when it goes down on Friday - I've done that before and it worked, but don't take my word for it.)",

      "text": "Anil Kapoor has been picked to play a key role in Amazon’s upcoming sci-fi drama pilot based on Michel Fabers cult hit book The Book of Strange New Things . The actor says he is thrilled to be a part of it.\n“So thrilled to be a part of the storm that Amazon’s kicking up with it’s original digital content! Strange New Things Amazon Prime Video India,” Anil tweeted on Tuesday evening.\nThe 59-year-old actor will play the role of Vikram Danesh, the authoritative head of the base on Oasis, joining previously announced Richard Madden and Haley Joel Osment, reports deadline.com.\nAnil promised that his role will be different from whatever he has done until now.\n“Starting work on this exciting new adventure soon! It’s definitely going to be different from whatever I have done till now!” he wrote. \nThe yet to be titled TV adaptation follows a priest who is sent into space to help found a new colony but what he ends up discovering not only puts his faith to the test but life as we know it.\nMatt Charman ( Bridge of Spies ) is writing the pilot and he is also an executive producer. Kevin MacDonald of The Last King of Scotland fame will direct it. The one-hour drama pilot is a co-production of Amazon Studios and Left Bank Productions.\nThe Slumdog Millionaire star says the role in the series is very complex.\n“The next chapter begins ... Strange New Things ! One of the most complex characters I’ve ever played!” he added.",

The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright The Associated Press \n ",

      "text": "\nInformed news analysis every weekday Why Amazon picked MXNet for deep learning Amazon plans to further develop this compact and versatile machine learning framework. Hosting it at scale would also fit the company's overall plans InfoWorld | Nov 23, 2016 Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Larry Ellison learns to love the cloud \nWerner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, announced yesterday that the MXNet deep learning framework would become \"[Amazon's] deep learning framework of choice.\" \nChoosing MXNet might come as a surprise to some, given the number of other frameworks -- TensorFlow , Theano, Torch, or Caffe, to name a few -- with far broader name recognition. Amazon claims it chose MXNet because it scales and runs better than almost anything else out there, but other motives may also be at work, too. [ The InfoWorld review: TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning . | Start here with TensorFlow . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] Travels light, works hard, scales well \nMXNet caught InfoWorld's attention earlier this year as one of the Open Source Rookies of the Year 2016 . Among its notable attributes are its compact size and cross-platform portability, both of which Vogels praised: \"The core library (with all dependencies) fits into a single C++ source file and can be compiled for both Android and iOS.\" Developers can also use a wide variety of languages with the framework -- \"Python, C++, R, Scala, Julia, Matlab, and JavaScript,\" as cited by Vogels. \nBut Amazon was likely most attracted to MXNet's scalability. Vogels published benchmarks for MXNet's training throughput using the Inception v3 image analysis algorithm and claimed that the speedup obtained by running it across multiple GPUs was highly linear. Across 128 GPUs, MXNet performed 109 times faster than with a single GPU. \nIt's safe to assume Amazon's long-term plans for MXNet include monetizing it by offering it as a cloud service. This doesn't have to be through Amazon's existing machine learning service; it could come from an officially supported machine image like the existing Deep Learning AMI that Amazon already sells. The former would be suitable for those who want an easily consumed product; the latter, for those who want total hands-on control. MXNaaS? \nAmazon also wants to become a major sponsor of MXNet's development. Vogels stated that Amazon will \"contribute code and improved documentation as well as invest in the ecosystem around MXNet,\" and \"partner with other organizations to further advance MXNet.\" \nThis plan includes another possibility: Creating custom hardware specifically designed to run MXNet at scale to provide a service not found anywhere else. In theory this could be done without making significant changes to MXNet, although Amazon could build an in-house version with enhancements specifically coupled to its own hardware. \nIt's not as if the publicly available open source version would magically lose its value if this happened. But cloud vendors recognize the importance of being able to provide an at-scale option out of a regular user's practical reach. As it is, MXNet fits elegantly into the machine-learning-as-a-service offerings Amazon has already brought to the table .

By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  ",

      "text": "By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir.\nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum.\nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign.\nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday.\nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By Lori Aratani November 23 at 6:00 AM Follow @loriara In this June 5, 2008, file photo, two ABX Air cargo planes sit at Wilmington Air Park, in Wilmington, Ohio. Pilots for ABX Air, a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL, went on strike Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. (AP Photo/Al Behrman, File) \nMore than 250 pilots who work for Ohio-based cargo carrier ABX Air walked off the job Tuesday in a move that could impact retailers during the start of the busy holiday shipping season. \nThe pilots, who are members of the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, are protesting staffing and pay levels. Union representatives said the pilots have been forced to take on numerous emergency assignments because the company is short-staffed and has refused to rehire pilots who were furloughed as a result of service cutbacks. \nIn a statement posted on the company’s website, the president of ABX Air, which is owned by Air Transport Service Group, called the action an “illegal work stoppage” and said the company would seek a court order to force the pilots to return to their jobs. \n“We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,” ABX Air President John Sarkovich said. \nHe said the cargo carrier has notified its customers about the work stoppage. \nAccording to union officials some of the company’s biggest customers include Amazon.com and DHL. They added that Tuesday’s walkout had caused the cancellation of at least 75 flights. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, union officials said. \nBea Garcia, a spokeswoman for DHL said the work stoppage affected inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas on Tuesday. She added that DHL is continuing to monitor the situation. \nOfficials at Amazon.com did not respond to requests for comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post.) \nThe pilots are picketing ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \n",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. The Los Angeles Times reports (http://lat.ms/2fop8fn) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum.\nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign.\nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday.\nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nThe regular tax deadline in 2017 is April 18, 2017. Taxpayers must either file a 2016 federal income tax return by this date or file a six-month automatic extension request by this date. \nIn most years, Tax Day is April 15, a date that is well known by many people. However, April 15, 2017, falls on a Saturday, and Monday, April 17, is the date of observance for a Washington, D.C., holiday known as Emancipation Day. So the tax deadline is the next day after that -- April 18. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nOn the other side of things, you can file your 2016 tax return as early as Jan. 1, although the IRS will not begin to accept e-filed returns until Jan. 23. It's generally a good idea to file as early as is practical, as early filing not only can result in a speedier refund, but is also one of the best safeguards against fraudulent tax returns being filed in your name. The extended tax deadline, and what it means to you \nThe extended tax deadline in 2017 is Oct. 16, 2017, for those taxpayers who filed an extension by the original deadline. \nIt's important to mention that the extended tax deadline refers to the last day to submit your 2016 federal tax return -- not the last day to pay any tax you owe. Any tax you owe must be paid by the original tax deadline, regardless of whether you requested an extension or not. \nIf you don't pay the tax you owe by the April tax deadline, you can be charged interest and penalties retroactive to April until the balance is paid, so it's important to be aware of this distinction before you file an extension. Penalties will generally be waived if you paid at least 90% of your tax with the return, so do your best to estimate the amount of tax you'll owe, and pay it along with your extension request in April. The deadline for an amended 2016 tax return \nTechnically, you can file an amended return at any time, but you only have three years from the original tax deadline to claim a refund. For 2016 tax returns, this due date is April 15, 2020. Similarly, there is technically no deadline for a previous year's tax return, but after three years, your refund becomes property of the IRS. Penalties for missing these deadlines \nIf you are entitled to a tax refund, there is no penalty for missing these deadlines. Not surprisingly, the IRS is perfectly content to keep your money for as long as you'll let them. However, if you owe taxes, the penalties for missing these deadlines can add up quickly. \nIf you fail to pay your taxes by the April due date, you can be assessed a penalty of 0.5% of the outstanding balance for each month (or part of a month) you're late, up to a maximum of 25%, plus you'll pay interest on the balance. Currently the IRS's interest rate for underpayments is 4% per year. For example, if you owe $5,000 and pay a year late, you can expect to have $500 in interest and penalties tacked on to your tax bill. \nThis is certainly inconvenient, but the penalties for not filing your tax return at all (if you owe money) are ten times as severe. The monthly rate jumps up to 5%, and you'll still pay interest. The maximum is still capped at 25% of the amount you owe, but this accumulates much faster. After just three months, if you owe $5,000 and didn't file your return, your tab will jump by $750, not including interest. \nThe point is that even if you can't afford to pay the entire balance, it's still important to observe these deadlines when it comes to filing your return. The IRS is quite flexible when it comes to payment plans or other arrangements, so if you can't pay, file a return anyway and consider your options . \nThe $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year!

      "text": "Wall Street Breakfast: Traders Digest Fed Minutes Before Thanksgiving (Seeking Alpha) \nMedia reports of a pilot strike at Charter Airline, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ATSG ), have “longer reaching implications” for FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE: UPS ) and cost implications for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and DHL Express (USA), Inc , Bernstein’s David Vernon said in a report. \nWith pilots refusing to bid for extra work, ABX Air is unable to crew its entire charter schedule, analyst Vernon mentioned. ABX is the primary cargo operator for DHL Express in the United States and among the several operators contracted by Amazon to support its Prime Air network. The news of the strike comes ahead of the key holiday season . Implications For Amazon And DHL Express \n“Because of more favourable labour agreements, ABX can crew a 767 aircraft at a straight rate of pay that is 26 percent lower than either UPS or FDX (more if you include the benefit of more productive work rules and lower minimums). ABX air claims a portion of that benefit as margin but passes the majority of the cost benefit on to customers like DHL and Amazon,” Vernon explained. \nWhile the work slowdown would likely disrupt the movement of goods across the United States and to international destinations, Amazon and DHL Express may pressure ABX to accept higher pay rates to avoid such disruptions in the longer term. This pay hike could result in other low cost airlines having to raise their rates as well. “This compounds the rate increase to both DHL and Amazon,” the analyst pointed out. Implications For UPS And FedEx \nThe work slowdown would likely boost volumes for both UPS and FedEx in the near term. In the longer term, the pay hikes by low cost airlines would mean a rise in the price floor for long haul express in and out of the United States, Vernon stated. \nBernstein has a Market Perform rating and a $159 price target on FedEx, and an Outperform rating and a $116 price target for UPS.

Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. AP \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports (http://lat.ms/2fop8fn) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. ADVERTISEMENT \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the “hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book” and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. TVJ",
