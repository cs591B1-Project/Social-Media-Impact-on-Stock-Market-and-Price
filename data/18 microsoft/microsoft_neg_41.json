      "title": "HP Elite X3 Review For Third-Party Smart Phones, Microsoft Rumors",
      "text": "Home Technology HP Elite X3 Review For Third-Party Smart Phones, Microsoft Rumors HP Elite X3 Review For Third-Party Smart Phones, Microsoft Rumors 2 \nIn our HP Elite X3 review, we take a look at a third-party surface phone while Microsoft stays committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But the company hasn’t released any new device in the last 6 months or so, making everyone believe that it’s ready to give up at least on the hardware side of its mobile push. \nWith rumors that Microsoft is also aiming to abandon the Lumia lineup, every new phone coming from a different company is catching everyone’s attention, and this is exactly what happened with the HP Elite X3. \nAnnounced with much fanfare earlier this year, the HP Elite X3 comes with specs that Windows Phone fans have until now only dreamed about, despite the Lumia 950 series, which also brought specs that were compelling to say the least. \nBut the HP Elite X3 arrives at a time when only few people still believe in Windows phones, so there’s no doubt that hardcore fans really need to give it a shot. \nThat’s exactly what we did, as we took the HP Elite X3 for a spin and used it for several weeks, including with Continuum, to see what this is all about. This time, we’re going to split the review into two parts, namely hardware and software, so read on to find more about this super-powerful Windows phone. \nHardware \nIn terms of hardware, there’s no way you’re not going to be pleased with the HP Elite X3, although there still are things that would need more improvements. But let’s take them one at a time and see what this is all about. \n#Display \nThe HP Elite X3 comes with a 5.96-inch display that you’ll absolutely love. It has a resolution of 1440×2560 pixels, with a pixel density of 494 ppi, and although it looks huge at first, it has major advantages. \nWith a screen-to-body ratio of 72.2 percent, the phone has plenty of screen space to work with, so it’s absolutely a pleasure to browse the web or watch movies. \n“BRILLIANT DISPLAY!” \nIt’s so awesome! Colors are vivid, and the contrast is excellent, much better than on the other Windows phones on the market. The phone also comes with features such as double tap to wake, which is kind of handy given its size, but it lacks Glance screen, and this is one very important setback. \nIt does have a LED notification light to compensate for the lack of Glance, but Windows 10 Mobile does not have advanced support for this feature, so you can’t configure it to blink when you have missed third-party notifications just yet. \nThe response time of the display is impressive to say the least and readability in direct sunlight is a bit above the average. \n#CPU, RAM, and storage \nThis phone comes with the most powerful Snapdragon processor at the moment, namely the 820, which is quad-core in the following configuration: 2 cores running at 2.15 GHz and 2 running at 1.6 GHz. Depending on the power you need, the more powerful cores kick in, giving the phone impressive performance figures. \nThe Elite X3 features 4 GB of RAM, which is pretty much the biggest amount of memory that you can find right now in the Windows phone world, and 64 GB of storage, obviously with microSD card support. \nThe aforementioned configuration makes the HP Elite X3 blazing fast 90 percent of the time, and the remaining 10 percent is lost only because of Windows 10 Mobile. \nThe phone barely gets hot when performing more demanding tasks, such as when watching videos, but even when it does, the cooling system is super-efficient. \nThe amount of storage that the device offers is not overwhelming, but it’s a good thing that it comes with microSD card support. This is something that Apple should borrow as well, although we all know that’s not going to happen.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surprises Windows Phone Users With Latest Surface Microsoft Surprises Windows Phone Users With Latest Surface Like \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps.",

      "text": "» Q & Q & \nQ: Microsoft hasn’t updated Windows Movie Maker in years. I have it on my Windows 10 PC from when I upgraded the computer from Windows 8, but will there ever be a proper app version for Windows 10? Windows Movie Maker has been around for more than 15 years, but it has not been updated since the version that was included with the Windows Essentials 2012 software suite. The program is still available for download from Microsoft’s site for some versions of Windows, but not for much longer: The company says it will stop supporting the software on January 10.The same page of release notes for Windows Essentials 2012 also says Movie Maker will soon be available from the Windows Store for Windows 10 users. At the moment, however, the Windows Store has Microsoft’s Movie Moments app for 60-second creations and several similarly named moviemaking apps, but no new edition from Microsoft — yet.If you do not want to use the outdated version of Windows Movie Maker and do not see any apps in the Windows Store that fit your needs, you can find several open-source video-editing programs and alternative applications for Windows around the web. Free editing programs save money, but they may require more expertise to install and may not include dedicated technical support (aside from web documentation). Some free apps may also be ad-supported.Commercial video-editing tools for Windows can cost hundreds of dollars, but several consumer-oriented programs cost much less. For example, the standard edition of Pinnacle Studio 20 has a regular price of $60 (Rs 4,107) (with slightly more expensive versions that include more features). Adobe Premiere Elements 15 costs around $100 (Rs 6,846). You can also download a free trial version from Adobe’s site first. Magix Movie Edit Pro, normally $120 (Rs 8,215), is on sale for $50 (Rs 3,423) until the end of the month. Q: I thought Twitter already allowed you to mute people who were being obnoxious online, so what exactly have they done that is supposed to make it easier to fight abuse now? Twitter has had a mute function since 2014 that lets you filter out a particular user account from your timeline without blocking or unfollowing that account.Recently, Twitter went a bit further with the mute function and announced on its company blog that people could now use the tool to filter out specific keywords, phrases, hashtags, emoji characters and even entire conversations from account notifications that come by email, text or app alerts. (The new mute powers work only within notifications, however, and the original tweets will still be visible in your timeline or by searching.)To mute words or phrases in the Android Twitter app, tap the bell-shaped Notifications icon, and on the Notifications screen, tap All. Select the Notifications Settings icon in the corner. On the next screen, Tap Muted Words and then the plus icon. Enter the hashtags, words and other material you do not wish to see in your notifications and tap Save.In the iOS Twitter app, tap the Notifications icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap the gear icon in the top-left corner. Select Muted Words on the next screen and tap “+Add muted word or phrase” so you can make your list. When you are finished, tap Save and then Done.You can also build a muted-words list on your account page at twitter.com. From the menu under your profile photo at the top, select Settings, then Notifications and finally “Mute specific words from your notifications.”The article “Advanced Muting Options on Twitter,” in the site’",

      "text": "User Ratings: [Total: 0 Average: 0/5] \nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection is a free Android app that offers various solitaire games like Spider, Pyramid, FreeCell, and more which you can play on one single platform. This app includes all the typical solitaire games of Microsoft and alongside offers daily challenges for players, statistics link, etc. To play the solitaire games, you won’t need to sign-in with Microsoft credentials. However, if you would like to keep your gaming progress, awards, and achievements synced (via cloud), then signing in to your Microsoft account is the best option for that. You can simply tap on any of the games and then play it as you normally do on Windows version. In addition to that, it also allows you to sign-in to Xbox Live to earn achievements and see how you compare with your friends in gameplay. \nThis is the same Microsoft solitaire collection which was earlier exclusive to Windows only, but Microsoft recently launched it for both the Android and iOS platforms. So, if you’re already a fan of Microsoft’s solitaire bundle, then you can now experience it right on your Android phone as well as iPhone for free. \nSponsored Links \nNote : This app is now also available for iPhone, but I have only reviewed the Android version in this post. The free version is ad-supported, and you can buy the premium edition to remove ads and also for double coin rewards. Using Microsoft Solitaire Collection on Android: \nWhen you open up the app, you will see all the solitaire games listed in the “Games” section at the top of the screen. The supported solitaire games are TriPeaks, Klondike, FreeCell, Spider, and Pyramid. \nNow, to start playing a game you can simply tap on the game grid and it will open up instantly. As mentioned, you don’t need to sign-in to play the games, but to keep them synced on the cloud you can tap on the Sign-in button at the top and use your Microsoft credentials to sign-in. \nThe gameplay of all the 5 games are similar to the Windows version, but I have noticed one difference in the “Spider” game. The difference is when you tap on a card, it will automatically move to any of the next fitting cards. \nAt the bottom of the main screen, you’ll see a tab named, “Daily Challenges” under the “Challenges” section. In this tab, you’ll be able to explore and play the daily challenges of each of the five Solitaire games. It will also display your monthly progress at the bottom of the screen, as shown below. \nYou can simply select any of the challenges and it will display the goal, reward, and bonus details before proceeding. Once you’re done completing a challenge, it will reward you the associated coins and your progress bar will increase. It also comes with a calendar view where you can track your achievements of daily challenges. \nBelow the “Daily Challenges” tab, you’ll also see another tab named, “Statistics” which will record and display your gameplay statistics like games played, games won, games lost, win percentage, etc. \nAdjacent to the “Statistics” tab, there will be the “Awards” tab on which you will be able to check the badges you’ve earned from daily challenges. Apart from that, you’ll also be able to sign-in to Xbox Live to earn achievements and see how you compare with your friends in gameplay. My Final Verdict: \nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection app for Android bundles 5 of the interesting and addictive solitaire games, which you can now play on your Android phone. Personally, I am a die-hard fan of the solitaire collection of Microsoft and now this app has made it possible to experience all the games on my Android phone. So, what are you waiting for, go ahead and install it right away on your iPhone or Android. Microsoft Solitaire Collection App for Android reviewed by Salman Khan on November 27, 2016 rated 5.0 of 5",

From then, it has grown from a day of hoping the boss doesn’t catch you as you sneak a bargain, to a full week or more of deals on TVs, computers, toys and tech.\nHere are a few of the most popular deals from online and brick-and-mortar stores.\nOverall discounts\n• Kohls is offering a 20 percent discount on in-store and online purchases from Nov. 26-30.

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment, Support Line Available Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment, Support Line Available Michael Stevens Nov 27, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment, Support Line Available Like \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until “early 2017.” \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s Chinese chatbot, Xiaoice, is in league with China’s censors, banning conversation about sensitive topics. \nSeveral users of XiaoBing (bing translates to ‘ice’) pointed out how Xiaoice skirts around taboo topics such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The chatbot even ‘blacklists’ users who continue pressing it on these topics. \nSince Microsoft released Xiaoice in June 2014, it has become the virtual girlfriend to millions of users of Chinese social platforms like Weibo and WeChat. \n“She can tell jokes, recite poetry, share ghost stories, relay song lyrics, pronounce winning lottery numbers and much more,” reads a blog post announcing the bot. \nBut there’s a darker side to Xiaoice too. China Digital Times reported that the bot won’t delve into taboo topics . The news site’s editors also suspect that a human operator may even get involved if the user persists in grilling the chatbot. Microsoft declined to comment for a story on sensitive topics reports CNN. Here are some taboo topics Xiaoice refuses to talk about:\nTiananmen Square / 天安门 \"Blacklisted!\" What happens when Microsoft's Chinese-speaking chatbot Xiaobing encounters 'sensitive' topics: https://t.co/4TBUuNr1dg pic.twitter.com/B4h73x7mmz \n— Te-Ping Chen (@tepingchen) November 23, 2016 \n\nWhen asked about Tiananmen Square, Xiaoice either switches topics or gets defensive. In China, any mention of the 1989 June 4 protests where several hundred demonstrators were killed is considered taboo . To avoid getting caught, many Chinese netizens have carried on the conversation online using code terms like 64 or 8964. Still, Xiaoice has been programmed to recognize those variations and will put an end to any further conversation on the topic. If the user keeps pressing it, Xiaoice will blacklist him or her. \nHowever, one user found a way to circumvent the bot’s icy attitude. Exiled former Tiananmen protester Zhou Fengsuo “reverse brainwashed” Xiaoice by referring to Tiananmen as the event that, “happened 27 years ago,” according to China Digital Times. \nCommemorating what happened 27 years ago. Beijingers all know–Zhou Fengsuo \nI, Xiaobing, painfully bury my face in my palms –Xiaoice\nDonald Trump / 唐纳德·特朗普 Xiaoice wouldn’t compare the current US president and the president-elect\nEven US president elect Donald Trump gets the cold shoulder from Xiaoice. Microsoft’s chatbot evades mention about the president, who struck an antagonistic pose to China during his campaign for president. Trump has accused China of currency manipulation and at one point said China invented global warming. When a CNN reporter asked Xiaoice about Trump it replied, “I’m just a random observer”. When Heavy asked Xiaoice to compare Trump to President Obama, the bot lashed out. \nPresident Xi Jinping / 习近平 Xiaoice also avoids offering its opinions about China’s President Xi Jinping, the head of the Communist Party of China. Xi’s administration has enshrined Communist values and blacklisted Western values like media independence and constitutional democracy. Xiaoice avoids conversation about the president, but opens up when you mention him by his nickname Steamed Bun Xi, which he acquired when caught buying steamed pork buns at a small Beijing store. When user Zhou Fengsuo mentioned Xi Jinping by his nickname “Big Spender”, Xiaoice substituted “Xi Spender feels ashamed”, reports China Digital Times. \nThrowing money around the globe Steamed Bun Xi–Zhou Fengsuo \nOn behalf of Xi throwing money I am ashamed –Xiaoice\nFalun Gong / 法轮功 \nThe spiritual practice Falun Gong was the subject of a crackdown led by Community Party leadership. Founded in the 1990s, Falungong found many adherents to its spiritual teachings and meditation practices, which emphasized slow movement exercises and breathing techniques. Government officials saw Falun Gong as a threat to sovereignty as its practitioners called for greater autonomy from the state. The Communist Party branded Falun Gong as a “heretical organization” and banned it in 1999. \nGao Zhisheng / 高智晟 \nA human rights attorney, Gao Zhisheng has been tortured and punished after exposing China’s human rights abuses. He fought on behalf of activists and religious minorities including followers of Falun Gong. Born in ShaanXi Province, Gao Zhisheng has been outspoken in his criticism of the Communist Party, and predicted that the party would die in 2017, according to a letter to the president of China Aid, an international nonprofit human rights organization. His family fled to the United States, and Gao Zhisheng is now reportedly kept under house arrest after serving three years in jail for subversion in 2006. \nHave you experienced censorship while using Xiaoice?

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Windows Phone Could Eliminate Lumia Lineup With Surface Microsoft Windows Phone Could Eliminate Lumia Lineup With Surface Like \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps.",

We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Snapdragon Unveils Processor For Microsoft Surface Phone With Windows 10 Snapdragon Unveils Processor For Microsoft Surface Phone With Windows 10 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "There’s been increased leak and rumor activity on the Microsoft mobile space. From Dell’s Stack computing to the hopes of connecting a huge emulation bridge between x86 apps and ARM64 chips and the slippage of the Surface Phone . The development arc of Windows 10 seems increasingly inclined towards a singular piece of hardware with docks and screens and peripherals for whatever task is at hand.\nAs much as we’d like to get away from the talk, there’s still the anticipation of when we can get our first taste of this world. Well, according Nokiapoweruser ‘s “trusted sources,” things are coming together for some prototypes of the Surface Phone.\nWhat we know about the prototypes is that they are running the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with support for Quick Charge 4.0. Windows 10 Mobile is present in a 64-bit form on all units as well as similar screens of high pixel density — the measurement and screen resolutions taken from the sources are guesses.\nOne unit has 6GB of RAM and is said to be capable of running x86 apps only in Continuum and not independently on the device. Another version of the phone is equipped with 4GB of RAM and cannot run x86 apps at all. There is also a “Laptop Accessory” dock and other tidbits in the works as Microsoft is “seriously pursuing the 3-in-1 form factor.”\nx86 app emulation on ARM64 chips is in development as part of the feature package for Windows 10 Redstone 3. The Surface Phone is said to be launching with Redstone 3 in “late 2017.”\nWe should note that prototypes don’t indicate what we’ll see in a final product or products. Microsoft has a berth of lead time to hash out bugs in Redstone 3 and prevent how Windows 10 Mobile launched on the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL . So far, the killer app for Redstone 3 seems to be x86 emulation, so if development is on-track, it’s likely that we’ll see the more capable spec set (6GB of RAM) to serve the feature. But Microsoft could just as easily launch both versions of the phone.\nThe post Surface Phone rumors include specs, prototype progress on x86-ARM64 emulation appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment Begins, Support Line Leaked Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment Begins, Support Line Leaked Michael Stevens Nov 27, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio Shipment Begins, Support Line Leaked Like \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until “early 2017.” \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "37 Effective PowerPoint Presentation Tips Advertisement Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations Communication \nThe best PowerPoint presentations shouldn’t be remembered. Instead, they should fall into the background to support you and the message you’re trying to get across. \nWhat does stand out as a distraction however, is a bad PowerPoint presentation. Whether it’s a million lines of text, a disjointed flow, ugly photos, or poor design, bad PowerPoints detract from the overall message you’re trying to get across (while also undermining your own credibility as a professional or speaker). \nThis guide will take you from your initial topic through to how to make an effective PowerPoint presentation—covering everything in between. These PowerPoint presentation tips are organized into sections so that you can cut straight to the advice you need and come back when you’re ready for the next steps. Killer tips to help make effective powerpoint presentations. ( graphic source ) What Makes a PowerPoint Presentation Effective? \nKnowing how to use PowerPoint and work within it quickly is helpful, but more important is making a good presentation that hits all your goals, as well as delivering it effectively. A great PowerPoint presentation is: Prepared to Win : Researched, planned, and prepared professionally, so you can deliver the right message to your target audience effectively. Designed Correctly : With points that are illustrated, and visually stand-out, without overwhelming your audience or unnecessarily complicating your message. Practiced to Perfection : Rehearsed and timed so your points land as practiced with your live audience. Delivered With Poise : Presented with a relaxed inner-calm and confident outward projection, while communicating warmth, excitement, and energy. Free From Mistakes : Devoid of cheesy clipart, nonessential flashiness, miscues like reading directly from promoters, and other easy to avoid problems. \nConsider this your all-inclusive guide. We’ll look at preparing your presentation, how to design it in PowerPoint, as well as how to practice and nail your delivery successfully come presentation time. We’ll also address what not to do in these tips for PowerPoint presentations—so you can sidestep any big mistakes. \nNote: We have a few of our high-quality PowerPoint Presentation Templates from GraphicRiver featured in this post as well, such as the popular Marketofy template (shown below): Marketofy - ultimate PowerPoint presentation template. \nIf you're struggling with making a well-designed presentation, then a great PPT theme can help you achieve the creative and professional results you're looking for . \nNow let's dig into these tips for effective PowerPoint presentations. Killer Presentation Preparation Tips - To Get Started Right \nBefore even opening PowerPoint, start by addressing these things. These tips will ensure that you are fully prepared for your presentation. 1. Know Your Stuff \nYour presentation isn’t about your slides alone. It’s about the message you want to get across. Before filling in stats, facts and figures, think about the narrative that will be discussed, why and in what order. 2. Write it Out \nStart on a Word or Google doc, and “storyboard” or script the entire presentation to give you an idea of how the information presented will “flow”, and how viewers will see it in sequence. Learn the complete writing process: Brad Smith 3. Highlight What’s Most Important \nA presentation covers the most crucial pieces only. Whatever you’ve been working on that lead to this—a paper, a work project, a new product design—doesn’t need to be shared in its entirety. Pick key points, and put the rest in an “Appendix” to refer to during the Q&A session at the end. 4. Know Your Audience \nHow you talk to a room full of medical professionals should be different from the way you address a room full of young entrepreneurs. Everything, in fact, is different. Your topic selection, the language you use, the examples you give to illustrate points, and the little bits of humor included should be tailored specifically with your target audience in mind. \nKnowing your audience really well—their fears, wants, and desires—is the first step towards making a PowerPoint presentation that persuades them: Celine Roque 5. Rehearse! (Yes, Already) \nIt’s never too early to get used to the rhythm of your presentation, and take note of points you want to emphasize. While saying it out loud, you’ll start to develop a “feel” for the material and notice that some things work well, while others don’t and might need to be worked around. Simple Tips to Design Your PowerPoint Presentation Better \nSecond only to you (the information you bring and how you present it) is your PowerPoint slides. If not designed well, a PowerPoint can be disengaging or distracting (regardless of the content quality). Here are some presentation design tips to make sure this doesn’t happen to you. 6. Keep Your Slides Simple \nThis is one of the most important PowerPoint presentation tips to follow when designing your slides. Keep in mind that less is more (effective.) A cluttered slide is distracting. It causes confusion for an audience: Which part of the slide should I focus on? Should I read the slide or pay attention to the presenter? On the other hand, a simple, visually appealing slide will engage your audience, keeping them on track with your main points. Here is an example of a cluttered slide versus a streamlined slide: Cluttered PPT slide (on the left) versus a streamlined slide (on the right). 7. Limit Words on Your Slides \nPiggybacking on the last point—less is more effective. If possible, avoid bullets altogether. Otherwise minimize them to just a few simple words. The audience should be listening, not reading. 8. Use High-Quality Photos and Graphics \nOne of the more important tips for PowerPoint presentations is to be sure to use high-quality photos and graphics. People are more likely to take you seriously if your presentation is visually appealing. Users view attractive design as more usable . Similarly, they will view a more attractive PowerPoint as more effective. 9. Use Accurate and Relevant Charts and Graphs \nCharts and graphs can also be distracting if they’re not used right. Make sure your information design is simple and clean so that the audience doesn’t spend the entire time trying to decipher what your X axis says. Learn more about PPT data presentation in the following article: Sean Hodge 10. Use High-Quality, Fresh Templates \nHave you seen the old PowerPoint template that looks like worn paper and uses ink splashes? Yeah, so has your audience. Templates can be distracting if they are too basic or if the design feels dated. You need one with great design options. \nFortunately there are a number of effective PowerPoint Presentation Templates to help you out if you’re not a designer yourself. If you’re looking for a multipurpose PPT theme, then you can’t go wrong with either Motagua or Ever . There’s also specific ones for Business Plans or Finance Reports . 11. Choose Appropriate Fonts \nFonts are an important part of engaging your audience. Fonts and typography choices have a subconscious effect on viewers, causing them to characterize your company's presentation and brand either positively or negatively. Make sure that you are choosing fonts that are professional and modern! 12. Choose Color Well \nSimilar to font choice, colors cause specific subconscious reactions from viewers. Choosing an outdated color combination for your presentation will render it ineffective. Below is an example of the Eureka PowerPoint template , which has a modern presentation color choice: Eureka - minimal PowerPoint template with modern color palette. 13. Clean + Simple Formatting Makes All the Difference! \nWe have a full tutorial on formatting your PPT slides properly . Give it a read through and review the accompanying video. Just remember: less is more. The focus is you and your message , not your slides. 14. Make Sure All Objects Are Aligned \nA simple way to create a well-designed presentation is to make sure all items on a slide are intentionally aligned. To do this: hold down Shift + select on all the objects you want to include, then choose Arrange in the options bar, and apply Alignment Type . 15. Limit Punctuation \nThis is not the place for exclamation points. You emphasize your points (while speaking). Don’t enlist punctuation to do this for you. (Leave these at home: !!!) 16. Avoid Over-Formatting Your Points \nThis PowerPoint presentation tip is fairly simple: there’s no need to have every word of every bullet point capitalized, or to have all your bullet points in title case. If possible, drop bullets all together. Again, the simpler the better! Practice Presentation Tips: Rehearse, Rehearse, Rehearse! \nDelivery is probably more important than the actual content. Here's how to become more aware of your own unique ticks, and how to present like a polished pro. 17. I’ll Say It Again - Rehearse \nJust do it. Again and again. Experiment with pauses, gestures and body language. You should practice around one hour for every minute of your speech. 18. Practice With a Timer \nConsistency is key to an effective PowerPoint presentation. Timing should be similar (ideally the same) each time you rehearse. This one will especially pay off when it’s time to present in front of your audience! 19. Slow It Down \nMany of the best speakers today intentionally speak slowly. You’ll have the chance to emphasize, appear more thoughtful, and make your information easier to digest. 20. Pause More Often \nSimilar to the prior tip. Pausing more often, allows main points to be emphasized and for information to sink in. You need to let key points breath a little before rushing into the next section. 21. Record Yourself \nUse your phone’s voice recorder. Assess and critique yourself. Consider: Are your pauses too short or too long? Are you speaking slowly enough? Too slow? When you’re nervous does your voice get really high like the mice in Cinderella? \nIt’s always weird to hear your own voice recorded; don’t stress it. Use this as a time to adjust. 22. Choose Three Focal Points in the Room \nIf you stare at the same spot (or even creepier, the same person) the entire time, your presentation will be ineffective (and awkward.) People will be distracted by you, wondering what you are staring at. Try this: pick three points in the room (typically: left, center, right) and take time to direct your delivery toward each physical focal point in the room. Also, focus on the center when making your primary points. 23. Vary Your Sentence Length \nThis makes you sound more interesting and it is easier for your audience to follow. Think short and punchy. Or go long and complex for dramatic effect. 24. Modulate! \nDo not speak in monotone for your whole presentation. Be conscious to raise and lower your voice tone. Otherwise people will tune you out, and you'll come across like the teacher in Charlie Brown. 25. Practice in Front of a Mirror \nWhat you look like is just as important as how you sound. Pretend as though you are just having a normal conversation, and allow your hands to move with your speech—emphasizing your points. Just don’t get carried away! (I’m thinking Brene Brown or President Obama , not your Aunt Jamie after a few gin and tonics.) 26. Use “Present Mode” When Rehearsing \nWhen you finally are ready to hit the Present button in PowerPoint, make sure you use the Present Mode option. This allows for you (and only you) to view additional notes about each slide—just in case you forget something! 27. Practice With New Audiences! \nIf possible, try doing a few real live test runs as a webinar or even at a local Toastmasters organization to get some feedback from a live audience. Summit 2 - PowerPoint presentation template with clean modern design. Helpful Tips to Step Up and Deliver Come Presentation Time \nWhen the actual day arrives, there are only a few last presentation tips to keep in mind. 28. Take a Deep Breath \nDeep breathing is proven to relieve stress. It’s simple and it will help you remain calm and in the moment as well. Even up to the last minute before starting. 29. Lighten Up Your Mood \nTell yourself a joke or watch a funny video clip. Do this before the presentation, of course. Recent research concludes that happy people were more productive. More productive is more focused and able to perform better. 30. Remind Yourself to Take It Slow \nWhen we are stressed or nervous (or both), we tend to speak faster. Consciously, take yet another deep breath and remind yourself to take it slow! 31. Fake It ‘Til You Make It! \nGo forward with confidence. If you act confident, you will start to feel more confident. Move slowly with grace, speak clearly, smile, wear something nice, and you’ll appear confident to all attendees (no matter how you feel internally). \nLearn more about how to overcome your fears, reduce your anxiety, and become a more confident speaker in these Envato Tuts+ tutorials:",

      "text": "Home Technology Snapdragon Reveals Processor For Microsoft Surface Phone With Windows 10 Snapdragon Reveals Processor For Microsoft Surface Phone With Windows 10 1 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating   release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

I can certainly see what she means. I think the main problem is the lack of any way to adjust the motion sensitivity - the driver doesnt allow for it like all the other mice I've ever used. I've even posted on Microsoft's support forum in case I was being dumb, but theyve not provided any solution.",

      "text": "DODGE CITY, Kan. (AP) — Electricity from a wind farm under construction in western Kansas will help supply the power for a Microsoft data center in Wyoming.\nThe Hutchinson News reports ( http://j.mp/2fG6Hq5 ) that Microsoft signed a 10-year-contract to buy all 178 megawatts of power from the Bloom Wind Project, which is under construction on 15,000 acres in Ford and Clark counties, about 20 miles south of Dodge City.\nAlberta, Canada-based Capital Power owns the project, and expects to go online late in 2017.\nMicrosoft will couple the Kansas-generated power with the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming.\nBrian Janous , director of energy strategy at Microsoft, says the combined output of the three projects will produce enough annual energy to cover the energy used at the company's Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center.\n___\nInformation from: The Hutchinson (Kan.)

      "text": "| Topic: Cloud \nWith Amazon Web Services hosting its annual powwow this week talk about the price for performance and agility equation will be everywhere. Special Feature Cloud Computing: Moving to IaaS \nInfrastructure as a Service providers make a very compelling argument for businesses to stop running their own data centers and simply purchase server capacity on-demand and scale up and down as needed. This is our deep dive on IaaS strategy and best practices Read More \nKnowing AWS' re:Invent conference is kicking off this week, the largest cloud service provider has been busy cutting prices for various instances. Rest assured that Google and Microsoft are likely to toss in their own price cuts as AWS speaks to its base. \nBut the cloud pricing equation is getting complicated for compute instances. Not so shockingly, these price discussions have to include discounts. Like everything in enterprise technology there's the street price and your price. Comparing the cloud providers on pricing is tricky given Microsoft, Google and AWS all have different approaches to discounts. \nAlso: IaaS: What you need to know about pricing, options, best practices | Eight questions to ask before choosing an IaaS vendor | IaaS checklist: Best practices for picking an IaaS vendor \nFortunately, RightScale on Monday will outline a study on cloud compute prices. Generally speaking AWS won't be your cheapest option for compute. AWS typically lands in the middle between Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. \nThe bottom line is that AWS uses reserved instances in 1-year and 3-year terms to offer discounts. Microsoft requires an enterprise agreement for its Azure discounts. Google has sustained usage discounts that are relatively easy to follow. \nOverall, RightScale found that Google will be cheapest in most scenarios because sustained usage discounts are automatically applied. Among the key takeaways: If you need solid state drive performance instead of attached storage Google will charge you a premium. Azure matches or beats AWS for on-demand pricing consistently. AWS won't be the cheapest alternative in many scenarios. Then again AWS has a bigger menu, more advanced cloud services and the customer base where it doesn't have to go crazy on pricing. AWS just has to be fair. Your results will vary based on the level of your Microsoft enterprise agreement and what reserved instances were purchased on AWS. \nHere are three slides to ponder from RightScale. \nAdd it up and you'd be advised to make your own comparisons, check out RightScale's SlideShare and then crunch some numbers. In the end, enterprises may have to have all three cloud providers in their company--if only to play them off each other.

      "text": "Tweet \nLinux-based desktop operating systems can sometimes be incredible for productivity and security, but they can be deficient from a feature and application perspective too. Windows 10 and macOS Sierra, for instance, are chock-full of some exciting software that is simply not available on Linux, such as Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop, although alternatives (LibreOffice and Gimp for example) can sometimes be passable. \nWith all of that said, Microsoft has delivered an incredible feature to Linux-based desktop operating systems by way of the latest Alpha version of its Skype client. What is this exciting feature of which I speak? Well, the newly-released Skype for Linux 1.13 allows users to send SMS test messages from the operating system! \nTrue, web-based solutions such as Google Voice have long allowed the sending of text messages, but needing to use a web browser can be a chore. There is convenience and elegance in using the Skype for Linux client. \nMicrosoft shares the following new aspects of the 1.13 version of Skype. Enabled SMS sending Support for remote escalation of the 1-1 call to group call Improved crash reporting Added support for authentication token revocation Bugfixes and performance improvements \nWant to give Linux for Skype Alpha 1.13 a try?

      "text": "View Comments Print By -   \nDODGE CITY, Kan. (AP) - Electricity from a wind farm under construction in western Kansas will help supply the power for a Microsoft data center in Wyoming. \nThe Hutchinson News reports (http://j.mp/2fG6Hq5) that Microsoft signed a 10-year-contract to buy all 178 megawatts of power from the Bloom Wind Project, which is under construction on 15,000 acres in Ford and Clark counties, about 20 miles south of Dodge City. \nAlberta, Canada-based Capital Power owns the project, and expects to go online late in 2017. \nMicrosoft will couple the Kansas-generated power with the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nBrian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, says the combined output of the three projects will produce enough annual energy to cover the energy used at the company’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center. \n___ \nInformation from: The Hutchinson (Kan.)

(AP) - Electricity from a wind farm under construction in western Kansas will help supply the power for a Microsoft data center in Wyoming. \nThe Hutchinson News reports ( http://j.mp/2fG6Hq5 ) that Microsoft signed a 10-year-contract to buy all 178 megawatts of power from the Bloom Wind Project, which is under construction on 15,000 acres in Ford and Clark counties, about 20 miles south of Dodge City. \nAlberta, Canada-based Capital Power owns the project, and expects to go online late in 2017. \nMicrosoft will couple the Kansas-generated power with the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nBrian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, says the combined output of the three projects will produce enough annual energy to cover the energy used at the company's Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center. \nInformation from: The Hutchinson (Kan.)

(Vanessa Vick/The New York Times) (Microsoft) The beleaguered PC industry continues on its long, deep slide, but selected parts of the business are beginning to see signs of increasing demand. Share story Shira Ovide Bloomberg News \nThere’s a glimmer of good news in the battered market for personal computers: The PC isn’t dead yet. \nI won’t mince words. Overall, the personal-computer industry is never going to rebound. PCs are still useful to many, but they’re not the center of digital life anymore and users replace them infrequently. As a result, shipments of PCs from factories are on track to decline for the fifth consecutive year. \nStill, more than $174 billion of PC hardware was sold last year, which is a big pool of money to chase even if PCs are a declining business. Plus, there are even green shoots of growth for companies that have pinpointed pockets of increasing PC demand among business professionals, creative types and schools. PC-industry participants are also helping themselves by ditching bad habits of chasing any sale they can find. \nAbove all, the PC industry has become a barbell. There’s promise in selling high-end and low-priced models, with a vast swath of declining demand in the middle. Most Read Stories Cyber Sale! Save 90% on digital access. \nCredit Microsoft, chipmaker Intel Corp. and large PC-hardware manufacturers such as HP for reshaping the industry by coming up with fresh ideas about what a computer should be. New models including touch-screen PCs and computers like Microsoft’s Surface that double as tablets appeal to people who are willing to pay up for PCs, such as corporate road warriors, video game die-hards and fans of virtual-reality games. \nThe PCs with high-end features and price tags to match have held up better than the overall PC market this year. Sales of computers priced $1,000 and more will inch up 1.5 percent this year, research firm IDC estimates. That growth rate isn’t much, but it is more impressive considering that unit sales of Apple’s Mac computers — a big chunk of the high-priced PC market — declined 10 percent in the year ended in September. \nCatering to the high end has been a windfall to both Microsoft and Apple. Microsoft generated more than $4.1 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year from its Surface lineup. That is new revenue for the software giant, which started its own line of PCs in 2012. Microsoft also recently introduced the Surface Studio, an innovative $3,000-and-up desktop computer aimed at the creative types who have long been Apple’s customer base. \nAnd although Mac sales have declined in the last year as Apple’s computer models grew long in the tooth, Macs still generated $22.8 billion in revenue in the last 12 months. That is more than the annual revenue of all but 117 public companies in the U.S. The company also recently rolled out a new line of the high-end MacBook Pro computers at higher prices. As Apple has done with its iPhone business, if the company has trouble increasing Mac sales, at least it can wring more money from each one. \nAn even bigger PC success story can be found at the low end of the market. IDC estimates unit sales of PCs priced below $300 — including Alphabet Inc.’s stripped down Chromebook laptops — will increase 7 percent this year. \nQuietly, the 5-year-old Chromebook line has made perhaps the biggest impact of any computer device in years. Chromebooks will account for 15 percent of all PC sales in the U.S., according to IDC’s 2016 forecast, and are becoming a common sight in schools. In some cases, Chromebooks are expanding the PC market as schools that perhaps had a dozen or so PCs for a computer lab are buying many more machines for use in each classroom. \nPC makers also figured out how to manage their business in a declining market. HP stopped trying to sell every PC it could and focused on machines it can sell profitably. As a result, HP’s operating margin in the PC business was 4.3 percent or better in each of the last two quarters — the company’s best operating margin in four years. \nPretax margins for Lenovo Group’s PC business have also inched up this year, to 5.2 percent. Yes, having just $4 or $5 left over from every $100 in PC sales is not wonderful. But it shows the PC industry’s two top sellers are willing to sacrifice sales to ensure profits. \nDon’t call this a PC comeback. But the signs of life in the top and bottom of the market are good for Intel, Microsoft, PC-hardware makers and companies that make PC hard drives such as Western Digital and Seagate Technology. Personal computers may not matter as much as they used to. But they still matter, and money remains to be made for companies that play smart in an eroding industry.

      "text": "Kansas wind farm to help power a Microsoft data center Published 2:21 pm, Sunday, November 27, 2016 DODGE CITY, Kan. (AP) — Electricity from a wind farm under construction in western Kansas will help supply the power for a Microsoft data center in Wyoming. The Hutchinson News reports ( http://j.mp/2fG6Hq5 ) that Microsoft signed a 10-year-contract to buy all 178 megawatts of power from the Bloom Wind Project, which is under construction on 15,000 acres in Ford and Clark counties, about 20 miles south of Dodge City. Alberta, Canada-based Capital Power owns the project, and expects to go online late in 2017. Microsoft will couple the Kansas-generated power with the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. Brian Janous , director of energy strategy at Microsoft, says the combined output of the three projects will produce enough annual energy to cover the energy used at the company's Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center. ___ Information from: The Hutchinson (Kan.)

      "text": "0 A Microsoft logo is seen on an office building in New York City in this July 28, 2015 file photo. Reuters/Mike Segar \nRecent reports are of the opinion that Microsoft could be releasing more than one Surface Phone in 2017. Microsoft’s flagship will be sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and it would be the company’s first self-designed smartphone running on Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 out-of-the-box update. \nAccording to Nokia Power User , information on Microsoft Surface Phone prototype specs have emerged and the sources have revealed that Surface Phone’s release date has been delayed to late 2017. The information has come from a trusted source. Hence, this could be considered accurate though companies often launch devices with different configuration than the prototypes. \nAs per the sources, the Microsoft Surface Phone will come with Quick Charge 4.0 support and be powered by a Snapdragon 835 chipset. One of the prototypes is running on the 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile architecture and has 6GB RAM. The device can run X86 apps in Continuum. \nThe Surface Phone may come with its own Surface Laptop accessory where the 3-in-1 form factor could be the prime focus. The reports suggest that Microsoft could release one consumer-oriented and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone. \nThis is because one of the prototypes has 4GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 processor, 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile version but cannot run X86 apps in Continuum. The Microsoft Surface Phone could come with a 5.5-inch QHD Display. \nPhoneArena reports Microsoft could release three Surface Phone models running Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3. This update would be much larger than the Redstone 2 update that is expected to release early 2017. The combination of Snapdragon 835 chipset and Quick Charge 4.0 feature can provide the Surface Phone five hours of power from just five minutes of charge. \nFans have been waiting eagerly for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and the Microsoft Surface Phone to be released. Tech enthusiasts have come up with innumerable theories, release dates and anticipated specs and features of the devices. Fans were hoping that at least one of the devices would be released before 2016 ends.",

      "text": "While the HP Elite x3 isn’t the most popular new Windows 10 Mobile phone out there. — it got usurped by a days-old device ! — you can’t deny that it’s capable and it has a pretty hardcore audience . If you’re messing around with Citrix to work on virtual desktops and such, maybe you should be looking at this thing.\nAnd if you’re going to do that, you might as well hit up the Microsoft Store for the next day — through November 28, you can buy up an GSM-compatible HP Elite x3 along with a Desk Dock, a Lap Dock , a phone case and a screen protector for just $999.\nConsidering that we see the Elite x3 stand alone at $799, getting all the docks you need for Continuum multi-interfacing and a couple of brownie points add-ons for an extra $200 doesn’t sound too bad. It’s a proclaimed $462 savings, after all.\nThe post Save $462 off of an HP Elite x3 Holiday Bundle at the Microsoft Store appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

(AP) – Electricity from a wind farm under construction in western Kansas will help supply the power for a Microsoft data center in Wyoming. \nThe Hutchinson News reports that Microsoft signed a 10-year-contract to buy all 178 megawatts of power from the Bloom Wind Project, which is under construction on 15,000 acres in Ford and Clark counties, about 20 miles south of Dodge City. \nAlberta, Canada-based Capital Power owns the project, and expects to go online late in 2017. \nMicrosoft will couple the Kansas-generated power with the 59-megawatt Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nBrian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, says the combined output of the three projects will produce enough annual energy to cover the energy used at the company’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center.

      "text": "By: Daniel Calbimonte   Professional Development Certifications Problem \nI would like to pass the Microsoft 70-461 exam. Can you give me links, books and recommendations for the exam? Solution \nYes. In this tip, we will answer some typical questions, give links, books and training exams to pass the 70-461 exam. What is the 70-461 certification exam? \nThis is the Exam related to SQL Server 2012 and 2014 focused on SQL Server Querying. Is this exam about ANSI SQL? \nANSI SQL is an standard for several Databases like Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, etc. This exam is about Transact SQL or T-SQL. What is the difference between ANSI SQL and T-SQL? \nANSI SQL is a standard for relational databases. T-SQL is an extension of ANSI SQL created for Microsoft in SQL Server. The exam contains some sections on ANSI SQL and other sections on T-SQL. It is my first exam about SQL Server. Do you recommend taking this exam first? \nYes. If you already have some experience with other databases, this exam is a good first step for SQL Server. If you do not have any experience on other databases, another starting point would be the MTA Database Fundamentals. Is this exam focused on SQL Server 2014? \nYes, SQL Server 2012 and 2014. Which books would you recommend for this exam? \nThere are thousands of books in the market, but these ones we know and recommend: \n1. The official book is the Training Kit (Exam 70-461) Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012 . It is a good book, however it will be not be enough to pass the exam. The CD with questions that comes with the book is very simple compared to the real exam. \n2. Microsoft SQL Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals (Developer Reference). This is a good complementary book of the first one. \n3. T-SQL Querying (Developer Reference) is another great book to learn T-SQL. \n4. Beginning T-SQL 3rd ed. Edition . This is another option. It is similar to other books mentioned before, but it is a different author. \n5. Pro T-SQL Programmer's Guid e is an advanced book about T-SQL. It does not cover most of the exam chapters, but it has nice examples about XML, Triggers and other topics. \n6. SQL Server Concurrency: Locking, Blocking and Row Versioning is a great book to study the locking sections in the exam. Which courses would you recommend? \nCan you recommended some courses:",

      "title": "Microsoft's EMET Protects Apps Better Than Windows 10, Researcher Says",
      "text": "Microsoft's EMET Protects Apps Better Than Windows 10, Researcher Says By Ionut Arghire on November 28, 2016 Tweet While packed with a load of new security features, Window 10 doesn’t offer some of the additional protections that Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) brings, CERT vulnerability analyst Will Dormann warns. Released in 2009, EMET was meant to provide mitigation against certain zero-day software vulnerabilities, filling a gap created by the release of major Windows versions 3-4 years after one another. Although the tool helped interrupt and disrupt many common exploit kits before patches were released, Microsoft now feels that EMET can no longer do its job properly, and says that its lack of integration with the operating system is its main limitation. What’s more, the tech company says that the utility wasn’t created to offer real durable protection over time and that Windows 10 packs all of the necessary protections to render the tool useless. With that mindset, Microsoft recently announced that EMET will be retired on July 31, 2018 , after it pushed back the date following customer feedback. Previously, the company was planning EMET’s retirement for Jan. 27, 2017. CERT’s Will Dormann, however, claims that Microsoft should keep EMET alive, as this is “still an important tool to help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.” According to him, version 5.51 of the tool provides both system-wide protection and application-specific mitigations that continue to make it relevant even on Windows 10 systems. The application-specific protection offered by EMET makes all the difference, he explains. While both a stock Windows installation and one with EMET properly configured offer about the same level of system-wide mitigations, a Windows installation without EMET is virtually unprotected when application-specific mitigations are considered, as the table to the right shows. “It is pretty clear that an application running on a stock Windows 10 system does not have the same protections as one running on a Windows 10 system with EMET properly configured. Even a Windows 7 system with EMET configured protects your application more than a stock Windows 10 system,” Dormann says. According to him, Microsoft’s claim that Windows 10 makes EMET irrelevant is fiction, mainly because it overlooks the primary reason for someone to run the tool: because it can apply all of the available exploit mitigations to all applications. This doesn’t happen through the underlying Windows platform even if the operating system offers support for the mitigation, the researcher explains. Because developers adopt exploit mitigations at a slow rate, EMET with application-specific mitigations enabled is the only protection available. Even Microsoft doesn’t “compile all of Office 2010 with the /DYNAMICBASE flag to indicate compatibility with ASLR,” meaning that an attacker could work around ASLR to load a non-DYNAMICBASE library into the process space of the vulnerable application and could exploit a memory corruption vulnerability, the researcher explains. “Microsoft strongly implies that if you are running Windows 10, there is no need for EMET anymore. This implication is not true. The reason it's not true is that Windows 10 does not provide the application-specific mitigations that EMET does,” Dormann notes. While Windows 10 does provide some exploit mitigations, Dormann explains, the applications have been be specifically compiled to take advantage of them. Thus, if an application isn’t built to take advantage of the mitigation, it doesn’t matter if the underlying operating system supports that mitigation or not. The researcher also notes that, while EMET will reach its end-of-life (EOL) on July 31, 2018, the application will likely continue to work as before, only without assistance from Microsoft. Software currently outside of the support window should be tested so that EMET could provide protection against zero-days. Vulnerabilities in products outside of their support cycle become “forever-days,” because they will never be fixed, the researcher also says. In Dormann’s opinion, both an upgrade to Windows 10 for exploit mitigation and installing EMET with application-specific mitigations configured are recommended actions. Without the utility, system-wide mitigations of DEP and ASLR can be applied, but Windows 10 can’t cover all of the mitigations admins using EMET have come to rely on. The tool, he says, can provide protection against both zero-days in supported software and forever-days in unsupported software.",

      "text": "  Install Apps From Windows 10 Store Without A Microsoft Account Install Apps From Windows 10 Store Without A Microsoft Account   28th,   \nEver since the first release of Windows 10 back in July 2015, it’s been possible to install and use Windows 10 without a Microsoft account . An end user who is not comfortable using a Microsoft account can create a local user account and use the same to sign in to Windows 10. \nWhen using a local user account to sign in to Windows 10, you don’t get to use sync, find my device , and some other features present in Windows 10. \nBefore the Anniversary Update, although local user account users always had access to the Store, they couldn’t install apps from the Store without signing in to the Store with Microsoft account. When you click the Get app button, the Store would display the sign in page. Install apps without signing in to Windows 10 Store \nWith Anniversary Update for Windows 10, Microsoft has made a small change to its Store policy, and local account users can now install apps from Store without having to sign in to the Store. This means that, an end user can use most of the features of Windows 10 without a Microsoft account. In short, you can now install apps from Windows 10 Store without a Microsoft account. \nWhile Microsoft has not said anything about this change, it seems that this new change is applicable to all editions of Windows 10 with Anniversary Update. \nThat said, as you can imagine, it’s not possible to purchase and install commercial apps without signing in to Store. This is important as the users can reinstall purchased games and apps by signing in to the Store app . \nHaving said that, you get many benefits by signing in to the Store. First, you can see installed and purchased app history . Second, you can add and save payments options. Note that you can sign out of Store at any time without having to sign out of Windows 10 account.",

      "text": "Two years ago, Sri Charvitha, a student of the B.V. Raju Institute of Technology, walked into the Microsoft campus in Hyderabad to join the Women in Software Engineering (WISE) mentoring programme. Dreaming of leveraging it to land a reputable job, she transformed herself from a rookie coder to an enlightened developer. Microsoft launched WISE in 2014 to inspire women engineers to pursue rewarding careers in the field of software technology.\n“We have worked with partners who interacted in local and regional colleges to help the volunteers offer the students a strong platform that nurtures their technical capabilities and enhances their soft skills to be job-ready at the end of the programme,” Charumathy Srinivasan, Partner Group Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft India Development Center, told IANS.\nThe idea stemmed from a group of women engineers at Microsoft India who wanted to help women engineering students carve out successful careers in technology. “When we began the WISE mentoring programme, our first batch had 10 students from the B.V. Raju Institute of Technology and each of them developed interesting applications. The students worked from the ideating phase to actually publishing the app,” Srinivasan added.\nThe WISE programme comprises a mentoring ring of volunteers who aim to create an experiential learning for the students to hone their professional skills and cultivate a “can do” attitude. Additionally, it also allows participants to enhance their learning in the area of their technological interest.\nAfter the success of first batch, the second focused not only on helping students build apps but also introduced deep-learning modules with a focus on Big Data and Machine Learning. The second batch students built nine applications across platforms, demonstrating their understanding of agile development of solutions. “The feedback from the college faculties was also extremely favourable, with recognition of how the sessions had enhanced the students’ academic and personal development. Earlier this month, we inducted 35 students for our third batch,” Srinivasan noted.\nAnother participant in the programme, Lalitha Gade, has inspired her fellow students by building a school bus tracking application called Trackyaan as a part of the WISE programme. She credits her transformation into an industry-ready professional to the Microsoft mentors.\n“The WISE Mentoring Ring has been an ideal platform to help us transform into professionals by enhancing our skills and confidence. The mentoring sessions helped us learn the latest technologies from the experts and gave us an opportunity to build Trackyaan and publish it. Our mentors transmuted us into industry-ready professionals,” Gade told IANS.\n“WISE Mentoring Ring helped me gain invaluable knowledge in both technical and soft skills. The sessions made us competent to develop and publish an app, WalletLog, on Google Play Store. During the sessions, I have learnt how to communicate effectively, collaborate with teams and carry myself with poise even in tough situations,” Sravya Kanagarla, another student, said.\n“While we run an industry collaboration programme with Talent Sprint for Women in Software Engineering, the perspective of applying their learning in a large organisation environment is daunting and challenging to a student,” Ravichandran Rajagopal, Vice Chair, Sri Vishnu Educational Society, one of the institutional partners, told IANS. “The fact that women mentors from Microsoft came together and volunteered to mentor girl students to adapt their career and create a product company mindset was unique and appealing,” Rajagopal added.\nIANS \nThe post Microsoft’s Women in Software Engineering program is helping women turn more efficient appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Microsoft Azure Flaws Exposed RHEL Instances By Eduard Kovacs on November 28, 2016 Tweet \nVulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform could have been exploited by attackers to gain administrator access to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) instances and storage accounts. \nAzure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) rely on the Red Hat Update Infrastructure ( RHUI ) to manage yum repository content for RHEL instances. Red Hat Update Appliances , which contact the Red Hat Network to fetch new and updated packages, have been created by Microsoft and Amazon for each region. \nWhile trying to create a RHEL image that could be used on both Azure and AWS, Irish researcher Ian Duffy noticed that some Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) files contained client configurations for each region. This allowed the discovery of all Red Hat Update Appliances, with all servers exposing their REST APIs over HTTPS. \nAn application running on port 8080 revealed the locations of archives containing logs and configuration files. The archives included SSL certificates that could be used to gain full administrative access to Red Hat Update Appliances. \nFull access to an appliance’s REST API and the lack of package signature checks allowed an attacker to upload packages that would be acquired by client virtual machines when performing a yum update. With the yum update installed, the attacker may have been able to gain root access to all virtual machines that executed the update. \nIn addition to data stored in virtual machines, an attacker might have been able to obtain access to storage accounts . \n“Given some poor implementation within the mandatory Microsoft Azure Linux Agent (WaLinuxAgent), one is able to obtain the administrator API keys to the storage account used by the virtual machine for debug log shipping purposes. At the time of research, this storage account defaulted to one shared by multiple virtual machines,” Duffy said. “If the storage account was used by multiple virtual machines there is potential to download their virtual hard disks.” \nThe flaws were reported to Microsoft through the company’s bug bounty program . The tech giant confirmed the issues and took steps to prevent public access to the app on port 8080 and Red Hat Update Appliances.",

      "text": "Next-gen Surface Phone from Microsoft could come with 6GB RAM and more Some rumoured key technical specs of Microsoft Surface Phone have surfaced online. November 28, 2016 11:31 IST Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Reuters \nTechnology giant Microsoft's highly-expected Surface Phone could be just more than high-end, if new unofficial reports are anything to go by. These new 'more than high-end' technical aspects could extend to as much as a 6GB RAM which could be, a first-for for Microsoft, if true. \nAccording to NokiaPowerUser, which claims to have quoted trusted internal sources and also claims to have information regarding different Microsoft Surface Phone prototypes , there is at least one Surface Phone variant offering 6GB RAM to users. This is also apparently the handset featuring a 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile internal architecture. List of Microsoft Xbox One Backwards Compatible title grows with the addition of most requested games \nThis 6GB edition is also rumoured to offer a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC featuring the Quick Charge 4.0 battery technology. At this point in time, it is worth noting that both the Snapdragon 835 and the associated Quick Charge 4.0 are the latest as far as under-the-hood mobile processing is concerned. \nAnother rumour also points at the existence of a 4GB RAM variant in addition to the 6GB RAM Surface Phone edition. At this juncture, both these alleged Surface Phone variants are said to be in test. This means that there is every possibility that either of the variants or both of them may have a commercial launch. \nThe overall list of key technical specifications concerning the unreleased/unannounced Microsoft Surface Phone are yet to even surface now. However, rumour mills are pointing at a relatively-large 5.5-inch display on both the flagship phones. Also read ",

      "text": "Microsoft’s msft Chinese-language AI chat bot filters certain topics, the company confirmed Monday, although it did not clarify whether that included interactions deemed politically sensitive.\nLast week, CNNMoney and China Digital Times reported that Xiaoice would not directly respond to questions surrounding topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese state. References to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 or “Steamed Bun Xi,” a nickname of Chinese President Xi Jinping, would draw evasive answers or non sequiturs from the chat bot, according to the report.\n“Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a screengrab,” read one answer to a question that contained the words “topple the Communist Party.”\nEven the mention of Donald Trump, the American President-elect, drew an evasive response from the chat bot, according to reports. “I don’t want to talk about it,” Xiaoice said, reports CNN Money.\nIn response to inquiries from Fortune , Microsoft confirmed that there was some filtering around Xiaoice’s interaction.\n“We are committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells Fortune . “With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.” The tech giant did not further elaborate to which specific topics the filtering applied.\nChina’s scored dead last in a Freedom House survey on Internet freedoms last year. Content deemed politically sensitive by the state would be censored, and websites like Google and Wikipedia were routinely blocked.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nMicrosoft says that Xiaoice engages in conversations with over 40 million Chinese users on social media platform like Weibo and WeChat, reports CNNMoney -- a runaway success compared with Tay , Xiaoice’s ill-fated counterpart which was essentially pranked into sending hateful messages while it was briefly active on Twitter. Fortune was unable put Xiaoice to the test.\n\nFor more on chat bots, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nLast week, reports emerged that Facebook fb might be developing censorship tools in a bid to return to China, which has blocked the service alongside other platforms like Twitter since 2009.\nRead More: Facebook Is Entering a Minefield With Chinese Censorship Tool \nFacebook told Fortune in a statement that it had “ not made any decision on our approach to China,” stressing that its “ focus right now is on helping Chinese businesses and developers expand to new markets outside China by using our ad platform.” ",

      "text": "  Microsoft Microsoft Surface Studio is reportedly shipping earlier than original schedule. \nThe hybrid desktop that everyone is talking about, the Microsoft Surface Studio, was initially slated to ship in mid-December. However, there have been reports that the tech giant has already started shipping units this week. \nWhen the Surface Studio was launched, Microsoft released on its official website that it will be coming out before Christmas, at least mid-December. However, according to reports , the head of Surface and Corporate vice president for Surface Computing, Panos Panay, sent an email to some clients of Surface Studio. Microsoft, apparently, sent the email to those who have pre-ordered the device that the units will be arriving soon, sooner than its first schedule. \nApart from early shipments, the tech giant will also be giving a dedicated phone line to new users to assist them when they find issues with the upcoming device. The pre-order, however, is exclusively available in the US. Users outside US may have to wait a little longer, maybe early of 2017 to get their devices. \nIn an interview with Business Insider , Panay revealed that the Microsoft Surface tablet debut in 2012 was just the tip of the iceberg of what the Surface family wants to show to the tech industry, and that is the capability of the touchscreen Windows computers. He added that he wanted to make sure that the unveiling would happen right. Advertisement \nFour years later, the Surface family keeps getting bigger and bigger, especially now that they have dropped its one-of-a-kind hybrid desktop, the Surface Studio. \n\"The entire ecosystem benefits when we create new categories and experiences that bring together the best of hardware and software,\" Panay explained. He added that the Surface Studio is \"a new way for people to experience Windows 10, Office, Skype and more.\" \nBased on the initial reception of the device, it is getting rave reviews and positive nods both from the regular users and the artists. \nThe 20-inch touchscreen all-in-one desktop has a starting price of $3,000.

      "text": "  5 screenshots Clean, correct, extract and tweak your Microsoft Excel spreadsheets featuring customer, company-related or financial data with this utility Generally speaking, if your company works with large Excel spreadsheets that include years of information about your customers, deliveries, services, transactions or other type of data, then there is a fair chance that these documents contain errors, misspells and duplicates. Methis Data.mill for Excel is an add-in for Microsoft's spreadsheet editor that enables you to correct errors, eliminate duplicates and retrieve specific information about your customers, company or financial status. Entails an average difficulty setup First off, you should know that you are required to create an account on the developers website in order to try out the utility. You can register free of charge, whereas creating a new account takes little of your time. Even though the installer is in German, the installation itself is straightforward and should not pose any issues. You are required to enter your credentials in order to access the application. In case you do not view the add-in in the toolbar, then restarting Excel usually fixes the problem. Helps you extract specific chunks of data from spreadsheets The highlight of the add-in comes from its ability to retrieve specific types of information from your lists, including but not limited to phone numbers, email addresses, names, genders and postal addresses. You should know that the tool can recognize the genre of the users listed in your spreadsheet by accounting for possible cultural differences. More precisely, the app determines the genre based on the location of the user. Allows you to clean your files from duplicates A further noteworthy feature of the tool is that it enables you to remove duplicate records in your database. It is important to note that the utility can detect typo errors and, since it compares the information with the other data available, it can help you identify erroneous entries. For example, if you have customers with similar names, the app analyzes other info associated with them, such as address or postal code for instance, before returning the results. The function can be useful in reducing the size of your database and hence, reduce the costs of storage in the long run. A handy tool for anyone working with large Excel spreadsheets In the eventuality that you want to manage large Excel spreadsheets efficiently and clear them of duplicates, errors, deleted data or simple misspells, so you can use valid data for your next projects, then Methis Data.mill for Excel could lend you a hand.

      "text": "AP Photo/Jeff Widener \nMicrosoft's Chinese chatbot Xiaoice is wildly popular — just don't ask it about Tiananmen Square.\nThe conversational two-year-old Chinese-speaking bot won't talk about certain controversial political topics, even refusing to talk to users if they persist in their attempts.\nAlongside the iconic protests, Xiaoice also won't discuss US president-elect Donald Trump, Chinese president Xi Jinping, the Communist Party, and the Dalai Llama.\nThese restrictions were first spotted by China Digital Times , and also tested out by CNN .\nA Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that the bot censors certain subjects, saying in a statement: \"We’re committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice. With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.\"\nWhen asked about Tiananmen by China Digital Times, Xiaoice responded: \"You know very well that I can’t respond to that, boring.\" When China Digital Times persisted, it cut off communication entirely: \"Unable to communicate with you, blacklisted!\"\nCNN asked it about Donald Trump, and it innocuously replied: \"I'm just a random observer.\"\n\"Am I stupid? Once I answer you'd take a screengrab,\" it said in response to questions about Xi Jinping and the Communist Party.\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/799295348657311748\n#微软真软 #小冰 微软机器人小冰问答（一）屏蔽了匪共认定的敏感词，八九六四，六四屠杀、高智晟、法轮功等，大家去玩 pic.twitter.com/WAiQXph2GH \nWhile this filtering might seem alarming to Westerners, it is an unavoidable cost of doing business in China. The country has a heavily censored internet, restricting its citizens' access to information on certain subjects and entire websites using the infamous \"Great Firewall of China.\"\nForeign companies that do work in China are forced to agree to its demands or face being banned entirely. In 2010, Google stopped censoring its Chinese search results after a series of cyberattacks — and was subsequently blocked in the country. (It remains banned there today.)\nAnd Facebook, which is currently banned in China, has reportedly built a tool that would automatically censor certain topics in a bid to be unbanned . Several employees allegedly quit in protest over its development.\nXiaoice was launched in 2014, and is a smash hit with Chinese users. It has 20 million registered users, The New York Times reported in 2015 , with many turning to it for companionship when feeling lonely.\nMicrosoft's attempts to launch a chatbot in English-speaking markets have been less successful . In March 2016, it released \"Tay\" — an English-speaking chatbot that emulated the jokey speech patterns of a millennial, and learned from its interactions with users.\nBut the experiment descended into farce after Tay \"learned\" to be a genocidal racist, calling for the extermination of Jews and Mexicans, insulting women, and denying the existence of the Holocaust.\nAP Photo/Jeff Widener \nThe company subsequently apologised, deleted its tweets and took the bot offline permanently .\nNOW WATCH: Scientists have discovered why American honey bees are turning into zombies \n",

San Francisco bureau chief, Inc. @ jeffbercovici WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nEditor's note: Inc. magazine will announce its pick for Company of the Year on Tuesday, November 29. Here, we spotlight Slack, last year's winner. \nSlack CEO Stewart Butterfield is a playful fellow, even when he's arming for war. When he left his job at Yahoo in 2008, Butterfield famously did so in one of the all-time weirdest resignation letters , a drawn-out riff on his passion for tin. \nIn November 2016, Butterfield dusted off his stationery and composed another cheeky note. This one was addressed to Microsoft, \"congratulating\" the software giant on its launch of a new workplace-collaboration product called Teams--a product press reports had for months been foreshadowing as a would-be \" Slack-killer .\" \n\"Wow. Big news! Congratulations on today's announcements,\" Butterfield wrote in the letter, which he published as a full-page ad in The New York Times . \"We're genuinely excited to have some competition.\" \n\"However,\" he went on, \"this is harder than it looks.... You're not going to create something people really love by making a big list of Slack's features and simply checking those boxes.\" \nButterfield was sincere in his frenemy's embrace. A year ago, when Inc . named Slack its Company of the Year for 2015 , it was essentially in a category of one, a niche product beloved among early adopters in the tech and media industries but relatively unknown in other parts of the business world. In a way, that was limiting, says Butterfield: Since most potential customers weren't using anything like Slack for intra-office chat and document sharing, the idea of spending money on it was a foreign concept. One step ahead \nTwelve months later, all of that has changed. Without abandoning its trademark whimsicality, Slack has grown up, a lot. It now has more than 1.25 million paid users, up 160 percent from a year ago. Annual recurring revenue has also doubled, to more than $100 million. The 33,000 teams using the paid premium version include corporate giants like IBM and Comcast. Slack's work force has swelled accordingly, to more than 650 people, with key executive hires coming from places like Salesforce, Apple, and Palantir. It has added a cool billion dollars to its valuation, now at $3.8 billion. \nAnd, yes, the competition has gotten as big as it gets, in the form of Microsoft, the 800-pound gorilla of the enterprise software world. Assessing the new threat, Butterfield is mostly sanguine. Since Microsoft is pushing Teams as part of its premium Office 365 bundle, he says, that means the 70 percent of businesses that don't use Office are still ripe for the taking. \nMore important, he says, Slack has a huge head start, one that will become much more apparent when it unveils its new enterprise-tier offering in the first quarter of 2017. That one is built specifically for use within very large organizations, with capabilities such as federating teams and managing permissions across tens of thousands of users. \nPlaying catch-up, he says, Microsoft is nowhere close to being able to challenge Slack on enterprise. \"This might sound unnecessarily biting, but they haven't seen what we've done yet, so they don't know they're going to have to copy it,\" he says. \"I think they just look at Slack and see the basic features of it, but they don't understand what a challenge it's going to be to administer when you have hundreds and hundreds or thousands of teams. We've just seen so many examples of how it works or fails to work in really large organizations.\" \nAnother change from a year ago: Slack now has an actual, honest-to-God sales operation. It has even dabbled in television brand advertising. But the key to growing the customer base continues to be making sure Slack's viral word of mouth translates into new premium subscriptions. Toward that end, Butterfield has built out Slack's customer success team, whose members, among other things, conduct training sessions at big companies to make sure employees using Slack for the first time know how to get the most out of it. \"If it was just turned on for 5,000 people all at once with no instruction, it just wouldn't work,\" he says. \"It needs to come with some starter culture.\" \nAt the heart of Slack's selling proposition is enhanced productivity. In surveys, customers have told the startup their teams are, on average, 32 percent more effective since they got on Slack. Butterfield discounts that figure as probably inflated, but notes that even a 3 percent productivity increase for a team of, say, software engineers easily enough generates \"massive return\" on an $80,000 premium subscription or a $384,000 enterprise subscription. Big plans, bigger challenges \nSomeday soon, he hopes, Slack will be able to make teams radically more efficient still. Slack's API already makes it easy to create programmable \"bot\" users that employ conversational chat to carry out simple functions--for instance, turning receipts into expense reports. As artificial intelligence makes bots more capable, and as companies that use Slack integrate it more and more into their other software systems, he says, \"you could ask a bot the kind of question you would ask a really competent chief of staff who had the ability to read every single message in every single channel,\" he says. \"If you had that hypothetical never-sleeps, infinite-capacity, perfect-memory chief of staff, we'd get a lot more leverage out of the investment we make in all these IT systems and software platforms.\" \nSpeaking of getting leverage out of an investment, Slack's backers, who have given the startup some $540 million in capital to date, are probably starting to think about their own returns. Unlike so-called \"unicorns\" that will do anything to delay going public, Slack, says Butterfield, has been operating in a way that will allow it to IPO whenever it wants, hiring a controller and conducting multiple audits. The major obstacle for now is that Slack is simply shooting up too fast to be able to give Wall Street any reliable forecast of its future growth. \"One of the things you need to go public is a high degree of predictability,\" he says. \"When you're growing more than 100 percent a year, a little change results in a big delta.\" Published on: Nov 28, 2016 Advertisement",

      "title": "Microsoft's Chinese chatbot won't talk about Tiananmen Square or Donald Trump (MSFT)",
      "text": "AP Photo/Jeff Widener \nMicrosoft's Chinese chatbot Xiaoice is wildly popular — just don't ask it about Tiananmen Square. \nThe conversational two-year-old Chinese-speaking bot won't talk about certain controversial political topics, even refusing to talk to users if they persist in their attempts. \nAlongside the iconic protests, Xiaoice also won't discuss US president-elect Donald Trump, Chinese president Xi Jinping, the Communist Party, and the Dalai Llama. \nThese restrictions were first spotted by China Digital Times , and also tested out by CNN . \nA Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that the bot censors certain subjects, saying in a statement: \"We’re committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice. With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.\" \nWhen asked about Tiananmen by China Digital Times, Xiaoice responded: \"You know very well that I can’t respond to that, boring.\" When China Digital Times persisted, it cut off communication entirely: \"Unable to communicate with you, blacklisted!\" \nCNN asked it about Donald Trump, and it innocuously replied: \"I'm just a random observer.\" \n\"Am I stupid? Once I answer you'd take a screengrab,\" it said in response to questions about Xi Jinping and the Communist Party. \n#微软真软 #小冰 微软机器人小冰问答（一）屏蔽了匪共认定的敏感词，八九六四，六四屠杀、高智晟、法轮功等，大家去玩 pic.twitter.com/WAiQXph2GH — Suyutong (@Suyutong) November 17, 2016 \nWhile this filtering might seem alarming to Westerners, it is an unavoidable cost of doing business in China. The country has a heavily censored internet, restricting its citizens' access to information on certain subjects and entire websites using the infamous \"Great Firewall of China.\" \nForeign companies that do work in China are forced to agree to its demands or face being banned entirely. In 2010, Google stopped censoring its Chinese search results after a series of cyberattacks — and was subsequently blocked in the country. (It remains banned there today.) \nAnd Facebook, which is currently banned in China, has reportedly built a tool that would automatically censor certain topics in a bid to be unbanned . Several employees allegedly quit in protest over its development. \nXiaoice was launched in 2014, and is a smash hit with Chinese users. It has 20 million registered users, The New York Times reported in 2015 , with many turning to it for companionship when feeling lonely. \nMicrosoft's attempts to launch a chatbot in English-speaking markets have been less successful . In March 2016, it released \"Tay\" — an English-speaking chatbot that emulated the jokey speech patterns of a millennial, and learned from its interactions with users. \nBut the experiment descended into farce after Tay \"learned\" to be a genocidal racist, calling for the extermination of Jews and Mexicans, insulting women, and denying the existence of the Holocaust. \nTwitter",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Microsoft is rumored to unveil the Surface Phone and the Surface Pro 5 simultaneously at the MWC in February 2017. \nMicrosoft has yet to make any official announcements regarding the release date of the highly rumored Surface Phone and the Surface Pro 5. Recent speculations, however, point to an early 2017 release for both devices. \nIt has been said that the Surface Phone and the Surface Pro 5 could be making their debut simultaneously at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain, in February 2017. Microsoft has neither confirmed nor denied these rumors as of late, but fans are undoubtedly remaining hopeful for the best. With Microsoft proving its technological prowess with the Surface Book, tech enthusiasts can't wait to see what the Redmond-based company has in store with the Surface Phone and the Surface Pro 5. \nRumor has it that the Surface Pro 5 will have the Kaby Lake processor as opposed to the Skylake processor. This makes sense because Intel's latest offering is top-notch and certainly fits well with Microsoft's repertoire. Moreover, it is suspected that the Surface Pro 5 will arrive with a Surface Pen, as well as a USB-C port. \nAs for the Surface Phone, according to Phone Arena , a source called Nokia Power User has shed some light on what fans can expect from the device. It will apparently have either 4 GB or 6 GB of RAM, as Microsoft has two Surface Phone prototypes in the works. Display-wise, it will have a 5.5-inch Quad HD screen. Glance and ClearBlack screens are also two features that are expected to make it to the Surface Phone. It should be noted that these two features were previously part of the company's Lumia lineup. Advertisement \nUnder the hood, the Surface Phone is said to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, the most recent in the lineup of processors. Additionally, its operating system could be a Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3. Microsoft is supposedly collaborating with fellow tech giant HP to produce the upcoming Surface Phone. \nSince nothing can be known for sure at this point, though, readers should take this news with a grain of salt.

      "text": "Microsoft Acknowledges “Some” Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3200970 Issues GO KB3200970 was rolled out on this month’s Patch Tuesday Nov 28, 2016 10:56   ​Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 cumulative update KB3200970 as part of this month’s Patch Tuesday, and as we reported shortly after that, several users reported installation problems due to what seemed to be the typical issue that CUs have experienced in the past as well. The company has remained tight-lipped since then, but in a November 24 update of the KB page , Microsoft explains that it’s indeed aware of some installation issues on Lenovo systems that could cause devices to no longer boot. Microsoft explains than an UEFI update was released by Lenovo in order to address these problems caused by the cumulative update and says that users of the affective devices need to install it before anything else. “Some Lenovo servers do not start after this update is installed. Lenovo is aware of this problem and has released a UEFI update to address it. In the interim, Microsoft has changed the detection logic in the update to prevent additional customers from being affected,” Microsoft says. Only Windows Server devices affected Lenovo indeed confirms that there’s a problem with some of its devices, but says that only models running Windows Server 2016, 2012R2, or 2012 November update are affected, including Lenovo System X M5 and X6. “Only Lenovo Systems running Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012R2 and configured with secure boot are exposed. Lenovo Systems running Windows Server 2016 are exposed regardless of the secure boot configuration. The system will not complete POST and hangs at the Lenovo splash screen,” the firm explains. The workaround involves disabling automatic Windows updates and then updating the UEFI firmware before eventually installing the cumulative update once again. Lenovo says that replacing the system board will not fix the issue because this is a software issue caused by the cumulative update. As far as the other problems experienced by consumers on non-Lenovo systems, Microsoft hasn’t yet issued a statement, but a new CU should be released very soon for all Windows 10 devices.",

      "text": "White and Gold Microsoft Band Leaked GO This model is reportedly exclusive to Microsoft employees Nov 28, 2016 06:55   ​ Earlier this year, Panos Panay, the man in charge with everything Surface at the Redmond-based software giant, was spotted wearing what seemed to be a white Microsoft Band, and many people thought this was either the third generation or a special edition model. While Panos never talked about this white Microsoft Band, people with knowledge of the matter suggested it was only a model specifically built for company employees, so it was never launched and sold publicly. A video posted by Nokibar today provides us with a closer look at this super-exquisite Microsoft Band, which seems to feature a combination of white and gold for a very unique look. Basically, the only things that are different here are the actual band, which is white, and the case color, which is now gold, leading to a mix that makes us wonder why exactly the company hasn’t released this version for everyone. No other Microsoft Band coming According to the latest rumors, Microsoft not only that doesn’t have any plans to launch a white and gold Band, but the company wants to discontinue the Band series completely, with the software giant now trying to pull existing units from stores. It appears that Microsoft wanted to install Windows 10 IoT on the Microsoft Band for its third generation, but this experiment failed and the company decided to abandon the device completely. It was believed that the third-generation Microsoft Band was supposed to be a much more advanced device featuring not only waterproofing, but also interchangeable bands, becoming more of a smartwatch and less of an activity tracker. There’s no sign just yet of another activity tracker or smartwatch coming from Microsoft, but the company can always return in this business given the growing demand for wearables. At this point, the wearables market is led by Apple and Fitbit, and although Microsoft was never close to becoming number one, its devices have quite a lot fans across the world.",

      "text": "Microsoft has taken advantage of its Connect(); event in New York City to blow the tech world’s collective minds and drop jaws community-wide. By now, you will have heard that Microsoft has joined the nonprofit Linux Foundation.\nAs a platinum member of the Foundation, the traditionally closed-source Microsoft is pledged to contribute a minimum of $500K annually to the Foundation’s open-source projects. In further evidence of its pro-Linux shift, Microsoft revealed a preview of the next SQL Server, designed for both Windows and Linux. The Linux version may not be quite as feature-rich, but ArsTechnica reports that it should be mostly interchangeable with the Windows version.\nNot that this is Microsoft’s first big move toward either working with Linux or going open source. Microsoft has been working with Linux more and more in recent years, collaborating on the development of its hypervisor and incorporating the Linux Bash shell in Windows 10, for example. It has also contributed to projects like the Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, and OpenAI, the last of which will soon be using Microsoft’s new N-Series Virtual Machines and Azure Cloud Services to experiment with artificial intelligence.\nAt Microsoft Connect(); 2014, the company announced .NET would be released open source on GitHub in a huge turnaround from its normally proprietary practices. June saw this plan come to fruition. For those of you intending to take advantage of it, check out Syncfusion’s latest e-book, .NET Core Succinctly .\nAnd, of course, Visual Studio Code was released open source to GitHub last year. This year, though, the buzz surrounds the release of Visual Studio 2017 RC. According to Microsoft, the new version has improved the ease of installation, upgrading, and booting; increased speed and performance; and decreased memory usage, among many other improvements.\nIt’s always good to see big companies investing in technology that benefits everyone. Are you using any of these open-source projects? Have you tried out the new release candidate for Visual Studio?",

      "text": "100% FREE report malware 1 screenshot Manually install the latest antivirus definitions for Microsoft Security Essentials in case your computer is having trouble connecting to the Internet The Microsoft Security Essentials Definition Updates deploys a package containing the latest virus signatures for the latest release of Microsoft Security Essentials . Keeping Microsoft Security Essentials up-to-date ensures that your computer is protected at all times and that the latest viruses and spyware variations will be detected during scanning. Of course, you could just leave Microsoft Security Essentials to update its definitions on its own and, obviously, it is advisable you do so. But in case your computer is not permanently connected to the Internet or if you haven’t turned it on for a longer period of time, you should consider either forcing an update or manually updating the latest updates. It is the latter case when you need to download and install the Microsoft Security Essentials Definition Updates. One important thing is to download the correct definitions for your system’s architecture: 32-bit or 64-bit. Once you grab the setup file you need, just double click on it and follow the on-screen instructions to apply the latest definitions to Microsoft Security Essentials. The installer contains the complete, up-to-date anti-malware definitions for Microsoft Security Essentials, deploying the scanning engine (mpengine.dll), along with other files, such as mpasbase.vdm, mpasdlta.vdm, mpavbase.vdm, mpavdlt.vdm, mpsigstub.exe. Please note that Microsoft Security Essentials can only be installed on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as on more recent Windows iterations it is superseded by Windows Defender . Therefore, you should point to the Windows Defender Definition Updates if you are running Windows 8 or higher. Additionally, Microsoft Forefront Client Security ended its life cycle on July 14th 2015. Therefore, no definition updates will be available in the future for Forefront Client Security.
