      "text": "A convincing new phishing scam threatens Amazon shoppers – just as the online behemoth announced it would offer Black Friday-type bargains as often as every five minutes all the way through Dec. 22.\nThese bogus emails ( below ), purportedly sent by Amazon and already rampant in the United Kingdom and Australia, have the subject line “Your Amazon.com order cannot be shipped.”\nAmazon scam phishing email\nClaiming a problem processing orders, it says “You will not be able to access your account or place orders with us until we confirm your information.”\nA “click here” link leads to this authentic-looking page ( below ) to “confirm” your name, address and credit card information (including Expiration and CVV security code) – everything needed by fraudsters to make unauthorized charges.\nWays to save, expert investment advice, scam alerts and more! — AARP Money Newsletter »\nAfter entering that sensitive data and hitting the “Save & Continue” tab, users are stealthily redirected to the actual Amazon website, none the wiser that they just gave cyber crooks carte blanche to their plastic.\nDon’t take the bait. Rather than ever clicking an embedded ink from Amazon (or any other online retailer), go to Your Orders to determine if there is an order that matches the details in an email. If they don’t match, the message isn’t legitimate, notes Amazon .\nThis latest scheme isn’t the only Amazon-related gotcha these days.\nThere’s a recent uptick in a years-old ploy in which DirectTV imposters telephone existing subscribers and potential new customers, claiming this bogus promotion: By purchasing a $300 Amazon gift card and using it to prepay for services, DirecTV users can get a discounted month rate and additional channels. Although DirecTV has promotions that give Amazon or other gift cards for initiating new service agreements, it does not solicit payment that way – and Amazon gift cards cannot be used anywhere except its own website.\nMeanwhile, just weeks ago the Federal Trade Commission busted a telemarketing scheme involving five companies that falsely claimed to be affiliated with Amazon. According to an FTC complaint , the defendants’ telemarketers would falsely tell seniors, veterans and others people that for fees up to several thousand dollars, they could create a website linked to Amazon.com to earn thousands per month in commissions for work-at-home sales.\nAARP Member Advantages — discounts on financial services from trusted companies »\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network .

Enjoy the show! \nWATCH: Trusted Explains: All you need to know about TVs \nLet us know what you think of the show in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "Abel Fermin/REX/Shutterstock December 2, 2016 | 06:34AM PT \n“ Good Girls Revolt ,” the retro drama that told the story of female journalists battling for recognition at a revered newsweekly in the 1960s and early 1970s, is in danger of becoming part of history. Amazon Studios has declined to pick up the show for a second cycle, according to people with knowledge of the situation. \nAn Amazon Studios spokesperson could not be reached for immediate comment. Sony , the studio behind the program, intends to shop the series to other outlets, these people said. \nThe drama depicts a staff of editors and reporters at the fictional “News of the Week, all grappling with a singular challenge: The men are reporters who get all the glory, while the women are researchers who are often cheated of it. \nThe series, which was created by Dana Calvo and stars Genevieve Angelson, Anna Camp and Erin Drake, is based on the book “The Good Girls Revolt, written by Lynn Povich. \nThe cancellation comes despite data commissioned by Sony showing the series had gained traction among Amazon’s subscribers, according to one of these people. Data from Symphony Advanced Media, a company that tracks mobile streaming, suggested “Good Girls” had a significant audience with an 80% completion rate, this person said, and a viewership larger than Amazon series like “Goliath” and “Transparent.” \nThe Symphony numbers can be controversial, and not every party in the media business takes them as a proxy for viewer streaming activity. In the absence of hard data released by subscription-video-on-demand players like Netflix and Amazon, however, they are used as a directional guide.",

      "text": "BII \n\nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing  subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon is opening up its machine-learning capabilities to third-party developers with its new AI platform,  according to TechCrunch.\nThe service, which was introduced at Amazon's re:Invent developer conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday , boasts three new tools that span the whole gamut of machine learning — image recognition, text-to-speech, and a platform that lets developers build conversational applications: \nRekognition is an image-recognition service similar to Google's, Microsoft's, and Facebook's image-recognition offerings. Image recognition is an increasingly important tool as smartphone cameras become more prevalent in search and communications. Polly is Amazon’s text-to-speech service that uses machine learning and natural-language understanding (NLU) to produce more natural, life-like speech. It can distinguish between words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently, such as in “I live in Seattle” and “Live from New York,” Amazon explains. This is an important feature for developers looking to build apps with voice assistants. Lex is arguably the most important of the three announcements. Effectively, this is the technology that powers Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant featured in the Echo. Lex will enable developers to build all kinds of conversation applications, including chatbots and mobile and web applications. The apps can be launched on platforms like Facebook Messenger and eventually Slack, as well as existing communications platforms such as Twilio, Salesforce, and Zendesk, VentureBeat reports .  Amazon’s announcement strengthens its position in the burgeoning chatbot and machine-learning industry. It also puts it in the company of other tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook, which are looking to leverage their in-house expertise in the growing AI field. The sheer size of Amazon and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the largest cloud company globally — means that a larger audience of developers and businesses will have access to build, deploy, and run conversational applications.\nThis will help encourage greater awareness of the technology, and likely indicates that intelligent, conversational software is another step closer to mass adoption and use.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, coupled with the proliferation of messaging apps, are fueling the development of chatbots — software programs that use messaging as the interface through which to carry out any number of tasks, from scheduling a meeting, to reporting weather, to helping users buy a pair of shoes. \nForeseeing immense potential, businesses are starting to invest heavily in the burgeoning bot economy. A number of brands and publishers have already deployed bots on messaging and collaboration channels, including HP, 1-800-Flowers, and CNN. While the bot revolution is still in the early phase, many believe 2016 will be the year these conversational interactions take off.\nLaurie Beaver, research associate for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on chatbots that explores the growing and disruptive bot landscape by investigating what bots are, how businesses are leveraging them, and where they will have the biggest impact.\nThe report outlines the burgeoning bot ecosystem by segment, looks at companies that offer bot-enabling technology, distribution channels, and some of the key third-party bots already on offer. The report also forecasts the potential annual savings that businesses could realize if chatbots replace some of their customer service and sales reps. Finally, it compares the potential of chatbot monetization on a platform like Facebook Messenger against the iOS App Store and Google Play store.\nHere are some of the key takeaways: \nAI has reached a stage in which chatbots can have increasingly engaging and human conversations, allowing businesses to leverage the inexpensive and wide-reaching technology to engage with more consumers. Chatbots are particularly well suited for mobile — perhaps more so than apps. Messaging is at the heart of the mobile experience, as the rapid adoption of chat apps demonstrates. The chatbot ecosystem is already robust, encompassing many different third-party chat bots, native bots, distribution channels, and enabling technology companies.  Chatbots could be lucrative for messaging apps and the developers who build bots for these platforms, similar to how app stores have developed into moneymaking ecosystems.

      "text": "Amazon isn’t playing nice with Plex’s new cloud service Posted The   \nMedia server software Plex, which helps you organize your own library of movies, TV shows, photos, and music, is now making it easier to access the content you’ve saved on other cloud storage services with an expansion of its Plex Cloud service. The company has added support for online services Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft’s OneDrive – meaning you can stream your content from wherever you already have it saved online. \nFirst launched in September, Plex partnered with Amazon Cloud Drive for its new hardware-free media server, Plex Cloud, still in beta. \nThe idea with the service was to eliminate the need to have an always-on PC or some other piece of network-attached drive in order to use Plex’s media player. The move was a significant departure for Plex, which had historically focused on turning a local device into personal media server. \nFor non-technical users, Plex Cloud could be more appealing. They wouldn’t have to worry with installing software locally or organizing their content libraries, but could instead just upload your files to Amazon Cloud Drive, then stream from anywhere using the Plex app. \nHowever, it hasn’t all been smooth sailing, the company admits. It says that it has run into to some “technical challenges” with its Amazon Drive integration which it’s trying to address. \nUsers have been complaining in the Plex forums that they’ve been unable to upload their files to Amazon’s online service. Some customers suspect that Amazon has placed limits on the uploads – possibly due to how much content some people have been uploading – but Plex staff hasn’t confirmed any details. \nAs TechCrunch’s Matt Burns pointed out before, a partnership between a service like Plex and Amazon could be tricky due to the fact that some Plex users’ libraries contain pirated material – something that Amazon prohibits hosting on its servers. \nBut it’s unclear for now what the exact issue is, as Plex will not say. \nStill, it’s not a good look for the new service, which is only available to Plex Pass subscribers (Plex’s paid tier.) And many Plex Cloud beta users signed up for Amazon Cloud Drive – at $60 per year – just to use Plex Pass. \nIn the meantime, Plex hopes that rolling out support for other online storage services will offer a workaround for those affected. Now you can link to Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive, and create libraries in Plex with content from any of them. \nDespite the issues with Amazon, Plex says it expects to start doling out more invites to Plex Cloud beta on December 5th. 0",

      "text": "Tencent executive showcases 'Mini Apps' on WeChat \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon is opening up its machine-learning capabilities to third-party developers with its new AI platform, according to TechCrunch. \nThe service, which was introduced at Amazon's re:Invent developer conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday , boasts three new tools that span the whole gamut of machine learning — image recognition, text-to-speech, and a platform that lets developers build conversational applications: Rekognition is an image-recognition service similar to Google's, Microsoft's, and Facebook's image-recognition offerings. Image recognition is an increasingly important tool as smartphone cameras become more prevalent in search and communications. Polly is Amazon’s text-to-speech service that uses machine learning and natural-language understanding (NLU) to produce more natural, life-like speech. It can distinguish between words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently, such as in “I live in Seattle” and “Live from New York,” Amazon explains. This is an important feature for developers looking to build apps with voice assistants. Lex is arguably the most important of the three announcements. Effectively, this is the technology that powers Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant featured in the Echo. Lex will enable developers to build all kinds of conversation applications, including chatbots and mobile and web applications. The apps can be launched on platforms like Facebook Messenger and eventually Slack, as well as existing communications platforms such as Twilio, Salesforce, and Zendesk, VentureBeat reports . \nAmazon’s announcement strengthens its position in the burgeoning chatbot and machine-learning industry. It also puts it in the company of other tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook, which are looking to leverage their in-house expertise in the growing AI field. The sheer size of Amazon and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the largest cloud company globally — means that a larger audience of developers and businesses will have access to build, deploy, and run conversational applications. \nThis will help encourage greater awareness of the technology, and likely indicates that intelligent, conversational software is another step closer to mass adoption and use. \nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, coupled with the proliferation of messaging apps, are fueling the development of chatbots — software programs that use messaging as the interface through which to carry out any number of tasks, from scheduling a meeting, to reporting weather, to helping users buy a pair of shoes. \nForeseeing immense potential, businesses are starting to invest heavily in the burgeoning bot economy. A number of brands and publishers have already deployed bots on messaging and collaboration channels, including HP, 1-800-Flowers, and CNN. While the bot revolution is still in the early phase, many believe 2016 will be the year these conversational interactions take off. \nLaurie Beaver, research associate for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on chatbots that explores the growing and disruptive bot landscape by investigating what bots are, how businesses are leveraging them, and where they will have the biggest impact. \nThe report outlines the burgeoning bot ecosystem by segment, looks at companies that offer bot-enabling technology, distribution channels, and some of the key third-party bots already on offer. The report also forecasts the potential annual savings that businesses could realize if chatbots replace some of their customer service and sales reps. Finally, it compares the potential of chatbot monetization on a platform like Facebook Messenger against the iOS App Store and Google Play store. \nHere are some of the key takeaways: AI has reached a stage in which chatbots can have increasingly engaging and human conversations, allowing businesses to leverage the inexpensive and wide-reaching technology to engage with more consumers. Chatbots are particularly well suited for mobile — perhaps more so than apps. Messaging is at the heart of the mobile experience, as the rapid adoption of chat apps demonstrates. The chatbot ecosystem is already robust, encompassing many different third-party chat bots, native bots, distribution channels, and enabling technology companies. Chatbots could be lucrative for messaging apps and the developers who build bots for these platforms, similar to how app stores have developed into moneymaking ecosystems. \nIn full, the report: Breaks down the pros and cons of chatbots. Explains the different ways businesses can access, utilize, and distribute content via chatbots. Forecasts the potential impact chatbots could have for businesses. Looks at the potential barriers that could limit the growth, adoption, and use of chatbots. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "Comment Elon Musk beats out Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Steve Jobs as the most admired tech leader in a survey among 700 founders. Web Summit via Flickr \nTesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk beats out Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Steve Job as the most admired tech leader among 700 founders. The survey by VC firm First Round Capital was conducted from August to September 2016 and published just recently. \nMusk received 23 percent of the votes . Amazon's Jeff Bezos was way behind at only 10 percent. He was followed by Zuckerberg with just 6 percent and Jobs got 5 percent. Another Facebook executive, Sheryl Sandberg was the most cited female with one percent. According to the Country Caller , Musk was described by the San Francisco-based firm as \"more revolutionary than the legendary Steve Jobs\". \nMusk is nothing short of an ambitious businessman. He has several unearthly goals up his sleeves. From setting up a global high-speed internet connection through thousands of satellites to establishing a colony on Mars by 2024. SpaceX wants to be the first one to send an unmanned spacecraft to the famous Red Planet by 2018. The company has also been a constant partner of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In fact, SpaceX has been striking deals with NASA. According to Recode , they are set to launch satellites \"that will monitor the earth's surface water and climate change\". \nBut this is not to say that SpaceX did not suffer from any hurdles along the way. Their rocket has exploded a few months ago. The investigation is still underway and the definite cause is yet to be determined. Though the said Falcon 9 rocket is planned to be launched on Dec. 16 since the incident. \nAs for Tesla, the US automaker had a good third quarter earnings . Musk was also instrumental for the company's shareholders to vote in favor of SolarCity's acquisition . Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system hit the news after a fatal crash incident that involved a driver while using the said technology. Germany even sent a letter to Tesla owners and reminded them to not rely entirely on the Autopilot. \nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles has also a proposed regulations that would prohibit Tesla and other carmakers to use the word \"auto-pilot\" or \"self-driving\". Apparently, they are only misleading consumers as they are being used in marketing. Still, Musk just confirmed that Tesla will be releasing an Enhanced Autopilot feature. This is a step towards the company's goal of fully autonomous cars. \nImagine once Musk is able to achieve those feats regarding Mars and cars, he will be admired much more.",

      "title": "Tutorial: Content Distribution with Amazon CloudFront",
      "text": "DevOps \nConsider a situation in which you’ve developed a groundbreaking website, and you would like to share your content with the world. The problem is that your hosting provider is based in New York, and you’re concerned that a user from a different region, such as Europe or Australia, won’t be able to view your content quickly and reliably. Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) solution that allows your content distribution to be shared in an accelerated manner from multiple edge locations around the world. Speed Plus Reliability \nWhen a user’s browser requests an image or other content from your website, chances are that request will bounce around the Internet as many as 10-20 times while it is routed to the correct location to retrieve that content. What CloudFront does is keep a copy of that content available at multiple locations around the world. When a request is received for the content, CloudFront is able to serve it up from the location with the lowest latency for the user, and with a reduced number of hops around the internet. \nHaving the content available at multiple locations also increases the reliability of the content, because it is available from multiple locations around the globe. At the time of writing, more than 60 Amazon Cloudfront edge locations were available on five continents. Setting Up Content You Want to Share \nYou’ll need access to an AWS environment in order to complete the following. All of this should be available if you are using the free tier. For more information on how to set up a free account with Amazon, please see the following link: https://aws.amazon.com/ \nFor this example, we’ll make an image available from CloudFront. In the past, when you wanted to include an image on your site, you would upload the image and then reference it directly from your page with a link such as http://{your_domain}/images/mainHeaderBg.png . With this example, we’ll upload that image to S3, setup some permissions and then distribute it over CloudFront. The end result will be a URL similar to: http://d2zo62o2iuzu83.cloudfront.net/mainHeaderBg.png . You can include this on your page, and it will allow users to access the image quickly and reliably. Step 1. Create a New Bucket. \nLet’s begin by navigating to your S3 console in AWS . Ensure you are signed into your AWS account. Create a new bucket by clicking on the Create Bucket button. \nSelect a region close to you and enter a unique name for your bucket which conforms to AWS requirements (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html), and then click Create . \nWith your new bucket created, click into the folder, and then click on the Actions button, and choose the Upload action. Drag your image onto the Drag and drop files area of the screen. Before you upload, click on the Set Details > button, and then Set Permissions > . Check the box next to Make everything public , and then click on Start Upload . \nYou should now have your image available in your bucket. And you should be able to view your image through a browser at your specific URL, which should look similar to: http://global-content-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mainHeaderBg.png depending on your region and bucket name. \nWith public content, we’re now ready to create a CloudFront Web Distribution. Step 2. Create the CloudFront Web Distribution \nEnsure you are signed into your AWS account, and navigate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/ . Then click on Create Distribution . \nSince we’re planning on serving up static web content, we’ll click the Get Started button under the Web section. \nYou will now be presented with a page full of options. These options control where the content is sourced, how it will be cached and how it will be delivered to your users. I used the default values where possible in order to set up the simplest distribution possible. Clicking on the black information icon to the right of each option will explain what the setting is used for. Step 3. Select Your Origin Settings Origin Domain Name : This is the URL of the S3 bucket where you stored the image. In my case this will be set to: global-content-images.s3.amazonaws.com. Origin Path : Optional field specifying a subdirectory within the bucket. I left this blank. Origin ID : Description of the origin. This allows you to add a description which allows you to differentiate multiple origins in the same distribution from each other. I left mine set to the default which is: S3-global-content-images Restrict Bucket Access :This option restricts users to using the CloudFront URL only, and prevents access to the resource through the S3 URL. This is set to No by default, which I chose to keep. Origin Custom Headers : These are used to add custom headers to the request from the client. I left these blank. Step 4. Set the Default Cache Behavior \nI’ve accepted the default values for all of this settings. This allows end users to access my resource using both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and cached the object on the CloudFront edge locations for 24 hours. This also allows open access to my resource and didn’t automatically compress it. For more information on these settings and how you can optimize them to meet your needs, Amazon offers an excellent description here . Step 5. Enter Your Distribution Settings \nAs with the Default Cache Behavior Settings, you can simply leave the default values in this section as well. These settings determine how your resource will be distributed, including pricing options, logging options and HTTP and SSL options. \nAs with all AWS offerings, there are allowances built into the Free Usage Tier if you are using the 1-year free trial offered by Amazon. The pricing structure is based on demand and usage and is explained in greater detail on the pricing page . \nFinally, I ensured that the Distribution State was set to Enabled , and clicked Create Distribution . \nAt this point, AWS will begin processing the distribution. The screen you’ll see lists all CloudFront distributions, and includes a Status column, which will update from In Progress to Deployed when your resource is ready to test. Amazon indicates that the process can take as long as 15 minutes. When I tried this on my account, it seemed to be closer to 20 minutes. Even after the 20 minutes, however, while my distribution was deployed, it still took additional time for the image to become available. I suspect this may be a result of the time required for propagation of the DNS information. Step 6. Testing Your CloudFront Web Distribution \nOnce the status of your distribution has changed to Deployed, you can test it. The URL for the resource is made up of the Domain Name assigned in the distribution, and the Object Name of your original resource in S3. In my case, this results in a URL of: http://d2zo62o2iuzu83.cloudfront.net/mainHeaderBg.png where d2zo62o2iuzu83 is the assigned by CloudFront for the distribution. It’s as Easy as That! \nAside from the additional time you may experience waiting for the image to become available, these steps are all you have to complete to make your content readily available around the world.",

      "text": "December 2 at 9:44 AM Follow chriscmooney\nA tract of Amazon rainforest, cleared by loggers and farmers for agriculture, is seen near the city of Santarem, Para State in 2013. (Reuters/Nacho Doce) Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, or INPE, released new data on the ongoing deforestation of the country’s portion of the Amazon rainforest this week, based on satellite measurements. And the news is very bad.\nFrom August of 2015 through July of this year, the enormous forest lost nearly 8,000 square kilometers of area to clear cutting, representing a 29 percent increase over a year earlier (when 6,207 square kilometers were lost). That’s an area considerably larger than the state of Delaware.\nThis means that since 2012, when deforestation hit a historic low after many years at high rates, it is now bouncing back again — and doing so at a time when researchers say protecting tropical forests, and allowing them to regrow, is one of the most effective short-term ways of fighting climate change.\n“This is a big deal,” said Daniel Nepstad, an Amazon expert and senior scientist at the Earth Innovation Institute. “It is the highest deforestation number since 2008. Compared to the lowest deforestation number, in 2012, it means an extra 150 million tons of CO2 went up into the air through forest destruction.”\n“It seems that we are facing a new trend of deforestation,” added André Guimarães, the executive director of Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM). “It has increased two years, it’s now close to 8,000 square kilometers. We left behind the level of 5,000 square kilometers, which was stable for three years.”\nThe loss of tropical forests is a crucial factor in the warming of the planet. Deforestation and the degradation of forests accounts for between 8 and 15 percent of the globe’s total emissions.\n[ The solution to climate change that has nothing to do with cars or coal ]\nThe causes of the uptick in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon aren’t fully clear, but experts like Nepstad suggest that it represents a decrease in enforcement on the part of the Brazilian government, which was not only in a state of political upheaval in 2016 but also has been facing a severe recession.\n“Suppression of Amazon deforestation is still highly dependent upon command-and-control measures–namely, law enforcement,” he said. “The cost to the government–to Brazilian taxpayers–of catching and penalizing people who are clearing forests illegally is huge and Brazil’s economic crisis has cut into the budgets of the federal environmental enforcement agency (IBAMA) and the state level enforcement agencies. In addition to a weakened enforcement effort, beef prices have increased, making it more lucrative to convert forests into cattle pastures.”\nNepstad says the use of economic incentives to reduce deforestation is what’s currently missing, and that enforcement measures alone won’t be enough.\nIn its pledge to the world under the Paris climate agreement, the government of Brazil laid out plans to halt all illegal deforestation in the Amazon by 2030 and to restore 12 million hectares (120,000 square kilometers) of forests by that year. It’s clearly moving in the wrong direction if it wants to achieve this goal.\nMoreover, the idea of waiting until 2030 to stop illegal actions is itself a way of sending “mixed signals,” said Guimarães. “The central government tells, ‘Look, we are going to stop illegal deforestation in 15 years.’ That means, keep on going with your illegal activities, because we’ll deal with that 15 years from now.”\nAt least until fairly recently, Brazil was seen as a success story when it came to cutting back on deforestation of the Amazon. Deforestation totals in the 1990s and early 2000s were astronomical — averaging 19,500 square kilometers per year between 1995 and 2005. Yet with tougher law enforcement and other measures such as an international soy moratorium , it had plunged to a low of 4,571 square kilometers by 2012.\nThe problem is that it is now clearly going up again.\n“The increase in deforestation rates can be linked to signals from Brazil’s government that it will tolerate the destruction of the Amazon. In recent years, public environmental protection policies in Brazil have weakened. For example, very few protected areas and Indigenous Lands have been created, and a new Forest Code was approved in 2012 that gives amnesty to those who committed illegal deforestation,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, Amazon campaigner with Greenpeace, in a statement.\nGeorge Mason University professor Thomas Lovejoy, who operates a research project in a completely undisturbed part of the Amazon near Manaus, in collaboration with the Brazilian government , saw a recently deforested plot along a road close to the research area last December. He now says it was a “first indication” of the deforestation increase.\n“For our immediate situation we are cutting down road access,” he said by email from Manaus.",

      "text": "  05:30 AM PST by Steven Cohen \nTwo new streaming kids shows are heading to Prime Video. \nAmazon has announced the latest additions to its lineup of original kids series. The upcoming shows include 'Bug Diaries' and 'Sid & Marty Krofft's Sigmund and the Sea Monsters.' \n\"We are so excited to bring this beloved series, Bug Diaries, to our customers that highlights important life lessons for our young viewers,\" said Tara Sorensen , Head of Kids Programming at Amazon Studios. \"We also look forward to reviving the classic Sigmund and the Sea Monsters that has a strong message of friendship.\" \n' The Bug Diaries ' - An animated comedy series for preschoolers based on the witty children’s books by best-selling author Doreen Cronin and best-selling Illustrator Harry Bliss. The show follows a comic trio of slimy, crawly, and buzzy bug friends whose tiny world offers up huge adventures. Pairing kid-personalities with incredible bug abilities, the series will give us a mile-high look at the world through Fly’s compound eyes, let us squirm in Worm’s “footsteps\", and literally hang around with Spider as they record their adventures, each in their own way, in their bug diaries. \n' Sid & Marty Krofft present Sigmund and the Sea Monsters ' - A live action show for children ages 6 to 11, based on their classic Saturday morning series from the 1970s. The show is centered on two brothers, Johnny and Scotty, who along with their cousin Robyn befriend Sigmund, a friendly young sea-monster who escapes from his old life and his comically dysfunctional brothers Slurp and Blurp. Now, using a Clubhouse as their hiding place, the gang must keep Sigmund safe from an ambitious sea-monster hunter Captain Barnabas. The show is executive produced by Sid & Marty Krofft (H.R. Pufnstuf, Land of the Lost) with the pilot directed by Jonathan Judge (The Thundermans, School of Rock) and starring David Arquette (Scream, Jake and the Neverland Pirates) as Captain Barnabas. Garrett Frawley and Brian Turner (Santa Baby) wrote the new teleplay based on the classic series. \nExact release dates for both series have not been announced yet. A current Amazon Prime subscription costs $99 per year or $11 per month. Likewise, Prime Video is available as a standalone service for $9 per month.",

That makes each bar of soap just 67¢ shipped right to your door!\nNOTE , if you have 5 or more subscriptions arriving in a month, you’ll save a whopping 15% off this order instead of the regular 5% – which will sweeten this deal! Remember, when you sign up for Subscribe and Save, you are under NO obligation whatsoever and can cancel at anytime. To cancel or modify your Subscribe and Save items, just click on “my account” and then “subscriptions” and then you can cancel and/or modify anything you want.\n(Thanks, Jason!) ",

      "text": "6:48am PT by Lesley Goldberg 'Good Girls Revolt' Canceled at Amazon; Will Be Shopped Elsewhere Courtesy of Richard Foreman Producers Sony Pictures Television has big plans for a sophomore season of the critically praised period drama. \nIn a surprising move, Amazon has opted to cancel one of its best reviewed dramas. \nThe streaming platform and retail outlet has axed Good Girls Revolt after one season, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Sony Pictures Television — whose TriStar Television banner was behind the 10-episode series — are in the process of getting the rights back from Amazon and plan to shop the period drama elsewhere. \nThis marks the latest one-and-done series at Amazon, which earlier this year canceled Shawn Ryan's Mad Dogs — also from Sony TV. (Amazon next has Sony's The Last Tycoon, The Tick and Sneaky Pete alldue in 2017 . ) \nSet in 1969, Good Girls Revolt centers on a group of young female researchers who work at News of the Week, inspired by the landmark sexual discrimination cases chronicled in Lynn Povich's book of the same name. \nThe real people portrayed in the series include Eleanor Holmes Norton (Joy Bryant), Nora Ephron (Grace Gummer) and Wick McFadden (Jim Belushi). Rising star Genevieve Angelsonstarred alongside Anna Camp. Dana Calvo ( Made in Jersey ) created the drama and exec produced alongside Lynda Obst, Darlene Hunt ( The Big C ), Don Kurt ( Justified ) and Jeff Okin ( Dark Skies ). \nThe series debuted Oct. 28 to mostly positive reviews (it has a 65 on Metacritic) and four and a half stars on Amazon. It was part of a freshman class that included previously renewed One Mississippi as well as Goliath, which Amazon boasted ranked as its \"top binged first season of a U.S.-produced Amazon original series ever over its first 10 days.\" The streamer, like Netflix, does not release official ratings data for its streaming originals. \nSources say streaming monitor Symphony Advanced Media metrics had Good Girls Revolt collecting more viewers than many of Amazon's other originals. Sources say Amazon Studios head Roy Price was not a fan of the series and didn't deem it to be an awards season player in opting to pass on ordering a second season after hearing Sony's season two pitch this week. The studio had hoped to file on time for a California tax credit. \nOf Amazon's 2016 freshman launches, Tig Notaro's One Mississippi has already been renewed; Goliath appears poised for a second season pickup; and a decision has yet to be made critical darling Fleabag (an international acquisition) or Woody Allen flop Crisis in Six Scenes. Due in 2017 are Jill Soloway's I Love Dick, Jean-Claude Van Johnson, The Last Tycoon, Sneaky Pete and The Tick.",

      "text": "So this is news. You can now earn 3 Jetblue miles per dollar on ALL Amazon purchases.\n\nAmazon has a lot of rules for their affiliates, and they don’t typically allow incentivizing the use of their shopping link. The affiliate link is meant for publishers referring others to the Amazon site; it’s not meant to pass the cash to the consumer. They do allow some big shopping portals to pass on savings to the consumer on select product categories, often categories like clothing or jewelry, depending on which categories Amazon is trying to promote and incentivize.\nThere was one point when we could earn 5% back on all Amazon purchases by going through the Givingassistant portal due to a special exception they had (I guess it had to do with their charitable affiliations ), but that didn’t last too long.\nNow, it’s possible to earn 3 JetBlue miles per dollar on almost all Amazon purchases!\nWe appreciate when people use our Amazon link, but if you have use for Jetblue points, that’s currently the best deal for you. Make sure to click on your unique Jetblue link before shopping , or even bookmark that link for easy access.\nI wonder if this will open the floodgates for other portals to begin offering points for Amazon purchases. It’s unlikely that cashback portals will be able to offer this, but there’s a chance other mileage portals will cut a deal with Amazon which would really be awesome! I’ll hazard a guess that there’s some sort of reciprocal partnership here between Amazon and Jetblue.\nThe Fine Print \nAllow 60 days after purchase ships for miles to post No TrueBlue points for postage/handling or tax If you are on a Jetblue flight, you can earn the 3x even without clicking on your unique link by Connecting to Amazon through Fly-Fi; when not in-flight you need to click on your unique link The following products do not earn points:\nAny product or service sold on a site linked to from the Amazon Site (e.g., a product or service listed through our “Product Ads” program or sold on a site linked to from a banner ad, sponsored link, or other link displayed on the Amazon Site); Any wireless service plan offered through the Amazon Site and not sold or fulfilled by us; Any product, including games and other applications, sold through the Amazon Appstore for Android; Any product sold on fresh.amazon.com; Restaurant takeout; Any alcoholic beverage product; Any digital Kindle product purchased as a subscription (e.g., Kindle newspaper subscriptions, magazine subscriptions, blog subscriptions, etc.); Any free trial subscription Hat tip to runningwithmiles \nThe post Earn 3 JetBlue Points Per Dollar on All Amazon Purchases! appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "text": "  13:26 PM EST Sector 5 has Success on Amazon with its 65\" 4K Ultra HD DLED TV PRWeb \nSector 5, Inc. (SECT.PK) announces that the Company is having success during this first week of holiday sales. Amazon sales were strong. Smart TVs are confusing because most consumers use them with a cable TV or video streaming box resulting in an overly complicated experience. The \"smart\" software is generally not very good with confusing, baffling interfaces unique to that model. The TV's don't receive software updates often enough as delivery protocols and hardware technology continue to evolve. The ultimate TV entertainment experience is achieved by combining a no fuss TV like Sector 5's 65\" TV with a Chromebox, Apple TV, Roku, XBOX, PlayStation or similar external solution. \nMore importantly, Smart TVs can be a security concern. Hackers can potentially access your TV through a back door allowing them to seeing what you are viewing, photos, USB memory stick content and perhaps even access your smart TV's build-in camera. \nRoger McKeague, Sector 5 CEO, states, \"Smart TV's are Stupid, More Expensive, Hackers New Tool to Watch Viewers at Home and Gain Access to Personal Information. Smart TV's are just a Gimmick like 3D and Curved TV's. \n\"At Sector 5, we feel that Smart TVs are a bad investment. Most people already have access to their desired content because they're watching TV through cable or satellite boxes with the same features. Plus, those Internet features on TVs are among the earliest to go obsolete. Sector 5 is selling its 65\"4k Ultra HD DLED for $689.99.\" \nRoger McKeague, added, \"If it connects to the Internet without the proper firewall, it's vulnerable to attack. Smart TVs are often developed with less scrutiny for security than more IT oriented equipment like Chromebooks and routers. Your TV can represent the most vulnerable piece of electronics in your home, allowing cyber criminals a way to hack into your home to spy by accessing built-in cameras and microphones. People watching TV might never know that their TV is watching them.\" \nSector 5, Inc. ( OTCQB: SECT ), SIC Code 3571 - Electronic Computers, is a Proud American Corporation, that sells, manufactures and develops new innovative consumer electronics under Sector 5(R) and other brands. The Company markets its partnership with Google approved Chromebooks to educational organizations, other B2B and B2C sales channels, with retail sales on Amazon. It is in development of several new products to serve the educational, business and retail markets. \nFollow the company on http://www.twitter.com/sectorfiveinc and http://www.facebook.com/sect5 and find further information at http://www.sector-five.com . \nForward Looking Statement Certain statements made in this release are \"forward-looking statements\" regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations.

      "text": "Share Tweet \nThe Good Girls Revolt has ended at Amazon. According to Deadline , the streaming service canceled their period drama about women fighting for their rights at a fictional news magazine in the late ’60s. Now, the show is apparently trying to find a home on another platform. The drama from Dana Calvo was based on real events that happened at Newsweek , and starred Erin Maya Darke and Genevieve Angelson as researchers who set out to sue their company for discrimination. When the first season dropped in October, it received mixed reviews from critics. Still, Deadline reports that it was something of a hit for Amazon, especially with a female audience. \nSo why not invest in a second season? Well, Deadline speculates it may have something to do with all the money Amazon is throwing at flashy projects from David O. Russell and Matt Weiner. Because if you have the actual creator of Mad Men , why keep your Mad Men wannabe around? \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

      "text": "print BII \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon is opening up its machine-learning capabilities to third-party developers with its new AI platform, according to TechCrunch. \nThe service, which was introduced at Amazon's re:Invent developer conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday , boasts three new tools that span the whole gamut of machine learning — image recognition, text-to-speech, and a platform that lets developers build conversational applications: Rekognition is an image-recognition service similar to Google's, Microsoft's, and Facebook's image-recognition offerings. Image recognition is an increasingly important tool as smartphone cameras become more prevalent in search and communications. Polly is Amazon’s text-to-speech service that uses machine learning and natural-language understanding (NLU) to produce more natural, life-like speech. It can distinguish between words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently, such as in “I live in Seattle” and “Live from New York,” Amazon explains. This is an important feature for developers looking to build apps with voice assistants. Lex is arguably the most important of the three announcements. Effectively, this is the technology that powers Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant featured in the Echo. Lex will enable developers to build all kinds of conversation applications, including chatbots and mobile and web applications. The apps can be launched on platforms like Facebook Messenger and eventually Slack, as well as existing communications platforms such as Twilio, Salesforce, and Zendesk, VentureBeat reports . \nAmazon’s announcement strengthens its position in the burgeoning chatbot and machine-learning industry. It also puts it in the company of other tech giants like Microsoft and Facebook, which are looking to leverage their in-house expertise in the growing AI field. The sheer size of Amazon and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — the largest cloud company globally — means that a larger audience of developers and businesses will have access to build, deploy, and run conversational applications. \nThis will help encourage greater awareness of the technology, and likely indicates that intelligent, conversational software is another step closer to mass adoption and use. \nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, coupled with the proliferation of messaging apps, are fueling the development of chatbots — software programs that use messaging as the interface through which to carry out any number of tasks, from scheduling a meeting, to reporting weather, to helping users buy a pair of shoes. \nForeseeing immense potential, businesses are starting to invest heavily in the burgeoning bot economy. A number of brands and publishers have already deployed bots on messaging and collaboration channels, including HP, 1-800-Flowers, and CNN. While the bot revolution is still in the early phase, many believe 2016 will be the year these conversational interactions take off. \nLaurie Beaver, research associate for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on chatbots that explores the growing and disruptive bot landscape by investigating what bots are, how businesses are leveraging them, and where they will have the biggest impact. \nThe report outlines the burgeoning bot ecosystem by segment, looks at companies that offer bot-enabling technology, distribution channels, and some of the key third-party bots already on offer. The report also forecasts the potential annual savings that businesses could realize if chatbots replace some of their customer service and sales reps. Finally, it compares the potential of chatbot monetization on a platform like Facebook Messenger against the iOS App Store and Google Play store. \nHere are some of the key takeaways: AI has reached a stage in which chatbots can have increasingly engaging and human conversations, allowing businesses to leverage the inexpensive and wide-reaching technology to engage with more consumers. Chatbots are particularly well suited for mobile — perhaps more so than apps. Messaging is at the heart of the mobile experience, as the rapid adoption of chat apps demonstrates. The chatbot ecosystem is already robust, encompassing many different third-party chat bots, native bots, distribution channels, and enabling technology companies. Chatbots could be lucrative for messaging apps and the developers who build bots for these platforms, similar to how app stores have developed into moneymaking ecosystems. \nIn full, the report: Breaks down the pros and cons of chatbots. Explains the different ways businesses can access, utilize, and distribute content via chatbots. Forecasts the potential impact chatbots could have for businesses. Looks at the potential barriers that could limit the growth, adoption, and use of chatbots. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "Amazon won’t resume work with one of its airlines until it’s sure the pilots won’t strike again The downside of leasing planes but not flying them yourself. share Stephen Brashear / Getty A week after unhappy pilots who fly cargo planes for Amazon were forced by a judge to end their strike , the online retailer has still not resumed shipping packages with the cargo airliner, one of the pilots told Recode . And it sounds like Amazon won’t do so until it is confident the pilots won’t strike again. “We rebalanced capacity across our carrier partners and we are leaving the adjustments in place until we are certain there will be no further disruptions,” an Amazon spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday evening. The cargo airline in question, ABX Air, is one of several Amazon has contracted in the last year to operate a total of 40 planes on Amazon’s behalf . The goal, Amazon has said, is to make sure it has enough shipping capacity to handle the annual increases in demand it is seeing, especially during the fourth-quarter holiday season. Amazon is also starting to build out its own transportation network because it believes it will lead to shipping savings over time. \nRecode's \"future of commerce\" conference is in SF on Dec. 6 \nLast chance to hear from Jack Dorsey, Kate Hudson, Apple and Wish Register Now But taking more control over the movement of packages after they leave an Amazon warehouse obviously comes with downsides, especially in a case like this where Amazon is leasing the planes but not hiring its own pilots to fly them. Amazon has said the current disruption has not affected customers, but one could imagine it increasing costs for the quarter because of the last-minute nature of the change of plans. About 250 ABX pilots, who belong to a local Teamsters union in Ohio, first went on strike before Thanksgiving because of what they say is an understaffing crisis resulting in 8,000 emergency flights for customers like Amazon and DHL this year that upended some of their lives. (Amazon, for its part, is notoriously anti-union .) The steady flow of emergency flights, “exacerbated” by bringing Amazon on as a client, made it difficult for pilots to use the comp days they receive in exchange for working an emergency flight on a day off, according to ABX Air pilot and union rep Tim Jewell. The Amazon work has also led to pilots being forced to change between day and night shifts more often than is allowed under their contract, Jewell said. On Nov. 23, a judge issued a two-week, temporary restraining order that forced the pilots back to work and to negotiate with the airline while working. The two sides have not yet come to a resolution, and it’s unclear if the pilots will attempt to strike again at the end of the restraining order window. “We hope very much to resolve it and not have to go down that road,” Jewell told Recode . “We hope that this period here woke up the company enough that they’re willing to work with us to mutually come to an agreement to move forward.” A spokesman for ABX Air’s parent company says they expect “these minor disputes to be resolved without further work stoppages.” recode_divider",

      "title": "Should Amazon be your AI and machine learning platform?",
      "text": "  Amazon   AI and machine learning are two of the hottest topics in the enterprise, and Amazon has a reputation as a leader. We break down the pros and cons of choosing Amazon Machine Learning as your platform.   ZDNet \nDoes your business want to become successful at facial recognition? Image tagging? Translation? As the rise of cloud computing has enabled faster and cheaper data processing, businesses are racing to harness the power of artificial intelligence -- via machine learning -- to understand data. But with Amazon, Google, Microsoft , IBM, and others offering similarly-priced  s for the enterprise, it's often difficult to know where to begin. \nHere's a comprehensive look at Amazon's platform as one option for your company.   \nAmazon Machine Learning (AML) offers companies an easy, highly-scalable on-ramp for interpreting data. Under the umbrella of Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched in 2006, AML offers visual aids and easy-to-access analytics to make machine learning accessible to developers without a data science background, using the same technology fueling Amazon's internal algorithms. It requires little in terms of hardware or software investment, and has a pay-as-you-go model. The aim is to help businesses build machine learning models without having to create the code themselves. \nOnce the models are in place, you can use AML to \"obtain predictions for your application using simple APIs, without having to implement custom prediction generation code, or manage any infrastructure,\" according to Amazon. The platform can \"generate billions of predictions daily and serve those predictions in real-time and at high throughput,\" the company said. \nOn Wednesday, AWS made some big announcements regarding its cloud offerings , at its annual conference, re:Invent. It is offering three new AI services: Amazon Rekognition , which can perform image recognition, categorization, and facial analysis; Amazon Polly , a deep-learning-driven text-to-speech (TTS) service; and Amazon Lex , a natural language and speech recognition program. \nSwaminathan Sivasubramanian, general manager for AWS, said he wants \"developers to build a new class of applications\" that can see, hear, and help them build. \"My goal is to bring machine learning to every AWS developer,\" he said. \nAnother part of Amazon's mission, said Sivasubramanian, is to \"help customers put intelligence at the heart of every application and business.\" \nThe philosophy for Amazon AI is \"high quality, best-in-class deep learning systems with deep functionality,\" Sivasubramanian added; he also noted the importance of Amazon's AI platform and services integrating well with other AWS products. \nSundown AI , a tech company that helps businesses offer customer service via an AI platform called Chloe, uses AML for business operations. Sundown AI works with businesses in 20 countries, mostly in e-commerce. The setup, said CEO Fabio Cardenas, was relatively easy: \"We chose Amazon because we already had features deployed in AWS, and thus interoperability was easier to achieve.\" And, although it's not open source, Cardenas pointed out that \"some services provide free tiers that could be used for testing or to create basic scenarios.\" \nCardenas noted that AWS was behind other competitors at one point, but said \"it's Amazon, and we knew they would catch up.\" He sees the competition as positive, in terms of increasing the quality of the offerings and keeping prices low. AML's price structure, he said, is \"based on computing power per hour used, and depending on the service other fees might apply. Data transfer in or out of the cloud is also a factor for calculating costs.\" Enterprises 'wake up' to machine learning \n  vice president at Gartner focusing on data science and machine learning, offered some insight into assessing available  s. Everybody this year is \"waking up,\" he said, and saying, \"Oh, we're becoming a machine learning company!\" \nThe good thing, said Linden, is that today, \"you can trial those systems for almost nothing. I think 1,000 image extractions or classifications cost you something like 10 cents, which is, of course, absolute peanuts.\" Instead of purchasing something like an image recognition application, which could cost up to a quarter of a million dollars, you can \"just fork over the data to Google or Amazon and get it sourced there,\" he said. \nIn terms of broad aims for these tech giants, when it comes to their machine learning offerings, Linden said they \"definitely\" have different goals: Microsoft has a significantly broader offering than Amazon or Google, he said, while Amazon primarily targets software developers -- not the corporate data scientists. \"I don't see Amazon playing a role in a banking context, insurance context, retail context, or government context,\" Linden added. \nLinden pointed out some considerations to keep in mind when evaluating Amazon's  . First, there's a difference between Amazon's platform and the \"pre-baked, ready-made, machine learning API,\" he said. Although it's difficult to stack the companies against each other, Linden's opinion is that \"Amazon is not fully up to speed against Google. I would think Google or Microsoft are probably the cutting-edge folks -- then Amazon would be third, and IBM.\" \nOn the other hand, he said, enterprises must sometimes create their own machine learning models, using internal data. \"If you think about failure prediction, if you think about customer, database marketing,\" said Linden, \"that's a complete different area. There, Amazon is a distant fourth. It's often not on the client's agenda.\" \nStill, if your business has been using Amazon for a while, and would like to get things done quickly, \"Amazon is fine,\" he said. \"It's definitely good enough to solve many different problems. But if you really want to be cutting edge, then I have never seen anybody actually doing machine learning just with Amazon's technology.\" \nAmazon's current offerings are relatively \"rudimentary,\" Linden said. \"It works, and it's good enough for many cases, but it pales in comparison to what Microsoft with its Azure machine learning does.\" To be fair, he added, Google's product is also \"still rudimentary,\" and he would \"put them almost in the same ballpark when it comes to making your own machine learning solutions.\" However, \"when it comes to utilizing existing machine learning solutions that Google has created, currently, Google has a clear edge over Amazon,\" said Linden. \nStill, Amazon's   should be taken seriously. \"AWS has far better traction in all kinds of other cloud services, which will likely outweigh its deficiencies in the machine learning space,\" said Linden. \n\"And it's still early in machine learning and AI race,\" he added. \"Let's not forget that.\" \nAlso see",

      "text": "December 02, 2016 -- Laurent Bride Yesterday at Amazon re: Invent, Werner Vogels, Amazon’s Chief Technology Officer outlined a vision for a modern data architecture that spans data ingestion, lifecycle management, data governance, orchestration and job scheduling. This vision included the announcement of Amazon Glue. Glue is really two things – a Data Catalog that provides metadata information about data stored in Amazon or elsewhere and an ETL service, which is largely a successor to Amazon Data Pipeline that first launched in 2012. Anyone familiar with Talend knows that we’ve been executing toward a similar vision for some time with our platform and solutions such as Talend Big Data Integration and recent innovations in Talend Data Preparation . One of the key differences with our vision is that whereas Amazon is looking to meet the needs of their platform users, Talend is addressing user requirements across a number of platforms, including multiple clouds, Hadoop, SaaS applications and traditional data warehouses. While we share a similar vision, Talend and Amazon are addressing different needs within the data management market. Amazon is approaching the problem from the perspective of a platform provider working to simplify the development of custom applications on their platform. The easier it is for developers to build applications on AWS, the more value customers will get and the more they will use the AWS platform. Our focus is on the data integration developer that is solving more complex data integration problems. These challenges typically span many data sources within and outside of Amazon and require deep, rich transformation, cleansing and governance capabilities. Amazon Glue is focused on Python developers hand coding applications on top of Amazon. It provides useful tools aimed at streamlining data movement on top of the Amazon platform. Its catalog tool gives developers visibility into where data lives and its ETL service allows developers to generate some starter Python code that they can then edit in their favorite IDE such as PyCharm. While Amazon Glue should be a good productivity boost for developers building analytic applications on top of EMR or Redshift, it is not intended to address the deeper data integration needs of a dedicated data integration developer. Our view is that over the next decade, enterprises will need to solve data challenges in a deeply hybrid world, where different workloads will run on a given platform based on the services provided. It’s also clear that many enterprises will hedge their bets on being too dependent on any single platform and use a mix of platforms such as AWS, IBM Watson, GE Predix, Salesforce, SAP, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Talend users are typically knowledgeable in Java, not Python, and they have a far deeper set of integration needs. Our users will typically need to connect to tens or hundreds of data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud. For example, Lenovo is using Talend to connect to 60 different data sources, including web logs , e-commerce, customer service and social media data. Once these developers have access to this data, they typically need to do far richer data transformation. For example, with EMR (Hadoop), Amazon would expect developers to program their data quality rules by hand in Python. With Talend, we provide them with pre-built data quality components that run natively inside EMR or any other instance of Hadoop. In the long run, we expect that Amazon will continue to expand its services, but with a focus on the analytic application developer, while Talend will continue to specialize in the deeper integration challenges. Solving these deeper problems will require strong multi-cloud and on-premises capabilities, continued innovation around data quality, including business-friendly user interfaces for data preparation and rich data governance and lineage capabilities. These are the requirements we are hearing from our customers and where we plan to focus our product development efforts. Amazon is a key partner for Talend. In fact, earlier this year we announced that Talend is “All-in” on Amazon . There are several opportunities for Talend and Amazon to work together to improve how these two types of developers collaborate. Our first opportunity is likely to be integrating Talend’s data management tools on top of Amazon’s data catalog, and there may well be more mutually beneficial opportunities in the future. Share",

The freshman drama had just recently debuted, with its 10-episode first season releasing in late October. Reviews were generally positive, and word is the show was one of the streaming service's bigger draws among female viewers. \nIt is unclear why Amazon has declined to continue with further seasons of Good Girls Revolt , but word is that Sony Pictures Television, which produces the series, will be shopping it around in hopes of finding it a new home elsewhere. \nSet during the cultural revolution that occurred in the 1960s, Good Girls Revolt follows group of young female researchers at a news magazine whose request to be treated fairly sparks the start of changes that upend lives, careers, and friendships.",

      "text": "For More Growth Than Amazon, Check Out These Cyber Monday Winners With brick-and-mortar retailers ramping up their ecommerce game, investors have more choices in the sector. Shubhankar Adhikari Dec2,201611:38AMEST \nThe past week saw record-breaking online sales as the U.S. and much of the rest of the Western world gobbled up Thanksgiving weekend sales. \nBut though an incredible amount of money was spent from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, the results were a mixed bag for ecommerce superstar Amazon ( AMZN ) . \nMany observers say that though Amazon no longer depends on Thanksgiving, Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales as it once did , Chairman, Chief Executive and Founder Jeff Bezos must seriously consider a few challenges to the company's business. \nSales of devices at Amazon over the weekend rose more than 100% from a year earlier. But digging deeper paints a less-than-rosy picture . \nThis year, Amazon sold two times more Kindle tablets than last year, but on Cyber Monday 2015, the company sold three times more tablets than it had the year before. \nSimilarly, sales of the Amazon Fire TV streaming-media player also decelerated, up 2.5 times from a year earlier. But Cyber Monday Fire TV sales in 2015 grew more than six times year over year. \nAmazon has boasted that it sold millions of its all-new Echo Dot over the holiday weekend. \nThis lowest-cost version of its Alexa voice-activated personal assistant has made headlines, but the device was marked down to just $40 from nearly $50 in September . It is doubtful whether this momentum can continue at the regular price. \nBut while Amazon's sales growth is cooling, it is heating up for some of the company's competitors. \nFor instance, Walmart has redoubled its ecommerce efforts over the past year in an effort to catch up with Amazon, especially when it comes to mobile purchasing. And those initiatives are starting to pay off. \nThe retail giant reported that its holiday weekend application orders with in-store pickup jumped 150% .

      "title": "FANG Stocks To Keep Going Strong In 2017: Analyst",
      "text": "Flip \nInvestors who hold the FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google/ Alphabet) may want to consider recalibrating their holdings… perhaps into GFAN, GNFA or ANFG, according to one analyst. However, it looks like nothing will stop the FANG stocks as the sky’s the limit for all four of them. The only one of the four in question lately has been Netflix, even it remains a darling among Wall Street analysts, despite the questions about content spend and subscriber numbers. FANG stocks take a bite out of BAGEL \nAround this time last year, some analysts were thinking that BAGEL (Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Expedia, LinkedIn) would replace FANG in 2016, but that didn’t happen. A lot has changed since December 2015. LinkedIn is out of the picture, as it’s in the process of being acquired by Microsoft. Alibaba is rising in popularity still but facing questions about its accounting procedures, and Expedia has failed to turn into the hot stock some thought it would, although it has managed to climb back to around the level it was trading at a year ago. \nCanaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham noted in his Nov. 30 update on the FANG stocks have outperformed the broader market “by a wide margin” over the last two years, although they had a rather mixed third quarter. He explained that each member of the group had a difference performance around its earnings report. \nThen after Donald Trump surprised everyone by winning the presidency, there was a broad sell-off of all the FANG stocks and the tech sector as a whole, although that was short-lived. Cantor Fitzgerald recently did a study of how Trump’s presidency might affect the constituents of FANG, and one of the key risks he found for all of them was an overhaul to net neutrality rules. He named Trump’s protectionist views as a far smaller risk for the FANG names than for other tech plays such as Apple, which relies heavily on China. \nGraham still expects the group to perform well throughout 2017, although he suggests fine-tuning exposure to the individual stocks based on time horizons. FANG stocks to benefit from strong tech sector \nGraham’s colleague Tony Dwyer expects the tech sector to do well in the coming year based on the current macro backdrop, which is strong and features a steeping yield curve, low P/Es and buyback support. President-elect Trump is widely expected to instigate corporate tax reform, with one likely outcome being incentives for companies to repatriate cash. If this happens, companies could have some fresh cash to buy back shares with. \nGraham also believes that the four main drivers of the FANG stocks – digital advertising, digital video viewing, e-commerce and cloud services – are still intact, with the tech sector being “mid-stride” in all of them. One headwind for the group, however, is the ongoing shift from non-GAAP to GAAP metrics. Graham said Netflix isn’t affected at all by the shift but that Facebook is the most affected of all the FANG stocks. Timing impacts positioning in FANG stocks \nThe analyst also suggests that investors examine and readjust their positioning based on “time horizons.” For example, for the first quarter, they suggest GFAN rather than FANG, with investors buying more of the first stock in the list, Google. \nThe reason is because he expects Google parent Alphabet to “power through Q4 with valuation support” and because the company doesn’t issue guidance. He believes the lack of guidance will help keep the momentum in the company’s stock going through March, adding that Facebook has the same features except it lacks the valuation. He expects Netflix to have a strong fourth quarter but possibly give a cautious guide for first quarter subscriber numbers. \nFor all of 2017, Graham suggests GNFA. He sees Google and Facebook as having “achievable mandates,” although Facebook could be hurt by the shift toward GAAP metrics. Meanwhile he expects Netflix to deliver on subscriber numbers in the second half of the year but spend more on content, while first-half estimates for Amazon may fall as a result of price cuts. Adjusting price targets for FANG stocks \nBecause of the change to GAAP metrics, Graham also adjusted his price targets for the FANG stocks. He cut his Facebook stock target by $10 to $150 per share based on GAAP numbers, although increased estimates slightly offset that shift. He slashed his target for Amazon stock from $900 to $875 due to the shift to GAAP and lower expectations for Amazon Web Services. \nHis price target for Google stock moves to $925 from $950 per share due to the shift to GAAP numbers , although higher estimates offset the drag from that shift. His target for Netflix stock remains at $140.",

      "title": "Top Tips for Selling Your Used Stuff Online in eBay, Amazon, Craigslist",
      "text": "Comment Is it really worth all the hassle to sell this old console online? Androidb. \nWith the barrier to entry really low, finding success in selling used stuff online can be very challenging and not as straightforward as it seems. Even if the product is really good, when the timing is bad and the seller is hitting on the wrong audience, the product can never get on the right hands. \nSecond-hand goods do have a big market. On one survey conducted by Global Market Insite Inc. (GMI), 35% of women and 25% of men buy more used products than brand new ones. It also appears that at least seven in 10 shoppers have purchased second-hand goods online. Most popular buys include books, DVDs and CDs. \nRalph Risk, GMI European Marketing Director, says there will always be a market for second-hand goods as people are always looking for ways on how they can \"maximize their return on income.\" He adds that sites like eBay and Amazon will keep on growing because of this demand. \nWith the competition really high, how can one achieve success in selling second-hand goods online? Here are a few tips to get anyone started: \n1. Focus on just one platform \nWhen starting, it is important to focus on just one site for selling. One does not have to create duplicates of similar listings on eBay, Amazon and Craigslist straightaway. Focusing on one portal makes it easier to get to know the audience and the site's features really well. This way, a seller gets to make the most of the site's features. \n2. Build a good online presence before selling \nMost online buyers are savvy internet users, and it is not far off for them to check on a seller's reputation before choosing to buy from a particular shop. Buyers may search for the seller's name online, so it is important for a seller to maintain a good online footprint. Building a blog, or registering with a professional site like LinkedIn may help with a seller's online presence. \n3. Use the right keywords for listings \nSome words captivate the audience more than others. For example, it is said that perfumes with the word 'authentic' tend to sell more compared to those labeled as 'genuine'. Shoes branded as 'sneakers' also sell more compared to 'trainers'. Buyers also put a great deal on grammar, with listings with incorrect spellings or grammar seen as less valuable. Sellers should make sure to double check on the coherence of listings, and shouldn't be afraid to have a professional copy write the listing if assistance is needed. \nOnline selling is putting oneself out there as an entrepreneur. Sellers should always act with professionalism, the right etiquette, and an excellent customer orientation.",

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday Now AWS wants to be your cloud APM provider, too Amazon X-Ray and Pinpoint allow end-to-end instrumentation of apps, but existing APM vendors can stand their ground by offering robust reporting tools InfoWorld | Dec 2, 2016 Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock Why you need to start using Polymer for your Web development \nAt its re:Invent conference this year, Amazon made a pair of announcements that should alarm cloud APM (application performance management) providers. \nTwo of Amazon's new AWS offerings, AWS X-Ray and Amazon Pinpoint, provide insights into distributed and mobile applications running on Amazon. With them, Amazon may not have put a stake through the heart of third-party APM offerings, but it might well mean limbs lopped off a la Monty Python's Black Knight. [ Download the public cloud megaguide PDF: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Joyent compared . | Stay up on the cloud with InfoWorld's Cloud Computing Report newsletter . ] Lifting the lid \nX-Ray is arguably the bigger of the two, since it allows requests to be traced for applications as they run across various parts of AWS's infrastructure, such as Elastic Beanstalk or Amazon API Gateway. \nDevelopers insert into the app a snippet of code that provides the needed request-tracing functionality. Data collected from the request tracer is forwarded to a daemon that aggregates the trace data and uploads it in batches to X-Ray. \nRight now, X-Ray only supports applications written in Node.js, Java, C#, or composed with AWS Lambda functions (in any language supported by Lambda), but plans are on the table to add many other common languages like Python and Ruby. The other limitation -- that it requires adding instrumentation code -- isn't out of gamut for other products in this space. \nAmazon's big advantage with X-Ray is that it's a one-stop shop. It allows performance telemetry to be fed back to the developer from across most every part of Amazon where an app runs, without having to create custom instrumentation for each segment. Full disclosure \nAnother new service, Amazon Pinpoint , focuses on a narrower incarnation of the same basic idea -- tracking user engagement with mobile apps by way of push notification campaigns. Apps often use push notifications to stimulate interest in the app -- e.g., an online shopping app will alert users of upcoming sales. \nPinpoint targets and tracks user behavior in much the same way campaign management systems for mailing lists do. It's not as monumental a concept as X-Ray, but it fits in with Amazon's overall ambition to allow most every aspect of an Amazon-backed app to be instrumented natively. \nWho's likely to feel the pressure from services like this? One easy answer is New Relic, the firm that's made a name for itself for providing \"full-stack visibility\" into apps. Amazon is fast building its own version of that, and on a stack that's popular and commands great loyalty . \nWhere New Relic (and other competitors) can continue to keep its edge is with its portfolio of powerful reporting and visual exploration tools . Instrumenting apps and gathering the data is only half the story; being able to make sense of that data conveniently is the other half. Amazon has some work in this vein -- Quicksight comes to mind -- but New Relic has already established deep presence for its front end, and with that ought to have plenty of ground to stand on for now.

      "text": "Amazon Effectively Eliminates Competition In Another Market Dec. 2.16 Send Message Summary \nAmazon has always been aggressive outside its home base in the US and now it is looking to build on the momentum to take the leadership position in major markets. \nAfter showing a dismal performance in China, the company went all-in in India with indicated investments of over $5 billion. \nThis has had a deleterious effect on local players like Flipkart, which has seen its valuation lowered by investor Morgan Stanley from $15.5 billion to $5.54 billion in 18 months. \nAmazon is going for the kill in this market where substantial changes in pecking order are possible in the next two quarters. \nThis market can boost Amazon’s international revenue considerably and would provide a stepping stone for expansion in other markets in the region. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) is not leaving any stone unturned for achieving the leadership position in its next major growth market after the US. Amazon's aggressive moves in India have had a negative impact on local competition. Former market leader, Flipkart (Private: FPKT ), has seen its valuation estimate lowered by investor Morgan Stanley by another 41% to $5.54 billion according to its latest regulatory filings . This effectively chokes its ability to raise future funds which puts Amazon in a strong position to grab higher e-commerce market share in this region. Jeff Bezos has already announced investments of over $5 billion in building logistics, operations and marketing in the Indian market. The company has added 120,000 sellers in this market and has built over 2.5 million sq ft of warehouse space. Although the numbers are smaller than its domestic market in the US, it has reached the current level within three years of starting operations in this market. As a comparison, its biggest competitor Flipkart has only 90,000 sellers. Effect on local competition The entry of Amazon in 2013 changed the e-commerce landscape within India. With abundant resources, Amazon has been able to challenge local competitors on almost every corner. Flipkart was the main player before the arrival of Amazon and was able to raise a good amount of cash in a series of funding rounds . However, this all changed in 2015 when Amazon started ramping up its operations in India and both companies entered into a ferocious battle for market share. Being a private company, Flipkart had a limited amount to expand logistics and provide discounts. Still its burn rate was quite heavy during 2015. The high burn rate, non-existent profits and future competition from Amazon led to lowering of valuation estimates in 2016 by several investors. In February 2016, Morgan Stanley marked down the value of its stake by 27% giving Flipkart a valuation of $11.2 billion. Recent valuation updates have led to further erosion in estimated value. It is now valued at $5.54 billion, down from $15.5 billion in May 2015. This 63% erosion in value shows the impact Amazon has had on its competitors. Click to enlarge Fig: Changing fortunes of former market leader Flipkart. Rapid fall of valuation in the last 18 months signals the increasing market share of Amazon. In order to sustain its exponential growth, Flipkart required regular cash infusion which it used for giving discounts and marketing. However, as the valuation shrinks, it will not be able to get the requisite funds. The last funding round made by the company was in July 2015 at the peak of its valuation. At that time, it was stated that this cash would be sufficient to sustain operations for 18 months. We are nearing that stretch and the only reason why it has not announced another round of funding is because of lower valuation. With some belt-tightening, Flipkart might be able to extend this cash by another 6 months but then it would require either a buyout option or an outside investor like Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) or Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) with whom it was in talks . Future prospects Of Amazon In The Indian market Within three years of operations, Amazon has been able to topple market leader Flipkart in terms of sales, sellers and logistics. It has launched Prime membership in the last quarter and is planning to start video and music services also. As other competitors figure out their next move, Amazon is ideally placed to grab a good percent of market share from them. The next two quarters can also give Amazon a decisive lead which would be difficult to overcome for future e-commerce players. The company is currently seeing over 100% growth in the market and expects to reach $10 billion in GMV (Gross merchandise value) soon. Senior management has also said that they expect this market to outpace operations in other international markets like UK, Germany and Japan. Currently, there is demonetization going on in India where the government is replacing higher currency bills. The government hopes there will be a move to greater digital payments which will help in increasing transparency in transactions. Although a short-term obstacle, it can create additional opportunities for Amazon to reach a wider customer base. There is also rapid growth of internet usage fuelled by the entry of another telecom provider, Reliance Jio. Jio has added 52 million customers to its 4G network in less than 3 months. It has had a free welcome offer where customers could use the services without any fees. Initially slated to run from September to December 2016, it has been extended till 31st March 2017, by which time it hopes to have a customer base of over 100 million. This free offer has led other competitors like Vodafone (NASDAQ: VOD ) to reduce their rates, fuelling growth of smartphone purchase and internet usage. According to Ericsson Mobility Report, the smartphone user base will touch 810 million by 2021, a big increase from close to 260 million base currently. As a wider customer base gets smartphone and higher internet speeds, e-commerce players like Amazon will be able to reach a greater number of customers. Contribution to Amazon's revenue A recent Deloitte report forecasted the growth of online shoppers in India from a mere 39 million in 2015 to 220 million by 2020. Along with this, the average spend will also increase from $247 to $464 during this time. This will increase the e-commerce market size to $101 billion. Amazon will be able to carve a big portion of this market. As this market adds tens of billions of dollars in sales in the next few years, Amazon should find it easy to hit a growth rate of over 25%. This should certainly boost its stock price, eliminating any fears of slowdown in growth due to a higher base effect. Investor Takeaway Amazon has taken the market leader position in India. Tough competition given by the company led to the fall in valuation of former leader, Flipkart, by 63% in less than 18 months. Flipkart is valued at $5.54 billion compared to $15.5 billion last May. This will make it even harder to raise fresh funds forcing the company to reduce discounts and giving away more market share to Amazon. The Indian economy is growing at over 7% and this market is seeing a rapid increase in smartphone and internet usage. With a forecasted addressable market size of $101 billion by 2020, this region will be one of the fastest growth markets for Amazon, providing additional sales of tens of billions of dollars in the next few years. A solid base in this region will also help the company expand to Southeast Asia. Amazon is a long-term growth story and its ability to achieve market leader position within three years of entry in the Indian market is testimony to its operational excellence and future ambition. The company should continue to deliver top line growth of over 25% for the next few years as it expands in international locations boosting its stock and giving good returns to long-term investors.

      "text": "The past week saw record-breaking online sales as the U.S. and much of the rest of the Western world gobbled up Thanksgiving weekend sales.\nBut though an incredible amount of money was spent from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, the results were a  mixed bag for ecommerce superstar  Amazon ( AMZN ) .\nMany observers say that though Amazon no longer depends on Thanksgiving, Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales as it  once did , Chairman, Chief Executive and Founder Jeff Bezos must seriously consider a  few challenges to the company's business.\n\nSales of devices at Amazon over the weekend rose more than 100% from a year earlier. But digging deeper paints a less-than-rosy picture .\nThis year, Amazon sold two times more Kindle tablets than last year, but on Cyber Monday 2015, the company sold three times more tablets than it had the year before.\nSimilarly, sales of the Amazon Fire TV streaming-media player also decelerated, up 2.5 times from a year earlier. But Cyber Monday Fire TV sales in 2015 grew more than six times year over year.\nAmazon has boasted that it sold millions of its all-new Echo Dot over the holiday weekend.\nThis lowest-cost version of its Alexa voice-activated personal assistant has made headlines, but the device was marked down to  just $40  from nearly $50 in September . It is doubtful whether this momentum can continue at the regular price.\nBut while Amazon's sales growth is cooling, it is  heating up  for some of the company's competitors.\nFor instance,  Walmart has redoubled its ecommerce efforts over the past year in an effort to catch up with Amazon, especially when it comes to mobile purchasing. And those initiatives are starting to pay off.\nThe retail giant reported that its holiday weekend application orders with in-store pickup jumped 150% .\nPrev 0 of 2 Next",

      "title": "Amazon’s Header Tag Goes Server-Side And Brings In Outside Demand",
      "text": "Share: Amazon’s four-year-old header tag is going server-side, making it among the first header tag solutions to move to the faster, more sustainable setup.\nSources briefed on the change described the details of this change to AdExchanger, which Ad Age first reported Thursday. \nAs header bidding has taken off with publishers and more ad tech companies advance their own solutions, the industry is seeking ways to reduce the latency that has become a necessary byproduct of the practice. By moving all the ad decisioning from a user’s browser to Amazon’s server, publishers should see faster load times. \nAmazon won’t just offer its own demand. Publishers can now use the tool to move all their header partners server-side, housed inside Amazon’s solution. Call it a server-side wrapper – or a meta ad server. \nAd tech partners can get touchy about being in someone else’s header-bidding solution. And ironically, considering the new product, no one has been more resistant than Amazon. The company refuses to be in any ad tech partner’s header-bidding wrapper , which industry sources usually attribute to concerns that being wrapped could leak its audience and bidding data. \nTo entice ad tech partners to play nice with its server-side wrapper, and to get publishers to sign on, Amazon is offering data and fee transparency. \nThe data transparency would mean that a publisher’s header-demand partners (a group that might include AppNexus, Criteo, Index Exchange, OpenX, Rubicon Project or Sonobi) would be able to see all bid details, and so would the publisher. Additionally, those partners will be allowed to pay the publisher directly rather than process payments through Amazon. \nIn comparison, publishers and ad tech companies testing Google’s server-side exchange bidding solution won’t be able to work with each other directly. They also have unanswered questions about exchange bidding’s fee structure and how it decisions, sources noted. \n“Philosophically and from a business perspective, we are aligned with what Amazon wants to do,” said an ad tech executive briefed this week on Amazon’s offering. “They are offering data and marketplace transparency. We pay the publisher directly. Those things are critical.\" \nBut, the executive added, \"Our concern is if they will be able to support our technical requirements within the server-to-server environment to fully support our customers.” \nFor publishers, data and fee transparency is a notable enticement. Header bidding improved their visibility beyond what they could see with a typical Google DFP ad server, and they’d like that visibility to stay. \nPublishers also don’t want to get bogged down with fees. One source who viewed the contract said the server-side tool will charge about a penny or half-penny CPM, less than many publishers' ad-serving fees. \nThat said, some publishers were skeptical of Amazon’s offering or said it wasn’t right for them. \n“This is smart for Amazon, not so much for publishers,” said Purch CTO John Potter. “Amazon gets to make the last call on whether they want the inventory at the bidded price, and they get all the bidding info, so they can adjust their bids every else.” \nWill Amazon succeed? The company brings with a huge amount of demand – both its own and that of its advertisers – to entice publishers. Katsur compared the initiative to Procter & Gamble’s Hawkeye project from a few years ago, in which P&G pursued header integrations with publishers to gain visibility into online audiences and to inform its bids. \nAmazon’s server-side solution will put it in competition with players like Google, but also Criteo, another longstanding header-bidding player. \n“[Amazon’s solution] is competitive to what Criteo just announced , and publishers will have to choose,” Potter said. “It offers a lot more than Criteo. The question is, how nervous will publishers be about giving Amazon that data and control?” \nWhile many ad tech partners view Google as a competitive threat, Amazon’s ecommerce focus and outsider status in the ad tech world may speed adoption of its tool. \n“Amazon not being part of the oft-spoken-about duopoly is good for the industry. Distributed power is typically better,” noted Jay Friedman, COO of the Goodway Group. \nThat said, Amazon’s newbie status as an ad tech player will test its ability to service the publishers who onboard its tech. It will have to invest in account management, publisher tech support and client services to support those publisher relationships. \nAfter all, if a header is down, publishers don’t make money.",

      "text": "Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  14AM PT \nA collection of industry executives, producers, and directors were honored by the Caucus for Producers, Writers & Directors at its 34th annual awards dinner on Thursday night at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. \nThe event celebrated the contributions of veteran producers and executives, as well as several young filmmakers who are just trying to break in. \nTanya Hart , the co-chair of the org, echoed the event’s focus on looking to the future of the industry. “We are very aware of what happens in our industry,” Hart said. “It evolves, and we, the caucus, have always been leading the evolution and we continue to do that with a verve that most membership organizations have not been able to do. Our student films, which are really what is the essence of this particular event, are phenomenal.” Related ‘Good Wife’ Producers and ‘Game of Thrones’ Director Win Caucus Honors \nThe event, hosted by “Grey’s Anatomy” star James Pickens Jr. and Fox Sports 1’s Charissa Thompson , began with the awarding of grants to six young filmmakers for their respective projects. Honorees during the evening included Liberty Global CEO Michael Fries and Amazon Studios head Roy Price . \nExecutive of the year honoree Fries credited his father, Chuck, for his many years of service to the org and also spoke about the importance of the young filmmakers being honored at the event. “I think it’s incredible,” Fries said. “Nothing happens without the next generation of creativity and innovation. Something that we try to do in our organization, both internally and externally, is to support the next generation of leaders in this industry.” \nPrice, who accepted the new visions award, spoke about the importance of backing new filmmakers in events such as this one. “Its an exciting time in television because everybody is competing to come up with the most amazing show that everybody is talking about,” Price said. “I think the only way to do that is to find really talented people and get behind them and find somebody with a unique voice; it’s a great time to be a producer, a writer, a director or an agent.” \nHere’s the complete list of winners: \nHonors Award Winners Producer: Marta Kauffman (“Grace and Frankie”) Producer: Howard J. Morris (“Grace and Frankie”) Writer: Robert and Michelle King Director: Thomas Carter \nCaucus Executive of the Year Award Michael T. Fries, vice chairman, president and CEO, Liberty Global \nCaucus Lifetime Achievement Award Kevin Bright, executive producer, director, educator \nNew Visions Award Roy Price, head of Amazon Studios \nCaucus Chair’s Award Stephanie Allain , producer, Homegrown Pictures \nCaucus Distinguished Service Award Frank Chindamo, professor, founder, Fun Little Movies \n2016 Caucus Gold Circle Awards First Place Winner: Panavision Camera Package — Ellie Foumbi for “Nocturne in Black” (Columbia University) Second Place Winner: Illuminate Studios Post Production Package — Julio Vincent Gambuto for “The Julie Stories” (USC) \n2016 Caucus Television and New Media Award Dodge College, Chapman University, The Kama Sutra Club Filed Under:",

      "text": "News Amazon adds HBO and Cinemax to its cord-cutting selection Amazon Prime subscribers can now get access to the on-demand content libraries of HBO and Cinemax via their favorite online retailer. Contributor, TechHive | Dec 2, 2016 7:56 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Nvidia Shield console hands-on: Powerful PC gaming in a $200 Android TV box \nAmazon just added two big names to its Channels offerings, an a la carte premium subscription streaming hub: HBO and Cinemax. HBO will cost subscribers $15 per month, similar to the pricing on other services, while Cinemax is priced at $10 per month. An Amazon Prime subscription is required for access to Amazon Channels . \nThe new additions do not include live streaming, unlike competing services such as HBO on Sling TV. HBO on Amazon Prime provides access to HBO’s on-demand catalog. This includes favorite shows like Westworld , Insecure , and Game of Thrones , as well as top movies like The Martian , The Revenant , and Batman vs. Superman (hey, I didn’t say they were all good movies). \nDespite the current streaming craze Amazon’s Channels offering has largely gone unnoticed. That may be due to the fact that Amazon doesn’t offer any live TV streaming, though Amazon is pursuing such a service . \nThe impact on you at home: Nevertheless, Amazon’s approach is in some ways the ultimate approach for cord cutters. Instead of signing up for expensive “fat” bundles or lower priced “skinny” bundles, on Amazon Channels you only pay for the streaming services you want. Even with skinny bundles such as those from Sling TV you will inevitably receive channels you’re not interested in. With the addition of HBO and Cinemax to the Amazon Channels lineup, the retailer has yet another reason for Amazon shoppers to keep their Prime memberships up to date.

      "title": "Seagate Announces Duet: An Amazon Cloud-Syncing Portable HDD for $99.99",
      "text": "Comment \nSeagate this week has continued to introduce special-purpose storage devices tailored for select applications: the company is launching its Duet external hard drive that automatically downloads and uploads content from (and to) Amazon Drive to enable instant and offline access to data stored in the cloud. The HDD will be useful for those,who store up to 1 TB of data in the cloud but prefer to have local copies as well. \nThe Seagate Duet is a re-badged Backup Plus Portable Drive with 1 TB capacity and special software that syncs it with the Amazon Drive service. The drive uses a USB 3.0 interface to connect to computers (running Windows or macOS) and has 5400 RPM spindle speed and two platters featuring PMR technology. The HDD needs to be plugged into a PC with internet access in order to connect to the Internet to upload or download data. Users who would like to use the drive like a normal external HDD will have to reformat it (it is doubtful that there will be a lot of such people as the drive costs considerably more than the regular external 1 TB HDDs without cloud-syncing technology). \nDuring the initial setup, the Duet drive logins to a customer’s Amazon account and then automatically syncs photos, videos, files, documents, movies and music. After a file is added to the Duet drive, it will be uploaded to the cloud and then available from almost everywhere using any device, including smartphones and tablets that have special apps installed. Alternatively, every file uploaded from a mobile device to Amazon's Drive eventually ends up on the Seagate Duet drive when the device is synchronized. \nThe Seagate Duet drive will be available exclusively from Amazon in the U.S. for $99.99, which is considerably more expensive than the actual retail price of Seagate’s Backup Plus Portable 1 TB model ($55 - $60). For new U.S. Amazon Drive customers the Duet will come with one free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage (a $59.99 value), which makes the external storage device somewhat more attractive. Meanwhile, existing Amazon Drive customers will essentially pay $40 - $45 for cloud-syncing software. The HDD is covered by a two-year limited warranty from Seagate.",

On Tuesday (Nov. 29), the film swept the National Board of Review Awards , winning Best Picture, Actor (Affleck), Original Screenplay (Lonergan) and Breakthrough Male Performance ( Lucas Hedges ). On Thursday (Dec. 1), Affleck and Lonergan prevailed with the New York Film Critics Circle which also singled out the supporting performance of Michelle Williams for honors. And that same day, the film reaped eight Critics’ Choice Awards nominations . \nTo date, 25 films have been delivered. Below, a list of these titles with the most recent first.",

      "title": "Amazon Plans To Enter Header Bidding 12/02/2016",
      "text": "Everyone else is in it -- why not Amazon? The online commerce giant plans to enter cloud-based header bidding, and is expected to make an announcement by next week, according to a report in Advertising Age. \nHeader bidding has experienced widespread adoption in 2016, as the process offers advertisers visibility into all ad inventory available for bid. Last spring Google announced its plans to test exchange bidding. Header bidding was largely a response to advertisers not having access to all inventory due to Google’s hegemony vis-à-vis DoubleClick AdX.\nNotably, Amazon isn't calling its header bidding offering a “wrapper” -- as many header bidding providers do -- because it plans to integrate it into the cloud. However, ad requests will likely be managed on the server vs. consumers’ Internet browsers. Server-to-server integrations are said to cause less problems with latency and page load times. By placing this process in the cloud, Amazon may avoid current challenges with the wrapper.\nIn the U.S., programmatic ad spending is expected to grow at a double-digit clip. In fact, eMarketer projected that it would increase to $25.23 billion this year. And programmatic is expected to represent 73% of all display ad spending in the U.S. this year.\nJay Friedman, partner and COO, of Goodway Group, told Real-Time Daily via email that header bidding has given publishers the feeling of having options other than going down the DoubleClick for Publishers/AdX (Google) path.\n“Publishers know that header bidding as it exists today is not the best option, but it’s an interim one that is better than what they had,” Friedman said. “Whatever the end state is, publishers, because they’re human, would like to have options.”  Further, Friedman said that Amazon entering the fray is good for competition, helping to break up Google’s dominance in the area.",

      "text": "Amazon's new services will help AI fulfill its manifest destiny By Lisa Lacy - 02 December 2016 17:18pm Three new services from Amazon will help AI fulfill its manifest destiny. / Edgarodriguezmunoz/Wikimedia: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Legislaci%C3%B3n_Tecnologica_IA.jpg \nAmazon’s cloud services platform Amazon Web Services recently announced three AI services it said will make it easy for developers to build apps that can understand natural language, turn text into speech, have conversations using voice or text, analyze images and recognize faces, objects and scenes. \nThis, in turn, underscores the increasing importance of AI to consumers, brands and marketers, but also raises some questions about how it will – and should – be developed. \nBuilding apps with AI capabilities has been challenging to date because doing so requires access to vast amounts of data and specialized expertise in machine learning and neural networks, Amazon said in a press release . \n“The combination of better algorithms and broad access to massive amounts of data and cost-effective computing power provided by the cloud is making AI a reality for application developers,” added Raju Gulabani, vice president of databases, analytics and AI at AWS, in a statement. “Thousands of machine learning and deep learning experts across Amazon have been developing AI technologies for years to predict what customers might like to read, to drive efficiencies in our fulfillment centers through robotics and computer vision technologies and to give customers our AI-powered virtual assistant, Alexa. Now, we are making the technology underlying these innovations available to any developer…we are excited to see how customers use Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly and Amazon Rekognition to build a new generation of apps that have human-like intelligence and can see, hear, speak and interact with people and their environments.” \nHere’s a closer look at Amazon’s new AI services : \nAmazon Lex \nAmazon Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text that is built on the same automatic speech recognition technology and natural language understanding that powers Alexa. \nAnd, according to Amazon, Lex makes it easy to bring natural language capabilities to most apps. Developers can build and test bots directly from the AWS Management Console by typing in a few sample phrases along with instructions for getting the required parameters to complete the task and the corresponding clarifying questions to ask the user. Amazon Lex then builds the language model and asks the follow-up questions needed to complete the task. \nIn a statement, Firoze Lafeer, CTO of Capital One Labs at Capital One said Lex “offers potential to speed time to market for a new generation of voice and text interactions, such as our recently launched Capital One skill for Alexa.” \nMomentum CTO Jason Snyder, however, questioned the degree of training required, particularly for understanding the context of a specific application. \n“[Amazon] demoed an airline flight-booking with natural language using Lex and Polly. Apparently, interpretation was based on a knowledge graph that lets you add metadata,” he said. “I’d wager developers will have to do more than build an app hook up the APIs. But what more?” \nAmazon Polly \nPer Amazon, Polly allows developers to add natural-sounding speech capabilities to existing applications like newsreaders and e-learning platforms or create new categories of speech-enabled products. \nDevelopers can send text to Amazon Polly using the SDK or from within the AWS Management Console and Polly returns an audio stream that can be played directly or stored in a standard audio file format. With 47 voices and support for 24 languages, developers can choose from both male and female voices with a variety of accents, Amazon said. \n“We’ve long been interested in providing audio versions of our stories, but have found that existing text-to-speech solutions are not cost-effective for the speech quality they offer,” said Joseph Price, senior product manager at The Washington Post, in a statement. “With the arrival of Amazon Polly and its high-quality voices, we look forward to offering readers more rich and versatile ways to experience our content.” \nAmazon Rekognition \nAnd, finally, Amazon Rekognition enables developers to build applications that analyze images and recognize faces, objects and scenes. It uses deep learning to automatically identify objects and scenes and provides a confidence score that lets developers tag images so that application users can search for specific images using key words. Amazon Rekognition can locate faces within images and detect attributes, such as whether or not the face is smiling or the eyes are open. Amazon Rekognition also supports advanced facial analysis functionalities such as face comparison and facial search. Using Rekognition, Amazon said developers can build an application that measures the likelihood that faces in two images are of the same person, thereby being able to verify a user against a reference photo in near real-time. Similarly, developers can create collections of millions of faces detected in images and can search for a face similar to their reference image in the collection. \nManifest destiny \nCombined, Lex, Polly and Rekognition demonstrate a bright future for AI. \nIn fact, one ad tech CEO said Amazon AI means the e-commerce giant is building out its arsenal to win the cloud wars and has positioned itself to catapult into the lead. \nFurther, Kerry Liu, CEO of retail intelligence platform Rubikloud, said he believes this investment should be a wake-up call for retailers if they want to remain competitive. \n“[The] announcement of Amazon AI should be a sign that retailers need to take a step back and analyze their business and where they have the ability to invest. It will be important for these organizations to have a significant tech budget allocated to innovative processes so that they can integrate deep learning functionality within their software infrastructure,” Liu said. “There should be a sense of urgency across retailers to incorporate machine learning and AI into their platform in order to meet consumer demands for a tailored experience. Clearly Amazon has made this strategic investment given industry trends and expectations and if retailers don’t jump on this technology now, they risk falling behind.” \nScott Horn, CMO of customer engagement software and services provider [24]7, agreed. \n“Amazon’s announced advances in AI demonstrate yet another example of the value businesses are putting on the power of machine learning. Abilities like natural language processing…are markers of an industry-wide race to better serve customers through AI. When used in a retail context, AI automates assistance on the front lines of customer service, saving human agents for higher stake scenarios, such as for retention and upselling purposes,” Horn said. “These advances are not only applauded by businesses, but also by customers. According to [24]7’s new customer experience study…two in five consumers are open to interacting with a chatbot in a retail scenario and nearly one-third of them (28.9%) prefer it over the phone or email. This level of adoption points to a profitable opportunity for retailers as they consider future CX investments.” \nSnyder, however, said the biggest issue in his mind is ethical. \n“Google has been using cognitive services and machine learning in its product set for more than a decade. Amazon has been working on AI, too, but not as long. Recently, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Facebook formed an alliance to address the ethical issues . My point is there needs to be more prominent voices pushing for AI research and conversations regarding ethics and safety,” he added. \nThat’s because while he called AI one of the most beneficial technologies humanity has produced, Snyder noted it is our responsibility – especially in the context of persuading, like marketing and advertising - that machine intelligence clearly state its purpose as utility, information or entertainment. \n“As an industry, it is imperative that as this technology enters culture, that we collectively develop and evolve AI in a responsible manner,” he added.",
