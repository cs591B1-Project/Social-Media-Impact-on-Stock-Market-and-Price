      "text": "Stocks to watch after the election. Buy Verizon at current levels.\nWhat if Hillary loses?\n\nStocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Monday, November 7. \nStocks rallied on Monday. Does it mean that the market loves Hillary? Not at all! The market just hates uncertainty. For a long time, Hillary was expected to win according to the polls. As polls got tighter, there was uncertainty and hence the money was flowing out. As the FBI started its probe again, the market got uncertain. Once a clean chit was given, sanity was restored and the money started flowing in.\n\n\"I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election,\" said Cramer. If Clinton wins the election, the market will return to normalcy and that means companies with the best earnings will be in the limelight again. Investors should keep their eyes on such stocks.\nIn the financial group, JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), Citigroup (NYSE: C ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY ) had good earnings. In the soft financials Visa (NYSE: V ), MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) and American Express (NYSE: AXP ) had good earnings. In the social, mobile and cloud group Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) had good earnings.\nThe transports group did not do well but Cramer expects United Continental (NYSE: UAL ) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) as comeback options. Due to an increase in Chinese business and turnaround in Europe, the airline space did well. Cramer picked Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) as stocks to watch.\nThe restaurant group had poor earnings along with retail and home improvements. A few stocks to watch in those groups are Cheesecake Factory (NYSE: CHK ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ), Masco (NYSE: MAS ), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW ) and PPG (NYSE: PPG ). In the sports apparel group Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) were hit hard. In the healthcare group, Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG ) deserves more respect than it gets.\n\"If you look at where the money wants to go, and you figure that this election will pass, I think that the above description of the earnings season to date will hold up until year end,\" said Cramer.\nCemex (NYSE: CX ) \nElections have consequences on companies based on the policies of the candidates. If Donald Trump were able to win the presidency, it would have an impact on Mexican cement maker Cemex.\nTrump has been vocal about the NAFTA agreement and free trade agreement which has allowed stocks like Cemex to grow. The company gets 28% of its sales from the US. The fundamentals of the company are improving as it has paid down $1.4B in debt. More importantly, the strength in the USD against the Mexican Peso has worked in the company's favor.\nThe company's products are getting cheaper in the US as the dollar rises and it makes more money for every dollar. If Trump wins and is successful in re-negotiating NAFTA, companies like Cemex would hurt. Cramer suggested waiting till after the election and a pullback in the stock before buying it.\nStocks to watch if Clinton loses \nWhich stocks will get affected if Hillary Clinton loses the election? As Cramer mentioned, Mexican companies could get hurt if Trump wins. In that case, Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU ), the leading railroad between the US and Mexico would be the biggest loser.\nApproximately 4M cars are expected to be produced this year and KSU will transport 40% of them into the US. Any policy which affects free trade will impact KSU as it generates more than 50% of its revenue from trade between the US and Mexico.\nThe iShares Mexico Capped ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW ) has become a proxy for a Trump victory. This ETF spans across the Mexican sectors and all will be hurt on trade restrictions.\nCEO interview - XPO Logistics (NYSEMKT: XPO ) \nXPO Logistics reported stellar earnings and its stock is up 32% since July. Cramer interviewed CEO Bradley Jacobs to hear more about the last quarter.\nXPO is a leader in last-mile deliveries for e-commerce shipments that cannot be moved by traditional carriers like appliances, furniture and exercise equipment. Jacobs said that the company plans to be a leader in the fastest growing areas of transportation. The company makes more than a million deliveries every month.\nCramer asked Jacobs about the impact of a Trump victory since they have more than $1B worth of business per annum with Mexico. Jacobs said that the company would find a way to continue business under Donald Trump and it wouldn't affect them. Even Brexit has had limited impact on their business in Europe as they have a large presence in the UK, Spain and France.\nViewer calls taken by Cramer \nVerizon (NYSE: VZ ): They have a good yield. Buy it.\nConstellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ): It's a good company but Cramer does not want to buy the stock when it's up. Wait till it comes down.\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB ): Their dividend is safe but they did not have a great quarter. Buy some at this level and the rest when it comes down.\n\nJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS : Check out Cramer's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.

More importantly, the strength in the USD against the Mexican Peso has worked in the company's favor.\nThe company's products are getting cheaper in the US as the dollar rises and it makes more money for every dollar. If Trump wins and is successful in re-negotiating NAFTA, companies like Cemex would hurt. Cramer suggested waiting till after the election and a pullback in the stock before buying it.\nStocks to watch if Clinton loses \nWhich stocks will get affected if Hillary Clinton loses the election? As Cramer mentioned, Mexican companies could get hurt if Trump wins. In that case, Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU ), the leading railroad between the US and Mexico would be the biggest loser.\nApproximately 4M cars are expected to be produced this year and KSU will transport 40% of them into the US. Any policy which affects free trade will impact KSU as it generates more than 50% of its revenue from trade between the US and Mexico.\nThe iShares Mexico Capped ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW ) has become a proxy for a Trump victory. This ETF spans across the Mexican sectors and all will be hurt on trade restrictions.\nCEO interview - XPO Logistics (NYSEMKT: XPO ) \nXPO Logistics reported stellar earnings and its stock is up 32% since July. Cramer interviewed CEO Bradley Jacobs to hear more about the last quarter.\nXPO is a leader in last-mile deliveries for e-commerce shipments that cannot be moved by traditional carriers like appliances, furniture and exercise equipment. Jacobs said that the company plans to be a leader in the fastest growing areas of transportation. The company makes more than a million deliveries every month.\nCramer asked Jacobs about the impact of a Trump victory since they have more than $1B worth of business per annum with Mexico. Jacobs said that the company would find a way to continue business under Donald Trump and it wouldn't affect them. Even Brexit has had limited impact on their business in Europe as they have a large presence in the UK, Spain and France.\nViewer calls taken by Cramer \nVerizon (NYSE: VZ ): They have a good yield. Buy it.\nConstellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ): It's a good company but Cramer does not want to buy the stock when it's up. Wait till it comes down.\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB ): Their dividend is safe but they did not have a great quarter. Buy some at this level and the rest when it comes down.\n\nJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS : Check out Cramer's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.

      "text": "Stocks to watch after the election. Buy Verizon at current levels.\nWhat if Hillary loses?\n\nStocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Monday, November 7. \nStocks rallied on Monday. Does it mean that the market loves Hillary? Not at all! The market just hates uncertainty. For a long time, Hillary was expected to win according to the polls. As polls got tighter, there was uncertainty and hence the money was flowing out. As the FBI started its probe again, the market got uncertain. Once a clean chit was given, sanity was restored and the money started flowing in.\n\n\"I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election,\" said Cramer. If Clinton wins the election, the market will return to normalcy and that means companies with the best earnings will be in the limelight again. Investors should keep their eyes on such stocks.\nIn the financial group, JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), Citigroup (NYSE: C ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY ) had good earnings. In the soft financials Visa (NYSE: V ), MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) and American Express (NYSE: AXP ) had good earnings. In the social, mobile and cloud group Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) had good earnings.\nThe transports group did not do well but Cramer expects United Continental (NYSE: UAL ) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) as comeback options. Due to an increase in Chinese business and turnaround in Europe, the airline space did well. Cramer picked Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) as stocks to watch.\nThe restaurant group had poor earnings along with retail and home improvements. A few stocks to watch in those groups are Cheesecake Factory (NYSE: CHK ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ), Masco (NYSE: MAS ), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW ) and PPG (NYSE: PPG ). In the sports apparel group Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) were hit hard. In the healthcare group, Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG ) deserves more respect than it gets.\n\"If you look at where the money wants to go, and you figure that this election will pass, I think that the above description of the earnings season to date will hold up until year end,\" said Cramer.\nCemex (NYSE: CX ) \nElections have consequences on companies based on the policies of the candidates. If Donald Trump were able to win the presidency, it would have an impact on Mexican cement maker Cemex.\nTrump has been vocal about the NAFTA agreement and free trade agreement which has allowed stocks like Cemex to grow. The company gets 28% of its sales from the US. The fundamentals of the company are improving as it has paid down $1.4B in debt. More importantly, the strength in the USD against the Mexican Peso has worked in the company's favor.\nThe company's products are getting cheaper in the US as the dollar rises and it makes more money for every dollar. If Trump wins and is successful in re-negotiating NAFTA, companies like Cemex would hurt. Cramer suggested waiting till after the election and a pullback in the stock before buying it.\nStocks to watch if Clinton loses \nWhich stocks will get affected if Hillary Clinton loses the election? As Cramer mentioned, Mexican companies could get hurt if Trump wins. In that case, Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU ), the leading railroad between the US and Mexico would be the biggest loser.\nApproximately 4M cars are expected to be produced this year and KSU will transport 40% of them into the US. Any policy which affects free trade will impact KSU as it generates more than 50% of its revenue from trade between the US and Mexico.\nThe iShares Mexico Capped ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW ) has become a proxy for a Trump victory. This ETF spans across the Mexican sectors and all will be hurt on trade restrictions.\nCEO interview - XPO Logistics (NYSEMKT: XPO ) \nXPO Logistics reported stellar earnings and its stock is up 32% since July. Cramer interviewed CEO Bradley Jacobs to hear more about the last quarter.\nXPO is a leader in last-mile deliveries for e-commerce shipments that cannot be moved by traditional carriers like appliances, furniture and exercise equipment.

      "text": "Stocks to watch after the election. Buy Verizon at current levels.\nWhat if Hillary loses?\n\nStocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Monday, November 7. \nStocks rallied on Monday. Does it mean that the market loves Hillary? Not at all! The market just hates uncertainty. For a long time, Hillary was expected to win according to the polls. As polls got tighter, there was uncertainty and hence the money was flowing out. As the FBI started its probe again, the market got uncertain. Once a clean chit was given, sanity was restored and the money started flowing in.\n\n\"I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election,\" said Cramer. If Clinton wins the election, the market will return to normalcy and that means companies with the best earnings will be in the limelight again. Investors should keep their eyes on such stocks.\nIn the financial group, JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), Citigroup (NYSE: C ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY ) had good earnings. In the soft financials Visa (NYSE: V ), MasterCard (NYSE: MA ) and American Express (NYSE: AXP ) had good earnings. In the social, mobile and cloud group Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Accenture (NYSE: ACN ) had good earnings.\nThe transports group did not do well but Cramer expects United Continental (NYSE: UAL ) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC ) as comeback options. Due to an increase in Chinese business and turnaround in Europe, the airline space did well. Cramer picked Boeing (NYSE: BA ) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ) and Honeywell (NYSE: HON ) as stocks to watch.\nThe restaurant group had poor earnings along with retail and home improvements. A few stocks to watch in those groups are Cheesecake Factory (NYSE: CHK ), Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ ), Masco (NYSE: MAS ), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW ) and PPG (NYSE: PPG ). In the sports apparel group Nike (NYSE: NKE ) and Under Armour (NYSE: UA ) were hit hard. In the healthcare group, Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG ) deserves more respect than it gets.\n\"If you look at where the money wants to go, and you figure that this election will pass, I think that the above description of the earnings season to date will hold up until year end,\" said Cramer.\nCemex (NYSE: CX ) \nElections have consequences on companies based on the policies of the candidates. If Donald Trump were able to win the presidency, it would have an impact on Mexican cement maker Cemex.\nTrump has been vocal about the NAFTA agreement and free trade agreement which has allowed stocks like Cemex to grow. The company gets 28% of its sales from the US. The fundamentals of the company are improving as it has paid down $1.4B in debt. More importantly, the strength in the USD against the Mexican Peso has worked in the company's favor.\nThe company's products are getting cheaper in the US as the dollar rises and it makes more money for every dollar. If Trump wins and is successful in re-negotiating NAFTA, companies like Cemex would hurt. Cramer suggested waiting till after the election and a pullback in the stock before buying it.\nStocks to watch if Clinton loses \nWhich stocks will get affected if Hillary Clinton loses the election? As Cramer mentioned, Mexican companies could get hurt if Trump wins. In that case, Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU ), the leading railroad between the US and Mexico would be the biggest loser.\nApproximately 4M cars are expected to be produced this year and KSU will transport 40% of them into the US. Any policy which affects free trade will impact KSU as it generates more than 50% of its revenue from trade between the US and Mexico.\nThe iShares Mexico Capped ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW ) has become a proxy for a Trump victory. This ETF spans across the Mexican sectors and all will be hurt on trade restrictions.\nCEO interview - XPO Logistics (NYSEMKT: XPO ) \nXPO Logistics reported stellar earnings and its stock is up 32% since July. Cramer interviewed CEO Bradley Jacobs to hear more about the last quarter.\nXPO is a leader in last-mile deliveries for e-commerce shipments that cannot be moved by traditional carriers like appliances, furniture and exercise equipment. Jacobs said that the company plans to be a leader in the fastest growing areas of transportation. The company makes more than a million deliveries every month.\nCramer asked Jacobs about the impact of a Trump victory since they have more than $1B worth of business per annum with Mexico. Jacobs said that the company would find a way to continue business under Donald Trump and it wouldn't affect them. Even Brexit has had limited impact on their business in Europe as they have a large presence in the UK, Spain and France.\nViewer calls taken by Cramer \nVerizon (NYSE: VZ ): They have a good yield. Buy it.\nConstellation Brands (NYSE: STZ ): It's a good company but Cramer does not want to buy the stock when it's up. Wait till it comes down.\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB ): Their dividend is safe but they did not have a great quarter. Buy some at this level and the rest when it comes down.\n\nJim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS : Check out Cramer's multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.

      "text": "Many stores and restaurants offer Veteran’s Day 2016 discounts to active and retired military members, but cell phone carriers and tech companies like Apple offer year round Military discounts on cell phone service, accessories and new Apple computers.\nVeteran and Military discounts at cell phone carriers are fairly common, especially among the big names in wireless service. These carriers do not require users to go in to a store on Veteran’s Day to get these deals, though many times you will need to go into a store to get the discount set up.\nAdvertisement\nCurrent and retired military members will need to bring proof to get the discount, in the form of an ID or DD Form 214. Request a DD 214 copy from Military records.\nThese deals won’t often reduce the price of a phone, and Apple’s Veteran discount is not good on the iPhone or iPad, but over the course of a two-year contract, the savings can add up to enough to cover the cost of two new iPhones.\nThe military member or veteran will need to be the primary account holder for the discount and most times it does not apply to the added lines. Switching to the primary on an account is a free and easy process that customer support can help with.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s the information you need to start saving on your monthly cell phone bill as a thank you for your service.\nAdvertisement\nGet 15% military discount for active duty, reserves and veterans from most wireless carriers and from Apple.\nVerizon Military Discount Verizon offers a Veteran discount as well as a discount to active service members and federal employees. Verizon’s Veteran discount includes 15% off plans $34.99 or higher, and may include discounts on data as well as 25% off accessories in some cases.\nThe plan is available active duty and veterans alike. Apply online at The Verizon Employee Eligibility Program page, where you will need a Paystub, Veteran’s ID Card or DD Form 214. You can also apply in store, though you may need a manager to help you get set up if the customer service rep is not aware of the program. There are a lot of varying discounts so don’t be surprised if the first person you talk to is not aware of the program.\nSign up Online at Verizon .\nAdvertisement\nAT&T Military Discount The AT&T Veteran discount is also available to veteran’s active duty and reserves, cutting 15% off your monthly bill. This is applicable on the primary line on the account. You will need to go into an AT&T store to get the military discount. Bring proof of your service including a Paystub, Veteran’s ID or DD Form 214.\nUsers with a military email can sign up online for $25 off an online orders and enroll using the AT&T Premier site. If you do not have a military email you will need to go to a store to sign up.\nSign Up Online at AT&T .\nT-Mobile Military Discount T-Mobile offers a military discount through the T-Mobile Advantage program. This is the name of T-Mobile’s employee discount program and it should offer around 15% off to active duty and veterans.\nShoppers will see 15% off their lines and off of data packages as well. Go online or call a T-Mobile representative for details.\nAdvertisement\nSign up for the T-Mobile military discount online .\nSprint Military Discount Sprint’s military discount is 15% off the monthly bill for active and retired military members. Users can verify their status online by entering their cell phone number and then supplying military orders, a W2 or DD 214 to verify their eligibility.\nOne oddity about this process is that it locks the user into a new two-year discount. If you just singed up for a discount it may make sense to skip this discount until you are ready to renew and get a new phone. The price of a new phone is discounted by hundreds of dollars when you are able to sign a new contract, so keep that in mind before signing up.\nSign up for Sprint’s military discount online .\nAdvertisement\nApple Military & Veteran Discount Active and retired military members and federal employees qualify for a discount from Apple. The easiest way to gain this is to shop online at Apple.com through the government portal. These discounts are for personal use, and extend to cover purchases made for your family.\nApple’s military discount drops $100 off the price of a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and many other Macs. It does not discount the iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\nVisit Apple’s Government Store for military and veteran discounts .",

      "text": "Chesterton police are investigating a robbery at the Verizon store Monday afternoon in which one of the suspects displayed a handgun and physically restrained the customers and employees there in a back room. \nNo one was injured in the robbery, Police Chief David Cincoski said in a news release. \nPolice responded at 1:28 p.m. to a call about the robbery at Verizon, 705 Plaza Drive, Suite 1. \nThree black men entered the store, appeared to browse around and engaged employees in product questions while other customers were in the store, Cincoski said. \nOne of the suspects displayed a handgun and told the employees and customers to place their hands in the air before they were taken to the back room and restrained, Cincoski said. \nThe suspects took store equipment, a customer's purse, and undisclosed contents of the store's safe before leaving through a back door, a release said. \nThe men were observed placing the items in the rear of a dark-colored, late model Jeep or Dodge sport utility vehicle before leaving the area southbound on Plaza Drive, police said. The vehicle had a white sticker in the rear window. \nOne suspect was described as being in his mid to late 20s, of medium build, 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 10 inches tall, in jeans, a white shirt and tennis shoes. Another suspect was described similarly and said to be wearing jeans, a striped shirt and hiking boots. Descriptions for the third suspect and the driver, also black men, were not available.",

      "title": "Agree To Buy Verizon With An 8% Yield; Still Beat A CD",
      "text": "Verizon’s highest dividend yield in the past couple of decades has been just above 7%. \nCurrent annual CD rates top out at about 1.3%. \nThis article demonstrates how you could agree to buy shares at a materially lower price / higher yield and still generate more cash flow than a lower yielding alternative. During the depths of the recession, telecommunications powerhouse Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) declined in price all the way down to $26 or so. Actually this happened about a year after what many would call \"the bottom\" for securities in the aggregate. Still, this event represented a decline of about 43% from the peak in 2007 (~$46) to the trough (~$26) in the middle of 2010. At the end of 2007, Verizon was paying out a $0.43 quarterly dividend - in turn representing a starting yield of about 3.7%. By the middle of 2010 Verizon was paying out a $0.475 quarterly dividend, meaning that the highest the dividend yield ever got to was about 7.3%. I want you to keep that number as a reference point for the moment. Presently the average rate for a 1-year CD sits at just 0.31% and the highest rate tops out at about 1.3%. That means over say a 14-month period you might be able to collect $42 or so in payments on a $2,800 starting balance. Now why do I bring all of this up? That's a good question. These things are relevant because the same sort of offer is available with Verizon put options. Let's survey the field. If you look out to the January 2018 put options for Verizon (14 months away) you'll see that the $28 strike price last traded at $0.50. In other words, if you set aside $2,800 to potentially buy 100 shares of Verizon, you would get $50 upfront for making that agreement. Once you add in fees (call it $8) you get to an option premium of about $42 - nearly identical to what's presently available, cash flow-wise, with your top rate CD. Obviously the principal amount is not guaranteed, your cash flow would be (you receive that upfront), but shares could later trade at a lower price and you'd see a loss, at least in the short-term. However, I think it's important to recognize what this sort of thing would represent. Verizon is expected to earn $3.90 or so per share this year, so for starters you'd be talking about a company generating ~$16 billion in profits and trading at just 7 times earnings. Naturally this is possible, but you'd be hard pressed to find examples of Verizon consistently trading at 10 times earnings, much less 7. Moreover, at a price of $28 per share the $0.5775 quarterly dividend would equate to a starting yield of 8.25%. Remember, the highest yield on record for the company over the last couple of decades was 7.3%. And something in the 4% to 5% range has been much more typical. Now none of this is to suggest that you ought to make that particular option agreement. Instead, it merely serves as an introduction to surveying the field for what's out there. A lot of people think of their investing decisions as an \"either or\" scenario. It goes something like this, \"well, I could go with a CD paying a percent or two, or I could go with something like Verizon paying 4% or 5%.\" In that scenario, the equity wins out. Yet it could be the case that you're not particularly fond of the valuation of a given security (Verizon or otherwise) or that you'd prefer a solid income stream but you're not comfortable with the starting price of XYZ security. The above illustration shows that you can generate the same amount of cash flow as a CD, while agreeing to buy shares of Verizon at ~40% discount to the current price and in turn representing a very high starting yield that has never been reached historically. To be sure this is riskier than owning the CD. Yet the point is that it's a whole lot \"safer\" (in terms of an adverse event, not in terms of opportunity costs) than buying shares outright. If for whatever reason a security's offering price doesn't fit your comfort zone at the moment you literally have options available to you. And of course the great thing about the option world is that you're not confined to an \"either or\" situation. You don't have to either own shares of Verizon or agree to buy at a 40% discount and generate a very small cash flow. That was just for illustration. There are all sorts of in-betweens, ranging from a week to years and discounts running the gamut as well. Here, I'll show you what I mean: The above table gives a range of available put options - ranging from $28 up to $50 - for the January 2018 expiration date. Note that I have no affinity for this date (many prefer shorter timeframes) but the idea is to provide a starting point to demonstrate what's out there. The first column highlights the strike price, or the price at which you'd be willing to buy 100 shares of Verizon. In the second column you have the \"net\" premium, which takes the most recent bid less $0.08 per share for transaction costs. The \"premium yield\" column indicates the yield that the option premium would represent (which can be taxed differently than dividends) based on the amount of capital needed to \"cash secure\" the agreement. Finally you have the discount that would result, based on a current price above $47, should the option be exercised. So you can see our starting example on the top line. If you set aside $2,800 for 14 months, you'd receive $42 upfront for agreeing to buy at a 40%+ discount. If the option is exercised, your cost basis is under $28 per share. If the option is not exercised, you don't own shares, but your $2,800 is once more \"released\" and you also had the small upfront cash flow component from the option proceeds. For many this sort of gain would not be worth tying up your capital for over a year. However, some of the other agreements may look a bit more interesting. For instance, you could agree to buy at $40 - a still solid discount to today's pricing - and receive a 4.6% yield for doing so. If the option is exercised, your cost basis is around $38 (indicating a starting yield north of 6%). If the option is not exercised, you'll have your ~$185 in proceeds plus the beginning $4,000 to once again allocate as you see fit. If you're happy to own shares of Verizon, the risk is if the share price moves materially higher to say $60 or $70. In that case you would have been better off outright purchasing shares instead of making an agreement to buy at a lower price. Another example if you're content with today's price, you could make an agreement to buy at $47 - resulting in ~$450 upfront, good for a near 10% starting cash flow yield. If the option is exercised, your cost basis will be around $42. If the option is not exercised you'd still have a ~10% return. You could miss out on a 20% or 30% return should shares move materially higher, but you wouldn't exactly have a poor result either. In short, it can pay (literally) to see what types of agreements are out there. If you hold the sentiment that CDs are not offering a high enough yield, but securities like Verizon do not look especially attractive you're not required to sit on cash. You may choose to do so, but you can also explore getting paid to potentially buy at a lower price.

      "text": "Best Buy Offers Up To $300 Gift Card With LG G5 Purchase On Verizon, Sprint Or AT&T Installment Plans 15 November 2016, 5:51 pm EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Android Marshmallow - Fascinating Facts Now Playing Best Buy has kicked off a promotion on the LG G5, offering gift cards of up to $300 when purchasing the device on an installment plan with Sprint, Verizon or AT&T. Prices and offers vary based on carrier, so here's what's on the table. ( Best Buy ) Advertisement \nIf you've been thinking about buying the LG G5 and don't mind getting hooked with a carrier for an installment plan, Best Buy may have just the right promo. \nThe retailer is offering a gift card of $300 when purchasing the LG G5 on an installment plan on Sprint or Verizon Wireless. Best Buy also has a similar promo for getting the smartphone on an AT&T installment plan, but it's only offering a $100 gift card. \nBefore the LG V20 hit the scene in September, the LG G5 was widely considered one of the best Android smartphones of 2016 . The LG G5 is a high-end smartphone with powerful specs and features all around, and it's also modular, allowing users to upgrade their device by adding the extensions they prefer. LG G5 Specs \nFor those who need a refresher, the LG G5 sports a 5.4-inch IPS QHD display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels, packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with a quad-core Kyro CPU and 4 GB of RAM under the hood, and rocks a full-metal modular body that aims to combine style and functionality. \nOther specs include 32 GB of expandable storage, a 16-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel selfie cam on the front, a 2,800 mAh battery and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner for extra security. \nOn the other hand, the LG G5 has also been facing some issues , as reported by users. \nThe LG G5 is available for $24 per month for 24 months on an installment plan with Sprint, or $799.99 outright, full retail price. Best Buy's offer to throw in a free $300 gift card applies only when purchasing the smartphone on an installment plan. \nThe same smartphone is also available for $26 per month for 24 months with a Verizon installment plan, or $649.99 outright. Just as the Sprint deal, Best Buy is offering a $300 gift card when buying the LG G5 on an installment plan. \nOn AT&T, the LG G5 is available at $22.97 per month for 30 months, $28.71 per month for 24 months, or $688.99 outright. Best Buy is offering a $100 gift card when purchasing and activating the LG G5 on an AT&T installment plan. Terms And Conditions \nThe gift card is applicable when purchasing and activating the device on Verizon Device Payment, Sprint 24-Month installment billion agreement or AT&T Next, and is not valid on two-year contracts (where applicable) or when buying the device outright. The gift card will be forfeited if the customer returns the device.

      "text": "# Comments \nWEST HAVEN >> West Shore residents who for months have been fighting Verizon Wireless’ application to locate a wireless telephone antenna at 281 Ocean Ave. — and eventually every quarter-mile in the public right-of-way along the shore — got some backing from the City Council Monday night. \nThe council unanimously approved a resolution opposing Verizon Wireless’ application, currently pending before the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority , joining Mayor Ed O’Brien, state Sen. Gayle Slossberg, D-Milford, and council Majority Leader Sean Ronan, D-9, who already were working on the residents’ behalf. \nThe council added its voice just three days before the next hearing on the application, which is scheduled for Thursday at 9:30 a.m. in Hearing Room 1 at PURA’s offices at 10 Franklin Square in New Britain. The application was filed by Cellco Partnership dba Verizon Wireless . \n“That sounds great!” said Morris Street resident Nhan Tran, whose yard is just 96 inches away from the proposed location of the cannister-type antenna, which would be placed on an existing utility pole along a bend in Ocean Avenue between Holcomb and Morris streets. Advertisement \nTran, speaking on Tuesday, was the neighbor who first alerted and got other neighbors involved last spring. \nIt’s not the first time Verizon Wireless’ plans have raised the ire of West Haven residents . Past issues have included upgrades to wireless facilities atop the Giannotti Apartments on Main Street . \nTran, being so close to the proposed location this time, is concerned about potential health effects of the radiation from the antenna. He and other neighbors also are concerned that the application process “does not require a permit from the city” and “there are only a few neighbors within 140 feet of the site that were notified.” \n“We want to basically make other neighbors aware of it,” Tran said. \nHis neighbors Alicia and Jack Glagowski, who live on Harding Street off Ocean Avenue, said having the City Council on record adds additional voices to the opposition. \n“The City Council is representing all the people now, and backing the mayor,” Jack Glagowski said. \nAlicia Glagowski, who spoke to the council on her neighbors’ behalf at a council meeting Monday night, said, “I don’t think it carries a lot of weight,” but as various people involved in the process have told her, “it wouldn’t hurt.” \nShe said a similar antenna already has been placed atop the strip mall that houses Dive Bar along Ocean Avenue near Jones Hill Road and the West Haven-Milford border. \n“We do not want to see our shoreline lined with all these poles,” Glagowski told the City Council Monday night. \nNeither PURA officials nor Verizon Wireless’ attorney, W. Richard Smith Jr. of Robinson & Cole in Hartford, immediately returned calls for comment. \nThe city is being assisted and represented in fighting the proposal by attorney Burt Cohen of Murtha Cullina, who also has represented the Connecticut Council of Municipalities in a similar fight involving wireless facilities in Greenwich. \nAmong the arguments made in that case, and expected to come up now in this case, is that while it is a public right-of-way, Verizon Wireless is a private company — and wireless service is not a public utility, according to Mayor O’Brien and the Glagowskis. \n“What CCM is saying is that the right-of-way is used for public utilities,” said O’Brien, but “Verizon is not a public utility.” \nO’Brien said he plans to testify at the hearing Thursday. \n“I think it’s just not a good place to put an antenna,” O’Brien said, pointing out that, among other issues, that area has been the site of a number of auto accidents, including one very recent one. \n“It’s just not a good spot for it” and “there’s no need for it, anyway,” he said. \n“We can’t have these antennas all over on every” utility pole, O’Brien said. \nAlicia Glagowski said the scope of local opposition has broadened since the issue first arose. \n“When we started this fight it was one pole outside of Nhan’s house,” she said. “But when we went to the first PURA meeting, we heard Verizon Wireless say, ‘Well, we’re going to need these every quarter-mile.’” \nWhat concerns her is that the way the law is written, “They’ve got everybody over a barrel. Basically, you can’t fight them,” she said. \nThe way it should work, she said, is “Verizon should have a plan that’s presented to the city, and the city can say, ‘Well, that’s not a good place for a cell tower, 96 inches from this man’s yard,’” she said. \nThe City Council acted after Ronan asked for it to be added to Monday night’s agenda. \nThe council resolution states that “there are concerns that West Haven and other Connecticut municipalities are not receiving proper notice of the filing of applications for installation of wireless facilities by Verizon Wireless and other wireless service provider with PURA, to the detriment of property owners and residents” who live nearby. \nIt states that the council opposes “the installation and construction of small cell and other wireless telecommunications facilities on utility poles in residential areas along the shoreline area in West Haven,” as well as approval by PURA “of any applications for such facilities.” \nThe West Haven council “supports the position of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities ... that (PURA) should cease approving such small cell applications until the Connecticut General Asseembly has studied the issue to ensure that safety issues ... are addressed and that municipalities are consulted before providers submit applications for the approval of such facilities,” it reads.",

      "text": "The news comes as AOL prepares to become a merged entity with Yahoo. AOL parent company Verizon announced in July its intentions to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion. \nThe thinking behind the layoffs is likely to be an exercise to de-duplicate roles that will exist once Yahoo becomes a Verizon company. Sources told Business Insider that rationally, this makes sense, as Yahoo generates more in direct sales revenue than AOL — and Yahoo's severance packages are a lot larger than those at AOL. \nThe Verizon/Yahoo acquisition process has been prolonged, however, owing to Yahoo confirming in September it had suffered a huge hack attack , affecting at least 500 million users. \nYahoo gave Verizon just two days notice before the public knew it had been breached by a \"state-sponsored\" attacker. Verizon's general counsel said in October the company has \"reasonable basis\" to believe the attack had \"material impact\" on the deal. Verizon is reportedly seeking $1 billion discount off the sales price as a result, although Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam dispelled these reports as \"total speculation\" in October. \nA string of senior executives has left AOL in recent months — many of which were considered CEO Tim Armstrong's closest lieutenants. \nMarta Martinez, AOL's SVP of advertising, left the company a few weeks ago and was the company's most recent senior departure, sources told Business Insider. Her exit follows that of AOL's president of media brands Luke Beatty , who left earlier this month; global sales chief Jim Norton who left in October and landed a new role at Condé Nast; and executive vice president of AOL content and consumer brands Jimmy Maymann. \nMaymann was brought on board by another former AOL employee, Arianna Huffington, who announced in August she was stepping down from the Huffington Post media company she founded in 2005 and sold to AOL in 2011 to focus on her new startup, Thrive Global.",

      "title": "Is Apple holding back Verizon iPhone speeds?",
      "text": "“The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. (Photo: Kiichiro Sato / AP) \nIt turns out not all iPhone 7s are created equal.\nThe latest Apple Inc. smartphones that run on Verizon Communications Inc.’s network are technically capable of downloading data faster than those from AT&T Inc. Yet in testing, the two phones perform about the same, according to researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights.\nNeither firm is clear on the reason, but Twin Prime says it may be because Apple isn’t using all the potential of a crucial component in the Verizon version.\n“The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.”\n“Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.\"\nIt would be an unusual step for a major phone company to restrain its devices. Normally, companies battle to make the fastest, most reliable handsets. Apple may be doing this because it wants to ensure a uniform iPhone experience, according to analysts.\n\"They don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better,\" said Jan Dawson, founder of technology advisory firm Jackdaw Research LLC. \"If Apple had a guiding principle it’s that they want to make sure customers were having a consistent performance.”\nBut the move could backfire if customers realize their device isn’t performing to its full potential, or that it’s less capable than other handsets, analysts said.\n\"This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product,\" said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. The firm does paid analysis for smartphone suppliers, including Qualcomm Inc. and Intel Corp.\nThe component at the root of the performance gap is the modem, a tiny chip buried deep inside a phone’s innards that turns wireless signals into data and voice. The iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone for several years to have versions with different modems. Verizon users get an iPhone 7 with Qualcomm’s latest X12 modem — capable of downloading data at up to 600 megabits per second. AT&T customers get a handset with an Intel modem that tops out at 450 megabits per second.\nApple likely went with multiple suppliers to keep component costs in check.\nIn field tests by Twin Prime, the Verizon version is a little faster than its AT&T stablemate — but not as fast as it could be. The firm proved this by doing the same tests onthe Samsung Galaxy S7, which also runs on Verizon’s network and uses the Qualcomm X12. The S7 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip, Twin Prime found. This was based on data from more than 100,000 phones downloading an image in large U.S. cities.\nQualcomm’s X12 is capable of dealing with more channels of data simultaneously than its Intel rival, according to a report by Milan Milanovic, an analyst at Cellular Insights, which tests phones and networks. Apple didn’t enable this feature \"to level the playing field between Qualcomm and Intel,”Milanovic wrote.\nCellular Insights tests phones in labs with equipment that can vary the strength of the signal, basically approximating a phone moving from good coverage to poor coverage. The differences in performance between the handsets Milanovic tested were greatest when the phone signal was weakest, he said.\nTwin Prime and Cellular Insights have no relationships with chip makers, phone makers or wireless carriers. Four other network testing firms contacted by Bloomberg News said measuring phone data speeds is difficult because performance can be influenced by weather and other factors beyond the control of wireless providers and phone makers. Though none of these other firms disputed the findings of Twin Prime and Cellular Insights.\nIn addition to creating a unified iPhone 7 user experience, leveling the playing field would also keep wireless carriers happy, according to some industry analysts.\n“Apple likely has some incentive to balance the performance of its iPhones across its U.S. operator partners,\" saidJeff Kvaal, an analyst with Instinet LLC. \"It would be difficult, for example, to explain to AT&T, which remains the U.S. carrier with the most iPhone subscribers, why Verizon is offering a superior product.\"\nRepresentatives of AT&T, Verizon, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment.\nCompanies that \"de-feature or go with a less-advanced modem\" may be left behind as the networks offer faster data speeds, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said in a recent conference call, without naming specific firms.\nApple is in this situation because it chose different modems for the latest iPhone. By pitting Intel against Qualcomm, the company may be trying to improve its negotiating position on price. Qualcomm’s modems have for years been almost ubiquitous in high-end smartphones, including iPhones. Intel has struggled to break into this market and has used subsidies to try to win share in mobile.\nSacrificing performance in return for cheaper components may not go down well with Apple users.\n\"It was probably multiple factors that drove that decision. But in the end, it was a bad decision,\" said McGregor. \"It is really hard to argue for doing this because Qualcomm really does have the best modem technology.\"\nStill, many users may not realize their iPhone is different from their friends’ iPhones. And even if they do, they may decide Apple isn’t responsible. Most consumers blame their wireless service provider when a phone doesn’t work well, Milanovic said.",

      "text": "Black Friday 2016 Smartphone Deals: Verizon, Sprint and AT&T Samsung Galaxy S7/Edge, iPhone 7/Plus Sales And BOGOs At Walmart, Target, Best Buy And More 22 November 2016, 4:31 am EST By James Geddes Tech Times Apple - Here's What You May Not Know Now Playing Smartphone sales abound this Black Friday at Walmart, Best Buy, Target and other retail and online outlets. Retailers are offering big savings on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, LG G5, Moto Z and more on the AT&T, Verizon and Sprint networks. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nSmartphone deals abound this Black Friday with many of the nation's top retailers offering big bargains on some of the latest and greatest flagship smartphones. \nTop-rated devices on major carriers Verizon, Sprint and AT&T, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, LG G5, Moto Z and others are on sale at Walmart, Target, Best Buy and other outlets and we've got a roundup of the best deals. Best Black Friday Deals On iPhone 7 And iPhone 7 Plus, 6s And 6s Plus and SE \nApple's latest flagship smartphones took the conservative approach this year, keeping most of the design elements of their direct predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus . \nWhat's new this year is water resistance and an improved camera, especially in the phablet-size Plus model that incorporates a dual lens setup. The iPhone 7 Plus has proven to be especially popular in the wake of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall, with many former Samsung customers making the switch to iOS. \nThis year it looks like all of the big-box stores have a version of pretty much the same deal. Best Buy , Target , Walmart and others are offering the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus with a $250 store gift card. Different models at different storage configurations may offer a lower gift card value at some outlets, and restrictions require most purchasers to use either Verizon, AT&T or Sprint's device installment plans. \nOther outlets are including older iPhones in the mix, for example Walmart is offering the same $250 gift card with the purchase of an iPhone 6s, 6s Plus or SE. The iPhone 7 Plus is also in short supply right now and therefore may be hard to snag on one of these deals. Best Black Friday Deals On Samsung Galaxy S7 And S7 Edge \nSamsung is of course still reeling from the aforementioned Galaxy Note 7 recall. The company had been poised to have a stellar holiday season with the phablet having received great reviews, and interest in the new iPhones being muted because of a lack of new features. Now Samsung is focusing instead on its other flagship devices, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge . \nThe best Galaxy S7 and S7 edge Black Friday deal comes from Target this year. Any purchaser of either device receives a $250 store gift card, a free Samsung Gear VR headset and an additional $50 Oculus content pack. The device must be purchased on the associated carrier's respective installment plans. \nIf you're looking to buy a phone outright, Best Buy is offering the Galaxy S7 for $550, a $120 savings off the regular price, on the 32 GB gold or black models, with the gold being sold in-store only. Sprint also has a great BOGO deal on the Galaxy S7 exclusively from the carrier itself. Best Buy Black Friday LG G5 And Moto Z Deals \nBoth the LG G5 and Moto Z feature modular setups that allow for the attachment of specially designed accessories, and Best Buy has great deals on both smartphones. Best Buy customers can grab a $300 gift card with purchase of the LG G5 on either Verizon or Sprint's installment plans, while Moto Z buyers will save $384 off the retail price of that device when purchasing it on Verizon's installment agreement.

Thanks to our anonymous tipster who sent us this information that is intended for Verizon reps only, we can pass along some of the deals that will be available. For example, Verizon is offering big discounts for customers using the monthly device payment plan for the purchase of some high-end phones.For example, you can pick up a 128GB Google Pixel for only $15 a month. That is a monthly saving of $16.24. The 32GB Samsung Galaxy S7 can be yours for only $10 a month. That is a savings of $18 a month. And there are many more deals to take advantage of.For example, if it's a tablet you want, grab the 32GB Apple iPad mini 2 for just $99 after a rebate. That is a savings of $200, and requires a signed two-year contract. Another promotion gives away the Samsung VR Holiday Gift Pack via a digital rebate with the purchase of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge .Click on the slideshow at the bottom of this story to see more of the holiday deals available from Big Red starting on Thursday.

      "text": "Ashley King Nov 23rd, 2016 \nThis Thursday and Friday, Verizon is going to offer the best deal on a Pixel device we’ve seen since the phone launched. Of course, one of the caveats of this best deal is that you don’t mind signing up for a new 24-month contract from Verizon. The Pixel in 32GB and 128GB will be offered at $10 and $15 a month respectively, so long as you’re willing to sign up for that contract. \nVerizon’s discount for the phones isn’t immediate, but rather you’ll get a bill credit each month to drop your price down to the promised $10 to $15 a month prices. You can’t get the discount any other way, as the fine print has tied it directly to a device payment plan. \nThe discount is also only available for the smaller Pixel and not the Pixel XL , though either storage configuration is available. Once the 24-month bill credit is complete, the total discount is $240 for the 32GB Pixel and $360 for the 128GB configuration. \nIf that deal isn’t to your liking, Verizon will also be one of many retailers offering Google Home for only $99 this holiday season. That deal starts on November 23rd and is available until November 28th.",

      "text": "As Google continues to grow its hardware line, people may start clamoring for the devices not just at Google’s online store but in other retail and online outlets. Verizon is one of their partners in making their products more available, and the carrier has now announced that Google Home will be available in their stores, together with the previously announced Pixel phones, Google Live Cases, and Daydream View. And of course since Black Friday is almost upon us, they’re offering some pretty good deals for consumers.\nIf you didn’t know or you forgot what Google Home is, it is basically the tech giant’s answer to the Amazon Echo. It is a voice-activated speaker that uses the power of Google Assistant to let you play your music, answer your queries, manage everyday tasks like schedules and to-dos, and even control smart devices in your home, like the Nest thermostat or the Phillips Hue bulbs. All you have to do is start it off with OK Google, then give the necessary commands and it will do the rest.\nBoth the Pixel and the Pixel XL are also available through Verizon to take advantage of their 4G LTE network. You will also be able to buy the Google Live Cases for the two smartphones: the Google Trends Live Case which shows you the trending topics from Google Search and the Google Earth Live Case which shows landscape shots from space on your screen. The virtual reality headset and motion controller, the Daydream View, can also be purchased through the carrier’s stores.\nFrom November 23-28, get the Google Home for just $99.99 and its regular price will be at $129.99. For a limited time, you’ll also get 6 months free on YouTube Red. The Pixel will cost just $10 a month through Black Friday or up to $200 off through November 27.\nSOURCE: Verizon",

      "text": "freedompop freedomshop s ceo stephen stokols More Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile may have the most subscribers among U.S. carriers, but there is no shortage of smaller, cheaper outfits with comparable coverage and plans. FreedomPop is one of them.\nIt is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), meaning it taps other carriers’ towers to provide service (Sprint’s, in this case), but one with benefits that some of the major competition lack. It offers free mobile data in 25 countries, a basic service that includes 500 texts, 200 minutes, and 500MB of data each month at absolutely no charge, and unlimited talk, text, and 1GB for $20. Soon, it will begin selling hardware alongside its plans. Recently, the carrier announced the launch of a refurbished phone store for customers in the U.S., Britain, Mexico, and Spain.\nThe carrier’s new digital marketplace, the FreedomShop, will debut with a catalog of more than 100 different models of Apple, Samsung, and LG phones sourced from the roughly 200 smartphone resellers with which the carrier’s partnered. FreedomPop claims it will stock “every Android and iOS” smartphone from every major manufacturer over the past three years. They will be steeply discounted — up to 80 percent off suggested retail price, FreedomPop said.\nMore: Too good to be true? FreedomPop’s new SIM has free WhatsApp messages, data, and calls\nThey will come with generous purchase protection, too. All phones will be covered by a 30-day “no questions asked” money back guarantee and a 90-day warranty.\nFreedomPop’s taking on retail giants Amazon, eBay, and even Apple in the burgeoning reseller market. Analytics firm Deloitte Global projects that customers will trade in more than 120 million phones in 2017, generating more than $17 billion in wholesale revenue. Furthermore, it anticipates the market is expanding “four to five times” faster than the retail smartphone market, which research firm Gartner estimated would grow a mere 1.6 percent by the end of 2016.\nMore: This mobile hotspot costs $50, and comes with 200MB of international roaming data for free\nFreedomPop, for its part, is confident in its ability to stand out from the crowd. “[We] realized … that the market for refurbished phones is not only massively fragmented, but too scrappy for large companies to really play,” FreedomPop CEO Stephen Stokols told VentureBeat. “We have spent tens of millions of dollars building this expansive and unique supply chain, putting us in the unique position to undercut the typical resellers found on eBay or Amazon.”\nThe Los Angeles-based FreedomPop, which recently closed a $50 million venture capital round, recently embarked on an international expansion. In September 2015, it rolled out service in the U.K, and followed in April with a launch in Spain. It also recently began selling service to customers of Latin America pay-TV provider Dish Mexico.\nMore: FreedomPop launches free monthly iPhone-only plan, for those who don’t use much data\nCollectively, the company has raised more than $100 million in funding from Intel Capital, LetterOne, Mangrove Capital Partners, Partech Ventures, Axiata, DCM, Atomico, and others.\nWould you buy a refurbished Galaxy Note 7? Samsung may be hoping that you will Cricket's new plan includes unlimited talk and text, 1GB of data for $30 a month Who has the best family plan? Shake-ups from T-Mobile and Sprint tilt the balance",

      "title": "NBC, Verizon Will Live-Stream Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade",
      "text": "Sports fans can live-stream the Super Bowl and the Olympics. Now, aficionados of Macy’s annual Thanksgiving Day Parade will have a to get a digital take of the proceedings.\nNBCUniversal and Macy’s will make a video feed of the annual spectacle available on Verizon’s YouTube page as part of a marketing partnership. The maneuver gives people who want to watch the event an option other than the NBC telecast for the first time since the network began its parade telecasts in 1952, and bring a new-media dimension to the venerable Macy’s event, which began snaking through New York City’s concrete canyons in 1924. Under the terms of the package, Verizon will stream the parade with five cameras placed along the route capable of beaming 360-degree views to users, and festoon the view with pop-up graphics offering facts about the proceedings. Actors Marlon Wayans and Olivia Culpo will curate the program.\n“We’ve never really focused on an alternate viewing experience,” said Alison Tarrant , executive vice president of client partnerships at NBCUniversal, in an interview. “This is a big step for this broadcast.” The live stream will be available on Verizon’s YouTube page, http://www.youtube.com/verizon .\nThe new means of watching an old TV institution arrives as Madison Avenue is seeking different ways to partner with the industry overall. While traditional TV commercials thrive, marketers are placing new emphasis on devising content that dovetails with the programming that attracted viewers in the first place, rather than interrupting a show with messages routinely viewed as something of an annoyance. The emerging model is sprouting in various places, as anyone who has seen NBC late-night host Seth Meyers do on-set commercials for Amazon or watched Taco Bell sponsor an ongoing series of vignettes from “Fear the Walking Dead” in ad breaks on AMC can tell you.\n“This partnership enables us to create content together that we would not have been able to do on our own,” said Tarrant.\nBut there are other benefits as well. The YouTube stream might appeal to people on the go for the holiday who must rely on a mobile device to get a view of the annual parade. Or it might serve as a sort of “second-screen” enhancer for viewers already at home watching the event through traditional means.\nNBCUniversal will promote the digital stream in live mentions on several of its programs, through social-media posts and with ads that appear on the company’s various TV networks.\nFinancial terms of the arrangement could not be learned. Zenith, one of the media-buying units of Publicis Media, helped put the deal together for Verizon.\nRelated stories\nTV Ratings: NBC's 'Thursday Night Football' Kicks Off Unsteady\n'The Night Shift' Renewed for Season 4 at NBC\nTV News Roundup: Chris Meloni Cast in Syfy Pilot, LeBron Game Show Gets Premiere Date\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "0 Tracfone - Verizon VoLTE / HDVoice? Now that Verizon allowed VoLTE on their prepaid customers, does anyone knows how long will be till Tracfone will get the same? I am asking this considering that Verizon announced that plans to shutoff their 2G/CDMA network in Dec 2019. PS: I have two devices that are VoLTE capable (BYOP) on TotalWireless (Tracfone). I have a blue tooth Join Date 0 We have not heard anything and I wonder if TracFone even knows that answer. They will have to start notifying people who don't have VoLTE capable phones way in advance and Verizon could push the date out into the future. My screen is bigger than yours Join Date I have a blue tooth Join Date Feedback Score 0 One solution for people with Google Voice will be to use Hangouts Dialer via mobile data on their non-VoLTE phones for voice calling. Seems like that should work since it works now. I've climbed a cellphone tower Join Date 0 Originally Posted by SoNic67 Now that Verizon allowed VoLTE on their prepaid customers, does anyone knows how long will be till Tracfone will get the same? One Verizon MVNO has suggested they could have VOLTE by the end of the year, so if that's accurate, it's possible others might also. I've got more phones than fingers Join Date http://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2016...ouncement.html This change will be huge compared to the AT&T 2G shutdown. Not just a small number of very old phones, but everything presently offered by Tracfone and a large number of BYOP phones as well. Bad news for anybody that has to use Verizon service including many of their own customers. Will be interesting to see how Verizon handles upgrading their own, and when they release VoLTE to the MVNO providers. I have a blue tooth Join Date Feedback Score 0 They could make the transition less painful by providing people with an app like Hangouts Dialer to be able to make calls using mobile data - and maybe giving a extra data allocation to those affected. I don't seem them subsidizing the cost of replacing phones that are not VoLTE compliant. Fortunately, at 1MB/minute and about $0.01 per MB, calling using data won't break the bank for most who can use can use an app like Hangouts Dialer. So if I'm using Hangouts Dialer with 4G LTE data, is that the same as VoLTE? And using Hangouts over WiFi would be VoIP. Is that the correct terminology?

      "text": "Hey, kids! Verizon's got a tablet just for you Hey, kids! Verizon's got a tablet just for you The GizmoTab is what a tablet would be like if everything was turned into a game. Hey, kids! Verizon's got a tablet just for you 0 \nThe GizmoTab home screen is a series of islands instead of rows of apps. Photo by Photo by Alfred Ng/CNET \nAt first glance, it looks like a game. But it's actually the home screen of a kids' tablet. \nInstead of rows of app icons, Verizon 's new GizmoTab has kids navigating applications by putting them in different themed islands. Children can go to Doodle Town to get the Crayola Color, Draw & Sing app or Safari Island for Nat Geo Puzzle Explorer. \nVerizon unveiled the interface, along with 300 preloaded kid-friendly apps, on its latest children's tablet on Thursday. It's a part of the carrier's Gizmo lineup, which includes smartwatches for children that come with monitoring tools for parents. The telecommunications giant started working on the GizmoTab immediately after its Ellipsis Kids tablet, released last November. \nThe tablet for rugrats is available for $80 with a Verizon data plan, and $250 on its own. \nTech for kids continue to be a growing market, as parents search for inexpensive ways to give their children gadgets without having to worry about the devices being misused . \nAs the designated child among the CNET staff, I decided to dive into the digital ball pit and explore the tyke apps on the Android device. Verizon GizmoTab is a kids' tablet with a twist on the home screen The GizmoTab is what a tablet would be like if everything was turned into a game. by Alfred Ng Close Drag \nThe tablet boots up into the playful map interface, which functions more like a game than an operating system. You control it all through an avatar that has the feel of a Sims character. The map shows eight islands, each with a different theme for apps. \nIt's what a tablet experience would feel like if everything was turned into a game. Your child's character has to go to the school in a 3D town to get to educational apps and books, or warp over to the arcade to play minigames. \nParents can adjust settings so that kids have to learn to earn playtime, with GizmoTab tracking how much time is spent on educational apps versus games. You can also limit how much tablet time each kid gets. \n\"Parents are just constantly trying to manage screen time,\" said Kimberly Verbonitz, the chief revenue officer from app maker Fingerprint. \nVerizon partnered with Fingerprint to curate its kids apps, which were approved by education and parenting experts. With Verizon's first kids' tablet , parents were left in the dark about what apps were appropriate to download for their child, the company noted on its feedback. \nFingerprint selected its apps based on three criteria, Verbonitz said: its educational value, engaging gameplay and storytelling. \nThe children's experience is pretty limited, though. You can either play or learn -- that's it. There's no web browsing or YouTube , so your kids are stuck in the world Verizon created. It means not having to worry about your child racking up charges on your bill with in-app purchases, but it makes it harder to keep the kids entertained, even with hundreds of apps. \nTo break free, you'll have to go into parent mode, which is protected by a PIN. You can download apps from the Google Play store there and put them on the kid-friendly map through the feature. \nYou can also turn the GizmoTab into a fully functional tablet, with 3GB RAM running on Android Marshmallow. The feature comes in handy for the day your tyke outgrows the kiddy apps and wants to take off the tablet training wheels. Share your voice",

      "text": "Google Pixel Sales 'Strong' At Verizon; Delays Till January? (Investor's Business Daily) \nWatch out Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), there may be a serious smartphone competitor in town. New data suggest Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )'s new Pixel smartphone was the real winner on both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. \nA research report from Localytics analyzed both Android and Apple device activations since Thanksgiving. During this time, Google’s Pixel experienced a 112 percent growth of new device activations. \nThese figures are a bit misleading, however, due to the short duration the Pixel has been available for sale. It went on sale in October . In comparison, Samsung 's Galaxy S7 had a 36 percent increase in activations, while the iPhone 7 had just 13 percent growth. \n“The Pixel is a very impressive device. While already receiving critical praise, the Pixel models are also beginning to meet analyst’s sales expectations, which is very good news for Google,” said Localytics. \nApple had a much stronger 2015 when it came to activations around the same period, with a 36 percent increase in iPhone 6S activations during Thanksgiving of last year. \nIt looks like the battle everyone is anticipating in the smartphone space, Google vs. Apple, will soon heat up. This is likely just the beginning. \nImage Credit: By Maurizio Pesce from Milan, Italia [CC BY 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons © 2016 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nWe've seen a few tablets designed specifically for children, though \"designed\" can sometimes be a bit of stretch. Nabi's hardware is kid-focused from the ground up, but Amazon and Samsung (two of the biggest tablet makers on the planet, by volume) just add a software skin and an impact-absorbing case to an existing product. In that context, Verizon's newly-announced GizmoTab is an interesting offering: not only is it one of the rare tablet designs meant uniquely for children, it also has surprisingly solid hardware underneath all that padding. \nThe idea behind all of this is that it's a tablet that works well for children aged 3 to 8, but which can also function as a standard \"grown-up\" tablet once kids get past that range. The GizmoTab uses a Snapdragon 617 processor, 3GB of RAM, 16 gigs of storage plus a MicroSD card slot, 8MP and 5MP cameras on the rear and front respectively, and a 5100mAh battery. The screen is a mid-sized 8 inches with a respectable 1920x1200 resolution, and it's running Android 6.0.1 underneath the kid-friendly skin. All that will cost you $79.99 on a two-year contract, $250 outright, or a little over $10 a month - not bad at all, considering the current market. \nIn addition to the padded teal body, the software enables both kid-centric tasks and parental management and tracking, including usage statistics and cutting off access to specific apps. (I'd start with the camera.) Education-focused games like Crayola Color, Draw, and Sing and Nat Geo Puzzle Explorer are among the 300 \"premium apps\" Verizon has designated as family-friendly. The $35 Kid's Case, a full plastic hard case with a built-in handle/kickstand and oversized stylus, comes in a variety of colors. All in all, it looks like a surprisingly cohesive bit of design, especially for a carrier exclusive. \nThere's just one thing that I don't like: there's no indication of who is building the GizmoTab for Verizon. I'd guess it's the same whitebox supplier that makes the company's exclusive Ellipsis hardware . The tablet is on sale starting today on the web and Verizon retail stores. Source:",

      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nRegulator warns practice of excluding certain services from data charges could harm competition, consumers\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s (T) practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ).\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. (NFLX) or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), 21st Century (FOX) and Time Warner Inc. (TWX).\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/fcc-raises-fresh-concerns-over-zero-rating-by-at-t-verizon-1480695463?mod=mktw)\nPopular on WSJ.com:\nCarrier will receive $7 million in tax breaks to keep jobs in Indiana (http://www.wsj.com/articles/indiana-gives-7-million-in-tax-breaks-to-keep-carrier-jobs-1480608461?mod=trending_now_1)\nHoward Schultz stepping down as Starbucks CEO to focus on higher-end shops (http://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-to-step-down-as-starbucks-ceo-1480626061?mod=trending_now_2)\nOpinion: Democrats send their regrets (http://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-send-their-regrets-1480638965?mod=trending_now_3)\n-Thomas Gryta;\n 1313ET\n ",

      "text": " Hey, kids! Verizon's got a tablet just for you CNET 5 hrs ago Alfred Ng © Provided by CNET The GizmoTab homescreen is a series of islands instead of a row of apps.\nAt first glance, it looks like a game. But it's actually the home screen of a kids' tablet.\nInstead of rows of app icons, Verizon's new GizmoTab has kids navigating applications by putting them in themed islands. Children can go to Doodle Town to get the Crayola Color, Draw & Sing app or Safari Island for Nat Geo Puzzle Explorer.\nVerizon unveiled the interface, along with 300 preloaded kid-friendly apps, on its latest children's tablet on Thursday. It's a part of the carrier's Gizmo lineup, which includes smartwatches for children that come with monitoring tools for parents. The telecommunications giant started working on the GizmoTab immediately after its Ellipsis Kids tablet, released last November.\nThe tablet for rugrats is available for $80 with a Verizon data plan, and $250 on its own.\nTech for kids is a thriving market, as parents search for inexpensive ways to give their children gadgets without having to worry about the devices being misused .\nAs the designated child among the CNET staff, I decided to dive into the digital ball pit and explore the tyke apps on the Android device.\nThe tablet boots up into the playful map interface, which functions more like a game than an operating system. You control it all through an avatar that has the feel of a Sims character. The map shows eight islands, each with a different theme for apps.\nIt's what a tablet experience would feel like if everything was turned into a game. Your child's character has to go to the school in a 3D town to get to educational apps and books, or warp over to the arcade to play minigames.\nParents can adjust settings so that kids have to learn to earn playtime, with GizmoTab tracking how much time is spent on educational apps versus games. You can also limit how much tablet time each kid gets.\n\"Parents are just constantly trying to manage screen time,\" said Kimberly Verbonitz, the chief revenue officer for app maker Fingerprint.\nVerizon partnered with Fingerprint to curate its kids apps, which were approved by education and parenting experts. With Ellipsis, Verizon's first kids' tablet , parents were left in the dark about what apps were appropriate to download for their child, the company noted on its feedback.\nFingerprint selected its apps based on three criteria, Verbonitz said: its educational value, engaging gameplay and storytelling.\n\"Kids are like little scientists. They like to explore and discover and play,\" she said. \"They learn best when they don't really know that they're learning.\"\nThe children's experience is pretty limited, though. You can either play or learn -- that's it. There's no web browsing or YouTube unless parents add it in, so your kids are stuck in the game world without an adult around. It means not having to worry about your child racking up charges on your bill with in-app purchases, but it makes it harder for kids to keep themselves entertained, even with hundreds of apps.\nTo break free, you'll have to go into parent mode, which is protected by a PIN. You can download apps from the Google Play store there and put them on the kid-friendly map through the feature.\nYou can also turn the GizmoTab into a fully functional tablet, with 3GB RAM running on Android Marshmallow. The feature comes in handy for the day your tyke outgrows the kiddy apps and wants to take off the tablet training wheels.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Verizon to Sell Data Centers to Equinix for $3.6 Billion (2) Scott Moritz and Alex Sherman Dec 06, 2016 11:05 am ET (Bloomberg) -- Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to sell its data-centers business to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion in cash as the company turns its focus to mobile video advertising. The deal includes 24 facilities across 15 metropolitan markets, according to a statement Tuesday. Equinix, based in Redwood City, California, operates as a real estate investment trust, mostly holding interconnected data centers. With the deal, Equinix now has 175 data centers in 43 markets around the world. For Verizon, the nation’s largest wireless carrier, the deal marks an exit from the data-hosting and cloud-services business five years after it bought Terremark Worldwide Inc. for $1.3 billion. As prospects faded and Verizon invested in more areas like mobile video and advertising, the company decided to put the data-centers unit up for sale about two years ago. As the telecommunications industry matures, Verizon is shedding assets and turning the business in a new direction. Using go90, its video-streaming business, AOL’s web properties and the pending purchase of Yahoo! Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook Inc. The sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon’s cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction. Shares of Verizon rose less than 1 percent to $50.09 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. Equinix climbed 1.3 percent to $336.54. Verizon’s advisers were Citigroup Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Equinix was advised by Evercore Partners Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. (Updates with shares trading, chart.) ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

As prospects faded and Verizon invested in more areas like mobile video and advertising, the company decided to put the data-centers unit up for sale about two years ago. As the telecommunications industry matures, Verizon is shedding assets and turning the business in a new direction. Using go90, its video-streaming business, AOL’s web properties and the pending purchase of Yahoo! Inc., Verizon is entering a mobile video and advertising arena to challenge Google and Facebook Inc. The sale to Equinix, which is expected to close in the middle of next year, would help replenish Verizon’s cash after it acquires Yahoo for $4.83 billion and bids for coveted airwaves in a federal auction. Shares of Verizon rose less than 1 percent to $50.09 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. Equinix climbed 1.3 percent to $336.54. Verizon’s advisers were Citigroup Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, with Jones Day providing legal counsel. Equinix was advised by Evercore Partners Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP. (Updates with shares trading, chart.) ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

NumberSync ended up being well-received by subscribers following its release, and T-Mobile went silent for more than a year.\nNow, 14 months later, T-Mobile has finally unveiled \"Digits,\" the carrier's response to AT&T's NumberSync solution.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nApple responds to claims that multiple older iPhones have gone up in flames 10 great iOS 10 widgets that should be on every iPhone Trump might move iPhone manufacturing to America after all ",

      "text": "While AT&T ( T ) is going big with its planned purchase of Time Warner ( TWX ) for nearly $109 billion, including debt, Verizon ( VZ ) Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam says that the telecom is learning towards \"snackable\" content that appeals to millennials on its Go90 streaming service.\nMcAdam compared Verizon's \"patient money\" strategy in mobile video to Netflix 's ( NFLX ) transition from a DVD-by-mail shop to a global power in streaming on Tuesday. \"If you look at, for example, how long it took Netflix to really ramp up and hit their stride, that's sort of a model for us,\" McAdam said at the UBS telecom, media and technology conference in New York on Tuesday.\nNetflix launched its streaming service in 2007 and it wasn't until 2010 that the business surpassed DVD rentals. It has taken years of trial, and some error, for Reed Hasting's streaming company to build a base of 75 million members in 190 countries that watch 125 million hours of shows and other video each day. And while some of Netflix's maneuvers may not apply to Verizon, Hasting's investments in content and integration with other pay-TV systems may prove useful guides for McAdam.\n\"The first part of that strategy was to get the Netflix app on consumer electronics,\" Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi said.\nNetflix struck up partnerships to get into Microsoft 's ( MSFT ) Xbox 360 and set-top boxes 2008. Deals with Sony ( SNE ) to get onto the Playstation PS3 and smart TV makers followed in 2009, and the following year Netflix's app appeared on Apple 's ( AAPL ) iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch and Nintendo 's ( NTDOY ) Wii.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .
