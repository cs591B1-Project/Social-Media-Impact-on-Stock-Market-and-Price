      "text": "American automaker Ford has announced recall of around 6,80,000 units of the midsized sedans mainly from North America. The company has raised concerns over front seat belts failing to hold people in event of a crash. The recall list includes - Ford Fusion manufactured between 2013 to 2016, Lincoln MKZ manufactured between 2013 to 2015 and Mondeo cars which were produced between 2015 to 2016.\nBased in issue identified, Ford believes that the heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners are deployed can cause the cables to break. This might result in belt being incapable to hold people and the company has reported two injuries related to the problem. Ford has stated that most of the affected vehicles are from US, Canada and Mexico.\nOn sensing that the cars are stopping, the pre-tensioners tighten the seat belts as required. Dealers will soon contact owners of the affected vehicles and the recall is slated to begin from January 16, 2017. Repairs will be done free of cost wherein the dealers will inject insulation into pre-tensioners to protect the cables from the heat.",

      "text": "Ford is willing to work with Donald Trump to keep jobs in the U.S. if the president-elect puts the right policies in place, the automaker's chief executive officer said.\n\"We will be very clear in the things we'd like to see,\" Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Mich. \"We'll continue to advocate for currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade. One of our priorities is making sure fuel-economy standards reflect market realities, tax reform in general we would be very supportive of, and the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Ford was a favorite target of Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border.\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS Ford tried to make peace last month when Executive Chairman Bill Ford called the president-elect to let him know the automaker no longer planned to move production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Kentucky.\nFord still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory, but the automaker has said it believes it can work with the new president to encourage economic growth in the U.S.\nDuring his campaign, Trump threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He made a similar threat against Carrier after the unit of United Technologies Corp. said it was moving production to Mexico and cutting 1,400 jobs in Indiana.\nInstead, Trump and Carrier unveiled a deal Thursday in which the maker of furnaces and air-conditioners will get $7 million in state incentives to keep the work in Indiana. About 1,100 Carrier employees in the Indianapolis area will still lose their jobs despite the agreement.\nFord received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, but the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1.\nFord already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It's building a $1.6 billion new small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020.\nFord has said it is just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it's the top automotive manufacturer in the U.S. Ford said it has added nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. over the last five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the U.S. and 8,800 in Mexico.\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, have announced investments of more than $24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S.\nAnnual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nFields has undertaken an expensive effort to transform Ford into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies and Google.\nThe cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis — without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — on the road in five years.\nIt's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco.\nThe second-largest U.S. automaker has cut profit forecasts twice in the last three months. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million, to $10.2 billion from at least $10.8 billion, due to rising recall costs.\nLast month, it trimmed the 2017 profit outlook for its credit unit by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, because declining auction values for used cars would hurt results. Ford shares fell 12 percent this year through Thursday.",

      "text": "December 3, 2016 — American / Project / Under $20k | 4 Comments First Year 292 Driver: 1957 Ford Ranchero \nThis 1957 Ford Ranchero is a running, drivable car from the first year of production. Power comes from a 292ci Y-block V8 backed by an automatic transmission, and the seller notes fitment of new brakes, tires, fuel tank, and sending unit, and cosmetics look fine for now. Ultimately, a stock restoration would be ideal, but there’s little that would stop one from enjoying it in the meantime. Find it here on Jalopy Journal in Warren, Michigan for $6k. \nIntroduced in 1957 and described as “More Than A Car! More Than A Truck!”, the Ranchero was built on a car assembly line but sold as a oick-up. Appearing mostly straight and quite complete, there may be some rust in the body’s lower areas, though the seller claims that overall the vehicle is very solid. Chrome and stainless look very decent. \nFrom the rear things look good apart from a slightly wavy rear bumper and missing longhorn emblem on the tailgate. Canted fins and rocket-style taillights are neat, while minimal side trim lets styling speak for itself. Photos show a bed that’s clearly been used, and while it could be cleaned up, a tonneau cover wouldn’t look out of place either. Note the ’59 Caddy in the garage. \nThe interior, said to be decent, appears complete and reasonably sanitary, though some work will need to be done with the 80’s style velour covered seat and door panels, cracked wheel and tattered seals around the doors. Thankfully all lights are said to work, the headliner looks nice, and the radio comes on, though heat isn’t hooked up–the blower motor does work however. \nWhile everything under the reverse-opening hood looks pretty crusty with surface corrosion, it also appears to be quite complete. Though no details are provided for the 292ci V8, beyond that it runs of course. There’s a decent selection of speed parts available for these engines, and more power could be on the table without the need for a swap. New brakes (though clearly not the master cylinder) and power steering should make getting down the road easier. Related Stories",

      "text": "Ford executives say that their plan to shift production of small cars, like the Focus, to a new plant in Mexico will go on as planned, while acknowledging that their earlier decision not to move production of a different car from Kentucky to Mexico was influenced by President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe announcement came a day after Carrier Corp. – like Ford, a frequent target for Mr. Trump on the campaign trail – said it would keep open a furnace plant in Indiana, sparing about 800 employees’ jobs, in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks.\nIn the case of Ford, neither decision would have any effect on the jobs of US workers, CEO Mark Fields told the Wall Street Journal on Friday .\nRecommended: How much do you know about the auto industry's future? “This isn’t a Carrier situation,” said Mr. Fields. “When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that’s to make room for new products – zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.”\nTest your knowledge How much do you know about the auto industry's future? Photos of the Day Photos of the weekend In November, the president-elect took credit for persuading Ford not to relocate the Louisville, Ky., plant to Mexico. In fact, the plant had only planned to relocate production of a Lincoln SUV – not the jobs of the people who made it – since the terms of a 2015 agreement with the United Auto Workers Union prohibited it from doing so without further negotiations with the union.\nBut Mr. Fields also said that Trump had “ influenced ” Ford's decision to keep Lincoln SUV production in the US, applauding what he called favorable proposals from the president-elect on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nThat may illuminate a key strategy for Trump’s brand of conservative populism: strike a hard rhetorical line on corporations while dangling a carrot of tax breaks and other favorable terms. And in the short term, at least, manufacturing execs may seek to cozy up to the new administration to spare their bottom line – and possibly reap the public-relations benefits.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of the automaker’s founder, penned a congratulatory letter to Trump after the elections, and even called him to say that the company wouldn’t shift Lincoln production to Mexico, according to the Journal.\nBut it’s unclear whether these early gestures might provide a model of personalized exemptions from Trump’s promise to impose big, industry-wide tariffs on vehicles and other goods imported from Mexico and China.\nThat possibility awakened concern from an unexpected corner on Friday, when former Alaska governor Sarah Palin warned in an op-ed for website The Young Conservatives that despite her approval of the Carrier deal, “political intrusion using a stick or carrot to bribe or force one individual business to do what politicians insist … isn’t the answer.”\n“When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent,” she wrote.\n“Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.”\nFields warned that Trump’s tariff proposals would have a “negative impact” on the US as well as in Mexico and Canada, Bloomberg reported , pointing to the deep integration of production and supply chains across the three countries.\n“It would be imposed on the entire industry, not just singling out a single company,” he said.\nOther Ford execs struck a confident tone about the new administration’s policies.\n\"I think governing and the campaign are two different things,\" Ford's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks, told the Free Press . \"I am hopeful and optimistic that this change in tone will carry forward into policies that … will be quite different than the prior administration but will be positive for growth.\"",

      "title": "Ford willing to work with Trump if policies are right",
      "text": "Ford CEO Mark Fields talks about the company's autonomous vehicle program at Ford's Product Development Center in Dearborn, September 12, 2016. (Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News file photo) \nFord Motor Co. was a target of Donald Trump’s criticism on the campaign trail for building cars in Mexico, and now that Trump will be president, Ford said it’s willing to work with him to keep jobs in the U.S. — provided Trump puts the right policies in place, according to the automaker’s chief executive officer.\n“We will be very clear in the things we’d like to see,”Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview Friday at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan.\nAmong them, according to Fields: currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade, tax reform and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles.\nFields said Ford plans to lobby the new president to soften U.S. and state fuel-economy rules. They hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand, he said.\n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the U.S. market and it represented 2.3 percent of the industry,” Fields said in the interview. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 percent.”\nNo Market \nThis isn’t exactly a formula for success, he said. “At the end of the day, you’ve got to have customers, so obviously there would be pressure on the business if there’s not a market,” he said.\nThe No. 2 U.S. carmaker was one of the companies that Trump singled out on the campaign trail for sending production to Mexico. The Republican threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on cars that Ford builds south of the border and ships back to the U.S.\nAfter the Nov. 8 election, Trump phoned Executive Chairman Bill Ford to discuss the carmaker’s plan to move manufacturing of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Louisville, Kentucky, Fields said. The discussion helped convince Ford to keep building the Lincoln in the U.S.\nTrump influenced the decision “because of what he’s talking about in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise,” Fields said.\nNo Incentives \nFord received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, though the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12 to 1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It’s building a new $1.6 billion small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020.\nFord still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory.\nTrump also criticized the Carrier unit of United Technologies Corp. after the company said it would move production to Mexico, cutting 1,400 jobs in Indiana. Trump and Carrier unveiled a deal Thursday in which the maker of furnaces and air-conditioners will get $7 million in state incentives to keep the work in Indiana. Despite the agreement, about 1,100 Carrier employees in the Indianapolis area will lose their jobs.\nFields said the automaker’s situation is different than Carrier’s. The small cars Ford is moving out of the Michigan factory are being replaced by two other models “and not one job is being displaced,” Fields said.\nDifferent Than Carrier \n“Our position is very different than the Carrier position,” Fields said. He added that he didn’t know whether Trump would carry through with his campaign pledge to impose the tariff on Ford’s Mexican-built cars, but he said he doubted it would be applied to just one company.\n“It would be imposed on the entire industry, not just singling out a single company,” Fields said. “When you look at the production and supply chains and how they’re integrated between the three countries” — Mexico, Canada and the U.S. — “putting a tariff on that would have a negative impact on all the economies.”\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including General Motors Co., Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced investments of more than $24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Annual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nMore U.S. Jobs \nFord has said it’s just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it’s the top automotive manufacturer in the U.S. The company said it’s added nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. over the last five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the U.S. and 8,800 in Mexico.\nThe day after the election, General Motors announced it would end the third shift at assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan in January. The automaker is eliminating almost 2,100 jobs because consumers prefer trucks and sport utility vehicles over the small cars built at the two factories.\nFields said Ford would now continue its dialogue with Trump. The auto industry may seek clean-air credits for self-driving cars, which could reduce fuel consumption and emissions by helping traffic move more smoothly.\nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Fields said Ford has made no change in its plan to invest an additional $4.5 billion in electrified vehicles by 2020, and to install this technology in 40 percent of its nameplates.\nClimate Change \nFord wants to continue to help boost fuel economy and lessen the industry’s environmental impact, because the company acknowledges climate change as a serious threat, Fields said.\nBy 2035, the growth in electric vehicles could erode as much as 10 percent of global gasoline demand,Alan Gelder, vice president of refining, chemicals and oils markets at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd., said in an interview.\nThe automaker has cut profit forecasts twice in the last three months. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million, to $10.2 billion from at least $10.8 billion, due to rising recall costs. Last month, it trimmed the 2017 profit outlook for its credit unit by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, because declining auction values for used cars would hurt results.\nFord shares have gained 6.6 percent since Trump’s election.\nWith assistance from Mark Niquette Richard Clough and Kevin Cirilli \nTo contact the reporters on this story: Keith Naughton in Southfield, Michigan at knaughton3@bloomberg.net, John Lippert in Chicago at jlippert@bloomberg.net, Jamie Butters in Southfield, Michigan, at jbutters@bloomberg.net.",

      "text": "Ford executives say that their plan to shift production of small cars, like the Focus, to a new plant in Mexico will go on as planned, while acknowledging that their earlier decision not to move production of a different car from Kentucky to Mexico was influenced by President-elect Donald Trump.\nThe announcement came a day after Carrier Corp. – like Ford, a frequent target for Mr. Trump on the campaign trail – said it would keep open a furnace plant in Indiana, sparing about 800 employees’ jobs, in exchange for $7 million in tax breaks.\nIn the case of Ford, neither decision would have any effect on the jobs of US workers, CEO Mark Fields told the Wall Street Journal on Friday .\nRecommended: How much do you know about the auto industry's future? “This isn’t a Carrier situation,” said Mr. Fields. “When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that’s to make room for new products – zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.”\nTest your knowledge How much do you know about the auto industry's future? weekend In November, the president-elect took credit for persuading Ford not to relocate the Louisville, Ky., plant to Mexico. In fact, the plant had only planned to relocate production of a Lincoln SUV – not the jobs of the people who made it – since the terms of a 2015 agreement with the United Auto Workers Union prohibited it from doing so without further negotiations with the union.\nBut Mr. Fields also said that Trump had “ influenced ” Ford's decision to keep Lincoln SUV production in the US, applauding what he called favorable proposals from the president-elect on tax reform and infrastructure spending.\nThat may illuminate a key strategy for Trump’s brand of conservative populism: strike a hard rhetorical line on corporations while dangling a carrot of tax breaks and other favorable terms. And in the short term, at least, manufacturing execs may seek to cozy up to the new administration to spare their bottom line – and possibly reap the public-relations benefits.\nBill Ford, great-grandson of the automaker’s founder, penned a congratulatory letter to Trump after the elections, and even called him to say that the company wouldn’t shift Lincoln production to Mexico, according to the Journal.\nBut it’s unclear whether these early gestures might provide a model of personalized exemptions from Trump’s promise to impose big, industry-wide tariffs on vehicles and other goods imported from Mexico and China.\nThat possibility awakened concern from an unexpected corner on Friday, when former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin warned in an op-ed for website The Young Conservatives that despite her approval of the Carrier deal, “political intrusion using a stick or carrot to bribe or force one individual business to do what politicians insist … isn’t the answer.”\n“When government steps in arbitrarily with individual subsidies, favoring one business over others, it sets inconsistent, unfair, illogical precedent,” she wrote.\n“Republicans oppose this, remember? Instead, we support competition on a level playing field, remember? Because we know special interest crony capitalism is one big fail.”\nFields warned that Trump’s tariff proposals would have a “negative impact” on the US as well as in Mexico and Canada, Bloomberg reported , pointing to the deep integration of production and supply chains across the three countries.\n“It would be imposed on the entire industry, not just singling out a single company,” he said.\nOther Ford execs struck a confident tone about the new administration’s policies.\n\"I think governing and the campaign are two different things,\" Ford's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks, told the Free Press . \"I am hopeful and optimistic that this change in tone will carry forward into policies that … will be quite different than the prior administration but will be positive for growth.\"",

Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. ",

      "text": "Southfield, Michigan; Chicago: Ford Motor Co was a target of Donald Trump’s criticism on the campaign trail for building cars in Mexico, and now that Trump will be president, Ford said it’s willing to work with him to keep jobs in the US — provided Trump puts the right policies in place, according to the automaker’s chief executive officer.\n“We will be very clear in the things we’d like to see,” Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview Friday at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan.\nAmong them, according to Fields: currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade, tax reform and safety guidelines for autonomous vehicles.\nFields said that Ford plans to lobby the new president to soften US and state fuel-economy rules. They hurt profits by forcing automakers to build more electric cars and hybrids than are warranted by customer demand, he said.\n“In 2008, there were 12 electrified vehicles offered in the US market and it represented 2.3 per cent of the industry,” Fields said in the interview. “Fast forward to 2016, there’s 55 models, and year to date it’s 2.8 per cent.” \nNo market\nThis isn’t exactly a formula for success, he said. “At the end of the day, you’ve got to have customers, so obviously, there would be pressure on the business if there’s not a market,” he said.\nThe No. 2 US carmaker was one of the companies Trump singled out on the campaign trail for sending production to Mexico. The Republican threatened to slap a 35 per cent tariff on cars Ford builds south of the border and ships back to the US.\nAfter the November 8 election, Trump phoned Executive Chairman Bill Ford to discuss the carmaker’s plan to move manufacture of the Lincoln MKC sport utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Louisville, Kentucky, Fields said. The discussion helped convince Ford to keep building the Lincoln in the US.\nTrump influenced the decision “because of what he’s talking about in terms of his economic policies, whether it’s tax reform or otherwise,” Fields said.\nFord received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, but the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It’s building a $1.6 billion (Dh5.9 billion) new small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020.\nFord still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory.\nCarrier deal\nTrump also criticised the Carrier unit of United Technologies Corp after the company said it would move production to Mexico, cutting 1,400 jobs in Indiana. Trump and Carrier unveiled a deal Thursday in which the maker of furnaces and air-conditioners will get $7 million in state incentives to keep the work in Indiana. Despite the agreement, about 1,100 Carrier employees in the Indianapolis area will lose their jobs.\nFields said the automaker’s situation is different than Carrier’s. The small cars Ford is moving out of the Michigan factory are being replaced by two other models “and not one job is being displaced,” Fields said.\n“Our position is very different than the Carrier position,” Fields said. He added that he didn’t know whether Trump would carry through with his campaign pledge to impose the tariff on Ford’s Mexican-built cars, but he said he doubted it would be applied to just one company.\n“It would be imposed on the entire industry, not just singling out a single company,” Fields said. “When you look at the production and supply chains and how they’re integrated between the three countries” — Mexico, Canada and the US — “putting a tariff on that would have a negative impact on all the economies.”\nMexico investments:\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including General Motors Co, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, have announced investments of more than $24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 per cent lower than in the US Annual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nFord has said it’s just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it’s the top automotive manufacturer in the US. The company said it’s added nearly 28,000 jobs in the US over the last five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the US and 8,800 in Mexico.\nThe day after the election, General Motors announced it would end the third shift at assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan in January. The automaker is eliminating almost 2,100 jobs because consumers prefer trucks and sport utility vehicles over the small cars built at the two factories.\nTrump dialogue\nFields said Ford would now continue its dialogue with Trump. The auto industry may seek clean-air credits for self-driving cars, which could reduce fuel consumption and emissions by helping traffic move more smoothly.\nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Fields said Ford has made no change in its plan to invest an additional $4.5 billion in electrified vehicles by 2020, and to install this technology in 40 per cent of its nameplates.\nFord wants to continue to help boost fuel economy and lessen the industry’s environmental impact, because the company acknowledges climate change as a serious threat, Fields said.\nThe automaker has cut profit forecasts twice in the last three months. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million, to $10.2 billion from at least $10.8 billion, due to rising recall costs. Last month, it trimmed the 2017 profit outlook for its credit unit by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, because declining auction values for used cars would hurt results.\nFord shares have gained 6.6 per cent since Trump’s election.",

      "text": "Westworld: Ford's New Narrative Revealed Amy Awesome Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nSince the very first episode of Westworld , Dr. Robert Ford, the founder of the park and the man behind the madness, has been secretly creating a new narrative that is sure to blow everyones mind. \nHe was using up so many resources, and moving most of the Delos staff over to his new project that the rest of the parks operations started to suffer. Host's were falling out of their comfortable little loops and Westworld went completely downhill. \nSo far that the board sent Theresa and then Charlotte to oversee operations and try to figure out what exactly Ford was up to. \nHowever, neither of these corporate spies made it very far while trying to uncover the truth, only that Ford was unearthing a huge part of the park to house his new \"realistic and original\" narrative. \nIn the Westworld season finale, Ford and The Man In Black meet again in Escalante, where Ford is throwing a celebration for his new narrative that he tells The Man In Black he would enjoy. \nFord unconvered and revived the town of Escalante for a reason. \nA romantic scene plays out with Teddy and Dolores. They reach where the land meets the see as she dies in the pale moonlight in Teddy's arms as he tells her, \"Maybe that's it Dolores, maybe this is just the beginning. \" They both agree that there is a new world out there... \nThe crowd claps and Ford takes the stage introducting his new narrative as \"Journey Into The Night.\" \nIs this a tease for other worlds? Maybe Roman World or Medieval Land? \nSomething else is up Ford's sleeve for sure... \nBack at the celebration gala, Ford addresses the crowd once more, and talks about how important stories are...and that he wrote a new story that \" begins with a new people, and the people they decide to become. \" \nFord goes on to say that this will be his \"final story and he hopes they will enjoy this last piece very much.\" \nAs Dolores puts a bullet into the back of his brain...",

      "text": "Ford is willing to work with Donald Trump to keep jobs in the U.S. if the president-elect puts the right policies in place, the automaker's chief executive officer said.\n\"We will be very clear in the things we'd like to see,\" Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Michigan. \"We'll continue to advocate for currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade. One of our priorities is making sure fuel-economy standards reflect market realities, tax reform in general we would be very supportive of, and the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Ford was a favorite target of Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border. Ford tried to make peace last month when Executive Chairman Bill Ford called the president-elect to let him know the automaker no longer planned to move production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Kentucky. Ford still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory, but the automaker has said it believes it can work with the new president to encourage economic growth in the U.S.\nTrump warns of 'retribution' for companies that offshore jobs, threatens 35 percent tariff Ylan Q.

Mui) During his campaign, Trump threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He made a similar threat against Carrier after the unit of United Technologies Corp. said it was moving production to Mexico and cutting 1,400 jobs in Indiana. Instead, Trump and Carrier unveiled a deal Thursday in which the maker of furnaces and air-conditioners will get $7 million in state incentives to keep the work in Indiana. About 1,100 Carrier employees in the Indianapolis area will still lose their jobs despite the agreement.\nFord received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, but the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It's building a $1.6 billion new small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020.\nFord has said it is just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it's the top automotive manufacturer in the U.S. Ford said it has added nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. over the last five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the U.S. and 8,800 in Mexico.\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, have announced investments of more than $24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Annual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nTrump took credit for stopping Ford from moving plant to Mexico, but it wasn't planning to Jim Tankersley President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico.

The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis -- without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals -- on the road in five years. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco.\nThe second-largest U.S. automaker has cut profit forecasts twice in the last three months. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million, to $10.2 billion from at least $10.8 billion, due to rising recall costs. Last month, it trimmed the 2017 profit outlook for its credit unit by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, because declining auction values for used cars would hurt results. Ford shares fell 12 percent this year through Thursday.\n  Automotive Industry Ford Motor Co. Donald Trump The Lincoln Motor Company United Technologies Corporation",

      "title": "Finding a Rare 1969 Ford Drag Team Fairlane Cobra—and Race Memorabilia to Boot!",
      "text": "Email \nBob Perkins first heard about Ford’s 1969 Drag Team Fairlane Cobra, driven by Dick Wood for Ford’s West Coast team, 27 years ago. Perkins explains, “In 1989, Rick Radke was out in California buying a big literature collection. He went to Mark Hefty’s shop, and Mark had the big Cobra sign, dated 1964, that hung over the Shelby-American plant.” \nRadke lives near Perkins in Wisconsin. Radke wanted to know if Perkins wanted to “go halves” to buy the Cobra sign. He didn’t hesitate. Yes, this was the sign that actually hung over the historic Shelby-American plant in the 1960s. \nPerkins eventually bought out Radke’s half of the sign, which he kept until recently, when he traded the sign to his friend, Richard Ellis. “Ellis has the most famous 427 Cobra there is,” says Perkins. “It’s the only Comp Cobra they made in 1965. I’m thinking, I’ve got the sign that hung over the Shelby plant. That sign needs to be hanging over Ellis’ Cobra in his showroom.” \nEllis had something Perkins wanted. Through his own collector dealings, Ellis had come up with the same Ford Drag Team 1969 Fairlane Cobra that Radke saw in Hefty’s shop a quarter of a century earlier. \nThe Fairlane Cobra was apart for a restoration, but rust free. Incredibly, Perkins traded the sign he and Radke bought from Mark Hefty for the same historic Fairlane that Radke saw in Hefty’s shop, and which Hefty owned, in 1989. \nPerkins had a restoration job ahead of him, but that’s OK. He owns his own business restoring Mustangs, particularly of the Boss persuasion. Of course, he also likes other Ford muscle cars. \nPerkins didn’t stop with the acquisition of the car. He took a trip to California to meet with the family of Richard Wood, now deceased. There, he got numerous items of memorabilia to enhance the enjoyment and history of this very famous Fairlane (which is not a Torino). \nThe Ford Drag Team consisted of six cars: three on the West Coast team (drivers Dick Wood and Ed Terry) and three on the East Coast team (drivers Hubert Platt and Randy Payne). \nThere were two Mustangs on each team, a Super Cobra Jet and a Cammer. And then each team had a Ford Fairlane Cobra, powered by 428 Super Cobra Jets. \nWhat Perkins really liked about the Fairlane was the Ford Drag Team lettering on the side, which leaves no doubt to the factory heritage. Yes, other Fords had sponsorship and a factory lineage, such as the famous “dollar” drag cars. However, did Ford intend for the dollar price to transfer both ownership and liability to the team operating outside Ford? \nIn contrast, the four Mustangs and two Fairlanes were the Ford Drag Team. There was no external team. The factory was the team, with racing and other activities administered by “Car Corporation” directly for Ford Motor Company. Wood Family photo \nIn his driveway in Fremont, California, circa 1971, Dick Wood stripped the Ford Drag Team logo and paint scheme/stripes from the Fairlane. Ford had ended the drag program, and specified no logo be left when racing in private hands. Wood Family photo\nWood repainted his Fairlane Cobra blue. His son, Rick, built another 1969 Fairlane to drag race. The Ford hauler with the Dick Wood 1969 Fairlane Cobra and one of the Mustangs was an impressive sight, as seen in this old photo. With their truck and cars and uniforms, they won best-appearing team at the Winternationals in 1969. This vintage photo shows the Fairlane displayed at a car show. The sign proclaims the car a national record holder at 11.49/120.16. When the Ford Drag Team split up, Dick Wood gave his racing helmet to his son’s best friend. Perkins tracked down the friend and bought the helmet. “He said Dick Wood was like their hero. He used to take the kids to the boy’s club in the hauler truck with the Fairlane on the back.” Ford promoted its drag team with press kits. This kit came from the Wood family. They stapled four historic Richard Wood cards to the kit: two NHRA membership cards and two Ford Drag Team business cards. This jacket commemorated one of Richard Wood’s 1969 class wins. Perkins got the jacket from the Wood family. This the jacket Richard Wood wore from his local dragstrip back in the Ford Drag Team days. SEE ALL 18 PHOTOS FROM THE ARTICLE",

      "title": "The ‘Westworld’ finale revealed Ford's new narrative, teasing a chaotic season 2",
      "text": "Over the course of nine episodes, Westworld has seen itself compared to HBO's biggest sci-fi hit, Game of Thrones , when in reality, the show has assumed a more Lost -like intrigue over its first season. The internet was certainly on board, developing several fan theories, many of which — for better or worse — panned out ahead of the finale. But there were still plenty of questions for the series to answer in its finale.\nSo how did it do? Here's the six biggest reveals from Westworld's momentous 90-minute finale.\n( Editor's note: Spoilers for the Westworld season one finale ahead).\nWilliam finally wears the black hat. It was a foregone conclusion that William was actually the Man in Black during his first visit to the park, though the show did an excellent job once it made the actual reveal. As Dolores grapples with the Man in Black in the present, she tells him that he'll be in big trouble because William's going to rescue her (all these flashbacks haven't done her any good).\nTo the Man in Black's amusement, he retells William's journey to find Dolores after his brother-in-law, Logan, left her with a gruesome stab wound. Heading to the far reaches of Westworld in search for her, William eventually makes his way back to the park's center, Sweetwater, after ditching a naked Logan on horseback (no, really). In Sweetwater, he sees Dolores in the same narrative loop that he finds her at the start of his journey, picking up groceries and dropping a can of condensed milk. She stares at him, blankly; the memory of their brief romance wiped away completely.\nIt's a disturbing, yet cathartic moment for William, whose trip across the park has — by his own admission — revealed his true self. In the present, Dolores is shocked at what William's become, but his violent quest to learn about Westworld's game within the game, the mysterious maze, is ultimately a letdown from his perspective.\nDolores has had enough of your shit, William in Black Source: John P. Johnson/HBO The maze is literal. Several characters in Westworld iterated to the Man in Black that the maze wasn't for him: It was for the Hosts. It's also a literal maze with an underlying message of consciousness.\nThe center of the maze is buried at a grave site next to the mysterious church steeple, under a Dolores-marked tombstone. But the maze itself is a toy — a toy maze that belonged to Arnold's son (Bernard's backstory, then, is rooted in a very tragic reality). It served as Arnold's model for designing the Hosts consciousness. The Hosts would have missteps along the way, he theorized, but eventually they could reach the endgame — the \"center\" — in which they can develop their own consciousness and thoughts.\nWhile Arnold believed the Hosts could gain consciousness, it would take time. Unfortunately, he didn't have time to convince Ford that the Hosts shouldn't be used to cater to the violent whims of human beings. The park was to be opened — the Hosts would be trapped in hell. Arnold's last-ditch effort to save the Hosts, however, meant he had to get himself killed, leading to the \"Wyatt\" narrative.\nDolores is Wyatt. It felt more and more likely that Wyatt wasn't a new Host as the season progressed, because he was never seen on-screen outside of Teddy's flashbacks. Plus, his narrative echoed a disturbing past of the park that Dolores continuously revisited: Hosts being slaughtered, left and right, before Dolores pulled the trigger on herself.\nTurns out, the \"Wyatt narrative\" was implanted in Dolores by Arnold, who wanted to demonstrate to Ford and the Delos board that the park wasn't ready to open by having Dolores (and Teddy, her willing accomplice) slaughter all the Hosts before shooting Arnold in the head. Arnold, having lost his son, was willing to die in the process.\nIt obviously didn't work — ironically, because William was so awestruck by Westworld and Dolores that he became a majority holder of the park and saved it — but the Wyatt programming was clearly imbedded in Dolores, deep down, waiting to be awakened again. \"Do you understand who you will need to become if you ever want to leave this place?\" Ford tells Dolores before the climatic reveal of his new narrative.\nTeddy is so damn confused, can someone give him a hug? Source: John P. Johnson/HBO Maeve's plan to leave the park wasn't actually hers. It's not clear where Maeve's storyline fits into Ford's plans — if at all — but she learns that her grand scheme to escape the park wasn't of her own volition. As Bernard explains when she reboots him, her storyline was altered to make her a very woke robot, though interestingly, it was changed by Arnold (who obviously isn't alive!).\nDoes this mean Ford was making the adjustments in Arnold's name? It's possible, but Maeve confronted her own free will with leaving by park, by choosing not to leave at all. Instead, she opts to return to the park to find her daughter from a previous narrative loop. Maeve knows the child Host isn't actually hers, but is compelled to rescue her from whichever park she's located in.\nBut that's the thing — which park is Maeve's daughter in, and how many are there?\nEveryone get on the elevator ride of existential crises Source: John P. Johnson/HBO At least one other park exists, and now we all want to visit \"Samurai World.\" During her escape, Maeve and Felix stumble across another section of Delos labeled \"SW.\" It doesn't take long before, at the sight of samurais sword fighting in the confines of a few rooms, that we're looking at a possible \"Samurai World,\" which sounds undeniably awesome.\n\"What is this place,\" Maeve asks Felix, to which he says it's \"complicated.\" He's not wrong.\nThis confirms that there's at least one other themed park from Delos, and if the series follows in the footsteps of the original Westworld movie, we could have a slew of others. Season two could span a couple of these worlds, now that Maeve has to find her daughter in a new park.\nAnybody else want to visit a Medieval World, Roman World and Westeros World? (OK, the last one is probably B.S.).\nif you thought the white guys who went to westworld are bad just wait until you meet the white guys who go to samuraiworld\nFord's new narrative is a chaotic delight. As some had predicted , Ford's narrative wasn't as simple as creating a new story for the park. While it's unclear whether Maeve's determination to leave Westworld was designed by Ford, he had his own finale planned that sets the entire purpose of the park in a new light.\nFord orders Dolores to shoot him in the head during his speech to the Delos board — echoing Arnold's death at her hands — on the night that was to be his final at the company before he was forced to retire after a unanimous decision. Once Dolores kills Ford, she begins opening fire on members of the board. The ensuing chaos, we assume, will wipe out the company's remaining members (except, perhaps, the Man in Black, who was shot in the arm).\nWhat does this mean for the Hosts in the park? They may finally, to an extent, be free — no longer catering to the whims of the guests or their corporate overlords.\nWestworld's first season might've been a slow burn before it laid all its cards on the table, but season two is poised to delve into chaos, which seems fitting. As the show has constantly reminded us, \"These violent delights have violent ends.\"",

Spoilers: totally pepsi Reply +1 123456789123345869 (3 hours ago) [-] |I'm not looking at the spoiler, because I'm considering watching Westworld. Is it any good? I've seen people claim it's the new Game of Thrones, watch is a pretty big claim. It's fantastic. Maybe not quite GoT yet, but it definitely has the potential. These violent delights have violent ends Reply +1 123456789123345869 (4 hours ago) [-] Really impressed by the first season, one of my favorite shows of the year. really excited where the series goes in the future. #6 - anon id: 7d868915 Reply 0 123456789123345869 (4 hours ago) [-] There is no \"Ford Sport\". \"Sport\" is not a model that exists. \"Sport\" is a trim level. Like Ford Explorer Sport. Reply 0 123456789123345869 (6 hours ago) [-] It is my hope that Westworld initiates a new surge of Crichton adaptions. Such a wonderful mind who's works deserve to be honored on screen. I don't count Jurassic World as a recent Crichton property because it was more banking off of the popularity of the franchise than bringing Crichton back to the forefront of film or tv adaptions. Don't think he was named once in any promotional material. I would love to see HBO tackle a more faithful Jurassic Park adaption, and Congo could use some redemption. Hell, American Horror Story it and carry over the Westworld cast for Jurassic Park. Especially Ed Harris as a more sinister book Hammond. Evan Rachel Wood as Dr. Sattler, is another perfect match. #7 - anon id: 5f49bfc7",

      "text": "Fords truck division is on a roll. They just racked up more awards for the F-150. And after driving the big boy for a week, I understand why it continues to get heaps of praise.\nFirst, I was blown away by the price for my tester And not in a good way. Granted, it came with a lot of options, but $59,000 for a truck! You can spend up to 70-grand if you are so inclined.\nHowever, to be fair, the F-150 drives more like a car and offers four-doors and seating for five and it delivers are 5-Star safety rating. Trucks have come a very long way in the comfort and safety department.\nThe 3.5L V-6 Ecoboost engine is fantastic. Gas mileage is pretty great for this heavy truck. 18-City and 22-Highway for an 18 MPG average. Aluminum rules!\nWhat blew me away was how well the large Ford handled. You won’t mistake it for a sports sedan but it wasn’t a hassle to drive in city traffic. The brakes are a bit grabby, but I would take that over the spongy long stops of some other truck offerings.\nThe interior is very well done. Again, more car like. And Fords Sync 3 system is so much better than the one it replaces. Pairing a phone is no problem.Offerings like active park assist, lane keep assist and the optional 360-degree camera system can come in very handy when you are driving a vehicle as large as this beast.\nYou have a lot of choices when it comes to how many seats, doors and beds you desire.\nAs for the beds you can pick from 8-foot, 6-foot-6-inch, and 5-foot-6-inch. Regular and SuperCab and regular F-150’s come standard with a 6-foot-6-inch bed, and SuperCrew models come with a 5-foot-6-inch bed. Then you can upgrade to an 8-foot bed on Regular cab and SuperCab models, and you can upgrade to the 6-foot-6-inch bed in SuperCrew models. The configuration section on the Ford website comes in very handy in this case!\nWhile my lifestyle doesn’t require a truck, I can see why Ford sells a boatload of these fine vehicles and why it keeps receiving so many awards.\n \nMike West CBS\nFord F-150 Ford F-150 Ford F-150 Ford F-150 img_1115 Ford F-150 Ford F-150 ",

      "text": "Ford Motor ( F ) plans to issue $2.8 billion in debt, the company's first automotive borrowing in nearly four years, as it boosts spending on self-driving cars, mobility services and electrified vehicles, according to a person familiar with the deal.\nThe second-largest U.S. automaker is raising new cash as it looks at the changing landscape in transportation. Ford is working with cities around the world to come up with transportation solutions that go beyond selling cars to individual drivers and include vehicle sharing, ride hailing and other modes of mobility.\nThe world's middle class will double over the next 15 years, as more people crowd into huge urban centers, which would create global gridlock if everyone is driving their own car. So the carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis — without steering wheels and gas and brake pedals — on the road in five years. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40% of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike-sharing and a commuter-van services in San Francisco.\n\"For us, the world is changing,\" Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive, said in a recent interview. \"The transportation that served us well in the last hundred years is not going to serve us very well in the next hundred years. So based on that, that's really forcing, really encouraging us to think differently about the business.\"\nFord has undertaken an expensive effort to transform itself into a mobility company that can take on upstarts such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Alphabet's ( GOOGL ) Google. But the cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next.\nThe Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker is taking on the debt in 10-year and 30-year notes, according to a regulatory filing Monday. The size of the deal will be larger than the $2 billion initially anticipated, according to two people, who asked not to be identified because the deal is private.\nFord's last automotive issue was for $2 billion in January 2013. The company said its auto business had $13.1 billion in debt at the end of September and net cash of $11.2 billion.",

      "text": "Ford sees lineup changing to match demand, will add debt December 5, 2016 @ 1:33 pm Comments \nHave an opinion about this story? Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nDETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. will likely make changes to its car lineup as demand for small utilities continues to outpace that for sedans. \nThat could include offering crossover-style variants of certain sedans -- as it plans to do in Europe with the Fiesta subcompact’s new Active model -- or dropping certain nameplates altogether. \n“Over time, there should be some pruning of the portfolio to support growth in other areas,” Joe Hinrichs, Ford president of the Americas, told Automotive News today. “Clearly we’re going to invest in growing the SUV portfolio. We certainly intend to have a strong car base as well; we don’t know where the market’s going to go. But there will be some pruning over time as there should be in a nameplate and portfolio.” \nFord’s car sales dropped 13 percent in November and are down 14 percent through the first 11 months of the year. \nSedans slump \nSedans have fared the worst. Fiesta sales have led the decline, dropping 26 percent year-to-date. Focus sales have fallen 17 percent; C-Max and Mustang sales are down 13 percent; Taurus sales have dropped 11 percent and Fusion sales are down 10 percent. \nHinrichs didn’t name specific nameplates that could be cut, but noted former popular vehicles such as the Freestar minivan and Ranger midsize pickup that were killed after demand dropped. \n“If you look at our past, there’s been some nameplates that have dropped off and other nameplates have been added,” Hinrichs said. “Given where the market is going, the demands for capital investment and the regulatory changes coming at us, we’ll continue to always look at the total portfolio and see where’s segmentation going and where should we be phasing out.” \nAdding debt \nSeparately, Hinrichs told Reuters today that Ford plans to raise about $2 billion in long-term debt. It would be the first time the company has sought to add to its automotive debt in nearly four years. \nHinrichs said the money will largely go toward investments in new technology. \n“It’s an opportunistic time,” Hinrichs told Reuters. “It’s a supportive marketplace for long-term debt given where rates are, and we want to make sure that throughout the cycle of the industry we have the flexibility to do what we need to do and want to do, especially in the emerging part of the business.” \nSUV options \nStephen Odell, Ford’s director of global marketing, sales and service, said there’s no indication the SUV trend will end anytime soon, but options are available to address both vehicle segments. \nLast week in Germany, Ford introduced a new Active model for its Fiesta which includes a higher suspension and looks more like a crossover. \n“You can address both markets in some cases with a similar product offering,” Odell said, although he declined to say if the Fiesta Active model would come to the U.S. \nTo help combat sluggish car demand, Ford will make all of its small cars in lower-cost Mexico. \nThat includes moving the Focus compact and C-Max hybrid out of the company’s Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne in 2018 and moving the Focus to a new $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Ford has not said what it will do with the C-Max. \nMexican business equation \nFord’s decision to move the Focus south of the border ensured the nameplate would have a future in the U.S. that may not have been possible if Ford continued to build it in America, Hinrichs said. \n“It improved the Focus business equation and allowed us to have a next-gen Focus,” Hinrichs said. “We want it to be an important part of our car offerings in the marketplace, but it’s important to recognize where that segmentation’s been going over time and what that may mean in the future about the volumes. \n“I think it would be a very challenging proposition to build the next-gen Focus in the U.S.” \nReuters contributed to this report.

      "text": "Summary \nThe share price of Ford was abysmal this year, similar to many other car manufacturers. \nYet many consider the stock cheap. I disagree and believe the firm could be a value trap for many. Never forget the mind of the other investors. \nFord has many hoops to jump through to finally convince shareholders. If they do go up, it will be most likely be driven by profitability and not better revenue. \nI believe better profitability can be achieved by a variety of factors such as more control of Ford Credit or simply reduce cost at its main business. \nFord (NYSE: F ) brings back many memorable thoughts of my past because as a child we traveled every Sunday in a rusty old Ford. It was long before I read my first equity analysis article in a local newspaper as a young boy. Years later, Ford is still on my mind as brand recognition works on the mind. Unfortunately, it is not easy to convert this idea into a profitable investment. \nThis year is coming to an end, and not to anyone's surprise, Ford has not performed well. I've covered Ford before on Seeking Alpha , with the main focus on how the company is destroying shareholder value as I felt the firm could potentially do more to convince shareholders. Especially to show that Ford is heading on the right path, that the firm learned from its mistakes. \nClick to enlarge \nThis article will specifically focus on factors and variables, which seem to have an impact on the share price. It will furthermore touch upon the theory of financial behavior when it comes to investment. \nFord: Nearly ending 2016, entering 2017! \nThe end is near for 2016. This can't come quickly enough for Ford investors who have held the stock since January 2016. \nLet's have a look at the performance over the year: \nThe return of Ford is absolutely below par and the majority of car manufacturers have also underperformed in comparison to the market. \nNevertheless, I've read in the last few articles where Ford was covered that the car manufacturing firm is cheap based on simple classical valuation methods. Reading through these articles makes you convinced that Ford is indeed cheap. \nNevertheless, I wonder what to do with this kind of information. Cheap is something which is incredibly subjective . Stock prices are driven by investors (whether through quantitative programmes or regular Joe's and professional investors). Ultimately, there is a living person who initiated the buying/selling process of a stock. But these investors can use all sorts of reasons to invest . It doesn't necessarily have to be based on theoretical valuation models. If a firm is cheap based on metric A, yet doesn't go up, then metric A was never the reason to invest in the first place. Let's sum it up: \n1) Looking at classical metrics (such as P/E and others), Ford can be considered cheap. \n2) On the other hand, the stock went nowhere over the year. \nThe discrepancy between 1 and 2 indicates the stock is not cheap but expensive as classical metrics have yet to convert investors to pull in and buy the stock. These people must base their opinion on something else. If it's not classical equity valuation metrics, then what could it be ? Could it be that investors specifically look at business fundamental metrics such as revenue or profitability? \nI'm sure investors look at revenue growth, but there isn't much of a positive relationship between share price and revenue growth. In the line above, share price has gone up and went down while revenue growth remained relatively stagnant for example. \nNevertheless, there are metrics that resonate much better with the share price. One example would be simple profitability (profit margin): \nThe blue and orange line in the graph above shares quite a few common trends, especially on troughs. Unfortunately, future wise, analysts are expecting some stagnation on margin levels: \nSource: 4traders.com \nLet's go back to P/E and why this might not pull in investors . I feel this requires more explanation. It tells me that behavioral finance (the study of the behavior of investors) shouldn't be ignored, and is definitely worth reading about . If you know how an investor thinks, you could take advantage of this information by simply following the herd at a distance in contrast to being part of the herd and lose out if the herd is wrong. \nDaniel Kahneman wrote an excellent book about this kind of behavior, Thinking Fast and Slow . It shows how the perception of people (potential investors) can easily be fooled by changing some numbers. A great example can be shown underneath: \nSource: GreenBookBlog.org \nThe best example in the picture is how we perceive quickly that a 90% fat free steak is much better than 10% fat, while in reality the essence remained exactly the same . This kind of behavior is similar to classical valuation metrics. Investors with not a lot of background in investment and looking for Alpha simply see a bunch of metrics, which classify Ford as a 'cheap' investment and base their investment on this. They hit their head when they realize that investing wasn't so easy after all. Ford is a perfect example of this, something which often doesn't get noticed. \nOne might wonder if herd-like behaviour is active in the financial markets . I would say it's very much alive and actually a well-researched topic in the world of academia, as well as by professional institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF): see this working paper by the IMF as example. Research in this topic is very interesting, as it gives additional insight to investing, rather than providing classic fundamental analysis to evaluate whether or not a firm is cheap. \nOne kind of herd behavior is short investors. Maybe Ford is being played around by typical hedge funds that use Ford as a stress ball. \nSource: Gurufocus \nThe chart above clearly defines that the short percentage has significantly declined over the last 10 years. This signals reduced activity. Furthermore, every time the short interest massively decreased, an expected slump in share price was not a direct given. \nLet's delve a bit deeper into the share price over the year: \nThis kind of pattern would have driven a long-term investor to unfortunate sadness, as overall there was a loss at the end (unless Ford sees a rally in December). Nevertheless, this chart sees a lot of spikes. So what about relatively short-term periods throughout the year? \nA quick look at the daily data tells me the maximum absolute returns over smaller period of times in 2016: \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Yahoo Finance - Historical Data \nOverall, there have been quite a few small-term periods, which yielded a larger percentage of return than 10% in absolute terms. Delving once more in the actual drivers of these small trends, we find typical fundamental drivers , as simple as the firm presenting their quarterly results, such as the 28th of July where Ford posted worse than anticipated results and got battered by more than 8%. This once more reverts back to the earlier story of behavioral finance. Herd behavior of investors who crawl through the same door when news is negative for example. And the circle is round… \nConclusion \n2016 was clearly a horrible year for long-term investors who had Ford in their portfolio. As I've described in the article, based on the valuation metrics throughout the year, one would anticipate that this cheap stock would go up. Unfortunately, classical valuation metrics might give you a taste of how much earnings (for example) you get for $1 but they don't relate to positive returns in your portfolio. On average they might, as the world of academics suggests that lower P/E stocks outperform high P/E in the long run. \nNevertheless, these are average numbers , which means there are outliers on this distribution. Ford is typically such an outlier ( similar to airlines for example ), as they are driven by different factors. In the end, these kinds of investments have much more to do with the level of risk aversion per investor, and in that case, Ford has burned long-term investors. So often, that it will take a long time before this confidence is rebuilt. \nThe main story here is that people should not focus merely on classical fundamental metrics but whether or not the firm can perform fundamentally better than investors expect. This is how you will be one step ahead of investors. \nFor the short-term investor, anyone who has a solid understanding of the car industry and Ford's financing segment definitely sees plenty of opportunities in Ford throughout the year. These examples can be achieved by for example better than improved profitability through cost control or certain movement of interest rates for example. Plenty of opportunities in 2017. \nDisclaimer: This article provides opinions and information, but does not contain recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose.

      "text": "New Technology \nFor all of you concerned about the Ford F-150's aluminum body, here you go. The material switch was made to improve durability against dents and dings, everything from small door bang ups to, what else, sledgehammers. The weight savings are especially noteworthy, helping to shave up to 700 pounds from previous years. It substantially improves fuel economy, to boot. Add all of this together with natural rust prevention, and you have the formula that makes up the nation's best selling truck 39 years in a row. \nThis video provided by Edmunds shows the aluminum's resilience towards significant blows such as the one you see here.

By John Parker | Dec 5, 2016 11:02 pm EST Ford’s November sales \nOn December 1, 2016, Ford Motor Company (F) released its November 2016 US sales data. The company sold 197,574 vehicle units in the US last month. This reflects a YoY (year-over-year) increase of about 5%. Retail sales revived in November \nIn November 2016, Ford’s fleet sales fell 9% YoY to 43,460 vehicle units while its retail vehicle sales were up 10% YoY to 154,114 units at the same time. This data reflects optimism—let’s find out why. \nIn the auto industry, fleet sales can be defined as wholesale vehicle sales to customers such as rental car companies, government departments, and other private companies that use commercial vehicles. Fleet sales help automakers ( VCR ) increase their revenues and market share. \nHowever, fleet vehicle sales typically tend to have lower margins than retail vehicle sales. To maintain healthy profitability, it’s important for automakers to focus more on retail sales. \nFord’s retail sales have dropped for the last few months, which took a toll on its margins. In October 2016, its retail sales fell 9% YoY. A revival in November’s retail sales should help the company boost its 4Q16 margins. Series overview \nIn this series, we’ll look at November sales figures of mainstream automakers such as Ford, General Motors ( GM ), Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ), and Toyota ( TM ). We’ll explore what these figures could mean for investors as we enter the 2016 holiday season. Later in the series, we’ll explore how investors on Wall Street reacted to mainstream automakers’ November sales data. \nRead on to the next part to see the positive side of Ford’s November sales. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"VCR\",\"GM\",\"FCAU\",\"F\",\"TM\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF\",\"General Motors Company\",\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.\",\"Ford Motor Company\",null]} X",

      "text": "Ford reported strong sales growth in November. Rising interest rates and political uncertainty are headwinds for Ford stock. Ford stock currently has a dividend yield of 4.9%. Flickr \nRiding on improving consumer sentiment, Ford (NYSE:F) brushed aside investors concerns by posting a much better than expected November sales number . The better than expected sales growth saw Ford stock gaining more than 4%. The stock is however down 11% YTD as investors are worried that US auto market has peaked for now. Also, the rising interest rates may adversely impact the stock. However, Ford's current dividend yield of 4.9% makes it a very attractive stock for income investors going into 2017 and the long-term growth story remains intact. Improving Economic Conditions Will Drive Demand \nThe US economy grew by 3.2% in the third quarter, against analysts estimates of 3% growth . The after-tax earnings of US corporations rose 5.2% in Q3, growing for the first time since late 2014. The unemployment is at a multi-year low and the wages are rising. All these are feeding into consumers, resulting in rising consumer sentiment . The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 93.8, one of the best readings in last 12 months. Improving economic indicators will increase aggregate demand. According to Mustafa Mohatarem, General Motors (NYSE:GM) chief economist: \n“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy including consumer and business sentiment, which continue to drive a very healthy U.S. auto industry,”, “We believe the U.S. auto industry is well-positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.” \nThe industry expects the near record level of sales to continue into 2017. While it was an all-round show by Ford in November, two key segments which drove the demand were SUV's and \"F-Series\" trucks. SUV sales were up 20% while \"F-Series\" sales were up 11%, driven by low oil prices. But the crude oil price has jumped more than 15% after OPEC reached a deal for cutting daily oil production. The increase in oil prices may hurt the demand of the gas guzzling SUV's. However, shale gas production and President-Elect Donald Trump's energy policies will keep the oil prices in check. Also, the auto industry expects the demand for SUV's to remain strong in spite of the rising oil prices. (Also read: BlackBerry Might Gain From The Tesla Motors Inc Hack ) Investing In Future Growth \nFord recently announced that it will be borrowing $2.8 billion in 10 years and 30 years notes from the market. This is the first time the company is approaching the debt market in 4 years. The proceeds from borrowing will be used for investing in the new focus areas of electric and automated cars. The company said, in a recent statement, \"Consistent with our recent investor day presentations, we continue to increase our investments in emerging opportunities, primarily in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility,\" . \nFor quite some time now Ford has been increasingly investing in emerging opportunities including autonomous cars. The company has announced its plans to roll out a fully automated car for commercial operations by 2021. According to Bloomberg, the autonomous car market is likely to be a $45 billion market by 2025 . The Down Side Risks Persist \nThe strong showing by the auto industry in November has taken many analysts by surprise. Ford sold 197,574 passenger vehicles in November, which is a 5.1% increase over the last year, handsomely beating analysts' consensus of 0.5% growth. This heavy beat has brought back investors to the stock with the stock gaining more than 4% since the news. However, the main question to be asked is whether this strong demand is sustainable? \nIn a statement Ford Vice President Mark LaNave noted that: \n\"Our outlook for the year remains unchanged at 17.8 million total vehicles. We had a strong sales in November, which places the year-to-date pace at a level consistent with the year ago, with 2015. \" \nWhile the company expects the demand to remain strong, it does not expect the November performance to repeat again. November performance was propelled by Black Friday deals and consumer incentives. According to Reuters \"Hefty discounts helped boost November U.S. auto sales 3.7 percent,\". These discounts are not sustainable in the long run and will negatively impact automakers' earnings. \nAnother risk facing Ford Motors is the rising interest rates. The yield on US Treasury bills have shot up since the elections to record levels, and the FED is widely expected to increase the interest rate in its December policy meet. Rising interest rates will hurt Ford's demand as it will increase the EMI's. Strong Fundamentals \nFord Motors has strong fundamentals which will allow it to sustain its dividend payments. Ford generated more than $17 billion in cash from operations in 2015 and more than $5 billion in the latest quarter. In the first nine months of FY 2016, the free cash flow numbers came in at $8 billion. In comparison, Ford spent around $2.5 billion on dividends and buyback last year and around $600 million in the latest quarter. Even the dividend payout ratio is low at 35%. Ford's auto segment had $24.3 billion in cash and $13.1 billion in debt at the end of the third quarter 2016. So Ford has ample margin of safety to protect its dividends in case of adverse economic growth, which now looks increasingly remote. (Also read: Trump's Policies Could Massively Dent Ford Motor Company ) Ford Stock Is A Good Income Play \nFord reported strong growth in November sales, beating the analysts' estimates by a wide margin. The company also borrowed $2.8 billion to invest in its future growth. Ford aims to roll out a fully automated vehicle for commercial operation by 2021. However, challenges remain. It will be difficult to repeat the strong performance of November. The rising interest rates may impact the demand. Also, Trump's promise to tax imports from Mexico at a punitive rate will have a negative impact on Ford's sales. But, despite facing several challenges, Ford's fundamentals remain strong. Ford's current dividend is amply protected by its strong cash flows and low dividend payout ratio. Also, Ford is currently trading at much lower multiples. With a dividend yield of nearly 5%, Ford stock is one of the best dividend stocks going into 2017. \nLooking to invest in auto stocks? Here are our latest Top Auto Stock Picks . Show Full Article",

      "text": "Pinterest Email \nAs with most automakers, Ford passenger car sales are down both for the month of November and for the year. Such trends usually lead to lineup changes, and Joe Hinrichs, Ford president of the Americas, nearly confirmed that fact to Automotive News . Just last week the company introduced a new, raised version of its Fiesta, called the Active , which had more of a crossover/ VW Alltrack feel to its design. \n“Over time, there should be some pruning of the portfolio to support growth in other areas,” Hinrichs told Automotive News. “Clearly we’re going to invest in growing the SUV portfolio. We certainly intend to have a strong car base as well; we don’t know where the market’s going to go. But there will be some pruning over time as there should be in a nameplate and portfolio.” \nThe stodgy Taurus sedan could be part of that pruning. It’s down almost 11 percent for the year. The C-Max is down 13 percent, though it ticked up in November. Those two and the slow-selling Ford Flex could all be on the chopping block. 2018 Ford Fiesta is coming with a new crossover model \nFord of Europe is adding upscale and crossover versions of its new Fiesta, along with advanced safety technologies, to boost the car’s competitiveness in the tough subcompact segment.Ford ... \n“If you look at our past, there have been some nameplates that have dropped off and other nameplates have been added,” Hinrichs said. “Given where the market is going, the demands for capital investment and the regulatory changes coming at us, we’ll continue to always look at the total portfolio and see where’s segmentation going and where should we be phasing out.” \nStephen Odell, Ford’s director of global marketing, sales and service said he’s looking at options that add to the company’s SUV/crossover arm and help combat slower car sales. \n“You can address both markets in some cases with a similar product offering,” Odell said, referencing the new Active. \nHinrichs also told Automotive News that the business decision to move Focus production to Mexico helped establish a future for the small car, something it may not have had in the U.S. with the former's production costs. \nJake Lingeman - Jake Lingeman is Road Test Editor at Autoweek, reviewing cars, reporting on car news, car tech and the world at large.

      "text": "Anthony Hopkins as Ford. Photo: HBO \nThe first season of HBO’s Westworld ended Sunday night with a high-budget bang that had people debating its twists and arguing its cliffhangers. Did they really kill Ford? The Man in Black? Is next season just going to be hosts running rampant, hunting for revenge on humans? And that’s perhaps the most interesting question right now — what does next season look like?\nJonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy turned a cult sci-fi film from the '70s into a television labyrinth, taking us so deep into a maze of twists that it’s almost impossible to know what season two, which won’t premiere until 2018, will look like. While there are a lot of practical questions, like the fates of Ford, Logan, and even Abernathy, these are more general thoughts on the tone and trajectory of the show. In many ways, the first season was a high-wire act that can’t be replicated. If Westworld keeps going down its own rabbit hole, it could become Heroes . How does it avoid such a fate?\nStop living in the past.\nOne of the main takeaways from the finale for this writer was the realization that this season has been almost entirely prologue. It’s really a primer on the history of Westworld , defining Arnold (Jeffrey Wright) and Ford’s (Sir Anthony Hopkins) roles in the creation of the park, laying out the rules of the place, and detailing the hosts’ journey towards awareness. Even one of our few likable protagonists, William (Jimmi Simpson), was a character who existed only in flashback and that we are unlikely to see again (at least in his youthful form). Now that we can sit back and reflect, so much of season one of Westworld is about the past, which is appropriate for a season that emphasized memory and grief, but is certainly something that can’t be maintained forever. We need our drama to have momentum, forward progress, and characters who grow (or refuse to) over the course of a season. The impression that much of the first season of Westworld was mere setup is what I think is at the core of a lot of people’s frustrations with the show — the sense that we’re not getting anywhere and only treading water in a sea of manipulative editing and shocking twists. The main thing we’d like to see the show do is make what’s happening next to these characters more interesting than what happened previously. \nHave some fun with it.\nWho would have guessed that a show about sentient robots would be so dour? While many fans embraced the deep, philosophical discussions inherent in the first season of Westworld , there was definitely a sense that the show took itself a little too seriously, especially in the back half. And this lack of pure enjoyment was highlighted by that fantastic scene in the center of episode seven, “Trace Decay,” in which Maeve (Thandie Newton) realizes the extent of her new powers during the town shoot-out. With a contagious spring in her step and glimmer in her eye, Maeve commands the sheriff to let the daily fracas continue, while she brings Hector (Rodrigo Santoro) into the saloon. The way the scene is shot, edited, and performed by Newton is almost playful, and typified what was missing so often from season one of Westworld — fun. It would also be nice to be reminded why people pay a fortune to come to Westworld and to break up the philosophical quandaries with moments of joy or laughter every now and then. \nGround it with characters.\nThe fact that the only relatable human protagonist from the first season (William) was also the show’s villain leaves us with a huge black hole in terms of character. The age of the TV anti-hero has taught us that we don’t have to necessarily like the people we watch every Sunday night, but there does need to be something relatable and grounded in their journey for us to care. Westworld could easily become a series of rug-pulls. Like this character? He’s really dead! Like this character? He’s really a host! And the problem with that kind of writing is it has a short leash in terms of viewer patience. It could be argued that Westworld needs a character like Jack from Lost , who we feel like we know and trust. He doesn’t have to be a white knight, but he or she does need to be consistent and not merely a cog in the plot-device machine. \nDon’t tip your hand quite so much. \nIt turned out that we saw most of the first season’s twists of Westworld coming from pretty far away. After the second episode, we were already theorizing about the Man in Black being William and Bernard being a host. While those played out in dramatically satisfying ways, one could easily argue that they were telegraphed too directly. The best magicians do something with their left hand while you’re looking at their right hand, but Westworld was all right hand. It would be nice for the second season to include a twist or two that comes completely out of left field, and only makes sense after further explanation or upon deep reflection of more subtle hints. For example, if you’re bringing Ford back in the fifth episode of season two (if that was, as theorized, a host version shot at the end of season one), don’t drop clues for the first four episodes. Just spring it on us. Keep viewers off their game in a way that makes Westworld feel like more than just a puzzle demanding to be solved.\nBreak the door.\nWe saw a glimpse of a potential other park (Samurai World) in the season finale (as well as the fact that Maeve’s daughter is in “Park 1”), and there’s been an incredible amount of speculation about the world outside of the confines of the theme park. Which is why I think we need to get out of Westworld more to understand its importance in this society and its allure in the next season. Imagine if the season premiere took place entirely outside of the Old West setting — either in another world or the “real one.” There’s a sense that Westworld as a concept lacks a greater human context. That was clearly purposeful and effective in season one, making us prisoners of the park as much as the hosts, but Westworld as a place could gain a much more satisfying depth if we knew a little more about the world around it.",

      "text": "Ford is willing to work with Donald Trump to keep jobs in the U.S. if the president-elect puts the right policies in place, the automaker's chief executive officer said.\n\"We will be very clear in the things we'd like to see,\" Mark Fields said in an exclusive interview at Bloomberg offices in Southfield, Mich. \"We'll continue to advocate for currency-manipulation rules to promote free and fair trade. One of our priorities is making sure fuel-economy standards reflect market realities, tax reform in general we would be very supportive of, and the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Ford was a favorite target of Trump, who lambasted the company for producing cars south of the border. Ford tried to make peace last month when Executive Chairman Bill Ford called the president-elect to let him know the automaker no longer planned to move production of a Lincoln sport-utility vehicle to Mexico from a plant in Kentucky. Ford still plans to move its Focus compact and C-Max hybrid to Mexico from a Michigan factory, but the automaker has said it believes it can work with the new president to encourage economic growth in the U.S.\nTrump warns of 'retribution' for companies that offshore jobs, threatens 35% tariff Ylan Q.

Mui) During his campaign, Trump threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on cars Ford builds in Mexico and ships back to the U.S. He made a similar threat against Carrier after the unit of United Technologies Corp. said it was moving production to Mexico and cutting 1,400 jobs in Indiana. Instead, Trump and Carrier unveiled a deal Thursday in which the maker of furnaces and air-conditioners will get $7 million in state incentives to keep the work in Indiana. About 1,100 Carrier employees in the Indianapolis area still will lose their jobs despite the agreement.\nFord received no incentives for keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky, but the automaker never planned to close that Louisville plant, which also builds the Escape SUV that outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. Ford already makes the Lincoln MKZ sedan and the Fusion family car in Mexico. It's building a $1.6 billion new small-car factory in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi, which will create 2,800 jobs there by 2020.\nFord has said it is just the fifth-largest producer of vehicles in Mexico while it's the top automotive manufacturer in the U.S. Ford said it has added nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. over the last five years. Ford employs 85,000 workers in the U.S. and 8,800 in Mexico.\nSince 2010, nine global automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, have announced investments of more than $24 billion in Mexico, where wages are 80 percent lower than in the U.S. Annual auto output in Mexico may more than double this decade, from 2 million to 5 million vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.\nTrump took credit for stopping Ford from moving plant to Mexico, but it wasn't planning to Jim Tankersley President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico.

The cost of that conversion is causing profits to fall this year and next. The carmaker has promised to put 100,000 robot taxis — without steering wheel, gas or brake pedals — on the road in five years. It's also investing $4.5 billion to convert 40 percent of its lineup to electrified vehicles by 2020 and is offering bike sharing and a commuter van service in San Francisco.\nThe second-largest U.S. automaker has cut profit forecasts twice in the last three months. In September, Ford reduced its 2016 profit prediction by $600 million, to $10.2 billion from at least $10.8 billion, due to rising recall costs. Last month, it trimmed the 2017 profit outlook for its credit unit by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, because declining auction values for used cars would hurt results. Ford shares fell 12 percent this year through Thursday.",

      "text": "Turns out, Donald Trump doesn't own stock in Boeing. Nor in Microsoft, or Ford, or Amazon, or AT&T, or any of several other companies whose policies may be affected by his future administration, and all of which he said he held as of a financial disclosure he made in May. He's gotten rid of all that stock, his spokesman Jason Miller said today. Sold it all in June, Miller said.\nMiller made the comment on a call with the press regarding Trump's morning tweet criticizing Boeing ( BA ) for overcharging the government on the sale of a new version of Air Force One. Miller later confirmed to the AP that he did indeed mean that Trump had sold not just his Boeing stock, but all of his stocks at that time. The AP asked for proof, and Miller declined to provide it.\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment on the stock sales or to provide any evidence of it.\nThe announcement comes amid growing conflict-of-interest concerns regarding Trump's business endeavors that are not necessarily shared by the president-elect, his family or his business associates. In his May 2016 financial disclosure , the self-described billionaire listed millions of dollars in investments in dozens of publicly-traded companies across a wide range of industries, including banking, technology, energy and autos.\nTrump's camp has been rather coy regarding what will happen to his private business interests, including stock holdings, now that he has been elected. The Washington Post reported as recently as last week that a Trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment for one of its stories on Trump's stock portfolio. Trump announced on Twitter in late November that he will discuss what will happen with the Trump Organization at a December 15 news conference. There is no indication he will divest of the company, and signs point to him holding control over to his children instead.\nTrump held positions in a number of companies about which he spoke frequently while campaigning and after his election. One such example is Apple ( AAPL ) , of which he previously held as much as $2.25 million in shares.\nOn the campaign trail, the real estate magnate was at times critical of the tech giant, claiming that as president he would get Apple to manufacture their \"damn computers\" in America and at one point floating the idea of boycotting the company until it helped the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters.\nAfter his election, the president-elect told the New York Times he had been in touch with Apple CEO Tim Cook and asked him to get the company to \"build a big plant in the United States.\" He also said he told him his administration would be going after a \"very large tax cut for corporations.\" Trump has proposed dropping the corporate tax rate to 15%.\nTrump also told the Times that Microsoft ( MSFT ) founder Bill Gates had called him after the election. During a campaign speech in South Carolina a year ago , Trump said he would work on closing up parts of the Internet to fight terrorism by going to see Gates and \"a lot of different people that really understand what's happening.\" In his May filing, he listed up to $600,000 in Microsoft shares.\nHe disclosed a position in Amazon ( AMZN ) of up to $100,000. Trump frequently criticized the e-commerce company's CEO, Jeff Bezos.\nIn May, Trump contended Amazon has a \"huge antitrust problem\" and said the company is \"getting away with murder, tax-wise.\" He accused Bezos of using the Post, which he owns, to wield power over lawmakers to avoid taxes.\nHe disclosed holdings in Ford ( F ) as well, which he frequently criticized for outsourcing on the campaign trail. After his election, he falsely took credit for the company's decision to keep one of its plants in Kentucky.\nTrump listed holdings in companies about which his administration stands to make important decisions once he is in the White House.\nHe held shares of both AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) , which announced an $85 billion merger in October that his Justice Department will oversee. Trump said he would seek to block the deal when it was first announced because it concentrated too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" However, he may have since changed his tune. The Financial Times reported last week that AT&T was encouraged by Trump's appointments of two former competition antitrust officials with a hands-off record on enforcement.\nHe listed holdings in Wells Fargo ( WFC ) as well, which earlier this year was flagged and fined by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for creating millions of phony accounts.\nTrump had also previously listed holdings in Energy Transfer Partners ( ETP ) , the owner of the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline that has become a political flashpoint in recent months. A Trump spokeswoman confirmed in late November he had sold off his stake over the summer . Trump has been supportive of the project, a stance Miller reaffirmed on Monday .\nAlso in the Trump portfolio was IBM ( IBM ) , whose CEO, Ginni Rometty, reached out to Trump soon after his election in an open letter outlining areas for cooperation . She will now form part of a CEO advisory forum to Trump . And, he listed holdings of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) , where his Treasury Secretary nominee, Steve Mnuchin, was a former executive and his top adviser, Steve Bannon, worked as well.\nThis is not the first time Trump has said he bought and sold a significant number of stocks all at once.\nWhen he made his first personal finance disclosure in July 2015, soon after announcing his candidacy, he claimed to have sold 45 stocks in January 2014 for a gain of more than $27 million. He said he made only five losing picks: Coca-Cola ( KO ) , D.R. Horton ( DHI ) , Enbridge Inc. ( ENB ) , Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ) and PepsiCo ( PEP ) .\nThe Trump camp did not return request for comment on how much the president-elect made on his stock sales this time around.",

      "text": "Ford survey reveals interesting facts about car drivers in India Share \nFord Motor Company conducted a survey across 9,500 drivers across 11 markets in Asia Pacific which also included 1,023 Indian respondents. 95% stated that they knew how to driver their car in a way that would offer maximum fuel efficiency while 96% stated that they put in every effort to drive efficiently. \nAmong those surveyed just 27% drivers stated that they were aware of how to use GPS to set best route prior to setting out on a journey while as much as 78% Indian drivers said they were not aware that use of cruise control could save a lot of fuel. The survey also revealed that 40% Indian drivers did not know that harsh acceleration and wrong braking could bring down vehicle’s fuel efficiency drastically. \nFord Motor Company offers some efficient driving and fuel saving techniques. \n1. Aggressive driving – harsh braking and quick acceleration are leading causes of increased fuel consumption which 40% of Indian drivers are unaware of. \n2. Turning off the engine and restarting it again is another leading cause of fuel wastage of which only 26% of Indian drivers believed. \n3. Cruise control offers benefits where fuel efficiency is concerned as maintenance of a constant speed saves fuel while it also ensures that the driver retains a constant speed. 78% of drivers surveyed were aware of this fact. \n4. Following a reliable GPS system allowed for better fuel efficiency while only 27% Indian drivers use this method of travel. \n5. Following a straight road rather than hilly terrain saves fuel with 52% drivers unaware of this fuel saver. \n6. Weather conditions played a significant role in fuel efficiency. Cold weather reduces fuel efficiency while warmer climates sees increased use of fuel especially with the AC running. \n7. Lighter baggage in vehicle contributes to better fuel efficiency. With every 20 kgs reduced, fuel efficiency increases by 1%, of which only 35% Indian drivers were aware. \n8. Proper maintenance of vehicle, regular servicing and keeping tyre pressure under check also ensures longer time distances between fuel refills of which only 33% drivers are aware. \nEcoSport Facelift",

      "text": "December 7, 2016 \nThe video spot makes use of and subverts the standard expectations of mobile video ads Ford is using the unique aspects of mobile video with a new campaign that promotes its blind spot awareness technology with an interactive video ad designed specifically for mobile. The ad makes use of vertical video, a format growing in popularity, to formally show the dangers of blind spots when driving. This video spot is meant to promote its vehicles Blind Spot Information System. Playing with form Every driver knows that not paying attention to the blind spot is an excellent way to get in an accident. Ford has been trying to work around that problem with its new tech, the Blind Spot Information System, designed to help drivers negotiate their blind spot and be aware of what is happening all around them at all times. To promote this new feature in Israel, Ford turned to marketing companies Baumann Ber Rivnay and Saatchi & Saatchi Israel to come up with an innovative ad that would creatively show the uses of this new system. They decided on using vertical video, an ad format uniquely suited to working on mobile, to sell the feature. The ad is a fairly ingenious way of using the standard perceptions of how videos are seen on a phone. When the ad is first viewed, it looks like a standard horizontal video with two black bars above and below the video, showing a car driving horizontally down the road. That is when the creativity comes in. Next, the two black bars that usually signify a horizontally-oriented video fall away, revealing the ad to be vertically oriented and at the same time showing a nearby vehicle that the first car could not see because it was in its blind spot. By turning the standard expectations of a mobile video on their head, Ford has created a surprising and engaging bit of advertising that entertains as well as demonstrating the properties of the advertised product through the form of the video itself. Big boosts The creativity put into this has paid off. Ford reports Facebook engagement of 600,000 with 300 shares and a reach of over 1.1 million. In a country of just 8 million people, that is a huge reach. Additionally, the campaign shows the continued success of video marketing, especially of the kind that targets mobile. For example, H&M recently had a large amount of success with a short film ad that was created by Wes Anderson ( see story ). Social video is also taking off, with the recent addition of live vertical video to Instagram having huge implications for marketers ( see story ). In the end, video marketing is nothing without creativity and effort to back it up. This ad is just one way that brands are playing with the format of video itself to get their message across.

      "title": "Ford: November China Numbers Look Fantastic",
      "text": "Summary \nFord numbers for November out of China look great. \nCompany continues to create many legs to stand on and a consistent global business as capex initiatives are paying off. \nWe anticipate continued success and update our thoughts as to why China's momentum remains so importnat. By Parke Shall Just a couple of days ago, we wrote about an automotive pair trade that we have had on for the last couple of months. One end of this pair trade is a long position in Ford (NYSE: F ) that we have advocated for mostly to take advantage of the company's significant dividend. News out this morning gives us confidence in Ford still, as the company continues to set a record pace in China. We will talk about why this is important to our pair trade, what this means for the state of the automotive market, and what we are looking for going forward. This morning, Seeking Alpha reported , Ford reports sales in China increased 17% in November to 124,113 units. Sales for the Changan Ford Automobile JV rose 14% to 96,191 vehicles. Sales for the Jiangling Motor Corporation JV jumped 29% to 26,285 vehicles. Ford Explorer sales were up 73% Y/Y during the month. YTD Ford China sales +11% to 1.09M. This data is fantastic not only at face value, but also because it perpetuates a couple of arguments that we have been making in favor of Ford for the last year. First it continues to perpetuate the argument that Ford's investments overseas will eventually pay off for the company in the form of being able to generate profits in other countries. The company can see this not only as insurance against the US auto market, but as a contributor to the bottom line when all economies are contributing and producing. Second, this continues to help shape our view of how Ford is looked at in China. Tapping into China's densely populated culture can be difficult for a lot of companies. In previous articles, we reviewed different marketing material and initiatives that Ford was using in order to try and make a name for itself in China. Click to enlarge In addition to that, it was just months ago that the company announced that it was investing in additional $2 billion into China to research and invest in smart vehicles, easily argued to be the \"next big thing\" in China, \nAmid slowing sales and rising competition, Ford Motor Co. is investing $1.8 billion in research that will help it build new smart cars in China. The U.S. car company announced Monday its plans to research smartphone connectivity, autonomous driving and other smart-car technologies over the next five years, the Associated Press reported. Its future Chinese products will include features developed specifically to appeal to Chinese customers as it hopes to expand in China. In the meantime, the company wants to sell smart cars in China using technology developed for other markets. \n\"We see China as a very big growth market,\" Ford CEO Mark Fields said Monday, according to the Wall Street Journal . \"It's a great opportunity to not only grow our core business of selling cars and trucks but also provide services to people who may not want a car but still want to be mobile.\" The better the company's brand image as they push forward with these initiatives, the more shareholders will benefit. The sales numbers tell us that the brand is still being very well received in China. The Chinese market continues to be one of the main growth drivers for Ford on a global scale right now. While the company is also finding some success in Europe and the United States right now, China is easily the fastest growing country for them and there doesn't seem to be any signs of stopping heading into the back end of this year. Our analysis on Ford has, from the start, always been very data dependent. While it has been argued time and time again that the US auto market is about to stall out, we continue to point out that the sales data continues to look fine and that the average age of a vehicle on the road is at an all-time high at 11.6 years. We plan on continuing to keep our thesis data dependent and, while we may be on the tail end of some euphoria in the United States, the Chinese sales data simply continues to look strong for the company. All in all, this data continues to support our long position in the company as well as our argument for maintaining a long position in the company as part of an automotive pair trade. The other leg of this trade, as we have identified in other articles, is a short position in Credit Acceptance Corporation (NASDAQ: CACC ), a company that services and originates subprime loans for auto lenders. Given this new data out of China, we feel a renewed affirmation that our trade will continue to provide Alpha heading into the back end of this year and the beginning of 2017. We remain confident in our trade and we remain confident in Ford. Disclosure: I am/we are long F. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
