      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 15, 2016 \"It’s a great form of communication... a tremendous form... I have a method of fighting back.... So it’s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It’s — it’s where it’s at.\" Said Donald Trump, speaking about social media — \"Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram\" — to Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" the other day . She was probing into whether he's going to give it up once he's President, and his answer is that it's a way to easily reach 28 million people. That would be \"very tough\" to give up, but he's \"going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I’m going to do very restrained.\" I like that Trumpism — \"to do very restrained.\" Ordinarily, in English, we'd say \"to be very restrained.\" But he's a doer. \"Do\" should get an adverb, not an adjective (\"restrained\"), so it's technically grammatically wrong. But \"do\" is perhaps his \"be,\" and \"be\" gets an adjective. See? I'm doing very pedantic. Hope you like it. I'm not ashamed. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of . Yikes! What a concept! No shame. No more shame. Do — and don't regret. Trump doesn't do regretful. But the reason I'm writing this post — doing this modern form of communication — is because of the phrase \"It’s where it’s at.\" That's a real 1960s phrase — right in there with \"Do your own thing\" and \"Let it all hang out.\" How much 1960s is in the mind of Trump? I only know what's in the mind of Althouse, and \"It's where it's at\" screams 60s to me. If you're younger, maybe you know it from this highly honored 1996 recording by Beck: But Beck's source for the phrase was from 1969, an educational recording titled \"Sex for Teens: (Where It's At),\" which you can listen to here . I listened. Very sincere and thus very funny. KENNY [Radio personality Kenny Everett]: \"What do you think of this new LP? It's a bit strange compared to the others. Would you term it 'Psycho-Deeelic'?\" RINGO: \"Only if you want to think of it as psycho-deeelic.\" JOHN: \"Now we'd like to play you one. It's a sad little song. (pause) Where's it gone?\" PAUL: (giggles) JOHN: \"Oh, this is it, yeah. Picture yourself on an old-fashioned elephant. Lucy in the sky for everyone, now.\" The best use of \"where it's at\" is, I think, from Bob Dylan, in that most Bob Dylan of Bob Dylan songs, \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" Forget the old-fashioned elephant. Bring on the chrome horse: You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Ain’t it hard when you discover that He really wasn’t where it’s at After he took from you everything he could steal I call out to Meade, and he points out that he already texted me what is to him the better Bob Dylan usage of \"where it's at,\" \"Positively 4th Street\" : You say you lost your faith But that’s not where it’s at You had no faith to lose And you know it You're probably wondering by now whether the 60s and Bob Dylan and The Beatles are where it's at and, to put it another way, whether the Althouse blog is where it's at. Or maybe is Trump where it's at. But we're all here on social media, and Trump says it's where it's at . Posted by Ann Althouse at 7:59 AM",

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 15, 2016 Since we're already talking about Facebook, let me show you this Buzzfeed article: \"Renegade Facebook Employees Form Task Force To Battle Fake News/The group is hoping to challenge the position by CEO Mark Zuckerberg that the platform has no responsibility to address the issue following the election of Donald Trump.\" I absolutely do not trust Facebook to decide what's fake and what's not fake, so I'm with Zuckerberg here and not the \"renegades.\" \"Renegade\" makes these people sound daring, but they are into censorship and upping the power of the big corporation. The chance that such a power would be used in a politically biased way is approximately 100%. I don't know how much Zuckerberg is really committed to the freedom of speech, but I think he knows if Facebook started deeming some political stories \"fake\" and taking action against them, Facebook would be accused of bias and censorship and it wouldn't be good for Facebook, the business. Those of us who care about freedom of speech should try to make it vividly apparent to the people of Facebook that censorship will hurt them economically. You can't trust them to believe in freedom of speech. They've already got a heated-up, self-righteous band of insiders who think censorship is the cutting edge. By the way, the first definition of \"renegade\" in the OED is: \"A person who renounces his or her faith; an apostate; (in early use) spec. a Christian who converts to Islam.\" Second is: \"A person who deserts, betrays, or is disloyal to an organization, country, or set of principles; a turncoat, a traitor.\" The set of principles here is: freedom of speech, the autonomy of individual writers, and the viewpoint neutrality of the owner of the forum. Buzzfeed quotes an unnamed Facebook employee, opining on Zuckerberg's statement that it's \"pretty crazy\" to think that fake news on Facebook helped elect Trump: “It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.” We're told that there's a task force of \"more than dozens\" of Facebook employees holding secret meetings and that \"hundreds” of employees are supportive of the cause. “There is a lot more we could be doing using tools already built and in use across Facebook to stop other offensive or harmful content,” said a second Facebook employee who has been a longtime engineer there. “We do a lot to stop people from posting nudity or violence, from automatically flagging certain sites to warning people who post content that doesn’t meet the community guidelines,” the employee said. He added that while Facebook users were encouraged to flag fake news, the guidelines for removing that sort of content were not clear. “If someone posts a fake news article, which claims that the Clintons are employing illegal immigrants, and that incites people to violence against illegal immigrants, isn’t that dangerous, doesn’t that also violate our community standards?”... Facebook came under fire in May amid accounts by recent employees that personal bias was pushing the platform’s Trending Topics section towards more liberal news sites. In the wake of the report, Facebook fired its entire Trending Topics team, and said it would instead rely on an algorithm — though as BuzzFeed News reported, experts warned that algorithms were likely to increase the spread of fake news. Experts warned , eh? Yes, it's those pesky experts. Well, I too am an expert, and I'm not even hiding my name. As an expert, I say: All news is fake news. I mean, look at this. I did a screen shot of the first thing I saw at nytimes.com when I looked at my iPhone this morning: The news is is that Trump is criticized ? There's a core of news: Trump hired somebody. But the headline isn't what Trump did. It's that people are criticizing him, that he is \"denounced.\" And the person he hired is a \"hard-right nationalist.\" That's at the top of the NYT mobile edition. Here's what should be the most respected news site, and it's reframing what Trump does into anti-Trump propaganda by pretending that the real news is what various Trump antagonists think of the news.

If my post made you wonder why I wrote \"Parents are so terrible!\" — feel free to speculate in the comments, but you will never guess. If my post made you wonder about the origin of the phrase \"hang up your spurs,\" read this , at Grammarphobia. Today, to “hang up one’s spurs” (or the tools of one’s trade) means to retire from the field, to give up, or to turn one’s attentions elsewhere. This... is a tradition dating back to classical times. The Roman poet Horace, who lived in the first century BC, refers to this tradition... [w]ith the lines nunc arma defunctumque bello / barbiton hic paries habebit , the narrator decides to retire metaphorically from the field of battle and hang up his weapon—the lyre with which he does his wooing. ADDED: Meade says \"'the lyre with which he does his wooing' should be a picture of me from the New York Times on the front porch with my laptop.\" He means the picture of him here .

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 14, 2016 Lesley Stahl to Donald Trump: \"A lot of people are afraid. They’re really afraid. African Americans think there’s a target on their back.\" What is the basis for the statement that Donald Trump has made \"African Americans think there’s a target on their back\"? And if there is no basis — I don't think there is — then Lesley Stahl — ironically — should be condemned for the very thing for which she is blaming Trump — making black people feel targeted. ADDED: Stahl was crafty in the way she phrased her question — nonquestion, really: I want to ask you all about something that’s going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They’re really afraid. African Americans think there’s a target on their back. Muslims are terrified. There's just this fear out there. She's not saying who scared who. She put black people and Muslims together. Muslims heard some specific policy proposals that are the basis of an appropriate question about fear. She did not mention Hispanic people, some of whom could be said to feel threatened by immigration proposals. But what's the Trump-connected basis for fear in black people? Trump's response was to say \"it’s horrible if that’s happening\" and to direct an attack at the press: \"they’ll take every single little incident that they can find in this country,\" even things that might have happened if he wasn't \"around doing this,\" and \"they’ll make into an event because that’s the way the press is.\" Stahl does not frame a follow-up question that specifies how she's tying Trump to the fear g oing on right now . She merely invites the Trump offspring \" to say anything about this fear that’s out there.\" \"Out there\" is an embarrassing tell. Donald Trump, Jr. steps up: \"I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded.\"",

      "text": "Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty Images A Chinese girl in Beijing buying goods from Amazon.cn. \nAmazon.com is finally taking counterfeiters to court. \nThe e-commerce giant for the first time has filed lawsuits against counterfeit sellers, after a number of businesses on Amazon voiced concern that knockoffs were killing their sales and endangering consumers. \nOn Monday, Amazon filed suit against a group of sellers for infringing on athletic training equipment developed by TRX. In a second case, Amazon sued sellers who are offering fake versions of a patented moving product called Forearm Forklift. \nLast month, CNBC.com featured Forearm Forklift , a Southern California company that has been crushed in recent years from counterfeiting on Amazon. Mark Lopreiato, the founder of the company, which makes straps for lifting and moving heavy equipment, said he submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to sellers and takedown notices to Amazon, yet fakes have continued to proliferate. \n\"When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers, and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand and causing irreparable reputational harm,\" the Seattle-based company said in the suits. \nThere's no way Amazon can litigate away the problem. The company generates over $75 billion a year in commerce, and about half the volume now comes from third-party sellers. However, with Amazon showing its willingness to take abusers to court, the company can at least hope to deter counterfeit sellers with the threat of potential legal action. \nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the cases. show chapters <p>Amazon counterfeits threat to businesses</p> <p>Mark Lopreiato, Forearm Forklift founder, discusses how Amazon counterfeits have been detrimental to his business.</p> Friday, 28 Oct 2016 | 4:46 PM ET | 03:55 \nBoth suits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington in King County. In the TRX suit, Fitness Anywhere , the creator of the training equipment, joined Amazon as a plaintiff. \nAmazon is the lone plaintiff in the case involving Forearm Forklift. The company claims that in addition to selling fake versions of patented products, the \"d efendants tried to further their fraudulent scheme by submitting forged invoices to Amazon purporting to show that their products were authentic.\" \nLopreiato called the lawsuit a public relations stunt, and said it's unlikely to have any real impact for his business. \nFor one, there's no monetary reward available to him — he's not a plaintiff — despite a plunge in his company's revenue from sales of cheaper knockoffs. Furthermore, he's concerned that because Forearm Forklift was named in the suit, the average consumer is going to think that his products are counterfeits along with all the others. \nRather than taking legal action, Lopreiato said Amazon should be working with the brands, responding to complaints and systematically removing counterfeits and suspending the sellers. As is, even if the businesses listed as defendants lose the suit, there are more than 100 infringers still on Amazon, he said. \n\"Where do I benefit in this at all?\" Lopreiato asked. \"There are dozens and dozens still listed on Amazon that can easily beat my price because they never paid for the patent, nor the pictures I took with my camera to market the Forearm Forklift, nor did they have to pay for product liability or workers' comp insurance policies.\" Amazon shares \nPerhaps Amazon is just trying to make a statement heading into the holiday rush. \nIn the suits, Amazon said it invests tens of millions of dollars in developing and deploying technology to weed out counterfeiters. When sellers sign up on the marketplace, \"Amazon's automated systems scan information about the sellers for signals that the sellers might be bad actors, and Amazon blocks those sellers during registration before they can offer any products for sale.\" show chapters <p>Counterfeiters on Amazon are putting this American company in jeopardy</p> <p>The president of Forearm Forklift explains why his business is on the brink of collapse because of knockoffs on Amazon.</p>",

      "text": "Channel 4 responds to rise of Netflix and Amazon with heavy investment in online programming By Jessica Goodfellow - 15 November 2016 17:30pm All4 new look \nChannel 4 is revitalising its on-demand platform All4, expanding into new content areas and pumping a multi-million pound investment into original and acquired online content as the broadcaster hopes to capitalise on the growth of connected TV viewing and compete with the giants in this space: Netflix and Amazon. \nAt its Upfronts today (15 November), the broadcaster unveiled a bold new interface for its on-demand platform to stand out in the connected TV space, and has designed the user experience to be tailored to each platform including iOS, Android and All4.com. \nThe new home screens herald greater personalisation, combining human curation with data-driven recommendations tailored for each user. \nChannel 4 also announced a multi-million pound increase in investment of original and acquired online content for All 4 in 2017. The broadcaster will also increase its brand-funded series, Shorts, which launched in 2014 and has so far produced 18 original series for 12 advertisers on the All 4 platform. \nFurthermore, the All 4 commissioning team revealed eight new thematic strands reminiscent of the kind of content commissioned by youth brands like Vice as it looks to better serve its millennial audience, currently reaching over half of all 16-34 year olds in the UK. \nThese include ‘New Romantics’, which will explore modern love in all its forms; ‘Rich Kids’, an examination of what it means to have a rich life; ‘Ballsy’, a home for those pushing life to the limits; and ‘Freaks & Uniques’, a look at extraordinary people living unbelievable lives. There are also strands for leading edge music and culture, gaming and the internet, topical series and mid-form millennial drama and comedy. \nRichard Davidson-Houston, head of All 4 and digital content at Channel 4, said: “This phase in All 4’s evolution sees us yank it out of the world of catch-up TV and into the expanding OTT space. In all aspects of the user experience from editorial to design and functionality, All 4 is becoming more personal and intuitive to use. Time is precious and our mission is to ensure that All 4 always hits the spot.”",

Amazon looks to July 2017 entry to Australia An Amazon Fulfillment Centre. Photo: Jeff Spicer ╳ exit \nRetail giant Amazon is expected to use the changes to the goods and services tax, slated for July 2017, as the catalyst for the start of its physical entry into Australia, according to analysts. \nBut it will take its time to enter to ensure it gets the model correct from the outset and will focus on grabbing market share from rival eBay. \nIn the May budget, the federal Government confirmed that from July 1, 2017, the GST would be applied to low-value imports of goods by Australian consumers. \nIt is designed to boost the competitiveness of domestic suppliers who incur GST on sales of low-value goods within Australia. \nCurrently, goods imported into Australia with a customs value that does not exceed $1000 are not subject to the GST. From July next year, it is proposed the GST will be applicable to goods below this threshold. \nAccording to Citi's retail analyst Craig Woolford​, Australia is one of three lucrative markets where Amazon only has its digital offer. \nSpeaking at the CBRE Large Format Retail Association forum in Sydney this week, Mr Woolford said the changes to the GST would be the catalyst for Amazon entry. \n\"I keep hearing they are looking at a site in Sydney's Eastern Creek, but that's unconfirmed,\" he said. \nProperty agents have also said the Goodman Group's $50 million industrial estate at Oakdale, in Sydney's west, could be a possibility. \n\"As we wrote in our August report, it's a case of when, not if, Amazon arrives in Australia,\" Mr Woolford told the audience of 250 retail developers and owners. \n\"One catalyst we flagged is, as of July 2017, the GST free threshold is scheduled to disappear ... so that the arbitrage of buying offshore online and not having to pay the 10 per cent GST is due to go. \n\"Perhaps that will be the catalyst for Amazon to look at entering the market as customers maybe more inclined to shop locally compared to international.\" \nBut Mr Woolford added: \"We are not in the camp that would likely suggest they will enter in 2017, but there are plenty of media headlines suggesting they are putting a lot of emphasis on this market.\" \nMr Woolford said his observation was that Amazon was still developing its model and entered markets on skinny margins and high volumes. \nHe said he still expected the giant to focus on electronics in the first stage of operation, then look at food and other sectors. \n\"The issue with food is that, sure it's a potential but, if you look at Amazon, their original success story and stomping ground is electronics, books and CDs,\" he said. \nMr Woolford said in selling food, you needed to have the right brand and Australian-centric brands were owned by food retailers, most of which had a large bricks and mortar presence so would not let Amazon undercut them. \n\"Amazon Fresh would be a disruptive force on the Australian grocery market, but developing the supply chain and dealing with Australia's lower capital city population density makes entry more challenging,\" he said. \n\"We expect Amazon would initially focus on its more successful general merchandise categories like electronics and toys.\" \nHe added Amazon's full product offer was likely to follow given Australia had all the right ingredients and would take inspiration from its US fulfillment solutions to deal with the distances in Australia. \n\"Based on other developed markets and recognising eBay's large presence in Australia, we expect Amazon could reach $3.5-4 billion in revenue,\" Mr Woolford said. \"This would be about 14 per cent of all online sales and 1.1 per cent of all Australian retailing.\" ",

Pulling it off with such intelligence and nuance is rare,\" said Amazon Studios' head of comedy and drama Joe Lewis. \n\"We're grateful for the audience response and we're excited to bring them more of Tig and Kate's brilliance in Season 2.\" \nThe series follows a fictionalized version of Notaro as she returns home to Mississippi following the unexpected death of her mother. \nNoah Harpster, John Rothman , and Stephanie Allynne also star. \nNotaro, Cody and Louis C.K. will also serve as executive producers for Season 2 alongside Robin, M. Blair Breard and Dave Becky.",

      "text": "A New York City subway car is covered in Nazi imagery to promote the new Amazon television series The Man in the High Castle. In this photo, the Nazi eagle appears on the American flag where the stars should be. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The New York Metro Transportation Authority has removed Nazi-themed subway advertisements for a new Amazon show, The Man In The High Castle , after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked that they be taken down. Featuring Nazi eagles and a variation on the Japanese rising sun flag, the advertisements blanketed the walls and seats of the subway car. Though the advertising blitz was limited to only one subway car on the S train, Cuomo requested that it be removed, according the local CBS affiliate . MTA officials confirmed to NPR that the advertisements have been taken down. The ads for The Man In The High Castle were pulled from the New York subway. Part of the advertisement covered seats in a design that evoked Japan's rising sun flag. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The Man In The High Castle , which is based on a book of the same name, is about what life may have looked like had Germany won World War II. But some people, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, found the imagery overwhelming\"While these ads technically may be within MTA guidelines, they're irresponsible and offensive to World War II and Holocaust survivors, their families, and countless other New Yorkers,\" de Blasio said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Amazon told NPR that the company did not ask MTA to pull the ads, which have been running in the subway since Nov. 16.\"Amazon Studios creates high-quality, provocative programming that spurs conversation. The Man in the High Castle, based on an acclaimed novel, explores the impact to our freedoms if we had lost World War II. Like Transparent and the movie Chi-Raq, stories that society cares about often touch on important, thought-provoking topics. We will continue to bring this kind of storytelling to our customers.\" Moxin24 I love my 4 from Vicki Staff Member Donor Pretty stupid ad campaign. Still even more fucked up that the ads were taken down by order of the governor. Danny Greene I lift things up and put people down. Donor Moxin24 said: ↑ Pretty stupid ad campaign.

      "text": "  \nGoogle’s first consumer WiFi router is now available for pre-order for $129… or you can buy a 3-pack for $299. \nThe reason you might want to consider buying more than a single router is that Google WiFi uses mesh networking to provide better coverage across your home. If you live in a studio apartment, one device is probably more than enough. But if you’re in a 4,500 square foot, multi-story house, Google WiFi is the latest in a series of mesh networking products that have launched this year designed to help blanket your home with wireless internet coverage. \nGoogle WiFi is up for pre-order from the Google Store , Amazon , and Best Buy , and it should begin shipping in December. \nToday’s launch comes a day after Google WiFi showed up at the FCC website and about a month and a half after Google introduced the product . \nThe router supports 802.11ac dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth LE, and 802.15.4 ZigBee wireless protocols, and uses 802.11s for mesh networking, so that you only need to plug a single device into your modem, but each Google WiFi router placed through your house will pick up the signal and amplify it to cover more territory. \nYou can use a smartphone app to set up and manage your network, much the way you could with Google’s app for OnHub routers from TP-Link and Asus… which was the strategy Google was taking last year, before the company decided to just build and sell its own routers.

      "text": "Amazon makes recruiting army veterans a priority | 13   Amazon makes recruiting army veterans a priority Ardine Williams By Angel Gonzalez SEATTLE — Ardine Williams, one of the lead recruiters for Amazon.com's fast-growing cloud computing unit, knows well the technical skills and can-do attitude veterans bring to the table. But she also knows, first hand, how hard it is to make those first steps in the civilian world. As a captain in the U.S. army signal corps during the 1980s, she had done specialized telecommunications work and data analysis. But in her first real foray into the private sector she found herself selling clothes at Gymboree, which as a young mother returning from Kuwait she joined \"because they had a great discount in kids' clothes.\" \"I really felt like I was lost,\" said Williams, 55. Now, after three decades and a successful career in pharmaceuticals and technology, she leads efforts to staff up Amazon Web Services, an Amazon division that has more than 6,000 jobs open worldwide, in the midst of a veritable war for talent among technology titans. She wants to open the door to as many veterans as she can who are a \"great fit,\" she says, for the company. Amazon says it has hired more than 10,000 veterans in the past five years, and vows to hire more than 25,000 veterans and military spouses in the next five. If Amazon keeps growing at the pace it's led in the past few years, there'll be plenty of space to absorb them, not only in cloud computing, but also in logistics and warehouse operations. There's what a company spokesperson calls a \"very active\" affinity group of veterans dubbed Amazon Warriors; and there are even a sizable number of recruiters with military backgrounds who make incorporating former service members a priority. The company's pledges come against a backdrop in which many large U.S. businesses have made incorporating veterans a top priority, a policy that has resulted in relatively low unemployment levels for former military. Examples abound, from software giants Microsoft and Uber to Starbucks. The coffee behemoth's CEO, Howard Schultz, even co-authored a book about veterans. But a divide remains between those emerging from the armed forces and their new civilian employers and co-workers, given the small percentage of the U.S. workforce that has any experience in the military. A survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that human-resources staffers \"often lack sufficient knowledge about military service or the skills acquired during that time,\" and that 44 per cent of veterans left their first civilian job within the first year, which they often took hurriedly to make ends meet. Williams managed to overcome the difficulty of the transition to military life because, as she puts it, her father goaded her into leaving her retail gig for \"a real job.\" His advice: Take a job that you know how to perform and take it from there, even if you feel you're overqualified for it. She found a spot as a technical writer at a pharmaceutical company. That soon opened the door to marketing, venture-capital work, executive roles in mergers and acquisitions, then to the top echelons of Intel's human-resources department. In 2014, a few months after retiring from the chipmaker, she was lured by AWS to help lead its gargantuan recruiting operations. \"It's incredibly difficult,\" she said of that first step into a civilian life. \"There are jobs in the military that very easily match civilian jobs. There are others who have no translation at all. How do you navigate the first transition is key.\" Amazon has several initiatives in the works to help with that first move. AWS works with Camo2­Commerce, an organization that seeks to connect veterans transitioning out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord with jobs and career development. In May, the company said it would train, free, 10,000 active-duty service members, as well as veterans and military spouses, in cloud-computing skills through online courses that can lead to certifications. The company also offers a 10-week internship to armed-forces personnel on active duty about to transition out of the service. \nSeattle Times",

      "text": "Who would have thought just a few short years ago that Amazon would be a market leader across several different hardware categories. Sure, Kindles have been the best eReaders in the business for quite some time now, but it took a while for Amazon to hit its stride in other areas. Now, the company makes some of the best tablets, wireless speakers and streaming media devices in the world. And guess what: thanks to a handful of special limited-time deals, you can save big by buying refurbished versions of six different popular Amazon devices like the Amazon Echo and the Fire TV Stick . All of Amazon's refurbs ship with the same warranty as a brand new device, so you've got absolutely nothing to lose by saving money on a refurbished device.

      "text": "E-commerce giant Amazon ( AMZN ) is expanding its service that allows customers to find local handymen and professionals, a move which could threaten the already troubled Angie's List ( ANGI ) .\nAmazon announced Monday that Amazon Home Services will be available in 20 more cities, bring the total to more 50 metropolitan areas across the U.S. including Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Cleveland, San Antonio, Raleigh, NC.\nThe Seattle-based e-commerce company first rolled out the service in 2015. Since its initial launch, the number of providers on Amazon Home Services has grown by over 1,500%, according to a company statement, offering more than 1,200 services such as lawn care, plumbing, electric work, home cleaning and more.\nAmazon has undertaken a bevy of ambitious projects outside its core of e-commerce in recent years, including its Echo home speakers and Alexa digital assistant, Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service (and rumored upcoming physical grocery store locations) and several brick-and-mortar bookstores.\nWith the expansion of its Home Services program, Amazon is taking on Angie's List, an online marketplace and review site that allows users to post comments about local service providers and businesses. Last year, the company rejected a $512 million takeover offer from IAC ( IAC ) , the parent company of HomeAdvisor, because it felt the bid was too low.\nNow Angie's List is in turmoil. CEO Scott Durchslag said during the company's third-quarter conference call on Nov. 1 that Angie's List would begin exploring strategic alternatives, and the company has reportedly begun laying off employees in an effort to save an additional $15 million to $20 million in costs this year.\nAmazon is held in the Growth Seeker portfolio.

      "title": "9 Smart Home products designed to integrate with your Amazon Echo or Google Home",
      "text": "By Derrick Miyao \nGoogle and Amazon are fighting for control of your home and that’s a good thing. With two of the largest tech makers in the world investing billions into smart products, it’s going to make our life at home a heck of alot easier. \nYou may have grabbed an Amazon Echo , Echo Dot or Google Home in the past few weeks and are finally learning its powers. For those of you who don’t own a smart speaker yet, let me tell you they are not a gimmick. They won’t be going away because they are truly helpful. I have three Google Homes spread out through my home, next to three Amazon Echo Dots with one Amazon Echo. I know it’s a bit of overkill, but it’s my job to figure out what’s the best for you and me. \nBoth speakers are very smart. The Amazon Echo has a leg up on the Google Home right now because it has been out for almost two years. Amazon has already been working with companies like Philips, Samsung, Honeywell and wemo to integrate smart home products with the Echo. Google has a ton of potential with its database and unmatched search, but it’s just not quite as developed as the Echo is. Personally I would take the Echo over the Home because Google has a long history of trying products and getting out leaving early adopters with a great concept. I’m not getting paid by Amazon to say that either. I love Google and Android, I’m just not a huge fan of Google’s side projects. \nRegardless of which one you choose, I just hope you’re happy with it. The smart speakers are so powerful with what they can do with simple voice commands. There’s no doubt all of us will have one in our homes in the next five years. \nFor those of you who already have a smart speaker, check out these nine great products for making your home smarter. Keep in mind, not all of these products will be compatible with Google Home yet, but they probably will soon. However all of the items listed are compatible with the Echo and Dot family. Philips Hue LED Starter Kit with 2 Bulbs & Hue Bridge Hub – $69.99 at Amazon This is easily my favorite home upgrade of the year. Two bulbs are definitely a start, but with this starter kit, you’re mostly paying for the hub which costs $60 on its own. Purchased separately, the two pack of LED bulbs are $30 . Once you connect the hub to your router, you can connect multiple smart LED lights to your home and creates zones for programming or voice commands. My living room lights are programmed to turn on at 4:30 pm every night so my dog doesn’t sit in the dark. I can then walk throughout my place and say “Alexa, turn on the office and bedroom lights” and it responds in an instant. I also dim the lights in my bedroom to 50% before I fall asleep to help my eyes relax. Additional white lights – 2-pack $29.99 at Amazon Philips Hue Ambience starter kit (for those who want colors in their lights) – $139.89 at Amazon Philips Hue Ambience light bulb single pack – $44.99 at Amazon (is compatible with the stock hub) Amazon Echo Dot and Philips Hue Start Kit – $99.99 at Amazon (save $20) Ecobee3 Thermostat with Sensor, Wi-Fi, 2nd Generation – $248 at Amazon One of the smartest upgrades you can do for your home is to change out your thermostat. The ecobee3 is a favorite amongst users, including myself for the ability to use external sensors. While one thermostat is great, it only sits in one part of your house. This one can adjust to your location by knowing which room you are in and change the temperature accordingly. I usually get cold at night and forget to turn the AC off – there’s nothing better than telling Alexa to turn off the AC without having to get out of bed or look at an app on my smartphone.

      "text": "Amazon Sues Sellers for Offering Fake Goods on Its Site--Update  48:  By Laura Stevens \nAmazon.com Inc. this week filed lawsuits targeting sellers allegedly listing counterfeit goods on its website, publicly cracking down on an issue that has caused increasing friction. \nThe two lawsuits, Amazon's first legal challenge against its third-party sellers for bogus products, pertain to fake versions of the Forearm Forklift, a strap system that allows users to lift heavy items, and TRX Suspension Trainer workout bands and products. The second lawsuit was filed jointly with Fitness Anywhere LLC, the company behind the authentic workout bands. \nAmazon has increasingly relied on third-party sellers to fuel its growth, and the online retail giant now has more than two million merchants listing items that comprise about half of all sales on its site. It also co-mingles many of the products in its warehouses with its own under a program known as Fulfillment by Amazon, where Amazon stores and ships items for sellers. \nBut opening its site to outside sellers has brought with it a greater chance for counterfeit goods to make it into its warehouses, sparking some consumer complaints and friction with the makers of branded products. \nIn July, shoemaker Birkenstock GmbH informed its retail partners it would stop selling to Amazon in the U.S. as of Jan. 1 and would no longer authorize third-party merchants to sell to the site because of high levels of counterfeits and knockoffs. \nLast month, Apple Inc. said in a lawsuit that fake power adapters and charging cables were rampant on Amazon and that some were being sold directly by the online retailer. Apple filed the suit against Mobile Star LLC, which it said Amazon had determined was the supplier of many of those products. A lawyer for Mobile Star said that the company doesn't knowingly traffic in counterfeit goods and that it is investigating Apple's allegations. \nAmazon has publicly stepped up efforts to combat counterfeiters in recent months. In August, the online retailer said it would start charging up to $1,500 in one-time fees and require invoices from manufacturers or distributors to prove that the sales by third-party sellers of certain brands were authorized. \nIn the suits, Amazon said it spends tens of millions of dollars on technology to identify counterfeits and that it employs a team that continually works to refine its anticounterfeiting program. Amazon said it uses technology to determine if new sellers might be bad actors, blocking some before they can sell on the site. \nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-15-161648ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Taking aim at counterfeiters, Amazon has filed two lawsuits against retailers that allegedly sell knockoffs through Amazon's platform.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed this week in Superior Court in King County, Washington, target several people who allegedly sold phony \"TRX\" fitness products, as well as individuals and two companies (ToysNet and Disk Vision) that allegedly sold fake \"Forearm Forklifts\" -- tools that help people move furniture.\n\"Amazon’s customers trust that when they make a purchase through Amazon’s website — either directly from Amazon or from one of its millions of third-party sellers — they will receive authentic products manufactured by the true manufacturer of those products,\" Amazon says in its court papers. \"A small number of bad actors seek to abuse that trust by creating Amazon Seller Accounts and using Amazon’s marketplace to market, sell, and distribute counterfeit goods.\"\nAmazon alleges that ToysNet, Disk Vision and the other defendants violated their contract with the online retailer, which prohibits the sale of counterfeits.\n\"Defendants used Amazon’s marketplace to market, sell, and distribute counterfeit TRX Products,\" Amazon alleges in the lawsuit centered on TRX fitness products, created by U.S. Navy Seal Randy Hetrick. \"Defendants have deceived Amazon’s customers and Amazon, infringed and misused the intellectual property rights of TRX, and harmed the integrity of Amazon’s marketplace, by selling and/or offering for sale unauthorized and unlicensed products,\" Amazon alleges.\nThe lawsuit regarding Forearm Forklift knockoffs includes similar allegations. Both lawsuits also include false advertising allegations, among other claims.\nAmazon's suits come as complaints about knockoffs on its platform have drawn wide attention.\nIn September, Apple sued the company Mobile Star for allegedly selling fake iPhone and iPad accessories through Amazon. Apple said in its complaint that it purchased more than 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products and cables over a nine-month period. Testing revealed 90% of those products to be fake, according to Apple.\nAmazon itself has defeated lawsuits over alleged counterfeits on its site. In one recent case, a jury in Seattle decided that Amazon wasn't responsible for knockoff Milo & Gabby pillowcases that third parties had offered for sale through Amazon.com. Milo & Gabby appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which will hear arguments from both sides on December 12.",

Wal-Mart holds the top spot, followed by Target Corp. Amazon occupies last place in the study, which is scheduled to be released Wednesday. \nThe report by Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a Washington-based coalition that advocates the use of more healthful products, ranked the 11 biggest merchants on a 130-point scale. The scores are based on 13 metrics, including ingredient disclosure, credible safety screening and efforts to find safer alternatives. \n\"Our policy is really to encourage a race to the top among leading retailers,\" said Mike Schade, who leads the group's retail campaign and co-wrote the report. \"It's more critical now than ever for big retailers, companies like Amazon and Costco, to use their multibillion-dollar purchasing power to drive toxic chemicals out of consumer products.\" \nConsumers, retailers and manufacturers are all taking a closer look at what goes into the products they buy, sell and make as evolving science points to harm even from small exposures of some chemicals and techniques. That's prompted the two largest U.S. retailers, Wal-Mart and Target, to introduce programs in the past three years to minimize the use of toxic ingredients in the products they offer. \nWal-Mart, Target and CVS Health Corp. were commended for \"making meaningful progress toward adopting policies for safer chemicals and products.\" Wal-Mart scored a B, with 78.5 points, closely followed by Target at 76.5. CVS was graded C, with a score of 53. \n\"We continue to apply a rigorous process in identifying chemicals of concern,\" said Eileen Howard Boone, a senior vice president at CVS Health. \"Our goal is to ensure we meet consumer demand for safe, effective and environmentally preferred ingredients and provide sufficient information to educate our customers.\" \nCostco holds the penultimate spot on the list, with an F grade and 9.5 points, while the Internet giant Amazon ranked last with 7.5. \nIn July, Wal-Mart released a list of eight high-priority chemical groups it's asked suppliers to eliminate, elaborating on a policy announced in 2013 to offer cleaning and personal-care products with safer ingredients. \nTarget, meanwhile, has expanded its own three-year-old program that rewards suppliers that list ingredients and choose safer substances. It added the cosmetics category and increased the number of substances it wants vendors to avoid. \nConcern about harmful substances in the products they come into close contact with \"is very much top-of-mind\" for its customers, said Jennifer Silberman, Target's vice president of wellness and sustainability. \"We know that our guests are asking for greater transparency.\" \nBest Buy Co. and Walgreens Boots Alliance have both promised to develop written safer chemical policies, the report said. They ranked fourth and seventh, respectively. \nWal-Mart, Costco and Walgreens didn't respond to a request for comment on the report, while Amazon had no immediate comment. Best Buy confirmed that it is working on a written policy but declined to comment further.",

      "text": "Amazon opens fulfillment center, to hire 350 workers Published 11:22 am,   PITTSTON, Pa. (AP) — The online retail giant Amazon says it has opened a nearly-400,000-square-foot building in northeastern Pennsylvania and is hiring 350 warehouse positions. The (Wilkes-Barre) Citizens' Voice ( http://bit.ly/2fW7su3 ) reports that Amazon opened a fulfillment center in CenterPoint Commerce and Trade Park West in Pittston Township. A Pennsylvania CareerLink Luzerne County spokeswoman says the company is recruiting for warehouse positions that pay $13 an hour. A spokesman inside the building and a representative of Mericle Commercial Real Estate Services both referred questions to Amazon's corporate headquarters, which didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Gov. Tom Wolf has said Amazon wants to add at least 5,000 new full-time jobs in the state over the next few years. ___ Information from: The Citizens' Voice, http://www.citizensvoice.com Most Popular",

Amazon's Alexa hops into your Hyundai with Blue Link skill 0 Share: \n\"Alexa, set my Ioniq to 69 degrees.\" \n\"Stop acting like a child, Andrew.\" Photo by Hyundai \nYour next Hyundai could always be set to a balmy 72 degrees when you hop into it each morning, thanks to Amazon 's Alexa voice service and Hyundai's Blue Link car connectivity platform. \nHyundai added a new skill to Alexa's ever-growing portfolio of capabilities . All it takes is a quick voice request to Alexa to start your car, charge the battery or preset the interior temperature. The internet of things is cool, but man, does it make us all sound super lazy. Alexa's new skill also lets owners lock and unlock the car, flash the lights or sound the horn, as well. \nBlue Link offers a variety of services beyond what Alexa can handle, as well. The Blue Link app lets owners locate their cars, call for roadside assistance or even help recover a car if it's been stolen. Blue Link also works with Android Wear and Apple Watch wearables. \nSadly, it doesn't work with every Blue Link-enabled vehicle. The car must come with the second generation of Blue Link. Every 2017 model is covered, including the forthcoming Ioniq , but only certain 2016 models can get in on the fun, including the Genesis, Azera, Tucson , Sonata, Sonata Hybrid , Veloster and Elantra GT. Three 2015 vehicles also work with Alexa -- the Genesis, Sonata and Azera. \nIt won't let any old Tom, Dick or Harry activate the vehicle, thankfully. Blue Link requires a PIN for security, and Alexa will prompt users for that PIN upon requesting a specific service. The Blue Link Alexa skill is available today.

      "text": "Taking aim at counterfeiters, Amazon has filed two lawsuits against retailers that allegedly sell knockoffs through Amazon's platform.\n\nThe lawsuits, filed this week in Superior Court in King County, Washington, target several people who allegedly sold phony \"TRX\" fitness products, as well as individuals and two companies (ToysNet and Disk Vision) that allegedly sold fake \"Forearm Forklifts\" -- tools that help people move furniture.\n\"Amazon’s customers trust that when they make a purchase through Amazon’s website — either directly from Amazon or from one of its millions of third-party sellers — they will receive authentic products manufactured by the true manufacturer of those products,\" Amazon says in its court papers. \"A small number of bad actors seek to abuse that trust by creating Amazon Seller Accounts and using Amazon’s marketplace to market, sell, and distribute counterfeit goods.\"\nAmazon alleges that ToysNet, Disk Vision and the other defendants violated their contract with the online retailer, which prohibits the sale of counterfeits.\n\"Defendants used Amazon’s marketplace to market, sell, and distribute counterfeit TRX Products,\" Amazon alleges in the lawsuit centered on TRX fitness products, created by U.S. Navy Seal Randy Hetrick. \"Defendants have deceived Amazon’s customers and Amazon, infringed and misused the intellectual property rights of TRX, and harmed the integrity of Amazon’s marketplace, by selling and/or offering for sale unauthorized and unlicensed products,\" Amazon alleges.\nThe lawsuit regarding Forearm Forklift knockoffs includes similar allegations. Both lawsuits also include false advertising allegations, among other claims.\nAmazon's suits come as complaints about knockoffs on its platform have drawn wide attention.\nIn September, Apple sued the company Mobile Star for allegedly selling fake iPhone and iPad accessories through Amazon. Apple said in its complaint that it purchased more than 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products and cables over a nine-month period. Testing revealed 90% of those products to be fake, according to Apple.\nAmazon itself has defeated lawsuits over alleged counterfeits on its site. In one recent case, a jury in Seattle decided that Amazon wasn't responsible for knockoff Milo & Gabby pillowcases that third parties had offered for sale through Amazon.com. Milo & Gabby appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which will hear arguments from both sides on December 12.",

Amazon Restaurants, however, never charges a delivery fee, making it a serious threat to leading industry competitors DoorDash and Postmates.\nIn Irvine, Prime members can choose from more than 50 restaurants, most of which are in Irvine. A few are in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa, including Newport Beach Brewing Co., Mezzet Mediterranean Cuisine (Costa Mesa) and North Shore Poke (Costa Mesa/Huntington Beach). \nIrvine is the sixth city in California, and the third this month, to join Amazon Restaurants. Other participating cities are San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, San Diego, and Los Angeles.\nUnlike other meal delivery services, Amazon Prime Now spokeswoman Amanda Ip said its restaurant meal program offers customers transparent pricing with no menu markups or hidden service fees for delivery. \n“If a customer finds a restaurant item on Prime Now that is priced higher than the regularly priced item on the restaurant’s current online menu within 24 hours of placing the order, Amazon will refund that customer the price of the item,” Amazon guarantees. \nJohn Cao, owner of East Borough restaurant in Costa Mesa, said he likes using Amazon’s restaurant delivery service because the company has a reputation for “quality and dependability” when it comes to door-step delivery.\nAmazon is broadening its meal delivery reach as on-demand services slowly heats up for restaurant meals. Roughly 12 percent of Americans say they have used a third-party delivery service in the past three months, according to a recent survey by market research firm Mintel.\n“While there’s no denying that Americans enjoy the dining out experience, we’re finding that more and more consumers want to enjoy their favorite restaurant meal in the comfort of their own home,” Mintel said.\nConsumers in Irvine can order from Amazon Restaurants using the “Prime Now” app or by visiting www.primenow.com",

      "text": "If you're a huge fan of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, but not a big enough one to have already bought a subscription to Amazon Prime ready to see their new show, then today is your lucky day. Amazon is offering £20 off its yearly Prime membership to coincide with the release of The Grand Tour, meaning UK customers have until the show's premiere date of November 18 to sign up to the service and get the first year's annual membership for just £59. So there's really no excuse not to tune into the new series. Especially now Clarkson has even sworn there will be no swearing on the show (even though he could if he wanted to). Related: Amazon reveals details of its mammoth Black Friday sales, and it's all starting very soon The Grand Tour is set to launch this Friday, and as the days count down the Amazon team have been dropping new teasers for the launch, complete with Hammond nearly becoming roadkill (he's fine though) and dropping the knowledge that a mammoth 27 cars have been harmed in the making of the series so far. The show has been shot in 4K Ultra High Definition and the 12-part first series will release new episodes weekly, taking us to a number of rather grand destinations across the globe as they do so. Nashville, Tennessee, Loch Ness, Scotland, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates are all on the filming destination list, but this week's episode will see The Grand Tour kick off in Los Angeles, California, where Jeremy, Richard and James will take their famous studio tent to Dry Rabbit Lake. Amazon Prime members can watch The Grand Tour via the Amazon Video app on smart TVs, streaming media players - including FireTV and FireTV Stick - Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, Wii U, on iOS and Android phones and tablets, and on the web. The offer is available right here and will end at 23:59pm on November 18, so what are you waiting for? ",

      "text": "AWS Makes Amazon QuickSight Available to all Customers Very fast, easy-to-use, cloud-powered business analytics service for one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions Infor, MLB Advanced Media, and Edmunds.com among the more than 1,500 preview customers using Amazon QuickSight November 15, 2016 05:40 PM Eastern Standard Time \nSEATTLE--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced that Amazon QuickSight is now available to all customers. Amazon QuickSight makes it easy for all employees within a company – regardless of their technical skill – to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data. More than 1,500 AWS customers, including global enterprises and startups from a range of industries, have been using Amazon QuickSight during its preview. These customers have experienced how seamlessly Amazon QuickSight connects to AWS and non-AWS data sources, and how fast the query performance is for its robust Super-fast, Parallel, In-Memory Calculation Engine (called SPICE). Pricing for Amazon QuickSight starts at $9.00 per user, per month – one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions – so customers of all sizes can make rich business analytics functionality available to all of their employees. To get started with Amazon QuickSight, visit https://quicksight.aws \nThe volume of data businesses create and process is growing every day. To get the most value out of this data, customers need to make it easy for all employees, regardless of their technical skill, to analyze data and share insights with others to drive decisions. However, the cost and complexity of traditional BI solutions prohibit most companies from making analytics ubiquitous across their organizations because these solutions require investments in costly on-premises hardware and software, weeks or months of data engineering time to build complex data models, and ongoing investments in additional infrastructure to maintain fast query performance as data sets grow. Amazon QuickSight is built from the ground up to solve these problems by bringing the scale and flexibility of the AWS Cloud to business analytics. Getting started with Amazon QuickSight is simple and fast. Customers simply log in to Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon QuickSight automatically discovers their data stored in AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon QuickSight also connects to third-party data sources such as Microsoft Excel or Salesforce.com. Amazon QuickSight formats the data and moves it to SPICE so it can be visualized in Amazon QuickSight, and customers can choose to keep the data in SPICE up-to-date as the data in the underlying sources change. \n“Amazon QuickSight makes business analytics much easier, more accessible, cost effective, and faster than ever before,” said Raju Gulabani, Vice President, Database Services, Amazon Web Services. “Because so many companies store data in AWS, it’s very appealing to these customers that Amazon QuickSight can automatically discover their data in AWS, move it to SPICE, and return query results so quickly – all for one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions.” \nBuilt from the ground up for the cloud, SPICE uses a combination of columnar storage, in-memory technologies enabled through the latest hardware innovations, and machine code generation to allow users to run interactive queries on large datasets and get rapid responses – even with thousands of users all simultaneously performing interactive analysis across a wide variety of AWS data sources. As users explore their data, Amazon QuickSight infers data types and relationships, issues optimal queries to extract relevant data, aggregates the results in the SPICE engine, and provides suggestions for the best possible visualizations of the data – from bar and line graphs to pie charts and scatter plots or heat maps and pivot tables. \nMLB Advanced Media (MLBAM) is a leader in digital media and content infrastructure, powering an ever-growing number of massively popular media and entertainment properties. “We have been using the preview version of Amazon QuickSight to get insights into our digital content business,” said Brandon SanGiovanni, Traffic Manager, MLBAM. “Amazon QuickSight and the SPICE engine allowed us to tear down and explore our data in a fraction of the time we expected, making it easy for us to tap into the value inside our data. Amazon QuickSight made it easy to slice and dice our data by simply pointing Amazon QuickSight to our AWS data sources. With just a few clicks, Amazon QuickSight provided us with a real-time, 360-degree view of our business without being constrained by pre-built dashboard and metrics, which allowed us to expand our use of data to make informed decisions regarding our products.” \nEdmunds.com is a leader and one-stop resource for automotive information online, and provides everything from prices for new and used vehicles, vehicle reviews, and true cost of ownership to tips and advice for car purchases. “At Edmunds.com, we have large amounts of data generated every single day in AWS, from website clickstream logs, vehicle transaction and inventory data, and third party datasets to our server and infrastructure logs,” said, Ajit Zadgaonkar, Head of Cloud Infrastructure, Edmunds.com. “Today, we use various tools to generate reports for the entire organization. However, there’s an increasing need to equip our business users with the ability to do their own ad-hoc data discovery and analytics to complement our centralized reporting. We are excited that Amazon QuickSight supports this self-service use case very well. Now that it is generally available, we’re looking forward to giving access to Amazon QuickSight to all of our business users because of its ease-of-use, fast analytics, deep integration with AWS data sources, and affordable price point.” \nInfor provides business applications specialized by industry and built for the cloud, to its more than 90,000 customers and 66 million cloud users. “We have been using Amazon QuickSight during preview to analyze large datasets from our customers and we are excited about the speed of SPICE and the ease of use of Amazon QuickSight,” said Steve Stahl, Senior BI Development Manager, Infor. “Amazon QuickSight’s SPICE engine is very fast and lets us quickly process these datasets and visualize the results while greatly simplifying integration with Amazon RDS and Amazon Redshift.” \nHotelbeds is a global distributor of accommodations serving more than 185 destination countries worldwide and more than 25 million room nights annually. “Hotelbeds’ platform that connects travel partners around the world is built on top of AWS and generates massive amounts of data every day, but our existing BI solution limits how we make these data and insights available to our business users,”said Miguel Iza, Head of Data and Analytics, Hotelbeds. “Amazon QuickSight is the ideal service to make this data available to our business users. After testing this new service in preview, we found Amazon QuickSight to offer great performance with its SPICE engine, and an easy-to-use user experience when it comes to analytics. Amazon QuickSight simplifies the way our users access their data, perform self-service analysis, and share insights with others. We plan to adopt Amazon QuickSight for our new data solutions and look forward to Amazon QuickSight democratizing business analytics in our company.” \nAmazon QuickSight is free for one user and one GB of SPICE capacity.

      "text": "Amazon Nabs 2013 Black List Script Holland, Michigan Posted on Pinterest Stumbleupon Pocket Tumblr Google Subscribe \nEvery December over 600 production company and film financier executives are surveyed about their most liked unproduced screenplays, and the result is known as The Black List . Back in 2013 Holland, Michigan , a spec script by Andrew Sodroski, sat among the top entries; and now it’s been snapped up by Amazon Studios. \nPer Deadline , Peter Dealbert ( Aftermath ) will produce for Pacific View Management & Production. \nHolland, Michigan is described as a Hitchock-ian style thriller with black humor, in which a Midwestern housewife suspects that her husband is having an affair. As she peels back the surface of her seemingly perfect life, she learns her husband might be leading a dark, secret life. \nA spring start date is hoped for so stay tuned for updates as they come.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nNeed some extra cash for your holiday shopping? Amazon is now issuing instant gift cards for customers who trade in used video games, laptops, and books via the company’s online storefront. \nPreviously, Amazon required trade-in customers to wait 10 days before receiving payment, in order to account for shipping time and item condition on arrival. Starting this week, the company is waiving its standard waiting period across multiple trade-in categories, starting with video games and select accessories. \nMore: Judge orders Amazon to pay back parents after their kids made unauthorized app store purchases \nAmazon’s trade-in program allows its customers to cast off their unwanted purchases in return for in-store credit. After picking a product to trade in via Amazon’s website, customers must then package the item and affix it with a prepaid shipping label before dropping it off at a UPS location for shipment. \nWhile Amazon’s policy still requires customers to ship out their items within seven days of submitting a trade-in request, the company is no longer delaying gift card payouts during shipment. Customers now have instant access to their trade-in credit after filling out the necessary forms at Amazon’s website, making it easier to turn their unwanted possessions into gifts and household necessities. \nAs part of its exchange program, Amazon scans previous customer purchases for suggestions regarding trade-ins. The site’s trade-in suggestions largely target video games purchased directly from Amazon, though items like headphones, tablets, laptops, and books also appear to be eligible for instant trade-in credit. \nAmazon’s trade-in credit favors current releases, and many recent games can be traded back to Amazon for a large percentage of their original retail price. Xbox One owners can trade in a boxed copy of Gears of War 4 for up to $26, for instance, while Paper Mario: Color Splash for the Wii U currently fetches a trade-in value of up to $30. \nCustomers who bought some of last year’s biggest releases via Amazon may be disappointed by current trade-in prices, however. The once-prized Pip Boy Edition of Fallout 4 can be traded in for just over $25, while the retail PlayStation 4 version of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain tops out at $6. \nAmazon customers can begin trading in their unwanted items for gift cards via this online form .

      "text": "53 minutes ago Image via Audible Treats \nToronto rapper Tasha The Amazon caught our attention earlier this year when her single \"Picasso Leaning\" topped the local Spotify charts. After releasing a stellar follow-up to \"Picasso Leaning\" with \"Prayer,\" Tasha now shares a new EP that's entirely self-produced alongside her partner Danthrax (together, they form the production duo Bass & Bakery). \nAs with \"Picasso Leaning\" and \"Prayer,\" Die Every Day is a relentless offering that perfectly encompasses Tasha The Amazon's no-holds-barred attitude and high energy, packed with fiery rhymes and raucous production. Deliciously rough around the edges, Die Every Day is the ultimate soundtrack for those days when you're feeling mischievously destructive. \n\"[We're] out here every day making our own traditions,\" Tasha told us over email about \"Prayer,\" and by the sounds of Die Every Day , the Toronto native is living by her own word. \nTasha The Amazon will be joining YG on Novemeber 29 in Los Angeles as a part of Redbull's 30 Days in LA 2016. Listen to Die Every Day below. Watch Now",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Stifel’s David Ross and J. Bruce Chan cut FedEx ( FDX ) to Hold from Buy–and it has nothing to do with Amazon.com ( AMZN ):\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images We upgraded the shares of FedEx Corp. a little over a year ago , with the thesis that we would see one last run before either 1) settling into a global economic pullback, or 2) becoming immersed in a challenging TNT integration. From there, FedEx didn’t go straight up and its path has been a bit of a roller coaster. And while we do not see an imminent global recessionâin fact, we believe there could be further market upside due to multiple expansion in the pre-Trump euphoriaâFedEx has hit our $186 target price, causing us to step to the sidelines rather than raise our estimates for the target multiple. For investors with a more bullish thesis, every P/E multiple point is worth >$12 in the share price, and we understand the rationale for a $200 target price. But in what we believe to be a still-fragile global economic environment with the heavy-lifting of the TNT integration ahead, we are choosing to take profits here and wait to re-enter at a later point…\nThis downgrade has nothing to do with Amazon or any other perceived competitive threat , as we believe there is significant growth ahead for FedEx, Amazon, and UPS ( UPS ) in the U.S. parcel market\nShares of FedEx have fallen 1.2% to $183.97 at 11:53 a.m. today, while Amazon.com has climbed 3.2% to $742.39, and UPS is off 0.6% at $112.22.",

The annual list features the Top 100 books of the year plus Top 20 lists across various categories. All lists are hand-selected by Amazon’s team of editors who read hundreds of thousands of pages throughout the year—choosing the best books of every month and then, finally, the best books of the year. To see the full list of the Best Books of 2016 and buy the print or Kindle editions, visit: http://amazon.com/bestbooks2016 \n“The editorial team had a handful of books that we seriously considered for the top pick but in the end our choice of The Underground Railroad was unanimous,” said Chris Schluep, Amazon Senior Book Editor. “Colson Whitehead’s novel is timely, important, and a great work of literature.” \nHere are the Amazon Editorial Team’s Top 10 picks this year: The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead : A brilliant, wise, fantastical yet grounded portrayal of a young slave seeking her freedom on a real underground railroad. The Wolf Road by Beth Lewis : Part literary thriller, part western, this is a debut novel about a young tomboy trying to survive a post-apocalyptic wilderness as she searches for her parents. Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance : A very personal tour of a segment of our culture that’s losing its way in modern America. The Nix by Nathan Hill : A big, smart novel about so many things: family, politics, revolution and the things we choose to remember (and forget). Mischling by Affinity Konar : Affinity Konar’s beautiful novel about twin sisters who survive Auschwitz is precisely crafted, acutely sensitive and ultimately uplifting and hopeful. Lab Girl by Hope Jahren : An inspiring and entertaining memoir about work, life and love from a plant scientist who is just as adept at analyzing the natural world as she is at illuminating human relationships. Another Brooklyn by Jacqueline Woodson : A poetic, breathtaking novel about growing up female and black in the 1970s—a time of conflicting pressures and sometimes crushing assumptions.

      "text": "Kourtney Kardashian has a fear of missing out.\nIn an interview with Amazon's Style Code airing on Thursday, the 37-year-old reality star dishes on juggling motherhood with a busy social life, and why she never slows down.\n\"It is like a 7:30 wake-up call, daily,\" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star says of her hectic schedule. \"But that's like to, you know, be a mom in the morning, have my mornings and then, I always have to do the gym. Every morning.\"\n\"I'm kind of like an all day and night person,\" she adds. \"Like, I don't stop. If people are like, 'What are you doing today?' I can literally send them the longest list.\"\nWATCH: Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick Dress Up as 'Avengers' With Their Kids — Check Out the Superhero Family\nIt's been especially hectic lately for the Kardashian-Jenner crew with Kanye West's Life of Pablo tour rolling into Los Angeles, and Kendall Jenner's epic birthday bash last week.\n\"I was talking on the phone to Khloe [Kardashian] last night and I was like, 'This is like a lot that I'm juggling,'\" explains Kourtney. \"It's been a busy two weeks. We've had the Pablo Kanye concerts. And then it was Kendall's 21st birthday, and then it was Halloween.\"\nDespite her packed schedule, the mother of three doesn't like to miss any events.\n\"There's been like so many things going on that I'm like, 'How do people have work, mom, and have a social life?' It's exhausting,\" she admits, adding, \"And I get fomo [fear of missing out], if I don't go to something—I have to go to everything.\"\nRELATED: Kourtney Kardashian Shares Adorable Pics of Penelope on Election Day\nThe reality star also gushed about spending \"tea time\" with her 3-year-old daughter, Penelope, and the toddler's love for makeup.\n\"She has a little vanity in her room that my mom got for her and North last year for Christmas,\" Kourtney shares.\n\"She loves makeup,\" Kourtney says of Penelope, before revealing another one of her daughter's beauty obsessions. \"She loves to put color in her hair. We found these natural powder colors, so they're not bad for you. She'll do those once a week, like a fun color.\"\nMORE: Kourtney Kardashian Says Penelope and North West Experiment With Makeup, Talks Her Sisters Being 'Critical of Each Other's Looks'\nRelated Articles\nJenna Dewan Tatum Shows Off Toned Abs Chrissy Teigen Goes Makeup-Free Jennifer Garner Slays On The Red Carpet",

      "text": "Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced that Amazon QuickSight is now available to all customers. Amazon QuickSight makes it easy for all employees within a company - regardless of their technical skill - to build visualizations, perform ad-hoc analysis, and quickly get business insights from their data. More than 1,500 AWS customers, including global enterprises and startups from a range of industries, have been using Amazon QuickSight during its preview. These customers have experienced how seamlessly Amazon QuickSight connects to AWS and non-AWS data sources, and how fast the query performance is for its robust Super-fast, Parallel, In-Memory Calculation Engine (called SPICE). Pricing for Amazon QuickSight starts at $9.00 per user, per month - one-tenth the cost of traditional BI solutions - so customers of all sizes can make rich business analytics functionality available to all of their employees. To get started with Amazon QuickSight, visit https://quicksight.aws \nThe volume of data businesses create and process is growing every day. To get the most value out of this data, customers need to make it easy for all employees, regardless of their technical skill, to analyze data and share insights with others to drive decisions. However, the cost and complexity of traditional BI solutions prohibit most companies from making analytics ubiquitous across their organizations because these solutions require investments in costly on-premises hardware and software, weeks or months of data engineering time to build complex data models, and ongoing investments in additional infrastructure to maintain fast query performance as data sets grow. Amazon QuickSight is built from the ground up to solve these problems by bringing the scale and flexibility of the AWS Cloud to business analytics. Getting started with Amazon QuickSight is simple and fast. Customers simply log in to Amazon QuickSight, and Amazon QuickSight automatically discovers their data stored in AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Amazon QuickSight also connects to third-party data sources such as Microsoft Excel or Salesforce.com. Amazon QuickSight formats the data and moves it to SPICE so it can be visualized in Amazon QuickSight, and customers can choose to keep the data in SPICE up-to-date as the data in the underlying sources change.",

      "text": "By Laura Stevens\nAmazon.com Inc. this week filed lawsuits targeting sellers allegedly listing counterfeit goods on its website, publicly cracking down on an issue that has caused increasing friction.\nThe two lawsuits, Amazon's first legal challenge against its third-party sellers for bogus products, pertain to fake versions of the Forearm Forklift, a strap system that allows users to lift heavy items, and TRX Suspension Trainer workout bands and products. The second lawsuit was filed jointly with Fitness Anywhere LLC, the company behind the authentic workout bands.\n\"When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand and causing irreparable reputational harm,\" the suits state. Both suits were filed Monday in Washington state court.\nAmazon has increasingly relied on third-party sellers to fuel its growth, and the online retail giant now has more than two million merchants listing items that comprise about half of all sales on its site. It also co-mingles many of the products in its warehouses with its own under a program known as Fulfillment by Amazon, where Amazon stores and ships items for sellers.\nBut opening its site to outside sellers has brought with it a greater chance for counterfeit goods to make it into its warehouses, sparking some consumer complaints and friction with the makers of branded products.\nIn July, shoemaker Birkenstock GmbH informed its retail partners it would stop selling to Amazon in the U.S. as of Jan. 1 and would no longer authorize third-party merchants to sell to the site because of high levels of counterfeits and knockoffs.\nLast month, Apple Inc. said in a lawsuit that fake power adapters and charging cables were rampant on Amazon and that some were being sold directly by the online retailer. Apple filed the suit against Mobile Star LLC, which it said Amazon had determined was the supplier of many of those products. Mobile Star wasn't immediately available for comment.\nAmazon has publicly stepped up efforts to combat counterfeiters in recent months. In August, the online retailer said it would start charging up to $1,500 in one-time fees and require invoices from manufacturers or distributors to prove that the sales by third-party sellers of certain brands were authorized.\nIn the suits, Amazon said it spends tens of millions of dollars on technology to identify counterfeits and that it employs a team that continually works to refine its anticounterfeiting program. Amazon said it uses technology to determine if new sellers might be bad actors, blocking some before they can sell on the site.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n 16:19 ET (21:19 ",

      "text": "Amazon takes counterfeit sellers to court for first time Ari Levy CNBC Wednesday, Nov 16, 2016 20160714_amazon_reuters.jpg Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. Amazon.com Inc on April 28, 2016 reported profit and revenue that blew past analysts' expectations, sending its shares soaring in after-hours trading and demonstrating the growing market power of its core retail business and new cloud services division. Reuters Print \nAmazon.com is finally taking counterfeiters to court. \nThe e-commerce giant for the first time has filed lawsuits against counterfeit sellers, after a number of businesses on Amazon voiced concern that knockoffs were killing their sales and endangering consumers. \nOn Monday, Amazon filed suit against a group of sellers for infringing on athletic training equipment developed by TRX. In a second case, Amazon sued sellers who are offering fake versions of a patented moving product called Forearm Forklift. \nLast month, CNBC.com featured Forearm Forklift, a Southern California company that has been crushed in recent years from counterfeiting on Amazon. Mark Lopreiato, the founder of the company, which makes straps for lifting and moving heavy equipment, said he submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to sellers and takedown notices to Amazon, yet fakes have continued to proliferate. \n\"When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers, and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand and causing irreparable reputational harm,\" the Seattle-based company said in the suits. \nThere's no way Amazon can litigate away the problem. The company generates over US$75 billion (S$106 billion) a year in commerce, and about half the volume now comes from third-party sellers. However, with Amazon showing its willingness to take abusers to court, the company can at least hope to deter counterfeit sellers with the threat of potential legal action. \nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the cases. \nBoth suits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington in King County. In the TRX suit, Fitness Anywhere, the creator of the training equipment, joined Amazon as a plaintiff. \nAmazon is the lone plaintiff in the case involving Forearm Forklift. The company claims that in addition to selling fake versions of patented products, the \"defendants tried to further their fraudulent scheme by submitting forged invoices to Amazon purporting to show that their products were authentic.\" \nLopreiato called the lawsuit a public relations stunt, and said it's unlikely to have any real impact for his business. \nFor one, there's no monetary reward available to him - he's not a plaintiff - despite a plunge in his company's revenue from sales of cheaper knockoffs. Furthermore, he's concerned that because Forearm Forklift was named in the suit, the average consumer is going to think that his products are counterfeits along with all the others. \nRead also: 90% of Apple chargers sold on Amazon could be counterfeit, Apple says in lawsuit \nRather than taking legal action, Lopreiato said Amazon should be working with the brands, responding to complaints and systematically removing counterfeits and suspending the sellers. As is, even if the businesses listed as defendants lose the suit, there are more than 100 infringers still on Amazon, he said. \n\"Where do I benefit in this at all?\" Lopreiato asked. \"There are dozens and dozens still listed on Amazon that can easily beat my price because they never paid for the patent, nor the pictures I took with my camera to market the Forearm Forklift, nor did they have to pay for product liability or workers' comp insurance policies.\" \nPerhaps Amazon is just trying to make a statement heading into the holiday rush. \nIn the suits, Amazon said it invests tens of millions of dollars in developing and deploying technology to weed out counterfeiters. When sellers sign up on the marketplace, \"Amazon's automated systems scan information about the sellers for signals that the sellers might be bad actors, and Amazon blocks those sellers during registration before they can offer any products for sale.\" Related Stories ",

      "text": "Amazon takes counterfeit sellers to court for first time CNBC | Wednesday, Nov 16, 2016 Wednesday, Nov 16, 2016 \nAmazon.com is finally taking counterfeiters to court. \nThe e-commerce giant for the first time has filed lawsuits against counterfeit sellers, after a number of businesses on Amazon voiced concern that knockoffs were killing their sales and endangering consumers. \nOn Monday, Amazon filed suit against a group of sellers for infringing on athletic training equipment developed by TRX. In a second case, Amazon sued sellers who are offering fake versions of a patented moving product called Forearm Forklift. \nLast month, CNBC.com featured Forearm Forklift, a Southern California company that has been crushed in recent years from counterfeiting on Amazon. Mark Lopreiato, the founder of the company, which makes straps for lifting and moving heavy equipment, said he submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to sellers and takedown notices to Amazon, yet fakes have continued to proliferate. \n\"When customers purchase counterfeit goods, it undermines the trust that customers, sellers, and manufacturers place in Amazon, thereby tarnishing Amazon's brand and causing irreparable reputational harm,\" the Seattle-based company said in the suits. \nRead also: 90% of Apple chargers sold on Amazon could be counterfeit, Apple says in lawsuit \nThere's no way Amazon can litigate away the problem. The company generates over $75 billion a year in commerce, and about half the volume now comes from third-party sellers. However, with Amazon showing its willingness to take abusers to court, the company can at least hope to deter counterfeit sellers with the threat of potential legal action. \nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the cases. \nBoth suits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington in King County. In the TRX suit, Fitness Anywhere, the creator of the training equipment, joined Amazon as a plaintiff. \nAmazon is the lone plaintiff in the case involving Forearm Forklift. The company claims that in addition to selling fake versions of patented products, the \"defendants tried to further their fraudulent scheme by submitting forged invoices to Amazon purporting to show that their products were authentic.\" \nLopreiato called the lawsuit a public relations stunt, and said it's unlikely to have any real impact for his business. \nFor one, there's no monetary reward available to him - he's not a plaintiff - despite a plunge in his company's revenue from sales of cheaper knockoffs. Furthermore, he's concerned that because Forearm Forklift was named in the suit, the average consumer is going to think that his products are counterfeits along with all the others. \nRead also: Birkenstock quits Amazon in US after counterfeit surge \nRather than taking legal action, Lopreiato said Amazon should be working with the brands, responding to complaints and systematically removing counterfeits and suspending the sellers. As is, even if the businesses listed as defendants lose the suit, there are more than 100 infringers still on Amazon, he said. \n\"Where do I benefit in this at all?\" Lopreiato asked. \"There are dozens and dozens still listed on Amazon that can easily beat my price because they never paid for the patent, nor the pictures I took with my camera to market the Forearm Forklift, nor did they have to pay for product liability or workers' comp insurance policies.\" \nPerhaps Amazon is just trying to make a statement heading into the holiday rush. \nIn the suits, Amazon said it invests tens of millions of dollars in developing and deploying technology to weed out counterfeiters. When sellers sign up on the marketplace, \"Amazon's automated systems scan information about the sellers for signals that the sellers might be bad actors, and Amazon blocks those sellers during registration before they can offer any products for sale.\" No comments yet.Be the first to post comment. follow us ",
