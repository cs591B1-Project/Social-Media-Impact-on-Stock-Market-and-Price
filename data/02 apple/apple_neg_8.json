      "text": "Home > DT Daily > Apple iPhone 8 may feature long-range wireless… Apple iPhone 8 may feature long-range wireless charging ability Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nGoPro’s Karma drone crashes into a recall – but is there hope in the smoke? \nFollowing last week’s financial near-death experience with their stock, now comes news that GoPro is recalling ALL of its recently sold Karma drones . Following reports from users that a small number of the drones have shut off and plummeted to the ground mid-flight, GoPro is telling buyers to return the drones now for a full refund . Additionally, GoPro says that replacement drones are not in the mix – at least, not yet. \nA recall like this could not have come at a worse time: just before the holidays – you know a lot of those drones were going to be gifts – and right after GoPro had a dismal quarter that saw its stock fall by nearly half. Yet, we have to give the company’s leaders due respect for doing the right thing. Following the bungling of the Note 7 recall by Samsung, GoPro’s quick action is a lesson in corporate responsibility no matter the consequences, even if it kills the company. \nIndeed, while the drone recall is another gut-punch for the company, it might help it in the long run in terms of good faith and renewed sales from consumers down the road. GoPro said about 2,500 Karma drones were sold before sales were halted. So far there have been no reports of injuries from malfunctioning Karma drones, and we have a link here to get you started on returning yours. \nA new (but also really old) way to think about charging stuff up \nDespite solid sales of Apple’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the tech world continues to look forward to the iPhone 8, which will arrive on the 10 th anniversary of the original iPhone and is expected to be a radical departure from current designs, with an OLED screen, possibly top to bottom, a glass back, better cameras and so forth. But BGR is reporting they are seeing solid information that the phone could house a very novel wireless charging ability. \nBGR says Apple has been working with Energous , a tech outfit that is developing a kind of wireless charging system that charges the phone in your pocket while you’re in your house or at work, no matter where you are in the building for the most part. In truth, it’s not new tech or even that complex: genius inventor Nicola Tesla demonstrated such a system over a century ago. But so far, no one has incorporated the tech into a cell phone, and it could be a game changer. \nImagine your phone charging up in your pocket wherever you are: at home, work, on the train, in your car, wherever. More than any fancy new camera or appearance change, it’s a feature that could change the way we think about charging up our phones – or charging anything at all. \nApple’s new Touch Bar MacBook Pro is touching some stellar sales numbers \nMore Apple news now: the new MacBook Pro, with its fancy video Touch Bar, is a certified monster hit, according to Slice Intelligence. \nSlice analyzed data from over 4 million shoppers and says that in just its first five days on sale, it outsold the Microsoft Surface Book sale totals for all of the last year by a factor of four. Apple has also indicated the new laptops are on full hot, with Phil Shiller saying Cupertino is ramping up production to meet demand. Granted, there was a lot of pent-up demand for the new MacBooks after a four-year stretch of no real redesign, but these sales results are unexpected. \nWant one for yourself right now? Good luck! Right now, it’s looking like a four or five week wait for new units to ship. ",

And while at first glance it might seem like Apple is lagging behind rivals here, Cupertino actually has a plan of offering wireless charging on the next iPhone, but not in a way you’re already used to. In the last few months, we’ve seen several hints that Apple might be working on a wireless charging system that would allow the iPhone to charge without a charging plate, as it’s the case with the existing implementations, but using transmitters that can be plugged in anywhere in a room. The main idea here is that you could be able to charge the iPhone whenever the device is in a close range to the transmitter, and it appears that this is exactly what Apple is aiming for right now.

      "title": "Feral Interactive brings classic strategic gaming to iPad with ‘Rome: Total War’",
      "text": "The classic AAA strategy game \"Rome: Total War\" is now available for Apple's iPad tablets. For a mere $10, players get the full strategic experience instead of paying an initial sum and facing in-game purchase options for the remaining content. More Apple device owners who are itching to play a new AAA strategy game on the go can now purchase the classic Rome: Total War originally published by Sega for Windows-based PCs in 2004. This touch-enabled version is available on Apple’s App Store through Feral Interactive, the same publisher that brought Rome: Total War to the Mac in 2010.\nAccording to Feral Interactive, the company is offering a full, complete release of Rome: Total War for a mere $10, meaning customers won’t have to deal with in-game purchases to unlock most of the game. However, Apple customers will need to own the iPad Air or later, or the iPad Pro. These devices will also need 4GB of free space and iOS 9.3.5 or later installed.\nMore: Sega acquires ‘Endless Space’ creator Amplitude Studios\nDespite its PC-based roots, this version of Rome: Total War is “heavily optimized” for the Apple-based tablets. The controls were retooled to work optimally on the large touchscreen to provide the full Rome: Total War experience. Thanks to this, players have easy access to all the main components with a simple tap on the screen.\nOn the camera front, players can drag their finger across the screen to move the camera. They can also use the typical pinch-to-zoom touch function to get a close look at the field and troops. Players can even rotate the camera using a thumb and finger, and tap on the screen to directly select/deselect a specific unit. Want to control more than one unit? Simply draw a virtual circle around every unit to control them all at once.\nTo order troops to a specific location, players can direct more than one unit by drawing the virtual circle and then tap on a specific location. Another method is to draw a circle around the units the player wants to move, and then draw a specific path on the screen leading to the desired location. The general formation of all the units can be changed by selecting everyone and then dragging two fingers in the desired direction.\nAs for battle, players simply attack by tapping on the enemy forces, or by drawing a path to the opposing army. The overall time frame can be adjusted, too, by using a single finger and tapping on the timer control panel located in the screen’s top-right corner. This panel consists of pause, play, fast-forward, and 2x fast-forward virtual buttons.\nGiven that Rome: Total War was originally designed for a Windows-based PC, the interface and controls relied on a keyboard and mouse. David Stephen, Managing Director at Feral Interactive, said that converting this experience to a touch-based tablet form factor was a huge design and programming challenge.\n“Our aim has been to bring this classic to a new and very different platform without compromising its enormous content, superb gameplay or strategic depth,” he said. “Working closely with Creative Assembly, I believe we have done that and am confident that Total War veterans and novices alike will enjoy the result.”\nThe Creative Assembly is the originating developer of Rome: Total War , which at launch was published by Activision. Sega later purchased the developer as a European subsidiary, and thus acquired the rights to Rome: Total War and subsequent games under the Total War brand. The Creative Assembly has developed other games as well including the recent Alien: Isolation .\nEverything you need to know about Google Daydream ‘XCOM 2’ adds controller support on PC to give players a first-person perspective",

      "title": "Hold up! Could Apple's AirPods actually drop next week?",
      "text": "Text Shortly after Apple committed headphone port murder back in September, it also happened to reveal a slick, wireless solution - the AirPods. While many were already sceptical of the toothbrush-head-looking buds, things got even worse when the Cupertino giant announced it would need \"a little more time\" before dropping them onto users. The AirPods were originally set for a late October release, though anybody looking to pick up the devices on Apple's site have been met with a 'currently unavailable' tag since the delay. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Fear not, though, wireless-needy Apple fans, help could be drifting over the horizon. According to German blog Apfelpage , an employee at Apple reseller Conrad has stated that the AirPod stock will arrive on 17 November, and will go on sale on 18-19 November. In the always-hilarious attempt by Google Translate to figure out what's going on, Apfelpage writer Robert Tusch seemingly said: \"Hello, I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today. Most Popular \"According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between 18-19 November.\" Google Translator's version of Tusch's account also revealed how this would end the \"long thirst\" for the AirPods, which is actually a pretty accurate representation of the current struggle. Currently, Conrad's site states that the AirPods will be available for delivery in eight weeks, though this is likely a placeholder until Apple drops some official news. After all, it would be a huge surprise if we didn't see people losing the AirPods down drains in time for Christmas. Despite logical reason pointing to a release sooner rather than later, this info massively contradicts another recent report, which stated that the AirPods wouldn't be released until January. ",

The day before the company's disappointing earnings report, AAPL closed at its best level of the year. This post-Oct. 25 flush has included nine losses over the last 12 sessions. Today the stock has reached a very important level. Apple (AAPL) -- Moving Averages View Chart » View in New Window » \nThe day after AAPL marked its September low with a key upside reversal, a high-volume surge began. The stock began the next day with a breakout gap, leaving behind a major bottom near the 200-day moving average. Less than a month later, AAPL had gained over 15% and was well into new 2016-high territory. Earlier today, the stock tested very solid support near the Sept. 13 breakout gap. This is the upper band (see my Nov. 3 Columnist Conversation post) of the zone that runs from $106 to $105 and includes the January high as well as the Sept. 13 gap. Just below is a scooping 200-day moving average near $103.60....59  ",

      "text": "Apple, Amazon, Facebook fall as technology antipathy continues Disney advances as investors focus on forecast over earnings Share on Facebook \nU.S. stock-index futures fell, indicating the S&P 500 Index will halt a four-day winning streak, as investors continue to parse the implications of a Donald Trump presidency for the economy and interest rates. \nS&P 500 Index contracts expiring in December slid 0.6 percent to 2,154.25 at 6:35 a.m. in New York. The equity benchmark capped its longest winning streak since July yesterday, as financial companies extended gains, although progress was tempered by losses in technology and some defensive stocks. Bucking the trend, the Nasdaq 100 Index dropped the most since September. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,714, today, after the index posted its first record close in three months. \nAs the dust settles after the shock election result, the spotlight is intensifying on Trump’s policies and the possible winners and losers. Financial and health-care industries have so far emerged as the most likely beneficiaries amid speculation that the president-elect and Republican-controlled Congress will pare down regulations. Trump’s promise to revive the nation’s infrastructure means commodities needed for everything from airports to bridges will benefit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \n“The U.S. market is having a think about what a Trump presidency means,” said Paul Wildman, an analyst at Avalon Capital based in London. “I don’t think it will be terrible for business despite perhaps some protectionism. The market is worrying about not just one rate rise in December, it’s looking down into next year and thinking maybe the Fed might have to raise two or three or four times next year.” \nInvestors are also considering what a Trump presidency means for Federal Reserve policy and the trajectory of interest rates. Odds for a December increase in borrowing costs have risen to 80 percent from 78 percent a week ago. The University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment in November will be scrutinized today for indications of the health of the world’s biggest economy. \nAs Trump prepares to take over the White House, earnings season is coming to an end. About 76 percent of companies that reported so far beat profit projections and 56 percent topped sales estimates. Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth of 2.5 percent for the benchmark’s constituents, reversing forecasts for a 1.6 percent decline at the start of the month. \nAmong stocks moving in premarket New York trade, technology companies continued their declines, with Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. each losing more than 1 percent. \nWalt Disney Co. climbed 1.1 percent after predicting renewed growth next year and beyond even as fourth-quarter profit fell short of estimates. Nvidia Corp surged 13 percent after the biggest maker of graphics chips used by computer gamers forecast quarterly sales that signaled continued strong demand for its signature products and gains in new markets such as data centers.

      "text": "Posted November 10,   Apple iPhone , iPad \niPhone’s iOS 10 has a little-known feature that can help you avoid missing important calls. Who has used the Do Not Disturb feature of our iPhones only to find out later that a certain important call or message went unnoticed because the phone forced incoming calls and messages to be silent? This is one downside of iPhone’s Do Not Disturb feature. Luckily, Apple has acknowledged the fact that certain contacts must be able to reach you at all times. To address this situation, Apple has introduced Emergency Bypass on iPhone. \nEmergency Bypass on iPhone will allow specific contacts to reach you even if you have enabled the Do Not Disturb feature on your iPhone. Messages and calls from selected contacts will have a ringtone and will bypass Do Not Disturb’s silent mode. This tutorial explains two ways to use Emergency Bypass: How to enable Emergency Bypass for messages \nHow to Enable Emergency Bypass for Calls on Your iPhone To hear an incoming phone call’s ringtone even if Do Not Disturb is turned on,   Press your iPhone’s Home button to get to the Home screen . 2. From the Home screen, tap on the Phone icon in the lower-left corner of the screen. 3. Once you are in the Phone app, tap on Contacts . 4. Tap on the contact that you want to set on Emergency Bypass. 5. Tap on the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the contact’s page. 6. Tap on the Ringtone option. 7. Turn ON Emergency Bypass by tapping on the switch button . 8. If you want, you can select a ringtone for the contact. 9. Tap on Done to save changes. 10. Emergency Bypass is now enabled for calls from the selected contact. \nHow to Enable Emergency Bypass for Messages on Your iPhone To disable silent mode for messages when you are on Do Not Disturb,   Press your iPhone’s Home button to get to the Home screen . 2. From the Home screen, tap on the Phone icon in the lower-left corner of the screen. 3. Once you are in the Phone app, tap on Contacts . 4. Tap on the contact that you want to set on Emergency Bypass. 5. Tap on the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the contact’s page. 6. Tap on the Text Tone option. 7. Turn ON Emergency Bypass by tapping on the switch button . 8. If you want, you can select a message tone for the contact from the available Alert Tones and Ringtones. 9. Tap on Done to save the changes. 10. Emergency Bypass is now enabled for messages from the selected contact. \nYou can use the same process for other contacts if you want to allow more people to reach you even when Do Not Disturb is active.

      "title": "An Apple iPhone 7 Plus reportedly exploded in China after a 50 centimetre fall",
      "text": "According to a report on Chinese web site Leikeji , the battery of a brand new iPhone 7 exploded, with the cracked screen violently separating from chassis. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco lead to the largest fire and burn hazard related product recall in United States history. But with the iPhone 7 Plus, there seems to be a trigger to the explosion – a fall. Lithium based smartphone batteries are extremely volatile, and exposure to either moisture or heat can make them explode. This is what happens when you puncture a modern smartphone battery.\n\nUnlike the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosions though, the reported incident in China was not a case of spontaneous smartphone combustion. The battery reportedly exploded after a fall. However, a fall of just 50 centimeters is not a large height, and is not an encouraging sign. The phone shocked the user, started emitting smoke, and then caught fire. The user apparently had opted to purchase an Apple iPhone 7 Plus, after reading news reports of exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones.\n\nIn August, a man riding a motorcycle in Australia got the shock of his life when he fell off his bike and his iPhone exploded in his pocket . The heat fused the model to his leg, and he had to punch the phone free. In September an iPhone apparently exploded while still in the box. There were no follow up posts or information after the initial reddit post, but the user manual in the box indicates that the phone was not the latest iPhone 7 . In October, an iPhone 7 wrapped in clothes and kept in the back seat of a closed car in a sunny beach, caught fire because of the heat . The entire vehicle was engulfed in flames.\nBy comparison, over 30 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 incidents were reported over the last week in August.\nThe post An Apple iPhone 7 Plus reportedly exploded in China after a 50 centimetre fall appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Swimming with Apple Watch Series 2 and Fitbit Flex 2 We spend some serious pool time with the two waterproof wearables   @michaelsawh \nAfter years of users asking for it, Fitbit finally gave the world its first waterproof fitness tracker by launching the Flex 2 . Apple meanwhile decided the Watch Series 2 was the right time to give its smartwatch a more swim-friendly design. But both companies didn't just stop there. They went one step further offering lovers of the sea and the pool the ability to track their swimming performance as well. \nWaterproofing is always high on our list of priorities, but clearly it's a lot more difficult than it seems. Fitbit revealed that it encountered Flex 2 production issues making the tracker waterproof. But it pulled it off, and we're glad it did but it has been a long time coming. \nRead this : Best swimming trackers reviewed and rated \nSo how does Fitbit's first swim tracker skills compare to the the one that Apple has packed into the Series 2? We've been spending some time with both in the pool to find out. We'll be adding our thoughts on how they fare for open swim tracking once we've had spent some more time testing them out. Wearing them in the pool \nIf your wearable is not equipped to deal with the rigours of a workout in the water, then it's already failed. It can track all the metrics in the world, but if it feels clunky or unwieldy when you're swimming, it's probably (definitely) going to get ditched. The good news on both fronts is that you won't have any problems like that with the Series 2 or Flex 2. \nRead this : Apple and Fitbit waterproofing ratings explained \nOnce you've paired the Series 2 with a suitably sporty strap, it really is a comfortable swim tracker to wear. We've lived with the smaller 38mm model, and it's light, unobtrusive and does not budge. Unlike the Flex 2, it does have the benefit of a full touchscreen display, but that's inactive once you enter swim tracking mode. It's fine though, because Apple's reliable gesture support means a flick of the wrist will illuminate the screen to let you cast an eye over your performance. Buy Now Amazon \nOnce you've completed a swim, a twist of the digital crown gives you back control of the touchscreen to pause or end a workout. You'll also initiate the eject water mode, which gets rid of the water through the Watch's speaker. It's a clever way to deal with the potential build up of water inside the device. \nThe Flex 2 is even slimmer and lighter than the original Flex, which means it barely takes up any wrist space. You don't have the screen, but there is an LED notification display that gives you a quite clear visual indication of how much swim time you've put in. One light equals 10 minutes and so on. Fitbit has vastly improved the clasp on the Flex 2 as well, which means you're not going to need to worry about this falling off. It might be a little trickier to take off afterwards, but it's very secure to wear in the water. Swimming metrics \nWhen it comes to what you can actually track in the water there's a more noticeable difference between the two devices. Apple simply offers a lot more than Fitbit in this department. \nWith the Series 2, whether you head into the Workout app on the Watch or the Activity app on your iPhone, it's recognising stroke type, workout duration, active calories, average heart rate, lengths and average pace (broken down by every 100 metres). That's the kind of data you'd normally associate with a dedicated swimming watch. \nFitbit keeps things more simple, recording lengths, workout duration and estimated calorie burn. It simply does not have the sensors on board to deliver what the Apple Watch Series 2 can do. When you put it into perspective of other similarly priced fitness trackers that can offer swim tracking though, it's about the standard we've come to expect. That might actually be enough for casual swimmers who are putting in 20 minute swims as opposed to much longer sessions. The accuracy test \nApple Watch Series 2 (left and centre) and Fitbit Flex 2 (right) \nAs far as giving you data you can rely on, we're very impressed with our initial testing with the Series 2, and it's more of the same up against the Flex 2. It's hands down one of the best swim trackers we've used in the pool. The TomTom Spark has been our go-to device for testing accuracy. Swim tracking is not its core feature, but it does have a swim tracking mode that proved very accurate in our big swim tracker test earlier this year. \nThe screenshots above really tell the story of our experience swimming with the Flex 2 and the Series 2 over the last couple of weeks. While the Flex 2 tended to be a little off on the lap count, the Series 2 was at most one length out from the Spark, and that was probably just on a single occasion. When paired against each other there was usually a one two to lap difference. \nThis may well be to do with the manner in which these two trackers log activity. While you have to manually start tracking a swim session from the Workout app on the Series 2, Fitbit uses its automatic activity recognition technology to work out when you're swimming as long as you are consistently swimming for a set period of time. 10 minutes of swim time should really be the minimum. Dealing with the data \nWhen it comes to looking back at the swim data and providing some analysis on performance, this is where both are a bit lacking. More so the Fitbit. The Flex 2 tags your swim as an exercise activity logged inside the companion app, but there are no insightful graphs or any attempt to put the swimming data to any really meaningful use apart from the impact it's had your daily activity goal. Serious swimmers are just not going to get the depth they crave. \nEssential reading : Top Apple Watch tips and tricks \nIt's a similar story with the Series 2 though. All of the data lives inside the Activity iPhone app, which you can share in multiple places. There are a few pretty graphs, but no way to export the data to analyse a little more closely. The good news though is unlike the Flex 2, there are dedicated swimming apps including those from Swim.com and MySwimPro that do more with the data. So if you want a meaningful look at your swim sessions, the Apple Watch is the one. The verdict \nSo what's it like swimming with the Fitbit Flex 2 and the Apple Watch Series 2? Pretty good, but for very different reasons. With the Series 2, there's the screen to view progress in real time, which the Flex 2 lacks and that can feel a bit of hinderance when you don't really know where you're at during your session. In our testing, the Series 2 also proved more accurate as well. That's not to say we weren't impressed with the Flex 2 too, but it was a little off at times. \nThe Flex 2 is a more simplified experience (and significantly cheaper), but in terms of comparing it to other dedicated fitness trackers that claim to offer the same automatic swim tracking (we're looking at you Speedo Shine 2 ), it does offer a more reliable experience and one that lets you focus on putting in those lengths. If you want the accuracy and the depth, go for the Series 2. If you're not obsessed with pools of data but still want those sessions to count towards you quest to get in shape, the Flex 2 is not a bad option either.

      "text": "Back in the good ole' days, Apple would announce a product and you'd be able to pick it up in stores within a week or two. In fact, the Apple faithful, way back when, used to mercilessly mock tech companies who were prone to unveiling vaporware or introducing products that weren't set to ship for months if not years on end.\nDON'T MISS: Target Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals\nApple isn't quite that bad, but in recent memory, the company has seemingly fallen into a trap of unveiling new products before they're necessarily ready to ship. The most recent example of this is the company's AirPods. Originally introduced alongside the iPhone 7, Apple's AirPods were positioned as a sleek and high-tech solution designed to address complaints surrounding Apple's removal of the iPhone 7's 3.5mm headphone jack.\nWhen Apple introduced its new wireless headphones in early September, the company said it would ship sometime in late October. However, with November steadily approaching, Apple about two weeks ago released a statement indicating that there would be a slight delay.\n\"We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready,\" Apple said, \"and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.”\nSince then, it's been radio silence from Apple. Not only do we have no idea as to what kinks Apple wants to work out, we haven't heard a peep as to when Apple's AirPods might see the light of day.\nUntil now.\nAccording to the German-language Apple website Apfelpage.de , Apple's AirPods will be shipped to stores on November 17 ahead of a launch set for November 18 or 19. The rumor comes from an employee at Conrad, an Apple re-seller in Europe. Of course, as with most Apple rumors, you might want to take this report with the requisite grain of salt.\nThat said, you can bet Apple is doing everything in its power to ensure that its AirPods are available before the busy holiday shopping season gets rolling.\nTrending right now:\nTarget Black Friday 2016 ad leaks: Huge iPhone 7, Xbox One S, TV, and other tech deals Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad: iPhone 7, PS4 Pro bundle, TVs, and other huge deals T-Mobile is giving away Samsung Galaxy S7s in a blowout deal this weekend See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Getty Image\nDonald Trump is not a fan of Apple , and Apple is not a fan of Donald Trump . So many were wondering how, precisely, the company would react to Trump winning the election. The answer comes in the form of an email sent to employees.\nCook doesn’t tackle the election directly, in the letter. Instead he mirrors what many have done over the course of the last few days and called for unity in the Apple team. Cook acknowledges that many are nervous about the future, but that the only way to go is forward. Cook’s full email, acquired by Mashable, is reproduced below :\nRelated Links:\nMichael Moore Was Spot-On With The ‘Trump Will Win’ Prediction He Made Back In July\nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\nCook closes by encouraging everyone to reach out to other co-workers if they feel anxious or need to talk it out. He hopes their Apple “family” can “move forward together,” regardless of the unexpected outcome of the election.\nIn other CEO letter news, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz also sent a letter to his employees saying he was “stunned” by Trump’s win , but “hopeful.”\n“Like so many of our fellow Americans—both Democrats and Republicans—I am stunned,” Schultz wrote. “We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.”\n(via Mashable )",

      "text": "Reddit \nIt had been thought that Apple would only have two suppliers to choose from when it came to its rumored switch to OLED displays for at least some iPhones next year: Samsung and LG. A third contender emerged in June , when it was reported that Sharp’s OLED panel business would be up-and-running by next year, and it now seems possible that Japan Display will also be in the running. \nWe learned back in August that Japan Display was seeking a government bailout to help it invest in OLED manufacturing capabilities, and the WSJ today reports that the company is now in ‘advanced talks’ for an infusion of around 75B Yen ($700M). Japan Display wants to improve its liquid-crystal display technology to compete against OLED displays while trying to set up its own manufacturing lines for mass-producing OLED panels. Both efforts require large investments. \nSamsung and LG were recently said to be engaged in a ‘ do or die ‘ fight to win OLED orders from Apple. It’s unclear whether Japan Display could have an OLED plant operational in time for next year’s iPhones. \nApple first adopted OLED for the Watch, followed by the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro – which is rumored to be made by Samsung. Looking further ahead, the company is said to be testing OLED for the main MacBook screens, mostly in the quest for ever-thinner laptops. Guides",

      "text": "Macy's ( M ) said Thursday it saw good results from Apple ( AAPL ) and Michael Kors ( KORS ) products as well as stronger apparel sales in the third quarter, which should continue into the important holiday quarter.\nAfter the close, Nordstrom ( JWN ) said EPS jumped 47% to 84 cents, crushing views for a decline to 41 cents, with sales rising 7.2% to $3.54 billion, above views for $3.485 billion. Same-store sales rose 2.4%.\nNordstrom also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates for $2.73, from a prior view of $2.60-$2.75.\nShares popped 7% late, after closing 7% higher in the regular session.\nMacy's now sees its 2016 same-store sales drop at 2.5%-3%, up from a prior view for a decline of 3%-4%.\n\"Our customers tell us we are their holiday shopping destination, and we are excited about our gift assortments, marketing strategies and digital enhancements, all of which should set us up for a stronger finish to the year and position us well for an improved performance in 2017 and beyond,\" said Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren in a release.\nAnd as Amazon.com ( AMZN ) continues to be a dominant force in holiday sales, Macy's plans to improve its website, mobile apps and search functions, and speed up its \"Buy Online, Pickup in Store\" option, said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen in a note.\nShares jumped 5.6% to 40.53 on the stock market today , after earlier rising to the highest in seven months. The stock had been moving sideways after plunging from July 2015 to May 2016. Amazon shares fell 4.6%. Apple shares were off 2.8%.",

      "text": "As Apple’s Mac App Store has exploded in size and popularity, it has also faced a growing number of complaints from developers. It can be hard to get your app discovered, there is frustration with terms of service, and updates can pose challenges.\nUkrainian-based MacPaw, makers of popular apps such as CleanMyMac , think they have a better solution that would drastically change the way users find and pay for apps. According to Oleksandr Kosovan, founder and CEO at MacPaw, the search for an alternative was motivated by his own company’s experience on the Mac App Store.\n“We’re constantly thinking about how we can move forward,” he said. “We’re constantly thinking about how to make the ecosystem better.”\nMacPaw’s solution: A new service called Setapp. With Setapp, users pay $9.99 each month and receive unlimited access to a suite of curated apps forever. No in-app purchases. No need to possibly pay for upgrades. And the apps are already in a folder on your Macbook if you want to download and install them.\nKosovan said he has a lot of love for Apple and the Mac. His company has built a nice business over the past eight years that brings in $25 million in annual revenue with its own software for the Mac.\nBut MacPaw has also been frustrated at the some of the limitations of the Mac App Store. He noted that there is no ability to try software before you buy it, just the ability to try stripped down versions with limited features. Refunds are not allowed. And finding the right software through search, customer ratings, and reading descriptions can be time-consuming and frustrating. That means that many developers don’t even put their software in the Mac App Store, but rather still prefer to sell it directly.\nEarlier this month, MacPaw began its private beta testing of Setapp, which it hopes will offer a service that reduces risk, creates more flexibility, and delivers a better experience for developers and users.\nMacPaw is in the process of signing up partners, but already has 45 developers who have made their software available for the subscription service. On MacPaw’s end, the team tests the software and evaluates it before including it to ensure the quality is high, he said.\nUsers who sign up for the subscription download the Setapp software which creates a folder on their Mac. Inside the folder is the suite of apps. Users can click on any app to install it. They continue to have access to the software and the folder as long as they are paying the subscription, and updates are delivered continuously.\n“It’s always up to date and you don’t have to pay extras,” Kosovan said. “We want to go away from major upgrades, but rather continuous updates so you always feel like you have the latest version.”\nKosovan said developers of the apps in Setapp are still allowed to sell their software directly to users, or via the Mac App Store. There’s no exclusivity.\n“We see this as an additional opportunity,” he said.\nThe company has funded the development on its own so far. It hopes to launch a closed beta next month to more customers next month, followed by a public launch in late January. It’s still hoping to sign up a handful of additional developers to be part of the beta and launch.\nhttp://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Welcome-to-Setapp-SD.mp4 \n\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Android Nougat's Night Mode May Soon Come Back to Nexus Devices Night Mode is similar to Apple's Night Shift feature Was earlier removed from final release as it was unfinished Feature might be pushed out with a future Nougat update \nGoogle's 'Night Mode', which works similarly to Apple's Night Shift, has been a feature that has been awaited impatiently by Nexus users. The search giant removed the feature from the final release of Nougat after giving an early glimpse in a developer preview for Nexus devices as the feature was not completely ready. Now, the 'Night Mode' will reportedly be making its way back to Nexus devices in the upcoming Nougat 7.1 update. \nAfter the feature was removed from the final build of Nougat, a thread named \"Bring Back Night Mode\" was posted on company's issue tracker. Now, the search giant has changed its status to 'Future Release', as pointed out by Phandroid . This indicates that the night mode is likely to come back in a future release, possibly the upcoming Android 7.1 Nougat update. Of course users might have to wait for longer if the company decides to push out the feature with a future update. The 'Night Mode' essentially adjusts the screen colour temperature in order to prevent excessive strain on user's eyes. There have always been apps that can help users adjust the screen colour temperature, such as f.lux, but system-level integration makes this feature extremely useful.\nRegarding the removal of night mode features in the Android N, a team of Google Engineers had earlier revealed that both dark theme and screen tinting had to be abandoned for similar reasons. The team claimed that both these were not going to be ready by the time Android N was launched publicly. Further, the team said that it did not want to leave a \"half-working\" feature in the platform. \nThe team pointed out that the implementation on an ecosystem-wide scale was difficult, and work on the features was not judged to be a sound allocation of resources.",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Apple Inc. As a means to boost sales during the critical holiday season, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) plans to offset what may be slow iPhone 7 sales with a number of its products aimed at year-end shoppers. What would online shopping be without free shipping? Apple has its own version.\nApple’s free shipping plan is not very attractive, although it is like a number of others: Free two-day delivery for items in stock. Orders need to be made before 5 p.m. Apple has several free shipping options:\nGet free next-day delivery on any in-stock iPhone and free two-day delivery on almost everything else. Faster options are also available.\nIn other words, the iPhone is special, and consumers can pay more to speed shipping of other items.\nPick up most items — usually within an hour — or let us know if someone else is picking up for you. We can even help set up your new Apple products.\nOther large retailers like this option because it saves their costs of providing free shipping.\nWe offer same-day courier delivery in certain locations for in-stock Apple products. You can select this option at checkout if it’s available.\nThe very expensive option. For example, next day shipping costs $17 to $20, in some cases.\nOne would think Apple’s products would be enough and the company would not have to resort to free shipping, but some products may have particularly slow sales in the fourth quarter. First among these is Apple Watch. Apple is pushing the entire smartwatch family in hopes the holidays will give it some modest help. And iPhone 7 holiday sales are essential to Apple’s revenue and its investors.\nFree two-day shipping, even from Apple.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "New MacBook Pro Taken Apart by iFixit \nApple has always offered support for devices in its many retail locations, which is one of the ways it got the iPhone into so many hands early on. Now, it’s maybe looking for a slightly more hands-off approach. The company has quietly released a support app in the App Store on election day. So hey, maybe you can try to solve the problem yourself before you bother a genius in real life? \nThe app includes help articles and tips for your device, I assume in hopes that people won’t come into an Apple Store every time something goes wrong. It’s not only for your iDevice, either. All Apple hardware registered on your account is accessible and eligible for support. \nThe help articles are just the first step. The app also has a live chat feature, allowing you to get 1-on-1 help from an Apple rep. That’s probably good enough to figure out many software issues, and it’s still cheaper for Apple than in-store support. If the chat option fails, there’s the option to schedule a phone call with a support rep. And yes, if you don’t want to use the app’s built-in support services, you can schedule an appointment in the nearest Apple Store. The app is thus far only available in English, but it’s popped up in a few App Store catalogs around the world. \nI’d be on the lookout for this app to be a pre-load in a future version of iOS. Hopefully, you’ll have the option of removing it, though. Share",

      "text": "OWC The 15\" MacBook Pro might be the most capable member of Apple's laptop family, but it only has so many ports.\nIf you've got an external monitor, hard drives for backup, and other peripherals running around, it's easy to fill those ports up fast. I was having that problem and got frustrated over how often I was plugging and unplugging things. \nFinally, last fall I purchased a Thunderbolt dock from OWC (Other World Computing), and I haven't looked back. \nLike its name suggests, OWC's dock connects to your Mac via Thunderbolt, Apple's highest-bandwidth port. Plugging it in gives you access to five USB 3.0 ports, a FireWire800 port, 4K-capable HDMI port, mic jack, headphone jack, additional Thunderbolt port, and Ethernet port. In some cases, like USB 3, the dock just increases the number of ports you already have. In other cases, you're getting direct access to ports that your MacBook doesn't have built-in, like Ethernet and FireWire. Those ports were casualties of Apple's desire to make their devices thinner, and having them again when in a desk environment feels good. \nAt first, I wasn't sure if I needed this many additional ports, but quickly realized that yes, yes I did. Right now I have a Thunderbolt raid , external hard drive for local backups , Ethernet cable , flash drive , webcam , USB speaker system , USB turntable , and audio interface all plugged in at once. And that doesn't count the 4K external display I have plugged into the other Thunderbolt port built-in to my MacBook Pro. Yes, that's a lot of stuff, but this dock is aimed at people who want to be able to use everything at once without having to keep switching things around. \nI was a little wary about buying this dock because reviews I read said it had some trouble with hard drives ejecting without warning. That has never happened to me after months of using it, and I'm constantly plugging and unplugging different things. Instead, everything works as solidly and consistently as it did when I had these devices plugged in. Even more impressive is that everything works smoothly, even when I'm using multiple peripherals at the same time. I've never had to worry about my webcam being spotty because I was in the middle of a large file transfer. \nThis dock definitely isn't for everybody. If you only have a couple of accessories that you use, plugging and unplugging them every once in a while isn't that big of a chore. If you're a power user whose work is suffering because of your ratio of needed peripherals and available ports, you should definitely consider picking one. \nMy favorite aspect of this product is the fact that all it requires is a power cable and Thunderbolt cable. If I need to use my laptop on-the-go, all I do is disconnect one cable and I'm ready to rock. Then, when I get home, I just pop that one cable back in and all my devices are available and I can get right back to work. \nOWC Thunderbolt Dock, $244, available at Amazon \nThis article was originally published on 7/14/2016.

      "text": "This is what Tim Cook said to Apple employees after Trump's victory IndiaToday.in Last Updated: NOV 11, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nDonald Trump's win in the US election has sure stirred the world and technology market is no different. While Mark Zuckerberg is seen defending his company against the allegations of swaying the US elections, Apple's CEO Tim Cook has called for unity amidst his employees through an email. First reported by Buzzfeed , Cook told the Apple employees that \"the only way to move forward is to move forward together\". \nHere's what he wrote in the email. \nTeam, \nI've heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it's inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago: \"If you can't fly, then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.\" This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world-regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI've always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your coworkers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet's move forward-together!

      "text": "Stocks gained as a whole Thursday, as investors favored industrial and banking sectors as likely beneficiaries of four years of Donald Trump policies. But big-name computer, software and internet tech shares including Apple ( AAPL ) suffered another dose of heavy profit-taking.\nThe Dow Jones industrials paced the market's upside, rising more than 1.1%. Banking, metal ores, machinery and shipping transport firms led the upside. Department store chains rebounded furiously.\nThe S&P 500 edged 0.2% higher, while the Russell 2000 surged 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.8%. Crude oil sank nearly 2%, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond surged again, up to 2.14%.\nVolume edged mildly higher on both main exchanges, according to preliminary data.\nApple symbolized the sharp sell-off in tech land , falling nearly 3% to 107.67 in above-average volume. At one point, the stock reached as low as 105.83, down a little more than 4% below its Sept. 14 breakout price of 110.33.\nFor now, the stock can be held by those who bought correctly. And despite the sharp drop, Apple still maintains a trend of higher highs and higher lows since bottoming out at 89.47 on May 12. However, continued weakness in not only Apple but in fellow tech stalwarts would justify an early exit in the stock so that one does not lose an opportunity to get exposure in those sectors that are heating up.\nAs seen in the stock market today , banking, industrial and manufacturing stocks ruled the day. Copper futures continued to jump as the market appeared to favor those industries that may get a boost from President-Elect Trump's pledge to boost manufacturing, construction and infrastructure rebuilding within America.\nGeneral Motors ( GM ) gained more than 5% to 32.73 in double normal volume and reaching a nearly three-week high. The car and truck giant is perhaps working on a bottoming-style saucer base after lagging the market since the end of 2013. A strong move past 33.18 would lead to a breakout. Also, watch for potential upside resistance near the 33-35 price level.\nWall Street currently sees GM profit rising 19% this year but sinking 4% in 2017.\nThe head of United Auto Workers expressed confidence on Thursday that his union can work with Trump in the area of trade policy, despite that workers group's prior endorsement of failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\nVulcan Materials ( VMC ), which was added as a watch list idea at IBD Leaderboard, rose 3.4% to 136.04, adding to the prior five-day buying rush. The expert in concrete aggregates and materials for road construction has now risen nearly 7% past a 127.30 cup-base buy point, so it's extended. Try as best as possible to buy stocks within 5% of the proper entry. Even top growth names will immediately pull back to shake out weak holders and return near or to the exact entry point before potentially resuming their run.\nVulcan is part of the Building-Cement/Concrete/Aggregates industry group, which is rapidly rising up the rankings of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. As of Wednesday's close, the group ranked 55th, vs. 149th just six weeks ago.\nOther building-related groups ranking highly lately include Building-Heavy Construction (No. 16) and Steel-Producers (No. 22).\nSteel Dynamics ( STLD ) surged another 3% to 32.38. The highly profitable operator of mini-mills has now advanced 15% past a 28.11 cup buy point. It was featured in IBD's Stock Spotlight column ahead of Trump's upset win in Tuesday's presidential election.\nSome breakouts in the consumer space are making good progress.\nPlanet Fitness ( PLNT ) rose nearly 4% to 23.91, sending shares now extended 7% past a 22.25 cup with handle buy point. The no-nonsense gym operator has been touted in IBD's IPO Leaders screen lately due to strong growth (EPS up 67%, sales up 26% in Q3) and solid stock price action. The Newington, N.H., firm went public in August 2015 at 16 a share.\nHowever, mortgage origination software specialist Ellie Mae ( ELLI ) got hammered, falling almost 8% to 95.57 in nearly five times its usual volume and caving well below its 50-day moving average. While there was no clear news, fund managers perhaps sold in the light of rising interest rates, which could pinch mortgage financing and refinancing activity.\nEllie Mae also notched its biggest one-day point loss since its mid-February breakout past a 78.81 buy point, a key sell signal.",

      "text": "Ireland to formally submit appeal on Apple case this week Tue Nov 8, 2016 11:07am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's government will this week formally submit its appeal against the European Commission's multi-billion-euro demand for back taxes from Apple, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on Tuesday. \nIreland's cabinet agreed in September to join the iPhone maker in appealing the Commission's order that the U.S. tech giant pay up to 13 billion euros to Dublin after ruling the firm had received illegal state aid. \nDublin is seeking to protect a tax regime that has attracted many multinational employers. The European Commission decision has also angered Washington, which accuses it of trying to grab tax revenue that should go to the United States. \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow,\" Noonan told a European Parliament committee in Brussels. \n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Andrew Roche) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Evolution of iPhone Now Playing Target Black Friday 2016 deals include some neat discounts on various Apple products, including iPhones, Apple TVs, iPads and more. The deals come in two waves and the first one is already on, so here's what's on offer and how much you can save. ( Scott Olson | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple fans, rejoice! Target is slashing and smashing Apple prices for Black Friday 2016, offering neat discounts on a number of products. \nIt's not even mid-November yet and Black Friday deals are already popping up. They're starting earlier and offer better deals each year and Target is not shying away, offering two waves of promotions with attractive price cuts. The retailer just posted its latest Black Friday ad for this year and it's full of sweet deals and a lot of love for Apple fans. \nApple Black Friday promos at Target include $150 off the smaller iPad Pro with a 9.7-inch display, $180 off the powerful Beats Solo2 Wireless headphones and 25 percent off all Apple TV models. Two Waves Of Promos \nAs previously mentioned, Target is offering its Black Friday deals in two parts. The Early Access wave has already kicked off and runs through Nov. 24, both online and in-store, while a second wave will kick off at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day in Target stores. Early Access Promos \nThe first wave of deals will include neat price cuts on three Apple TV models and two Beats headphone models. \nYou can get 25 percent off the Fourth-Generation Apple TV in both 32 GB and 64 GB, as well as the Third-Generation Apple TV. Target notes that it has limited quantities, so no rain checks. The discounted prices will be reflected when adding the product to cart. \nThe Beats Solo2 Wireless headphones normally retail for $299.99, but Target is offering them at $180 off as part of its Early Access deals. The Beats Tour 2.5 in-ear headphones, meanwhile, dropped $65 off the normal $129.99 retail price. Black Friday Deals \nRegular Black Friday deals, meaning the second wave of promos that kick off on Thanksgiving Day, include iPad discounts, iPhone 7 deals, Apple Watch price cuts and more. \nMore specifically, the original Apple Watch will see a hefty $71.99 discount , all iPods will drop 20 percent off their normal price tags, the iPad Pro 9.7-inch will drop $150.99 off its normal retail price, the iPad Air 2 will cost $129.99 less, the iPad Mini 2 will be $70.20 cheaper, and all iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models will be available for $0 down and a free $250 Target Gift Card for \"well-qualified guests.\" The Beats Solo2 Wireless and Beats 2.5 in-ear headphones will be available at the same discounts as for the Early Access wave at $180 and $65 off, respectively. \nTarget Black Friday 2016 deals also include a number of other products at hefty discounts, including gaming console offers, Xbox One and PS4 bundles and more.

A European reseller, however, has just indicated the launch may be much sooner than that. \nAn employee of Apple reseller Conrad told a customer it would receive stock on November 17th and make them available for purchase November 18th or 19th. The store’s website, however, still indicates a longer wait of seven to eight weeks , but the report does provide some hope that the AirPods will be available for the holiday season.",

      "text": "Getty Images Donald Trump doesn't like encryption. He threatened to call for a boycott of Apple products because they wouldn't undermine the encryption on the iPhone. \nTrump also loves surveillance. When he was a candidate, he said he wanted to place mosques under U.S. surveillance and create a national database to track Muslims. \nHe is also in favor of NSA mass surveillance. And on the topic of hacking his enemies, Trump said, \"I wish I had that power. Man, that would be power.\" \nAs president, he will have that power. \nMore from Recode: \nDoes Trump's victory mean I need stronger encryption? \nPolitico co-founder Jim VandeHei is coming to Code Media in New York \nMark Zuckerberg says it's 'crazy' to think fake news stories got Donald Trump elected \n\nEdward Snowden has revealed that the United States already engages in mass digital surveillance of Americans. But the federal government has gone to great lengths to keep its domestic surveillance operation under wraps, getting broad clearance through secret court orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court. \nUnder Trump, that surveillance is likely to be a lot more overt. \nBut the ability to have private conversations, to research controversial topics without fear of government reprisal and to engage in political activism and organizing are all key functions of American democracy. \nIf you're concerned about expanded surveillance, there are a number of privacy-enhancing tips and products you can try that will help keep your digital footprint under wraps. \nTexts and phone calls Leaks have shown that the NSA and the FBI are capable of intercepting text message and phone data . To keep your text messages private, use a service that offers end-to-end encryption. \nApple's iMessages does this, but only between iMessage users — if you text someone who's on an Android phone, those messages won't have the same protection. \nSignal, a popular encrypted text messaging app Snowden recommends, and Facebook's WhatsApp , are other options. And both of them work on Apple as well as Android phones. Like iMessage, both parties of the text conversation need to have the app installed for the encryption to work.\nInternet search data If you want to keep your internet search queries private, try installing Tor, an internet browser that anonymizes your activity by routing the data through multiple destinations before sending it out onto the worldwide web. \nThere are also tools like HTTPS Everywhere , a browser extension which helps to encrypt connections between websites. \nTwo-factor authentication and updates Passwords are hackable, especially if you reuse the same one over and over, like many people do. Don't do that.\nOne thing you should do to protect your privacy is enable two-factor authentication for all of your accounts. Most services offer the option to text a code to a phone number on file for your account, so only someone with both your password and your cellphone can access it.\nAlso, make sure all your apps and services are fully updated to take advantage of any recent security improvements. \n— By April Glaser, Recode.net . \nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "CHATBOTS EXPLAINER: Conversation may power revenues for the next decade \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAfter Apple had to purge several hundred malicious fake shopping apps from the iOS App Store earlier this week, the company’s security review process has been called into question. \nApple often touts its security review process, which new apps must undergo before they can enter the App Store, as a significant advantage of the iOS ecosystem over its Android competitor. However, Apple does not actually review every single new app, according to The New York Times. \nThis leaves it up to developers and brands to keep a watchful eye for fake apps masquerading as their own, as was the case with the hundreds of fake apps Apple recently removed. Apple told The New York Times that it encourages consumers and developers to report suspicious apps so it can quickly review them. \nApple is in the midst of a campaign to review the more than 2 million apps in the App Store to remove malicious and outdated apps. Apple has historically had far less malicious code make its way into the App Store compared with Android’s Google Play store and third-party app stores. \nHowever, that has begun to change recently. In addition to the spate of fake retail apps, a number of fake apps related to the Pokemon Go mobile game hit the App Store after the game rose to popularity. This means brands and developers will likely need to be more vigilant going forward around threats to their customers stemming from fake apps. \nCutting through the noise of an overcrowded app market is already critical for any app developer looking to build a viable user base, and that challenge becomes greater when malicious and fake apps flood the stores. There are now well over 3 million apps available across the world’s five largest app stores. Delivering the right product to the right audience at the right time in this environment is imperative to the success of any app. \nThe challenge of marketing an app effectively has made app-install ads — an ad unit that directs users to download a mobile app — an essential tool for developers seeking to stand out in the Google Play and Apple app stores. This is why it's not surprising that more marketers are using paid channels to drive downloads than ever before. In fact, over 80% of respondents in a survey of the top 100 grossing mobile app developers noted they plan on increasing their spend on app-install ads in 2015. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile app-install ads that looks at the revenues from app-install ads and how they're expected to grow over the next five years. It also looks at the performance of app-install ads and how these metrics are expected to change over time. \nFurthermore, the report examines the top app-install ad products and pricing models offered by the leading advertising platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Google, as well as newer app-install formats from Instagram and Snapchat. Looking to the future, the report examines how companies are shifting their app-install ad spend to new formats, as well as the new tools they're using to improve optimization and ad effectiveness. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: Mobile app-install ads — ad units that direct users to download a mobile app — are an essential tool for developers, and they account for a major share of mobile ad spend. We estimate 25% of total US mobile ad revenue was generated by app-install ads in 2015. A combination of new developers entering the space and rising ad budgets will drive increased spending in years to come. US app-install ad revenue will grow to over $7 billion by year-end 2020, according to BI Intelligence estimates. Mobile app install advertisers have traditionally invested heavily in display and interstitial ads, but are moving to mobile video and native install formats. 86% of developers currently use in-feed video app-install ads, and video ads are seen as the most effective app-install format. As formats like video rise in popularity, older formats are losing their appeal for install campaigns. Static nonnative ads are widely used but are not seen as effective. Free app networks and offer walls have also fallen out of favor. Ad platforms are now developing innovative new install formats to earn even more revenue from these lucrative ad units. New approaches, including deep linking and app streaming, are more contextualized and interactive than older ad formats. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts app-install ad spending in the US through 2020. Explores which app-install ad formats developers believe are most effective. Discusses what the most popular platforms and ad networks are doing to attract ad spending. Investigates new tools for marketing apps, including deep linking and app streaming. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "title": "Safari: Tabbed Browsing",
      "text": "[Return to Apple Safari: LSU Overview] \nApple's Safari Internet browser allows users to have multiple webpages open in a single window, by separating them into individual tabs. This greatly simplifies browsing and frees both memory and display space. Safari even allows users to bookmark multiple tabs into a single folder and open them all at once. To Use Tabbed Browsing: First open Safari by clicking the Safari icon in the dock, or find it in the Applications folder within Macintosh HD. To Open a New Tab in Safari: Press Command + T ,or select New Tab in the File menu.

      "text": "Details \nThe 11.6\" MacBook Air Notebook Computer from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apples engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68\" it tapers down to 0.11\" at its thinnest. Computers in the MacBook Airs weight class are most often classified in the netbook category. \nNetbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer without sacrificing ergonomics. \nThe MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. The computer is powered by a dual-core 4th-gen, low-voltage Haswell 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of onboard 1600MHz LPDDR3 RAM . Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. \nSpecifications: Processor: 1.3GHz Intel Core i5 Dual-Core Operating System: Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan Storage: 128GB SSD",

      "text": "AirPods Production Said to Begin in December in Limited Quantities   9:36   Ever since Apple delayed the launch of its all-new AirPods beyond the late October timeframe it originally promised, saying it needed \"a little more time\" before they are ready for customers, there have been conflicting rumors about when the wireless earphones will actually be released. The latest word comes from investment bank Barclays, which in a research note we saw said AirPods should enter production in December. That means AirPods could still feasibly be released in time for the final weeks of the holiday shopping season, although a January 2017 launch as previously rumored, or later, is possible. Barclays said the initial production run will be \"fairly small,\" totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch. Earlier this week, an employee at Apple reseller Conrad reportedly told a customer it will receive AirPods stock on November 17 . As we noted at the time, it is entirely possible the employee provided inaccurate information. Apple lists AirPods as both \" coming soon \" and \" currently unavailable \" on different parts of its website.",

      "text": "– A + Purpose of Apple's 'Control Strip' trademark filing detailed in Touch Bar developer guidelines By Neil Hughes \n  09:50 am PT (12:50 pm ET) \nA trademark application for the term \"Control Strip\" fueled speculation that it might be the name Apple would use to refer to what is now officially known as the Touch Bar on its new MacBook Pros. But Apple's developer guidelines reveal that the Control Strip is the official name for an essential portion of the Touch Bar.\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation now available to developers explains the layout of the new Touch Bar, and also what its individual components are named. In all, there are three regions on the Touch Bar: A system button, an app region, and the Control Strip.\n\nOf the three components, only the Control Strip is presented as a proper noun by Apple, reflecting the trademark application the company covertly applied for earlier this year. The filings also included the eventual Touch Bar name, as well as an unused alternative dubbed the \"Magic Toolbar.\"\n\nThe Control Strip is located to the far right of the Touch Bar, and plays an important role in the dynamic OLED display's function. Essentially, the Control Strip is the digital replacement for the function row of keys found in previous Macs.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the Control Strip displays system tasks including adjusting brightness and changing volume level. It also includes a dedicated Siri button, taking advantage of its introduction to the Mac with OS X Sierra .\n\nThe Control Strip is also user-customizable, allowing MacBook Pro owners to remove items or even to hide the Control Strip completely.\nThe Control Strip is an essential part of the Touch Bar, providing users with commonly accessed system commands, and also allowing them to customize it to their liking, in both size and layout. \nThe leftmost button on the virtual Control Strip is an arrow that will expand the system commands. Doing so hides the app region to provide users with a greater selection of functions on demand.\n\nIn normal use, the app region of the Touch Bar, to the left of the Control Strip, is where developers can implement app-specific controls. Like with the Control Strip, developers can allow users to add and remove items in the app region to their liking, making it completely customizable.\n\nThe system button is also context sensitive as well, Apple notes. By default it features a virtual Escape key, but Apple notes that other system-provided buttons may appear on the far-left side of the Touch Bar depending on context.\n\nAnnounced at an event in Cupertino last month, the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is now available for preorder, with some of the first orders placed preparing for shipment .

      "text": "NIMS Announces $500,000 in Apprenticeship Grants, Support ‘Areas of Angst’ \nStarting about midnight on Tuesday, Karyn Twaronite, global diversity and inclusiveness officer at consulting and accounting firm EY, said she received hundreds of emails from employees “raising concerns, thoughts and observations” as well as “areas of angst.” \n“I’m actually hopeful, because there’s so much dialog. We’ve been able to have conversations about subjects people never talked about before, like racism and sexism,” Twaronite said, adding that about two-thirds of EY’s employees are Millennials. \nThere’s still cause for concern. Advocates of diversity see major changes in workplace regulations if Trump follows through with his pledge to rescind Barack Obama’s executive orders, which could include the ones below. And it’s still legal in 28 states to fire workers because they are gay. Amendments to Equal Employment Opportunity Executive Orders 11478 substituting “sexual orientation, gender identity” for “sexual orientation” and to 11246, substituting “sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin” for “sex, or national origin” Aug. 18, 2014 Establishing a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. 2011 Creating the White House Council on Women and Girls: Includes assisting women-owned businesses to compete internationally and working to increase participation of women in the science, engineering and technology workforce. 2009 \nTrump will appoint his own attorney general and can name a new general counsel and chairman for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as change the leadership of the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB exerts broad influence over workplace issues, and the Department of Justice wrote key guidelines this year requiring the government to treat sexual orientation and gender identity as protected under the Civil Rights Act. \nDuring Obama’s two terms, the Justice Department and EEOC have taken the lead on discrimination cases involving religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and race--including high-profile diversity lawsuits against McDonald’s Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and AutoZone Inc. Aggressive Enforcement \n“The biggest effect will be in the agencies--the NLRB, DOL and EEOC--that have all been very aggressive in enforcing the laws,” said Cliff Palefsky, a civil-rights lawyer at McGuinn Hillsman & Palefsky in San Francisco. “I suspect we’re going to go back eight years, to when those agencies actually worked to undermine the laws. That’s unfortunate.” \nMatt Maloney, head of food-delivery company GrubHub Inc., generated controversy after the election with an email to employees decrying “the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump” and said workers who don’t support a culture of inclusiveness should “reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.” In a statement posted Thursday on the company’s website, he clarified that GrubHub welcomes people of all political affiliations and the initial message was not meant as an attack on Trump voters. Move Past Rancor \nMany CEOs sidestepped specific comments on Trump and instead asked workers to try to move past the partisan rancor of the campaign. Starbucks Corp.’s Howard Schultz, who endorsed Clinton, told employees in a letter that “we have a choice in how we treat one another,” regardless of which candidate they supported. \nCompanies increasingly recognize the need for employees to reflect their customers, and recruiting more women, minorities and people of different sexual orientations can help them stay competitive and innovative. \n“It’s a business imperative,” said George Nichols, senior vice president of government affairs at New York Life Insurance Co. “Businesses that don’t invest in diversity efforts will increasingly be at a competitive disadvantage, regardless of the political landscape.” \nThe company held a town-hall meeting Thursday at which CEO Ted Mathas reiterated its commitment to a diverse workforce, Nichols said. \nTimothy Ryan, U.S. chairman at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, encouraged employees to talk about their feelings the day after the election. “We’re doubling down” on diversity, he said in an interview. Some 44 percent of the new partners PwC named this year were women or minorities, while 47 percent of its workforce is female and 33 percent are minorities, he added. More Innovation \n“We and other companies understand the importance of diversity and inclusiveness to get more innovation, better answers to problems and to reach more customers -- and that’s not going to change,” he said. \nTrump’s candidacy inflamed racial tensions as he demonized Mexicans as rapists and Muslims as terrorists while also expressing support for police practices such as “stop and frisk,” which some consider a form of racial profiling disproportionately targeting blacks and Hispanics. Trump also was criticized on gender grounds, particularly following the release of a recording in which he makes vulgar comments about groping women. \nCorporate boards have been unforgiving with some top officials who engaged in arguably less crude behavior that could paint the company in a bad light or put it at legal risk. \nWhile the tone from the campaign was “disturbing,” it may not stop the progress toward a more diverse workforce, said Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital, who filed nine diversity-related shareholder resolutions at technology companies this year. \n“Investors are part of a greater groundswell that is emboldening corporations to plot a more diverse and successful future,” she said. Following the election, “our work on gender equity is more important now than ever.”",

      "text": "Apple will launch a trio of new iPads this spring, according to Barclays research analysts. Citing the company’s Asian supply chain, the analysts report we can expect a 10.9-inch model with a borderless design. Due to the bezel-less display, the larger iPad would occupy the same footprint as the smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We’ll also be getting a rather bad-ass iPhone 8, with an edge-to-edge display — if the rumors are true. It’s this that perhaps gives us a hint to Apple’s future plans for the Home button. Long-rumored as a DOA feature, the new iPads could be the first…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "title": "Despite complaints, initial sales of Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro have been incredibly brisk",
      "text": "In spite of a chorus of complaints around the lack of real innovation in its recent MacBook Pro release , Apple is still enjoying brisk sales of the new machines. In fact, the new MacBook Pro is outselling a number of competitive notebooks on the market, including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook, according to Slice Intelligence .\nThe data is most impressive because it’s based on just five days of sales for the 2016 MacBook Pro. In that brief span, the MacBook Pro generated 78 percent of the revenues that the diminutive MacBook has generated since its introduction on April 10, 2015. Generally speaking, the new MacBook Pro has already generated more revenue than any other notebook in 2016.\nMore: How Intel’s Ultrabook initiative challenged the MacBook Air — and won\nCompared to the competition, the 2016 MacBook Pro has generated more revenue in its first five days than a number of competitive machines have since they were introduced. This includes Microsoft’s Surface Book, the Asus Chromebook Flip, Dell’s Inspiron 2-in-1, and the Lenovo Yoga 900.\n2016-macbook-pro-sales More Slice Intelligence\nThese results are particularly important for Apple’s long-term success, as Slice Intelligence points out. In the two years since the previous MacBook Pro refresh in 2014, fully 40 percent of Apple’s notebook customers moved on to other vendors. Dell and Asus were the biggest beneficiaries, with each gaining roughly 7 percent of Apple’s customers.\napple-to-pc-1 More Slice Intelligence\nWhile seeming like very good news for Apple, it’s entirely possible that these significant sales gains represent pent-up demand for new MacBook Pro hardware. The Windows 10 notebook ecosystem hasn’t been standing still, and time will tell if Apple can maintain these sales levels against excellent alternatives like Dell’s popular XPS 13 and the new thin and light — and more affordable — 2-in-1 convertible machines from HP, Lenovo, and others.\nSlice Intelligence gathers its data from 4.4 million online shoppers, so it doesn’t track all sales from every channel. Therefore, there’s room for interpretation of this data, although a general conclusion has to be that, at least initially, Apple is enjoying some renewed vigor when it comes to selling MacOS hardware.\nIf the MacBook Pro is still selling at these levels in six months or so, then we can mark this as a tremendous success. Otherwise, it’s possible that Apple’s perceived lack of innovation could end up costing it even more customers as the market continues to move forward around it.\nRussian listing shows three new portable personal computers using MacOS Sierra New MacBooks are coming later this month, but are they too little too late?

      "text": "  Apple Releases iBooks StoryTime for the Apple TV November 11,   Leave a Comment \nApple has just unveiled a new app for the Apple TV called iBooks Storytime. It brings a modest selection of kid books to your television and each one has Read-Aloud functionality. There is an option to turn the narration off, so parents can read the book aloud to their child. \nThe app, which comes with a free Dora the Explorer book, is designed for young children. Additional books can be purchased from the Featured Books section of the app. There is a nice mix of classic children’s books and familiar modern characters. \nWhen you are reading a book with the narration feature turned on, the words are highlighted. This will hopefully teach children word correlation. In read-aloud mode the pages are turned automatically. Pages can also be turned by swiping on the Siri Remote when the read-aloud feature is turned off. \nApple was initially granted a trademark for iBooks StoryTime back in September. Many digital publishing websites were buzzing about what this new initiative would entail, and we finally got the answer.  ",

      "text": "It looks like the fight between Ireland, Apple, and the EU is only set to escalate -- Ireland is prepared to bring that fight to EU courts. An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes. More The tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle.\nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change.\nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant\nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history.\nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.”\nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks.\nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices.\nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country.\nReports: Apple hit with $118 million fine for underreporting income in Japan Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant Apple’s Tim Cook responds to European Commission’s $14.5 billion fine",

      "text": "Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus Posted: 7 hours ago , by Stephen S. Comments Introduction Apple's always offered its users a complete hardware-and-software smartphone experience: everybody gets iOS, and everybody gets the iPhone. With Android, that situation's a lot more complicated, with a litany of manufacturers to choose from, and little assurance their phones are running the newest, most-feature-packed software release available. But this year Google's stepping up in a way we haven't really seen before. While Nexus phones offered a pure-Google software experience, this year's new Pixel phones add that same sort of Google leadership to the hardware side of things, with a pair of handsets designed from the ground up to be 100% Google phones.We've already gone head-to-head with the smaller iPhone 7 and Google Pixel , but for as much as we enjoy a good petite phone, there's a lot to be said for the big screens, big batteries, and all-around larger-than-life experiences of a more massive phablet. Luckily for us, both Apple and Google are ready to deliver with the iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL , respectively.Do these two phones measure up in quite the same way as their smaller siblings, or does enough change with these bigger models that we'll look at their balance in a different light? Let's find out, with our iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL comparison. Design Both Google and Apple scale up some familiar looks for their larger handsets Smartphones may rely upon millions of lines of code, a dizzying array of tiny transistors, and more high-tech components than you can count, but there's little that affects our impressions of a handset more than its design and styling. Looking at both the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL, it's clear that a lot of thought went into making these handsets look and feel the way they do, all while Google and Apple made some very different decisions about how to put their phones together.The iPhone 7 Plus is sleek, sturdy, and smooth. The phone scales up the dimensions of the iPhone 7 to accommodate for the Plus model's larger 5.5-inch screen, and while it's slightly thicker than the smaller handset, we're talking a near-indiscernible amount – to the tune of a fraction of a millimeter. But not all of the phone's hardware can squeeze into that slim body, and like the iPhone 7 itself, the Plus has to live with a camera bump, but it's significantly more pronounced on the 7 Plus: it both sticks out further, and takes up more surface area to make room for the phone's dual rear cameras.While the Pixel XL is a thicker device than the iPhone, Google both manages to keep its thickness consistent from smaller to larger Pixel, as well as avoiding a camera bump altogether. This however, is at the cost of having the profile of the phone get progressively thicker towards the upper end. The handset's design is a bit unusual, taking advantage of multiple materials in a way that's unexpected but also really help the phone stand out in a busy Android market. Like the smaller Pixel, an edge design that shifts from curves, to flat surfaces, to angled bevels helps keep the handset feeling secure in your hand, which is a plus considering the phone's size.Comparing the two phones against each other, while Apple's is the thinner handset, to the tune of more than a millimeter, Google's manages to be both shorter and narrower, despite the same 5.5-inch screen size.",

The IP8 moves to 5\" (from 4.7\") and the Plus moves to 5.8\" (from 5.5”).” \nThe current iPhone 7 devices are 4.7-inches and 5.5-inches respectively. \nFurthermore, the analysts say that the rumoured OLED displays will be saved for the iPhone 8 Plus. \nThis would enable a curved display that would wrap around the edge of the iPhone, akin to the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and its predecessor. \nThe analysts added: “By using a plastic OLED screen, the screen can bend at the edges to allow a curved bezel-less edge.” \nThe iPhone 8 is expected to arrive in September 2017 and will mark the first major redesign in 3 years. \nWould the addition of an OLED curved display push you towards the larger iPhone 8 Plus?

      "text": "The MacBook Air may be on its last legs, but cash-strapped Mac fans can still save as much as $210 on one of Apple's many refurbs. Backed by a 1-year Apple warranty, they're an excellent way to save on a MacBook Air, MacBook, or MacBook Pro Retina. More The 11-inch MacBook Air lost its status as Apple’s most coveted laptop some time ago, but for cash-strapped Mac fans, the svelte ultraportable was their go-to system thanks to its $899 price tag. Unfortunately, last month Apple announced it’s giving its 11-inch ultraportable the ax. Moreover, by not upgrading the 13-inch MacBook Air ($999), it’s sentencing all of its sub $1,000 laptops to a slow death.\nThat means that in the near future Apple could make the 12-inch MacBook ($1,299) and the 13-inch MacBook Pro ($1,499) the company’s new entry-level machines, sans entry level prices.\nFortunately, the Apple Store offers refurbished MacBook Air , MacBook , and MacBook Pro laptops with prices starting at $929.\nIf the idea of a refurbished laptop makes you hesitate, rest assured that Apple’s refurbs are among the best in the industry and they’re all backed by the same 1-year warranty found in Apple’s newer devices. Below we’ve rounded up a few refurb Apple laptops currently available.\nMacBook laptops on sale from $170 to $210 off:\n11.6-inch MacBook Air for $929 ($170 off): There’s no Retina display and its 11-inch screen may be too small for some users, but at $929 — the 11-inch MacBook Air is the cheapest way to set foot inside the Mac laptop ecosystem. This laptop’s classic design has spawned countless imitators — including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook — and its just 0.3 pounds heavier than the 2-pound 12-inch MacBook. This model has been upgraded to include 256GB of storage space. 12-inch MacBook for $1,182 ($210 off): The 12-inch MacBook is Apple’s most forward-thinking device to date. It defines the bleeding edge in PC portability and just like the original MacBook Air inspired dozens of competitors, so will the 12-inch MacBook. At its full price, however, it offers too little for too much money. As a refurb, it presents a more compelling argument, just keep in mind it doesn’t offer the best battery (that would be the 13-inch MacBook Air) nor does it offer the most horsepower, if CPU muscle is what you require. 13.3-inch MacBook Pro Retina for $1,099 ($200 off): This laptop costs $100 more than the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air, yet it includes an eye-opening 2,560 x 1,600 pixel Retina Display. This 2015 model may be outdated — when compared to the just-released 13.3-inch MacBook Pro — but in terms of power it leaves the older 13-inch MacBook Air and 12-inch MacBook in the dust.

Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog: Why Tech Stocks (FB, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL) Are Tanking Today Shares of some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:( FB - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Amazon (NASDAQ:( AMZN - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Apple (NASDAQ:( AAPL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:( MSFT - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:( GOOGL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), are in the red today as investors continue to adjust for Donald Trump’s upset victory in the presidential election. The prevailing concern surrounding tech companies under a Trump presidency is the potential changes to manufacturing and distribution that the Donald would make. For example, Trump has voiced his desire for Apple to build its products in the United States, as opposed to its current operations in China and other places abroad. Shares of the Cupertino-based tech giant slid nearly 3% in morning trading Thursday, and the stock is now down about 4% since Tuesday afternoon. Apple CEO Tim Cook was forced to send out an internal memo in the wake of the election results, reassuring employees that Apple’s “North Star” hasn’t changed and suggesting that they all move forward together. Microsoft stock also fell Thursday, with shares falling about 2.6% in morning trading. The company responded to the election results in two public ways, including a post from CEO Satya Nadella on newly-acquired LinkedIn (LNKD) that congratulated President-elect Trump and asserted that Microsoft’s goals have not changed. While Nadella remained primarily non-partisan, the CEO did link to a blog post from the company’s chief legal head Brad Smith. It was here that the sense of Microsoft’s paranoia about the future of tech became apparent; Smith made it clear that the company was ready to stand up to the government to advocate for “clearer and more modern” laws. The brutal performance of tech stocks was spread pretty evenly throughout the entire industry on Thursday. Facebook and Alphabet both slipped about 4.2% in morning trading, while Amazon fell nearly 5%. Overall, the market’s reaction to the election results seems to assume a quick adoption of the policies Trump ran on. Money is pouring out of technology and renewable energy and back into traditional energy sources and American industry. Only time will tell what President Trump actually does, and his specific policy initiatives remain relatively unclear. For now, investors seem to be trading based on his rhetoric, which may or may not manifest itself in actual changes. The market just can’t tell for sure what it’s getting right now.

      "text": "{ 0 comments } \nThe Jet Black iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sold out very quickly when Apple announced the new iPhones a couple months ago, but it didn’t take long for sad news to start swirling about how easy it is to scratch that gorgeous finish. If you are a lucky Jet Black iPhone 7 owner and want to keep your device looking great but don’t want to cover the shiny with a plastic case, the fully funded Indiegogo campaign for the SwitchEasy GLASS case might be an option for you. The GLASS case is actually made of tempered glass… at least the see through back of the case is glass. \nThere is an aluminum bumper frame around the sides that has been designed to provide protection. \nThe best way to protect the beauty of Jet Black iPhone’s is not to touch its delicate black back finish. SwitchEasy designed a 1mm gap between the phone and the back of the GLASS case, allowing less than 13% of iPhone’s surface to come in contact with the case. With a rigid case structure, composed of aluminum and glass, it ensures the back of the case and iPhone will never be compromised. \nAs with most metal cases, there is a problem with signal interference. SwitchEasy has a solution for that as well with their patent-pending wireless pass-through design. The frame has Pass-Through Nubs that enable a wireless signal to pass through metal casing. \nThe SwitcEasy GLASS case Indiegogo project ends in 15 days with shipping scheduled for this month in time for the holidays. You can pre-order a case for $29 for either the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. For more info head over to Indiegogo . Share this story",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb has snapped up large stakes in Apple ( AAPL ) and Alibaba ( BABA ), and continued to expand his stake in Facebook ( FB ).\nGetty Images According to a 13F filing released Friday , Loeb’s Third Point reported that it owned 2.5 million shares of Apple and 2.6 million shares of Alibaba as of Sept. 30, both new positions for the fund.\nThe firm also raised its stake in Facebook to 5.5 million shares from the 3.8 million shares it owned as of the end of June and raised its stake in Google’s parent company Alphabet ( GOOGL ) to 550,000 shares.\nInvestors managing more than $100 million are required to reveal their holdings to the SEC every quarter via 13F filing that detail the number of shares held and the value of each stake. Fund managers have until 45 days after the end of a fiscal quarter to complete the filing.\nThird Point’s new holdings also included Visa ( V ) and Dell Technologies ( DVMT ) and health insurer Humana ( HUM ).\nLoeb’s hedge fund trimmed its in Allergan ( AGN ) to 3.8 million from more than 5.4 million at the end of June and exited its former stake in Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ).\nThe quarterly 13F filings are closely scrutinized by journalists and investors who believe there is much to be learned watching the portfolio moves of Wall Street titans like Warren Buffett and hedge fund gurus like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn .\nBut beware. Hedge funds don’t always get it right. Also, 13-F filings generally don’t hit the wires until the very last minute, so portfolios can lag big market moves or fail to reflect changes.\nAnd the filings paint an incomplete picture because they show so-called long positions in U.S. stocks, but not short positions, or investments in bonds or currencies.",

      "text": "Apple's iOS support app surfaces in the Netherlands For now, it's doesn't appear to be available elsewhere. Share Save \nReports of an Apple support app began making the rounds a year ago and now it looks like the company may be close to an official launch. The software is now available in the Dutch App Store , but our editors have confirmed the switch hasn't been flipped for iOS users in the US, UK or Hong Kong. We've reached out to Apple for more information on availability and we'll update this post if we hear back. \nThe app serves up product information and tips to help with any minor issues. It also helps you schedule a repair appointment at an Apple Store or with an authorized third-party who can assist with a more serious problem. There's also the ability to chat, email or schedule a call with a support technician. You can view your recent support history to keep track of things as well. \nWhat's more, the Apple Support app also lists all the devices tied to your account. If you're not sure of an exact model number and other information someone will need to help you, you have easy access to those details with this new iOS software. The app will also help you find answers and articles that are specific to the products you own, which will hopefully cut down on time spent searching for a fix.",

      "text": "You might have thought that Apple would have been working on trying to fix up iOS right after an 18-year-old publicly executed a nasty exploit that could make the host device do supposedly anything from a click of a web link: call 911 repeatedly, send torrents of emails and performing other JavaScript tasks to do so much.\nWell, it turns out that after doing a little more digging, one Collin Mulliner has been able to replicate the bug that the Arizona teenager put out. He was able to figure out how iOS apps that use the in-built WebView browser to display external webpages are vulnerable to a bug that traces back to iPhone OS 3. You know, before when the iPad and iPod touch got into the family.\nNowadays, when your iPhone reads the HTML of any page on Safari, it’s supposed to make sure you want to call the number requested through a dialog prompt. It used to simply dial and call the number upon read. Apple did patch this bug, but it has neglected to do so for the WebView browser.\n\nThat means that if you click on, say, a Facebook or Twitter link to a page coded in such a way, you are at peril with whatever the HTML code makes your phone do. In Mulliner’s simulated case, it is to call a certain number and lock out any input into the phone through a mix of bogging the phone with too much information at the same time.\nMulliner, who was able to use a bug he had in 2008 to work with an app with WebView in 2016, contacted both Twitter and Apple. The developer also has a bounty cap on his way.\nThe post The iOS 911 vulnerability was reported in 2008, usable in 2016 appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "About two weeks ago, Apple said that the company's new AirPods weren't going to hit store shelves as early as anticipated. Without getting into too much detail, Apple issued a prepared statement indicating that the company needed a \"a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Recently, an optimistic, albeit sketchy, rumor hinted that Apple might begin shipping AirPods to retail outlets as early as late next week. Unfortunately, the rumor now appears to be off-the-mark in light of a new research report which claims that AirPods production might not even begin until December. And as if that weren't frustrating enough, the initial production run is said to be for just limited quantities. \n\n(more…) Trending right now: \nThe best feature of AT&T’s new $35 TV subscription might be illegal Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss ",

Three new models are expected to be unveiled at an event next year in March.From our perspective, the most interesting rumored update is an alleged bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad. Interestingly, Apple is said to have fitted in a much larger screen without increasing the footprint compared to the latest iPad Air, which features a 9.7-inch display.Supply chain sources say that both the 9.7- and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro models will be updated although the series is in for a bit of a twist. Allegedly, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro won't be a premium tablet despite its 'Pro' name. Instead, it will feature entry-level specs and will be positioned in a more affordable segment of the market, probably somewhere above the iPad Mini. While the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is expected to be nerfed with the next iteration, its larger brother is said to be improved. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to be updated to a True Tone display like the one on the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro, an upgrade that made sense the minute the 9.7-inch iPad Pro came out.For a brief moment, we'd like to get back to the alleged bezel-less 10.9-inch iPad. With Apple widely expected to launch the iPhone 8 with an edge-to-edge AMOLED screen next fall, the unveiling of a bezel-less iPad would provide us with a sneak peek at how Apple plans to approach edge-to-edge screens looking forward. Since we've mentioned the iPad Mini, this new rumor indicates that Apple will not update the iPad mini series. Previous rumors dating back this October claimed that the iPad mini is in for its much-needed refresh, but this new rumor says it's not going to happen.How does a bezel-less iPad Air sound to you guys?",

      "text": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. says sales from its massive Singles Day shopping event totaled $17.8 billion, up more than 24% from the record $14.3 billion sold last year.\nThe most popular U.S. brands as of about 10:30 p.m. CST were, in order: Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.44% Nike Inc. NKE, +0.74% New Balance, Playboy, and Skechers USA Inc. SKX, +1.31%\n“Alibaba is using this year’s Singles Day to showcase the number of international brands participating, everyone from Apple, Victoria’s Secret, Burberry, Gap GPS, +1.47% , [and] Nike, acting as the gateway to China for these brands and fulfilling Chinese consumers’ insatiable demand for Western products,” said Danielle Bailey, head of Asia-Pacific research for L2 Inc.\nVictoria’s Secret is in the L Brands Inc. LB, +1.34% portfolio.\nSingles Day started strong, with sales of $1 billion recorded in the first five minutes .\nSee also: Backlash bites New Balance after backing Trump’s trade stance\nAlibaba Offers Virtual-Reality Shopping on Singles' Day (1:48) Alibaba is hoping to boost sales from China’s biggest annual online-shopping event--Singles' Day--with what it claims is the world’s first virtual-reality shopping experience.\nMany U.S. brands have tried and, so far, failed to find success in the Chinese market. Recently, Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.05% said it would abandon efforts to launch a full-service offering in China.\nSee also: Netflix joins ranks of U.S. tech companies admitting they can’t conquer China\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.39% announced in June that it would partner with Alibaba BABA, -1.36% rival JD.Com Inc. to grow its China business. The partners announced new initiatives in October.\nSee also: Wal-Mart’s deal with China’s JD.com may be copied by others\nApple and Nike are popular in China irrespective of the day, with Nike reporting 21% revenue growth in China in fiscal first-quarter 2017. The U.S. and China are Nike’s two biggest basketball markets, Trevor Edwards, Nike brand president, said on the Sept. 27 earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\nThe Playboy brand is also popular in China , with items like jewelry and fragrances selling well.\nStarbucks Corp. SBUX, +0.62% seized the opportunity to get into the Singles Day festivities, offering a Cocoa Java Mocha beverage exclusively for the day at locations across China. The company also sold gift sets, exclusively-designed gift cards, and limited-edition My Starbucks Rewards Cards 11/11.\nForty-seven million users purchased international brands, led by U.S. brands, according to L2 data, and 82% of sales were made on a mobile device.\n“With Alibaba distributing different deals across different devices, they have encouraged devoted savings seekers to keep separate shopping carts on their desktops and mobile phones,” said Tim Barrett, retail analyst at Euromonitor International. “Alibaba is grooming a generation of mobile-first shoppers, a move which will pay off greatly when the entire world is addicted to their mobile devices.”\nFor Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang, this integration of sales across different platforms is critical.\n“If you look at this as an online game, people see you will have less margin in the future,” Zhang said, according to the Alibaba live blog of the Singles Day event. “But when we look at the entire landscape, only 10% of China’s total retail is online. [W]hat we believe is that at the end of this, online and offline… should be fully integrated.”\nThis year, Alibaba introduced virtual reality into the 11.11 experience, as well as games, with 2.6 billion games played, according to L2.\nSee also: On Singles’ Day, Alibaba exec says U.S. needs China\n“Alibaba is blurring the lines between entertainment and e-commerce and extending technologies thought to be simply gimmicks in the West,” said Bailey.\nEven with the eye-popping sales numbers, popular brands and new technologies, Alibaba shares are down 1.4% in Friday trading.\n“In keeping with the de-emphasis of GMV [gross merchandise value] as a reported metric, we expect sales volume to become but one of many focuses of the event, with others being new mobile functionality, innovations and improvements in logistics, new partnerships,” said Deutsche Bank in a note published Tuesday, which calls Singles Day “a PR exercise.” Analysts there expected 35% year-over-year growth.\nDeutsche Bank rates Alibaba shares buy with a $138 price target.\nAlibaba shares are up 14.4% for the year so far while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.27% is up 5.7% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch Vice-Presidential Debate in Two Minutes Coal-mining boss: ‘Tesla is a fraud’ How Advanced Would Aliens Need to Be to Contact Earth?",

Reflecting on Trump’s vow to offer a lower, 10% tax on any overseas cash brought back to the U.S., Huberty writes it \"should be beneficial and most impactful for the mid-to-large cap names that have a significant percentage of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and are interested in making acquisitions or stepping up capital return to shareholders.\"",

Providing a total of thirteen ports, it’s an elegant and versatile way to connect a wide variety of accessories such as external hard drives, webcams, audio interfaces, Ultra HD displays, wired network connection, and more, and can also supply power to the 2016 MacBook Pro at the same time. \nSpecifically, the new dock provides 40GB/s of bandwidth and two Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ports which can daisy-chain and power up to five Thunderbolt 3 devices, five USB 3.1 ports, with two high-power USB ports for faster charging, and individual FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, mini DisplayPort, and analog and S/PDIF digital audio ports. A built-in SD card reader also allows you to easily transfer photos and videos onto your MacBook Pro.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Apple ( AAPL ) stands to benefit the most from any U.S. tax holiday on overseas cash, writes Morgan Stanley ’s Katy Huberty , while disk drive maker Western Digital ( WDC ) could be at risk from trad policy by a Trump administration.\nReflecting on Trump’s vow to offer a lower, 10% tax on any overseas cash brought back to the U.S., Huberty writes it “should be beneficial and most impactful for the mid-to-large cap names that have a significant percentage of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and are interested in making acquisitions or stepping up capital return to shareholders.”\nChief among them is Apple:\nApple, with $216B of cash held offshore (or 37% of market cap), is the largest beneficiary and would likely pay $54B less in taxes should a repatriation holiday occur and they decide to move all their cash onshore. This would give Apple a significant amount of accessible dry powder to potentially make a sizable acquisition, boost returns to shareholders, pay down debt or do all of the above. It would likely also remove an overhang on the stock that has been in place for many years. Other companies with large offshore cash balances that could potentially step up M&A activity or return cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1)? NTAP (offshore cash is 43% of mkt cap), HPE (26%), HPQ (21%), WDC (17%) and IBM (6%). Collectively, these six companies could save over $61B in taxes, or 25% of their current offshore cash balance, with a 10% repatriation holiday.\nOn the flip side, for Western and other names with high exposure to international sales, tariffs or other limitations would be a risk.\n“International markets make up, on average, 46% of reported revenue for our coverage universe, with the Asia Pacific region representing about 20% of revenue.”\n“While we have no advanced knowledge of specific policies president-elect Trump will enact,” she writes, “investors are asking who could be most exposed if tariffs and other limitations on global trade are put in place.”\nHuberty offers the following ranking of international revenue exposure for the major hardware names:",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Billionaire hedge fund manager Dan Loeb has snapped up large stakes in Apple ( AAPL ) and Alibaba ( BABA ), and continued to expand his stake in Facebook ( FB ).\nGetty Images According to a 13F filing released Friday , Loeb’s Third Point reported that it owned 2.5 million shares of Apple and 2.6 million shares of Alibaba as of Sept. 30, both new positions for the fund.\nThe firm also raised its stake in Facebook to 5.5 million shares from the 3.8 million shares it owned as of the end of June and raised its stake in Google’s parent company Alphabet ( GOOGL ) to 550,000 shares.\nInvestors managing more than $100 million are required to reveal their holdings to the SEC every quarter via 13F filing that detail the number of shares held and the value of each stake. Fund managers have until 45 days after the end of a fiscal quarter to complete the filing.\nThird Point’s new holdings also included Visa ( V ) and Dell Technologies ( DVMT ) and health insurer Humana ( HUM ).\nLoeb’s hedge fund trimmed its in Allergan ( AGN ) to 3.8 million from more than 5.4 million at the end of June and exited its former stake in Activision Blizzard ( ATVI ).\nThe quarterly 13F filings are closely scrutinized by journalists and investors who believe there is much to be learned watching the portfolio moves of Wall Street titans like Warren Buffett and hedge fund gurus like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn .\nBut beware. Hedge funds don’t always get it right. Also, 13-F filings generally don’t hit the wires until the very last minute, so portfolios can lag big market moves or fail to reflect changes.\nAnd the filings paint an incomplete picture because they show so-called long positions in U.S. stocks, but not short positions, or investments in bonds or currencies.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Apple ( AAPL ) stands to benefit the most from any U.S. tax holiday on overseas cash, writes Morgan Stanley ’s Katy Huberty , while disk drive maker Western Digital ( WDC ) could be at risk from trad policy by a Trump administration.\nReflecting on Trump’s vow to offer a lower, 10% tax on any overseas cash brought back to the U.S., Huberty writes it “should be beneficial and most impactful for the mid-to-large cap names that have a significant percentage of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and are interested in making acquisitions or stepping up capital return to shareholders.”\nChief among them is Apple:\nApple, with $216B of cash held offshore (or 37% of market cap), is the largest beneficiary and would likely pay $54B less in taxes should a repatriation holiday occur and they decide to move all their cash onshore. This would give Apple a significant amount of accessible dry powder to potentially make a sizable acquisition, boost returns to shareholders, pay down debt or do all of the above. It would likely also remove an overhang on the stock that has been in place for many years. Other companies with large offshore cash balances that could potentially step up M&A activity or return cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1)? NTAP (offshore cash is 43% of mkt cap), HPE (26%), HPQ (21%), WDC (17%) and IBM (6%). Collectively, these six companies could save over $61B in taxes, or 25% of their current offshore cash balance, with a 10% repatriation holiday. \nOn the flip side, for Western and other names with high exposure to international sales, tariffs or other limitations would be a risk.\n“International markets make up, on average, 46% of reported revenue for our coverage universe, with the Asia Pacific region representing about 20% of revenue.”\n“While we have no advanced knowledge of specific policies president-elect Trump will enact,” she writes, “investors are asking who could be most exposed if tariffs and other limitations on global trade are put in place.”\nHuberty offers the following ranking of international revenue exposure for the major hardware names:",

      "text": "Apple certified Kanex GoPower Watch provides 6X the charge\nNew York, NY (PRWEB) November 10, 2016\nKanex today announced that it has been named a CES 2017 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Computer Accessories category for its GoPower Watch portable Apple Watch charger. Products entered in the prestigious program are judged by a preeminent panel of independent industrial designers, independent engineers and members of the trade media to honor outstanding design and engineering in cutting edge consumer electronics products across 27 product categories.\nThe GoPower Watch is the first cordless portable charger for Apple Watch. This portable, magnetic charging dock uses the same inductive charging connector that comes with Apple Watch. Packed with 4,000 mAh of power, GoPower Watch’s lightweight battery is capable of delivering six full charges to the Apple Watch, while an additional USB port allows an iPhone to charge simultaneously.\n“We are thrilled to be recognized as an honoree of the CES 2017 Innovation Awards,” said Andrew Truong of Kanex. “The Kanex GoPower Watch frees users from being tied down to wall outlets and offers six additional days of convenient, portable power packed into a premium, slim device.”\nThe prestigious CES Innovation Awards are sponsored by the Consumer Technology Association (CTATM), the producer of CES 2017, the global gathering place for all who thrive on the business of consumer technologies, and have been recognizing achievements in product design and engineering since 1976.\nThe Kanex GoPower Watch will be displayed at CES 2017, which runs from January 5 – 8 in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the LVCC North Hall in booth #8906. A selection of Honorees will also be displayed at CES Unveiled New York, which features dozens of exhibitors and networking opportunities and runs 3:00-7:30 PM November 10 at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York.\nEntries are evaluated on their engineering, aesthetic and design qualities, intended use/function and user value, how the design and innovation of the product directly compares to other products in the marketplace and unique/novel features present.\nProducts chosen as CES Innovation Honorees reflect innovative design and engineering in some of the most cutting edge tech products and services coming to market.\nCES 2017 Innovation Honoree products are featured on CES.tech/Innovation, which lists product categories, as well as each product name, manufacturer information, description, photo and URL.\nThe Kanex GoPower Watch is available on http://www.kanex.com/gopowerwatch for $99.95, as well as Amazon.com.\nAbout Kanex\nKanex is a group of thinkers, creators, technologists, go-getters and doers.

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo The iPad was mysteriously left out in the cold when Apple held its October event. A few models are in need of an upgrade and it was odd Apple didn’t announce anything new. But now we may know the reason why.\nAccording to Barclays Research analysts, Apple is prepping refreshed models for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch Pro models along with adding a new 10.9-inch bezel-free model in March. The new 10.9-inch iPad will apparently retain the same physical size as the 9.7-inch model, but the elimination of the bezels will allow for the bigger display. This may also hint at the end of the home button.\nThe 12.9-inch iPad Pro refresh will get the True Tone display and 12-megapixel camera present in the smaller Pro model, Barclays Research said. Each new model will also reportedly sport four microphones and will retain the 3.5mm headphone jack—continuing to make the elimination of the port in the iPhone that much more head scratching.\nApple won’t refresh the iPad Mini 4, which last received a minor redesign and spec upgrade in 2015. No word on whether the iPad Air 2 will be refreshed or not.\nWhat new iPads means for Apple These are just rumors at this point, but it does give us an understanding as to what direction the iPad line is heading. In the past year, with the introduction of the iPad Pro, Apple began making the shift to sell the iPad as more of a computer replacement than a computer companion. But with a new bezel-free iPad model, Apple may surprise us and reinvigorate its tablet lineup.\n\n\nSource : Mac Rumors ",

      "text": "Apple’s iBooks StoryTime app for Apple TV will read to your kids Posted DigitalGlobe’s new imaging satellite makes it to space \nApple on Thursday released a new Apple TV application called iBooks StoryTime that brings children’s books to the TV’s big screen. Kids can flip through the pages of the books on their own, or switch on Read-Aloud narration which will sync the audio to the on-screen text and flip the pages for you. \nThe app, which works on 4th generation Apple TV devices that have access to tvOS App Store, is a free download, but the books themselves are not. There’s one free giveaway at launch so you can test the functionality: a Read-Aloud title called “Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook.” \nIf you want to buy more books, you can do so from the StoryTime app itself, as well as via the iBookstore on Mac, iPhone and iPad. If you’ve already purchased compatible content through your Apple account, it will automatically show up here as well. \nThere aren’t that many supported titles available at present, but the list includes a few classics like “Goodnight Moon,” “The Little Red Hen,” and “Green Eggs and Ham,” for example. Popular characters like Sophia the First, Grover, and Cookie Monster also have books available, among others. sc720x405-3",

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images Grubhub's Matt Maloney (left) and Apple's Tim Cook wrote post-election letters to their teams in the wake of the 2016 election. The leaders of some American companies are grappling with workplace diversity in the wake of Donald Trump's election as president. Several CEOs have written letters to their employees ensuring them that they will honor and celebrate the diversity of their teams. One letter from the CEO of Grubhub, which he later clarified, singled out Trump for the statements he made impugning minorities during the long and rancorous campaign. Women Anxious About Future of Contraception Under Trump Matt Maloney, the food delivery service co-founder, sent an email to all his employees Wednesday saying he rejects Trump's \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics.\" He added that many of Trump's campaign comments \"would have resulted in his immediate termination.\" Maloney went on to say in the email that the Chicago-based company would fight on behalf of anyone who felt exposed in the wake of the election. WATCH: Obama Welcomes Trump to the White House President Barack Obama welcomed President-elect Donald Trump to the White House Thursday for a private meeting in the Oval Office. After spending roughly 90 minutes together the pair made a brief statement to reporters. Obama said he was \"encouraged\" by the wide-ranging conversation the pair had, adding that it's important \"we call come together\" to face the challenges America faces. Trump added that he \"very much looks forward\" to dealing with President Obama in the future and will rely on his \"counsel\" (Published Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016) \"If you do not agree with this statement then please reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here,\" Maloney said. \"We do not tolerate hateful attitudes on our team.\" Maloney later clarified his position in a statement on Grubhub's website Thursday, saying his email advocated for inclusion and tolerance and that Grubhub doesn't discriminate based on political beliefs. Calls Grow for Trump to Respond to Hate Incidents, KKK Rally \"The message of the email is that we do not tolerate discriminatory activity or hateful commentary in the workplace, and that we will stand up for our employees,\" the statement said. Trump has not responded to these remarks, or others from U.S. businesses about diversity. NBC reached out for a comment from a Trump representative. Anti-Trump Protests Erupt in US Cities Stephen Maturen/Getty Images Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud storage company Box, reached out to his staff as well. He posted an edited version of his emailed message on Medium.com , writing that people \"have been through an emotional roller coaster of toxic rhetoric and behaviors throughout this campaign.\" \"At Box, we are strongly committed to our values of openness and inclusion and will do everything to fight for these principles going forward,\" Levie continued, reiterating a commitment to building a culture that reflect's the organization's diversity.

Apple CEO Tim Cook also sent an email to his employees Wednesday night, after hearing from employees with strong feelings about the election, Buzzfeed reported . Obama: ‘We Are All on One Team’ President Barack Obama, addressing the nation on Nov. 9, urged the country to come together after a divisive election season. “We are all on one team.

Place the cranberry apple filling down the center of the pastry, keeping it in the middle third and leaving 1\" of space at the top and bottom of the pastry. Cut away the top corners from the left and right thirds of the. Cut 8 equal 1\" strips along each side, leaving ½\" of space from the apples. Cut away excess dough at the bottom corners. Fold down top flap of dough and pinch the corners down to seal. Fold in the side strips, alternating from left to right. Fold up the bottom flap, pinching the corners to seal then finish folding in the last 2 side strips, pinching the corners to seal. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with silicone or parchment and bake at 400˚F for 18-22 minutes (mine was perfect at 20 min) or until top is golden brown.

      "text": "TWEET Earlier this year, in a move that was well received by gun control activists, Apple replaced the more realistic-looking gun emoji with a bright green water gun in its iOS 10 update. Android users should not expect a similar modification, as Google, which owns the operating system, announced at the inaugural Emojicon in San Francisco that it would be keeping its gun emoji. Apple replaced its pistol emoji with a green squirt gun icon. Source: Apple Newsroom The motivation to keep the gun emoji is to ensure nothing gets lost in translation; Google essentially wants to make certain emojis are universally consistent across its different devices and platforms. This way, in theory, there will be no miscommunication between a user sending a relatively harmless water gun emoji and a user who receives a pistol emoji. \"The thing is, emojis already look different on different platforms, and it does cause confusion,\" Jeremy Burge, editor of Emojipedia, told the BBC at the time of Apple's gun emoji redesign. \"When we're dealing with guns and toys as a comparison, that's a whole new level of problems that we have there.\" Currently, Apple's operating system is the only one to represent the gun emoji as a squirt gun. While Microsoft previously had a toy gun emoji, it switched to a revolver emoji as part of its Windows 10 Anniversary Update one week after Apple's announcement. \"We believe in the cross-platform communication, so we are maintaining our gun,\" Rachel Been, a Google art director who worked on Android emojis, said at the three-day event, according to Fortune . Apple, Google and Microsoft are all members of Unicode Consortium , the nonprofit in charge of selecting and overseeing emojis. Like us on Facebook: ",

      "text": "About two weeks ago, Apple said that the company's new AirPods weren't going to hit store shelves as early as anticipated. Without getting into too much detail, Apple issued a prepared statement indicating that the company needed a \"a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.”\nRecently, an optimistic, albeit sketchy, rumor hinted that Apple might begin shipping AirPods to retail outlets as early as late next week. Unfortunately, the rumor now appears to be off-the-mark in light of a new research report which claims that AirPods production might not even begin until December. And as if that weren't frustrating enough, the initial production run is said to be for just limited quantities.\nDON'T MISS: Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves\nCiting sources close to Apple's supply chain, analysts from Barclays Research write that AirPods won't even hit the production line for at least another three to four weeks at best. What remains unclear, though, is when in December Apple is hoping to begin production. Apple would ideally like to have AirPods packaged and ready for purchase in time for the holiday shopping season, but that's starting to look less and less likely with each passing week. In fact, we wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if AirPods don't start shipping until early January of 2017.\nMacRumors reports :\nBarclays said the initial production run will be \"fairly small,\" totaling between 10 million and 15 million AirPods to start. Depending on demand, the limited supply could result in a scenario where AirPods stock is quickly depleted upon launch, resulting in extended shipping estimates akin to a new iPhone launch.\nAll in all, this isn't a good look for Apple. While it's one thing to give users a sneak peek at an upcoming product, promising a launch in October only to delay said launch for as much as two to three months is something that Apple observers used to mock other tech companies for.\nTrending right now:\nThe best feature of AT&T’s new $35 TV subscription might be illegal Leak suggests the iPhone 8 will finally get the redesign it deserves Best Buy and Target have iPhone 7 Black Friday deals you shouldn’t miss See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe merits of reading aloud to young children are innumerable. It’s invaluable for bonding time, of course, but it’s also an opportunity for children to develop basic speech skills, grasp the fundamentals of language, and begin to think a little more creatively and abstractly about the world. That’s undoubtedly one of the reasons Apple’s released a new app for Apple TV, iBooks StoryTime , designed to help children follow along interactive, animated stories on TV. \nApple describes iBooks StoryTime as a “different way to experience classic kids’ books and discover new favorites” on the app’s iTunes page. “With read-aloud narration and beautiful illustrations, every handpicked title in the app transforms Apple TV into an engaging place for young readers to enjoy the stories they love.” \nMore: Apple launches Beta 2 of iOS 10.2, featuring new TV app and Music app UI tweaks \nThe new app, which launched on Friday morning, acts as an extension of the iBooks app on the iPad, iPhone, and macOS computers. Kids download titles they’d like to peruse and a read-aloud feature helps them along at a variable pace. Book pages turn automatically as audio and visual cues appear onscreen, guiding kids as they progress through chapters. Titles synched with audio narration, special character voices, and sound effects scroll at the bottom of the TV — sort of like literary karaoke. \nParents can also get involved, and kids can read at their own pace in manual mode, in which pages flip with a flick of the Apple TV’s Siri remote. \nBetter yet, StoryTime plays nicely with the rest of Apple’s iBooks ecosystem. Purchased titles download instantly to Apple devices signed into the same iCloud account, and conversely, supported books purchased on iPad and iPhone show up on the Apple TV. Progress syncs across hardware, too — kids can leave pick up where they leave left off on any iOS or macOS device. \nMore: Now, you can send money to your friends via PayPal by shouting at Siri \nStoryTime’s library is relatively limited at the moment. The curated crop of initial books includes Green Eggs and Ham , The ABC’s of Cookies , The Little Red Hen , Meet Tracker , and Goodnight Moon . Apple is also offering a Dora’s Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook as a free download.",

      "text": "Who’s it for: Apple fans who want the best phablet ever \nHow much will it cost: $770+ \nWhy we picked the iPhone 7 Plus : \nApple’s phablet keeps getting better every year. The iPhone 7 Plus may look nearly identical to last year’s iPhone 6S Plus, but it packs some huge internal improvements inside its slim metal body. The 5.5-inch screen is still a 1080p LCD panel this year, but it looks as sharp and rich as before. in fact, this year’s iPhone has an even brighter screen. \nUnderneath the panel is Apple’s homegrown A10 Fusion processor, which is perfectly tuned to power the iPhone 7 Plus. In benchmark tests, the A10 Fusion blows away the competition, and real-world performance is equally impressive. Apple’s iOS 10 brings big improvements to the iPhone, including rich notifications, increased 3D Touch functionality, better widgets, and much more. It is also the most secure mobile operating system, thanks to instantaneous updates and security patches. Apple also focuses on user privacy and security more than most with its dedication to encryption and refusal to store and read user data. \nHowever, the real star of the show is the impressive 12-megapixel dual cameras. One of the cameras is a telephoto lens that offers 2x optical hardware zoom and up to 10x software zoom. The quality of 2x zoom on the iPhone 7 Plus is just extraordinary. It beats out every other smartphone on the market. You don’t lose detail, and your zoomed picture turns out excellent. You can go up to 5x in good lighting conditions without too much noticeable loss in quality, which is still better than you can say of any other smartphone’s zoom. \nThe dual-camera lenses also enable the best bokeh effect (when the background blurs around the subject of the shot) we’ve ever seen on a smartphone. Other phones, including the Pixel, tend to mess up the blurring effect on the small details. Apple is also well known for reproducing colors accurately, while Android phones consistently oversaturate images. It comes down to personal preference, but we prefer the iPhone’s natural hues. It also produces strong images in low light, rivaled only by the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. \nThe iPhone 7 Plus is the phablet to buy (so long as you don’t mind losing the headphone jack).",

Now, it seems like Apple is following suit — at least a little. The company has quietly launched a support app on the App Store. \nThe app represents a slightly less hands-on approach from Apple, which has traditionally offered more personal support through avenues like the Apple Store. Clearly, the goal here is to help people quickly and easily without them having to come into the Apple Store every time something goes wrong. \nMore: Apple seemingly getting some 2016 MacBook Pro orders ready for shipment \nThe app basically includes help articles for popular topics, and it actually doesn’t stop at the iPhone — users can get help with their Macs and other Apple devices too. When you open the app up, you’ll see a list of devices registered to your Apple account, with help articles for each of them. \nThankfully, the app doesn’t stop there — it also offers a live chat feature, so if you can’t find the help you need from the articles, you can get more personal help from an Apple support representative. Not only that, but if you can’t find what you need through the chat feature, you can then call a support agent. Last but not least, if all else fails, you can schedule an appointment at the nearest Apple Store. \nIt seems as though the app is currently only being offered in English, but it’s available in a number of countries around the world, and it is likely we’ll see it open up to more languages in the future. It’s also likely we’ll see the app pre-loaded on future versions of the iPhone. You can get the app for yourself here .",

Sam Graves stating that more gun control won’t stop radical Islamic terrorism. I believe that comprehensive gun control would go a long way in reducing gun violence in America. \nJared Lee Loughner shot Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six people Jan. 8, 2011. Loughner was not an Islamic terrorist. \nOn April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado. They were not Islamic terrorists. \nOn July 20, 2012, James Holmes killed 12 people at a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Holmes was not an Islamic terrorist. \nOn Dec. 14, 2012, Adam Lanza fatally shot 20 children and six adult staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Lanza was not an Islamic terrorist. \nUsing “Islamic terrorism” as an excuse to ignore gun control in America is just another bow to the gun lobby. As one of those “anti-gun liberals” Graves referred to, I believe that we must do more. \nCharles L. Beucher Jr. \nKansas City Voting flu \nWhile standing in line at my voting site in south Kansas City, chatting with neighbors and acquaintances, I got the distinct impression that some people were voting not for the presidential candidate they favored, but against the person they disliked more. \nA nice touch at our voting site was the complimentary barf bags handed out to voters. \nTom Karczewski \nKansas City VA thanks \nAs a Korean War veteran, I hate to hear of veterans who are not receiving necessary services from the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nI served in the Army as a medical corpsman and was wounded and medically discharged with two Purple Hearts in 1952. \nI received a degree in education from Southern Illinois University under the G.I. Bill, which paid for my tuition, books, supplies and housing. \nI have received services at the medical centers in Leavenworth and Kansas City. I found the personnel in both locations to be respectful, cordial, qualified and responsive. \nThe VA has provided hearing aids, eyeglasses, a walker and other adaptive devices. The Vision Impairment Services Program provided me with an electronic reader and audio newspaper/book services, enhancing my quality of life, all at no cost to me. \nThe VA provides low-cost prescription medicines, saving me hundreds of dollars every year. \nI have gotten timely appointments, but when I visit one of the medical centers and witness the massive number of veterans being served, I can see how there could be delays. \nI have nothing but accolades for the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nJoseph Mayo \nBlue Springs Liberals’ beef \nJust because a conservative does not agree with everything a liberal believes, he is labeled a bully, mean-spirited, bigoted and the fall-back default criticism — racist. \nEven when a conservative capitulates and, to keep the peace, agrees to everything a liberal wants, the liberal denigrates the gesture with “It’s a good start, but it’s not enough.” \nThere will never be a time when liberals say, “It’s good enough,” until complete socialism is achieved, when everyone has the same income and all amenities. That would last about one day. \nIt’s a shame that retaining power by promising everything to everyone is so important. \nWould that public servants were just that. \nEdward Barnes \nPrairie Village Apology expected \nSome of Donald Trump’s campaign statements would be sufficient to get me fired. Taking his words at face value, it is easy to see him as a misogynistic racist bigot. \nI hope his words don’t reflect who he really is. I hope the majority of people who voted for Trump don’t approve of his derogatory statements. \nI believe a few are OK with his attacks. The election has validated their racist beliefs. \nIt’s OK to pick on Muslims, immigrants and Hispanics. It’s OK to deride women who don’t meet his appearance standards. \nWorse, Trump’s validation could embolden another group to try blowing up a Kansas mosque or go after immigrants in Montana. Most won’t go that far. \nI worry many in this group believe it’s OK to express their hatred in public and teach their kids it’s OK to bully. If it’s OK for the president to say, it must be OK for me to act that way. \nIt is not. \nTrump needs to own and apologize for his comments. More important, he must convey that it is not OK to treat each other as he has indicated. \nIf he doesn’t, then he really is the person that his words reflect. \nBrian Petrie \nIndependence iPhone Apple hold \nI recently wanted to replace the battery in my iPhone, which was lasting significantly less time after three years of ownership. I took it to the Apple store and requested that the battery be replaced. \nI was told that I needed an appointment and that they would notify me when my place in line had arrived. After occupying myself at a local restaurant, my turn arrived. \nI was greeted by an iPad-carrying young person who took my information and sent me to another line. Here, a genius (nice guy really) evaluated my phone and told me my battery was shot. I needed to come back in the next four days for a replacement. \nI returned to drop off my iPhone and was placed in a line, presumably to find out what I wanted. I was then greeted by a second person who found another genius for me. The phone was re-evaluated, and I was told I could leave it if I could get it out of its case, which was next to impossible. \nLuckily I succeeded. On a third trip to the store, I was able to pick it up. \nBusiness idea: I drop off stuff. You fix it. I pay you. \nStephen Kunz \nOverland Park Embracing people \nIf I left an office where I had applied for a job and I saw a black person sitting in the waiting room, I could feel a sense of relief. Inside of my liberal self, the knowledge that the black person was not as likely to get the job as I was could rise unbidden. \nI’m glad things are changing, but I know others who have benefited from this kind of privileged existence are not. \nWe have plowed through American history, a juggernaut that need not concern itself with other cultures or races that would, we guessed, just sort themselves out in our wake as best they could. \nI understand you may see recent trends as “us” being in trouble. The birth rate for whites is down, immigrants are settling in and whites find themselves in an ever more evenly matched regatta. \nBut what are some saying? That people in white culture can’t compete in a fair competition? \nIt’s going to be OK, folks. It’s not the end of the world. \nIt’s not even the end of your world. \nIf you can avoid the siren call of reactionary authoritarianism, this could turn out to be a race you can be proud of. \nThomas Hall \nRea, Mo. Differing freedoms \nLiberals interpret the Second Amendment as narrowly as they can, wanting to limit gun ownership to members of a state militia. \nBut they want to interpret the religious freedom clause in the First Amendment extremely broadly, to the extent of turning it into freedom from religion and making the slightest, generic reference to a religious subject an attempt to establish a state religion. \nThis seems very hypocritical to me. \nRobert Reimers \nGardner We’re worried \nIn Friday’s “Short Take“ (11-11, 11A, “Short Take: Trump didn’t win because of racism”), Ramesh Ponnuru argued against the idea that Donald Trump was put into the White House by racists. Perhaps not, but I think that’s not ultimately the “race question” that worries most of the people who are dismayed by his victory. \nWhat worries us is that he tolerated it. That he didn’t repudiate the white supremacists, that he could say such vulgar and offensive things about women and not seem to understand that “locker room talk” of that type is as offensive and wrong as using the “n-word” as an epithet. That the things he said about Mexicans, Muslims, disabled people and many others could even pop into his head. \nWhatever mental world he lives in, it’s one we had hoped we were leaving behind. Instead, we apparently are sending it to the White House. That’s what worries us. \nJan S. Gephardt \nWestwood Free-speech threat \nThe insidious attitude of today’s law enforcement thinking that free speech is not a public right is as scary as any development in the last half-century. \nEven in the protests of the 1960s, officials acknowledged this basic of all human rights. The shift in thinking is an almost unbelievable outcome until one fully considers the acceptance of today’s militaristic law-enforcement practices that have produced an us-against-them mindset. \nThis is a major element resulting in much of the mistrust many feel when approached by any officer. \nM. Rex Strunk \nIndependence Polite drivers \nIn both Kansas and Missouri, slower traffic is to move to the right on highways. As a side note, fog lamps are designed to be used in fog, not daily on your truck to artificially inflate your manhood. \nCarla Akins \nKansas City Suckers \nI would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Donald Trump. He has managed to pull off one of the greatest political scams in modern history. \nTo all of you middle-class citizens who voted for him so he can lower your taxes, enjoy your time in Fantasy Land while you wait for that to happen. \nAnd while you’re looking forward to the wall being built, you might want to check out the famous quote about suckers that’s closely tied to P.T. Barnum. \nDiana Brinsko",

      "text": "In the beginning they counted your steps, your distance, and your calorie burn. Then they counted your heartbeats. Some tried their luck at analyzing your sleep quality, with varying degrees of success.\nFitness trackers have been around for a few years now. Sensors have gotten better and cheaper. Algorithms have advanced. But what I’d argue is the most important fitness measurement—at least for aerobic stuff like running—has still not been added. \nLet&apos;s call it \"pain factor,\" the level and duration of physical strain or fatigue you feel while exercising.\nWorkouts come and workouts go. We come to our workouts at various times of the day and week, and with various body conditions—different amounts and quality of sleep, different types and amounts of fuel (food) in the tank, different stress levels. So that workout that seemed like a piece of cake on Monday morning can feel grueling on Thursday afternoon.\nIt’s that level of suffering we should be watching. The difference between someone who’s successful at working out well and consistently, and someone who isn&apos;t, may be in their ability to understand pain level and their capacity for pain—and manage it accordingly.\nYou don’t need a device to tell you when you’re feeling the burn. But a device could put a number on it that’s based on real, measurable factors. \"Pain factor\" is a relative number, meaningful only in its relationship to other pain levels at other times.\nSo we need our fitness trackers to know when we’re suffering based on some simple information that we, and our bodies, provide. The algorithm would need to know something about what I’d eaten that day. It might factor in the quality of my sleep the night before. Heart rate relative to the difficulty of the workout would likely be a factor. \nHow It Might Work Let’s say we can now look down at our wrist and see a \"pain level\" number from 1 to 10. What could we do with that? How could that help?\nIt could change the way you normally measure the quality of your workout. Instead of looking at basic metrics like pace, duration, or distance, you might begin seeing \"quality\" as the amount of time you maintained a specific activity at a given pain level.\nLet’s say you haven’t worked out in a while and you’ve fallen out of shape. You might reach your pain factor norm well before you finish the normal time or distance of your workout. Time to stop.\nOn the other hand, if you’re having one of those good days when your body seems eager to work out, and you finish your normal workout before hitting your normal pain level, you might choose to tack an extra 10 minutes on to the end of the session.\nIt could service as a motivation tool. Let’s say you’re a little tired when you start your normal 35-minute run around the park. And five minutes in you’re hurting. If you know you have, in the past, powered through the same run at the same pain level, it might make you think, \"I’ve been here before; I know I can do this\" and keep going.\nOn the same logic, pain (or, rather, too much of it) doesn’t always turn into gain. Many people work out too hard (often driven by guilt about not working out enough) and endure more than a workout’s worth of pain. That can have physical risks, like injuries from trying to lift too much weight when you&apos;re tired.\nThe main risk might be psychological. When we push ourselves too hard or too long in a workout, it ratchets up the pain level. And it’s that pain level we tend to remember after the fact, not the extra 30 minutes on the treadmill or the extra two-mile run. And that memory of physical—and mental—pain can make it mentally harder to get yourself back in the gym or on the trail. And consistent workouts with moderate pain always trump infrequent, painful workouts.\nPerhaps the main theme in the evolution of health wearables is their ability to go beyond giving users raw, static data like time and distance, and deliver meaningful, actionable insights that can directly impact performance and health. \"Pain factor\" might be an example of that. The new metric would result from data crunching a set of more basic static and real-time numbers—some provided by sensors, others provided by the user—to generate a meaningful number for the user.\nOf course, even more useful would be a device that knows the meaning of that score so that it could say things like: \"You’ve suffered enough today, Mark. Now hit the showers.\"",
