      "text": "0 SHARE \nFirst launched in China back in May this year, the YI 4K Action Camera is an updated version of the YI Action Camera, featuring a 12MP Sony IMX377 sensor. The device is currently on sale for a affordable $199, so now may be the best time to pick one up. \nAs the name suggest, the YI 4K Action Camera can record 4K footage at 30fps, as well as 1080p recordings at 120fps, 720p recordings at 240fps video and 12MP photos using its 155° wide-angle lens with F2.8 aperture. \nThere’s also a built-in 2.19″ LCD touchscreen with a resolution of 640 x 360 for easy previewing and shooting. The display is covered with Gorilla Glass, so there’s less concern of it scratching. The device is powered by a 1400mAh battery. \nIf you’re interested in picking up one of these cameras, the link to the Amazon page is right here . For $199, it’s a pretty decent device. There are also bundles that come with selfie sticks and waterproof cases, but those are additional. TAGS",

      "title": "How Amazon snatched huge customer Motorola away from Microsoft (AMZN, MSI)",
      "text": "Michael Seto/Business Insider \nMotorola used to be one of those giant corporate conglomerates that employed 150,000 people, many at a massive campus in Schaumburg, Illinois. But it hit hard times, and over the last several years it sold off chunks of itself and became Motorola Solutions.\nMotorola Solutions is still a huge company. It employs around 14,000 and generated $5.8 billion in revenue over the last four quarters. But it has sold the huge campus and moved to new headquarters in Chicago.\nAs part of its move and cost cutting, Motorola is unplugging its data centers and going all-in in the cloud.\nIts cloud of choice is Amazon Web Services, Leo Wang, head of cloud computing, told Business Insider.\n\"When we first we started, we were moving just one data center, our Schaumburg data center,\" he said. \"Within 6 to 7 months, we moved more than 200,000 servers, and 150 applications, and we had more than $2 million in computer yearly spend moved over to AWS.\"\nAnd they liked AWS so much, they decided to move everything else into it, worldwide, over the course of the next two years, Wang said. \n\"We save millions per year. We invested millions initially but the long range savings will be significant, and we have a more aggressive plan next year and the year after.\"\nChoosing Amazon wasn't automatic. In fact, Motorola already had a smaller contract with Microsoft to use its competing cloud, Azure. But Microsoft wasn't able to turn that into a bigger sale.\nWhy Microsoft didn't win Michael Seto/Business Insider Motorola Solutions sells radios and communications equipment to government agencies like police, fire, other emergency services.\nThey chose Azure because Azure had a crucial government security certification known as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) and Amazon didn't.\nSo when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. It is much more mature in terms of functionality. They excelled in every aspect that we needed from the cloud perspective and from the customer service perspective, but they didn’t have the CIJS compliance,\" Wang said.\nBut CIJS certification was a deal breaker, they told Amazon.\n\"Initially, they were hesitating. They were not interested in having this certification because they were so big in the market,\" Wang says.\nBut they agreed to look into it and decided to get CIJS, realizing it could open up new government markets for its cloud. Amazon is already making a name for itself pursuing government cloud business with its \"GovCloud,\" a highly secured section of the AWS's services reserved for government use.\n\"Once they realized the importance of this certification in this industry, they invested. In a few months they were certified, and they created a Gov Cloud for us,\" Wang said.\nMichael Seto/Business Insider By doing this, Motorola was able to launch a brand new app for its law enforcement customers on AWS that lets them store camera footage on AWS. This app has the potential to be huge for Motorola and AWS, Wang believes.\nAmazon isn't known for its customer service, but Wang can't sing AWS's support praises any louder.\n\"Andy Jassy personally came to our office and had a detailed look at what we had. They put a lot of attention to us,\" Wang said.\nIn comparing AWS's support to that from Microsoft, he called it \"very different,\" saying, \"With AWS we are very tightly engaged with them in almost all efforts. We have meetings, we share our concerns, we have follow up, and a consultant works closely with us, and works closely with the product team.\"\nAmazon's big gotcha There is one big downside to choosing Amazon: it's harder to keep track of costs.\nLike all cloud providers Amazon charges for the actual time each machine (known as an instance) is used. That's a benefit over buying servers, which a company pays for if they use them or not.\nMichael Seto/Business Insider But if a company is not carefully watching its Amazon usage, it could run up a huge bill.\n\"In the cloud, it’s so easy to create resources, but the right governance over the usage is needed for you to get the price benefits. You need to be able to start and stop that instance only when the app is running.\" Wang said. \"If you simply spin up the servers without proper governance, you could end up paying more.\"\nAWS doesn't make this task easy.\n\"AWS, their pricing model is very complicated, that is a drawback,\" Wang says. He has complained to AWS about it and believes \"they are improving in that area.\"\nThere are hoards of apps that will monitor Amazon usage. Motorola doesn't use them. Instead, it hired a cloud consultant, 2nd Watch,  to help it move to AWS, size everything properly, train the IT staff and set up its own internal systems for watching usage, Wang says.\nDownsizing Oracle Michael Seto/Business Insider One bonus for moving to the cloud is that Motorola has a chance to look at its big expensive apps, like Oracle's database, and ditch them.\n\"In some of the instances, if we can use AWS [databases] instead of Oracle, we are doing that,\" he said, though he's not ready to dump Oracle completely. \"Oracle is still our big partner.\"\nThis is a huge concern for Oracle these days, as Amazon rolls out more database alternatives and has created a tool that helps a company move its database from Oracle to Amazon's homegrown one.  \nAvoiding hard feelings Michael Seto/Business Insider One last thing Motorola needed to work on was getting the IT staff on board. No one lost their jobs because of this move, Wang says. That's because Motorola had an outsourcer called CSC managing its infrastructure. With AWS, it won't need CSC.\nBut there's still some jealousy among the staff.\n\"My team is very excited because they are the core cloud computing team, doing the work. Some other IT teams are feeling left out. I can sense that kind of feeling,\" he said.\nSo, Wang says, he's working on eventually getting the other IT folks trained on the cloud. And people are excited to learn all the latest, greatest cloud tech. It's good for their careers. \"I will help them and they will help me, too.\"\nNOW WATCH: How the ‘perfect body’ for men has changed over the last 150 years \n",

      "text": "  7:58am CST | by M. Affan , in News | Cars & Vehicles Jeremy Clarkson Sets the Record Straight for Amazon’s Payment for The Grand Tour \n  Jeremy Clarkson shots down Netflix’s claim that Amazon paid $250 million for their latest show The Grand Tour \nOnce BBC fired Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear for misbehavior with one of the producers, we have seen the show decline. Don't Miss: The Best Cyber Deals on Amazon.com \nThat is particularly because his co-hosts, Richard Hammond and James May also left the show. No matter how much RJ Chris Evans tried to redeem the show, BBC almost lost the show because of declining ratings. \nClarkson, Hammond and May suffered no major losses with the sudden action. Having successfully proven that they were the reason that people watched Top Gear. \nThey were then able to sell the idea of a bigger and better show in The Grand Tour. The show went to the highest bidder and on November 18th, Amazon Prime premiered the first episode of the show which broke records in countries including U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Germany. \nAmazon is the top contender to compete with Netflix in online video content and The Grand Tour is one of the major steps for Amazon to step into the major leagues that will make it compete with Netflix and You Tube. \nAt time like that Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos recently said in a statement to The Telegraph that The Grand Tour had cost Amazon \"about a quarter of a billion dollars.\" He said that Netflix had also made a bid for the show and it had reached that amount. \nWhile many would think that the show was indeed expensive for the network, Jeremy Clarkson set the record straight about the amount paid by Amazon for the show. \nHe aid in an interview published Wednesday with CNN that, “Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe. It’s nowhere near as expensive as people have been saying.” \nHe did not reveal the number that Amazon had spent on the show but Clarkson reassured that it was definitely not quarter of a billion dollars. \nCyber Monday 2016: Shop the best Cyber Monday Sales Now:",

      "text": "Home » News » Us News » Online sales surge on Black Friday, with Amazon topping discounts Online sales surge on Black Friday, with Amazon topping discounts 46 minutes ago | 26-11-2016 | IANS Washington, Nov 26 : US online sales surged on Black Friday, with Amazon.com Inc offering the steepest discounts among e-commerce sites as it set the agenda for what has traditionally been the biggest shopping day of the year for brick-and-mortar retailers. [NK US] Though in-store customer traffic picked up in the afternoon, it paled in comparison to the jump in online sales, NBC news cited analysts as saying. Macy's Inc's website crashed as it saw heavy traffic on Friday. It had to delay customers from entering the site at three different times. Online sales on Friday hit $1.70 billion as of 3 p.m., according to Adobe Digital Index, after reaching $1.13 billion on Thursday, up almost 14 per cent from a year ago. The National Retail Federation expects total sales this holiday season to increase by 3.6 per cent to $655.8 billion, mainly due to the rise in online shopping. This weekend's shopping could reflect signs of faster economic growth in the fourth quarter this year. Administrative assistant Kelsey Gilford, 52, was shopping at Chicago's Water Tower mall on Friday but had already made purchases online on Thursday. \"I looked at some online deals on J.C. Penney which were good. I bought a small kitchen appliance yesterday (Thursday),\" she said. Amazon.com Inc offered a 42 per cent off, compared with 33 per cent off at Walmart, 35 per cent at Target and 36 per cent at Best Buy. Amazon said Black Friday would surpass last year in terms of the number of items ordered on its website. The Seattle-based company declined to provide specifics. Online shopping continued to grow, with Adobe saying that Black Friday was on track to set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time. It is also expected to become the first day in US retail history to drive over a billion dollars from mobile sales. Mobile accounted for 40 per cent of sales, with 29 per cent from smartphones, and 11 per cent for tablets. Combined with Thursday's $1.93 in online sales on Thanksgiving, the two days are expected to close out at nearly $5 billion in sales. Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director, Adobe Digital Insights, said: \"We expect Cyber Monday to surpass Black Friday and become the largest online sales day in history with $3.36 Billion.\" Meanwhile, UK shoppers also rushed to buy Black Friday bargains, as retailers and payment firms reported strong sales. Barclaycard said it had seen a record number of transactions on Friday, while Argos, John Lewis and Currys PC World reported a surge in orders, BBC reported. In the UK, analysts expect sales on Friday to have topped last year's 1.9 billion pound, with people hunting for discounts ahead of an expected rise in prices next year. \"The Black Friday promotions at the end of November are the start of a longer, more drawn-out peak season, which begins with most of the activity online and then moves in-store as we get closer and closer to Christmas day,\" said Richard Jenkings, data analyst at credit reference agency Experian. py/rn",

      "text": "These guys are more fun than your family. (Photo: USA TODAY/Netflix; Amazon; USA; Paramount; Castle Rock)\nThanksgiving is over. Black Friday is over. It's time to sit back, relax, grab some leftovers and binge-watch your little hearts out.\nIf you're not spending your entire weekend watching Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (or you already finished it ), we have some suggestions for shows and movies you can watch with family and friends. Or you can watch up in the guest room alone to get away from them all.\nIf you want something light and lovely: Lovesick The British romantic sitcom used to be called Scrotal Recall , but now it has a name you can actually say to your parents. Despite its first unfortunate name, the comedy is a delightful portrait of a man and his romantic relationships, after he discovers he has an STD and has to contact his former partners. It's not about sex so much as it is about the people with whom we choose to live our lives.\nStream Lovesick on Netflix .\nIf you want to stir the pot a little bit: Catastrophe Catastrophe is also a perfectly lovely British sitcom, but where Lovesick goes for the sentimental, Catastrophe goes for the gut punch. The show, which was created by and stars comedians Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, follows a mature pair that accidentally gets pregnant during a vacation fling and decides to give commitment a try. It's one of the most realistic portraits of a couple working hard to stay together, and it's downright hilarious.\nStream Catastrophe on Amazon .\nIf you want to gossip with your relatives: Suits What better dinner-table conversation is there for you and your family than Prince Harry's love life? The younger British prince has a new girlfriend, American actress Meghan Markle. Markle is best known for the USA show,, which follows a con artist posing as a lawyer at at top NYC firm. It's the type of blue skies USA show that works for a big group, and has the added bonus of helping you get to know Markle.\nStream Suits on Amazon .\nIf you need something to watch with your dad: Top Gun Finding something that everyone will agree to watch can be tough, but your family can probably all agree on hanging out with Maverick. Top Gun has the action, comedy and romance to please most members of your family, plus there's that sequel on the horizon . Since the movie is leaving Netflix on Dec. 1 , this may be your last weekend to watch.\nStream Top Gun on Netflix .\nIf you need something to watch with your mom: When Harry Met Sally Fighter pilots not appealing to everyone in the family? Go for a safer pick with When Harry Met Sally , the classic rom-com that will please everyone. Well, except when you all get kind of uncomfortable in the \"I'll have what she's having\" scene.\nStream When Harry Met Sally on Hulu .\nYou can scroll through more of our binge recommendations below (see last week's here ).\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Your binge-watching guide for any weekend Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.\nLooking for something to watch this weekend? Look no further. We at Entertain This! know that sometimes instead of watching Netflix, you just, you know, scroll through the options on Netflix endlessly. Which is why we are here for you, every week, with 5 shows, movies or TV episodes that you should add to your queue. You can scroll through all the recommendations we've ever made here. First up is 'Good Girls Revolt,' Amazon's new (and relevant) period piece. Jessica Miglio, Amazon Studios Fullscreen 'Gilmore Girls.'We recommend \"Love, Daisies and Troubadours\" from Season 1, \"The Bracebridge Dinner\" from Season 2 and \"Those Are Strings, Pinocchio\" from Season 3. Just thinking about Rory thanking her mom in her Chilton valedictorian speech is enough to bring a smile to your face. The WB Fullscreen 'Happy Endings.' Sometimes you just want to sit at a bar and be close to your friends. No matter how weird they are. Happy Endings may be a sitcom about 20-something friends and their love lives, but it's no Friends knock-off. The show is full of unique characters, enviable relationships and genuine hilarity. The silly costumes and pratfalls are just a bonus. Jordin Althaus, ABC Fullscreen 'Sing Street.' USA TODAY Film Critic Brian Truitt called Sing Streetthe best film of 2016 (so far), and it's easy to see why. The film, by Once director John Carney, finds optimism and hope in music, telling an 80s-set coming of age story. Come for the music, stay for the love. The Weinstein Company Fullscreen 'Akeelah and the Bee.' If you can get through this story of a young girl overcoming incredible odds to win the National Spelling Bee without ugly-crying all over the place, we don't know what to do with you. The movie that gave us Keke Palmer is one of the most upbeat, inspirational movies we can think of, with a joyful ending that is anything but cheesy. Saeed Adyani, Lionsgate Fullscreen 'The West Wing.' From Jed Bartlet's great debate in Season 4 to Matt Santos's rousing convention-floor speech in Season 6, The West Wing knows how to inspire you. By the end of a nice binge you may find yourself writing in some of the candidates from the show. Chris Haston, NBC Fullscreen 'Veep.' It's been a depressing election season. Why not lean in? Veep does not assume all politicians are idealists trying to make the world a better place. Veep assumes all politicians are conniving and ambitious and thoughtless and will do anything to get ahead. It might just hit the spot this year. LACEY TERRELL, HBO Fullscreen 'The American President.' Before he was President Bartlett, Martin Sheen spent time in another White House staff created by Aaron Sorkin. The West Wing creator wrote The American President first, about a first-term president running for re-election while dating a lobbyist. It's got the same kind of inspiration as the show, but in a tighter, more romantic package. Associated Press Fullscreen 'The Crown.' If you'd like to take a break from democracy, why not try the monarchy across the pond? Netflix has a dazzling new series following the early years of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the current and longest-ruling monarch. Politics is just a bit juicier when there's love and marriage and fancy dress involved. Robert Viglasky, Netflix Fullscreen 'Supergirl.' We get it. You're tired. You've been hearing nothing but cable news for months. You're depressed. You want happiness. And sunshine. And you don't want to hear the words \"margin of error\" ever again. Take a trip to sunny National City and fly around with Kara Zor-El in the most optimistic show on television. If you need counter-programming to the darkness of this election season, no show is better. Darren Michaels, AP Fullscreen 'American Horror Story.' The creator of Glee was never going to do horror in any sort of conventional way. The FX anthology series takes on different tropes from the genre and turns them on their heads while also managing to brutally terrify the audience. The show is not for someone averse to violence (this is not a jump-scare show, this is a graphic-scare show). Some seasons are better than others (let’s just pretend Hotel didn’t happen), but the benefit of the anthology structure is that you can pick and choose which ones to watch. Prashant Gupta, FX Fullscreen 'The Walking Dead.'Forget Carl and the detour to the farm in Season 2, and the show’s general tendency to swing back and forth in quality. Remember instead that heart-stopping pilot, the Governor’s assault on the prison and Terminus. Although it mostly relies on creative ways to kill zombies for its horror, Walking Dead has genuinely been able to surprise and scare us. Gene Page, AMC Fullscreen 'Fringe.' Sorry, Scully. If you’re looking for a weekly foray into the supernatural, you should probably check out the J.J. Abrams-produced Fringe instead of the actual new X-Files. Fringe started out as a modern take on the X-Files formula, and quickly evolved into a sci-fi serial with multiple universes, doppelgangers and a lot of Leonard Nimoy. It’s mysterious occurrences tended to be more horrific than weird, equally terrifying and intriguing. Michael Courtney, Michael Courtney Fullscreen 'The Witch.' The horror film, which USA TODAY Film Critic Brian Truitt called the “first great film of 2016,” is a creepy, genuinely shocking slice of horror. Plus, in a year when society's treatment of women is under the microscope, this puritanical movie is surprisingly relevant. A24 Fullscreen 'The Blair Witch Project.' If the Blair Witch sequel makes you want to watch the original, you’re in luck because it’s currently streaming. You’ve seen it a few times already, sure, but the found-footage flick can still pull off a few scares. Artisan Entertainment Fullscreen 'Pitch.' If you would like to, ahem, take a swing at a new network show this fall, you may want to try Pitch. The first episode is a little rough (especially if it's hard to watch people fail and/or be embarrassed), but the story of the first female major league baseball player has garnered critical praise and buzz. According to USA TODAY TV Critic Robert Bianco, \"with some fine performances and a good sense for the frenzy Ginny might cause, Pitch is, all told, an entertaining hour.\" Ray Mickshaw, AP Fullscreen 'Eastbound and Down.' Although Eastbound and Down doesn't technically take place in the hallowed halls of a professional baseball field, the sport is in the DNA of the Will Ferrell and Adam McKay-produced HBO series. Danny McBride stars as a burnt-out professional baseball player that's forced to return to his hometown and teach P.E. at his old middle school. Things go just as you might guess for the man who is not exactly the nicest you'll ever meet. Fred Norris Fullscreen 'Fever Pitch.' Fever Pitch is perhaps the height of the Drew Barrymore romantic comedy. Sure, she's swapped out Adam Sandler for Jimmy Fallon (remember when he was going to be a movie star instead of just telling stars how much he likes their movies?), but the tropes are all there. She's a bumbling romantic lead, there's a weird conceit keeping her and her man apart and, after rushing Fenway Park, everything works out in the end. OK, the Fenway thing only happens in Fever Pitch but you get it. Darren Michaels, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen 'A League of Their Own.' There's no crying in baseball, but re-watching the Geena Davis and Tom Hanks-starring film about the women's baseball league during WWII might just make you tear up. Maybe it's when the Peaches win the World Series or when we learn Betty's husband died in the war or when everyone reunites at the end. No matter what, you'll feel good after watching. Columbia Pictures Fullscreen 'Major League.' Sometimes baseball movies are all about heart and inspiration and sportsmanship. And sometimes, they're just about revenge. Take the Cleveland Indians in Major League, who are assembled to be the worst baseball team in history (this year not so much). Once they figure it out, they take revenge by being the best team of the season. In addition to being genuinely dirty and hilarious, the movie features a young Charlie Sheen as a player nick-named \"Wild Thing\". And yes, they play the song. AP Fullscreen 'Girls.' Lena Dunham's star-making HBO show just wrapped filming its final season, so you have just enough time to figure out what everyone's been yelling about the entire time it's been on the air. Girls ended up being as dramatic and think piece-driven as sister HBO show Game of Thrones, but it never lost its core focus on its four titular Girls. Being young and stupid in the city isn't the same as it was in Friends, and Dunham helped show us something new. Jessica Miglio, HBO Fullscreen 'Gossip Girl.' Our use of \"XOXO\" in texts, emails and real life can be traced back to Blair, Serena and the rest. The soapy CW drama may have started out as the adventures of privileged adolescents at an Upper East Side private high school, but a few dozen twists later it became so much more. KC Bailey, The CW Fullscreen 'New Girl.' Sometimes you just need something quirky, fun and funny after a long week. May we direct you to this delightful Fox comedy? There have been cast additions and subtractions, weddings and Megan Fox but, despite the upheaval, it's still going strong in its sixth season. Don't you think it's time to catch up? Greg Gayne, FOX Fullscreen 'Gone Girl.' Sorry, guys, it seems the most recent Girl is a bit of trainwreck. But you know how people were calling it the next Gone Girl? Well, you can actually just watch the original Gone Girl instead! There's a reason both the book and the film were such an event. The story of a missing suburban housewife seems pretty standard... until it isn't. And even if you've been spoiled on The Big Twist (and if you haven't, we commend you), there is still so much mileage to Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck's performances to keep you going. Merrick Morton, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.' No offense to the Rooney Mara adaptation, but the best version of Lisbeth Salander is portrayed by Ms. Noomi Rapace. The original Swedish version (in addition to adapting all three of Stieg Larsson's novels) is rawer and more brutal than the David Fincher-directed American version, but what keeps it grounded is Rapace's blockbuster performance. You need to be in the right mood for this violent, dark mystery, but it's a rewarding watch if you are. Knut Koivisto, Music Box Films Fullscreen 'Luke Cage.' The show, which USA TODAY's Brian Truitt called the very best Marvel-on-TV offering, is an intense and rewarding binge. Myles Aronowitz, Netflix Fullscreen You think you know Fleabag, the vulgar, drinking, smoking, sex-loving title character of the British import available on Amazon, but you don't.The show — which explores Fleabag's crumpled life (she's struggling professionally, personally, financially and romantically) after she suffers a loss — is as hilarious as it is heart-wrenching. Hal Shinnie, Amazon Fullscreen 'Smallville': You can thank the recent glut of superhero shows (yes, even Luke Cage) on the path that Tom Welling and the WB set for 10 seasons, chronicling Clark Kent (aka Superman) as a teenager in Smallville, Kansas. The WB Fullscreen You've seen Making a Murderer. And The Case Of: JonBenét Ramsey. And OJ: Made in America. Now what? Amanda Knox. The new Netflix documentary takes another crime that dominated the headlines and looks at it in a very different and new way. Netflix via AP Fullscreen You're not too old for this. There's a new version of Riggs and Murtaugh on TV (and hey, they aren't half bad according to our TV critic Robert Bianco), which means you should absolutely revisit the original 'Lethal Weapon.' Warner Bros. Fullscreen For a Brangelina-themed week we picked some of our favorite movies from the couple. One of them is 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' which may be a sci-fi flick, but it's really a snapshot of Hollywood in 2004, when it hit theaters (around the time Brad and Angelina first got together). The film stars Jolie along with Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow, a reminder about what mattered at the box office and in our hearts back then. NONE, XXX Paramount Pictures Fullscreen You've seen Tomb Raider. But this is a really good weekend to watch it again. The action flick is an hour and 40 minutes of Jolie beating the odds, knocking heads and taking names. She may have moved away from her action star persona, but she will always be one of the greats. ALEX BAILEY, PARAMOUNT PICTURES Fullscreen Pitt did strong work in last year's The Big Short, which he also produced. He's not the star, but the film has an incredibly strong cast, so you don't miss him when he's not there. Jaap Buitendijk, Paramount Fullscreen Do you want sadness? Babel will give you unrelenting sadness if you let it. The drama, which follows conflicts all over the world dealing with violence and language barriers, is a morose choice, but sometimes that's what you want. Murray Close, PARAMOUNT CLASSICS Fullscreen Besides its infamous role in bringing the couple together, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is actually a smart, funny action flick about two undercover spies who are married but work for opposite sides. It may be too fraught when you think about the context, but it's still a highly enjoyable film. Stephen Vaughn, AP Fullscreen Don't sleep on Netflix's 'Grace and Frankie.'The show, about two women in their 70s whose husbands leave them for each other, is a pure delight, doling out hearty laughs and heartfelt scenes in equal measure. Karen Ballard, Netflix Fullscreen Baz Luhrmann, the man who dazzled you with 'Moulin Rouge,' 'Romeo + Juliet' and 'The Great Gatsby,' has absconded to Netflix to tell a story about the rise of hip-hop in the Bronx in the 1970s in 'The Get Down.' Netflix Fullscreen 'Suits' is really a beach read come to life. Once you get over the USA Network show's admittedly absurd concept (an underachiever with a photographic memory poses as a lawyer at a high-power NYC firm and wins big cases ) you can enjoy the soapy drama. Christos Kalohoridis, Christos Kalohoridis/USA Network Fullscreen 'The Bank Job' is exactly what it sounds like: a 1970s-set British heist movie about a group of thieves trying to rob a bank. But what doesn't come across in its simple the title is the fact that it stars the one and only Jason Statham, that it includes a possibly true royal scandal and that it has intrigue, murder and a very steamy romance. 'The Bank Job' is genuinely fun, with a British sense of humor and none of that technological cheating when it comes to the actual robbing -- it's the 70s and they dig a tunnel. Jack English, Lionsgate Fullscreen 'I Capture the Castle,' based on the novel of the same name, follows the aptly named romantic lead Cassandra Mortmain who lives in a crumbling English castle with her family whose finances are crumbling, too.Everything is turned upside down when two rich American men come into the picture. The 2003 film has a talented cast, including Rose Byrne, as Cassandra's ambitious sister, and Bill Nighy who plays her father. The movie verges on cheesy, but it manages to balance its drama and romance. Samuel Goldwyn Films Fullscreen For our Olympic-themed edition we suggested 'Make It or Break It.'If you love gymnastics but want a little more drama, try this Freeform (well, ABC Family when it was on the air) show, which follows a group of gymnasts trying to make it to the Olympics. Isabella Vosmikova, ABC Family Fullscreen If you've never seen, 'Sports Night,' Aaron Sorkin's take on fast walking-and-talking, smart, heart of gold sportscasters, you're missing out. ABC Fullscreen Nothing, nothing will get you more into the Olympic spirit than 'Miracle,' the Disney film that follows the 1980 USA men's hockey team on their quest to win the gold (and beat the Soviet Union). It's got motivational speeches, patriotism, Kurt Russell and a whole lot of action. Watch it and try not to get hype. Disney Fullscreen ESPN's 30 for 30 series has given us some incredibly documentaries (including this summer's break-out hit 'O.J.: Made in America'), but one of the very best is 'The Price of Gold,' which tells the full story behind the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan drama that dominated the Olympics and headlines in 1994. Doug Mills, AP Fullscreen OK. You've seen 'Cool Runnings.' You love 'Cool Runnings.' But now is the time to re-watch 'Cool Runnings,' if only so you can appreciate the fact that the summer and winter games are no longer in the same year. Rob McEwan, Disney Fullscreen 'BoJack Horseman' aims its satire directly at Hollywood and all its quirks while also digging into depression, mental health and what makes us happy. The half-hour episodes will fly by and you won't be able to get the post-credits song out of your head after awhile, but its all worth it. Netflix Fullscreen Have you watched 'Stranger Things' yet? Why haven't you watched 'Stranger Things' yet? The Netflix show is the Internet's latest obsession, and for good reason. The show follows what happens in a small town in Indiana in 1983 after a young boy goes missing. Netflix Fullscreen 'Arrow' has had it's ups and downs (it is something of the testing ground for all things DC Comics on TV) but the show's second season is some of the best superhero action you can find on TV. Diyah Pera, The CW Fullscreen 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a raunchy comedy distinctly of the '40 Year-Old Virgin' era, but it's also incredibly sweet and has the best Dracula puppet musical in any movie ever. Glen Wilson, Universal Fullscreen Do you need an excuse to revisit the 'Harry Potter' movies? Jaap Buitendijk, Warner Bros. Pictures Fullscreen Our first pick for our Comic-Con week is 'The Flash.'If you are intimidated by the multitude of DC Comics TV shows on the CW these days, start here. Katie Yu, The CW Fullscreen 'Jessica Jones,' the second of the Netflix/Marvel super-shows is the best so far, but one for the adults in your life. Myles Aronowitz/Netflix Fullscreen We've been treated to a lot of big-screen Batmen over the past few years, but our favorite may always be the Dark Knight from 'Batman: The Animated Series.' Bonus: It has our favorite Joker, too, voiced by Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker took a bit of a turn to the Dark Side). Warner Bros. Fullscreen Listen, there are a few thousand Marvel movies these days (OK, 13). But in this reporter's humble opinion, the best — and the most pertinent — is the first 'Avengers' flick, which epitomizes the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel Fullscreen Star Trek crew from left: Chekov (Anton Yelchin), James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Scotty (Simon Pegg), Bones (Karl Urban), Sulu (John Cho), and Uhura (Zoë Saldana) in a scene from 2009's \"Star Trek.\" Industrial Light & Magic, Paramount Pictures Fullscreen For our \"restore your faith in humanity\" edition, we started with 'Call the Midwife.' Few shows are as consistently life-affirming as this BBC gem, which follows a group of young nurses working as midwives in the East End of London in the baby boom of the 1950s. PBS Fullscreen 'Psych' is ostensibly a crime procedural, which is not a particularly heartwarming genre of television. But unlike your 'SVUs,' 'CSIs' and 'Criminal Minds,' 'Psych' comes from a place of joy, with an outlook on life that is distinctly rosy. Alan Zenuk, USA Network Fullscreen When you're looking for some Grade-A comfort food, look no further than 'Cheers.' Because sometimes you truly just want to know where everybody knows your name. Or at least, watch your favorite actors hang out there. NBC Fullscreen You don't need to look any further to find the good in people as 'Batkid Begins,' the true story of an entire city (plus President Obama and some other fine folks) coming together to make one little boy's dream come true: Be Batman for a day. We'd say more, but we're tearing up a little thinking about it. Paul Sakuma, Make-A-Wish Foundation Fullscreen Will and Jaden Smith star in 'The Pursuit of Happyness,' based on the true story of Chris Gardner, an entrepreneur who worked his way up to a position as a stockbroker while homeless. It's one movie where the spoiler only makes it better: knowing that Chris eventually succeeds after all the times life knocks him down. Zade Rosenthal, Sony Pictures Fullscreen For our wedding edition, you should try 'The Office.' This pick may surprise you, but over nine seasons the show has its fair share of successful and not-so successful weddings. What comes to mind, of course, is Jim and Pam's romantic and wet wedding in Niagra falls, but don't forget Phyllis's or Dwight's. Byron Cohen, NBC Universal Fullscreen Sometimes, sometimes, you just need to sit down on your couch, order pizza, maybe get some wine, and watch this show for like 6 straight hours. It is never a bad call. TLC Fullscreen We've all seen 'Bridesmaids.' We all love it. But it never hurts to revisit. Suzanne Hanover, Universal Studios Fullscreen No, we're not talking about 'The Bachelor' reality show, but the sweet rom-com about a man who needs to get married in order to come into an inheritance. When things don't work out with his girlfriend or any of his exes, he places an ad. A little iffy on the gender politics? Sure. Goofy and fun? Absolutely. New Line Cinema Fullscreen If you're looking for a little darkness in your wedding comedy, look no further than 'Monsoon Wedding,' which follows a family re-united for a wedding in Delhi. And as a bonus, the film is directed by Mira Nair, who directed 'The Namesake' and is directing Lupita Nyong'o in Disney's upcoming 'The Queen of Katwe.' USA Films Fullscreen For our 4th of July edition our first pick is 'The West Wing.'The obvious choice, but probably the best. In a busy, long and dark election season, West Wing is a good antidote. NBC Fullscreen If you want to celebrate the 4th with something that takes place during the American Revolution, and you can’t get tickets to 'Hamilton,' 'Turn' is right for you. Antony Platt, AMC Fullscreen You know what your plans are for the 4th, so you might as well lean in! But in all seriousness, 'Drunk History' is smart and funny and just happens to be the perfect accompaniment to your barbecue and partying plans. Comedy Central Fullscreen There are a few things we know to be true in life. One of those things is that there is no crying in baseball. Another of those things is that we've yet to watch 'A League of Their Own' without tearing up just a little bit. Louis Goldman Fullscreen 'Independence Day: Resurgence' may be not-so-great, but the original is still a 4th of July classic. And you have to admit, Bill Pullman's speech is one of the most rousing and inspirational political speeches ever (and, if we're being very honest, including real life political speeches, too). 20th Century Fox Fullscreen For the summer edition of our guide, we start with 'The O.C.' Travel, if you will, to Southern California and spend some time with Summer, Seth, Ryan and Marissa. FOX Fullscreen An episode of 'Burn Notice' is very much like your favorite summery cocktail. It’s fun, it’s brightly colored and there are amazing sunglasses. The USA spy dramedy is good for picking up some spy tips, good for watching while you fold laundry and good for reminding you why you want to live in a beach town. Glenn Watson, USA Network Fullscreen You’ve heard about that (apparently actually pretty good?) new movie where Blake Lively plays a surfer trying to survive a shark attack? It has us remembering our favorite surfer movie of all time, the Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodriguez-starring 'Blue Crush.' Universal Fullscreen 'Now and Then' helped us get through middle school and we hope it helped you too. There have been few movies that are such pure celebrations of female friendship and so directly confronting the challenges of adolescence and puberty. It reminds you of the time when summer meant you spent every waking hour with your friends. And that’s what you need sometimes. New Line Cinema Fullscreen 'Troop Beverly Hills' follows Shelley Long as a fish-out-of-water trophy wife who ends up leader of her daughter’s scout troop and must brave the outdoors. It’s heartwarming, it’s fun and it actually really tense during one particular scene with a tree log (you know the one). Bill Heitzel Fullscreen First up in our dad edition of our guide is 'Fresh Off the Boat,' which features one of our favorite TV dads of all time: Louis Huang (Randall Park). Nicole Wilder, ABC Fullscreen If your dad has no idea who McSteamy is, he might enjoy Eric Dane as Commander Tom Chandler in 'The Last Ship,' TNT's post-apocalyptic drama. It’s a story you’ve heard before (virus outbreak threatens life as we know it) but told through a naval ship that is carrying the doctor who might save us all. Karen Ballard, TNT Fullscreen This may seem out of left field but listen, your dad loves 'Orphan Black.' Truly. He likes sci-fi and action and he thinks Tatiana Maslany should have an Emmy. We may be talking about one very specific dad here, but trust us, other dads will fall in line. George Kraychyk, BBC AMERICA Fullscreen More than just the “other movie starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez,” 'Jersey Girl' is a sweet movie about fathers and daughters. And because it’s directed by Kevin Smith, it contains some delightfully wacky tributes to Sweeney Todd. Miramax Fullscreen 'Bridge of Spies' is the dad-est movie to ever dad. This is a period piece, set in the Cold War, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. This is your dad’s favorite movie of all time. Jaap Buitendijk, DreamWorks Fullscreen For the musicals edition of our guide, we start with 'Glee,' the perfect choice for any Broadway obsessive (although we're mostly talking about season 1). Carin Baer, FOX Fullscreen Many, many TV shows have tried to execute a musical episode. Many have failed. The one that did it, and did it really, truly right, was 'Buffy,' with season 6, episode 7: \"Once More With Feeling.\" MITCHELL HAASETH, XXX UPN Fullscreen A scene from the Disney animated film 'Mulan' Disney Fullscreen 'Chicago' remains one of the best film adaptations of a Broadway show, managing to beautifully translate the songs and the spectacle to the screen without losing the essence of the show. Future 'Hamilton' musical, take notes. Miramax Fullscreen If you've never heard of 'Camp', your life is about to change. The movie follows a group of pre-teens and teens at a musical theater summer camp, figuring out who they are and singing their way through it. Bonus: It features a teeny, tiny Anna Kendrick as a back-stabbing manipulator. IFC Films Fullscreen 'Parenthood' is our No. 1 pick for our weepy edition of the binge guide. Just thinking about the drama is enough to make us cry. Colleen Hayes, NBC Fullscreen GREY'S ANATOMY - \"Grey's Anatomy\" concludes the season with a shocking two-hour telecast, THURSDAY, MAY 14 (9:00-11:00 p.m., ET) on the ABC Television Network. In the second part, \"Now or Never\" (10:00-11:00 p.m.), George delivers stunning news to Bailey, sending shockwaves throughout the hospital, and Izzie's friends anxiously await her recovery from surgery. Meanwhile Bailey is surprisingly displeased after being accepted into the pediatric fellowship program, and the victim of a near-fatal traffic accident brings the talents of Seattle Grace's doctors together. (ABC/SCOTT GARFIELD) ELLEN POMPEO, PATRICK DEMPSEY (Via MerlinFTP Drop) Scott Garfield, ABC Fullscreen 'Parks and Recreation,' while one of our favorite sitcoms of all time, has the uncanny ability to make us cry. Sometimes it's a happy cry (see: any engagement or wedding episode), and sometimes it's a little sad (see: any breakup), but we always feel so much better afterwards. Colleen Hayes, NBC Fullscreen This summer's 'Me Before You's clear predecessor is 'The Fault in Our Stars,' which follows two young teens battling cancer who fall in love. We'd say you'd laugh and you'd cry, but mostly you'll cry. James Bridges, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen If we're going to get very personal about this, Clint Eastwood's boxing drama 'Million Dollar Baby' is the movie that makes us cry the most out of any movie. Ever. It is worth revisiting any time. Even if you don't feel like crying. It's worth it. Merie W. Wallace, XXX Warner Bros. Pictures Fullscreen You are being watched. That’s how every episode of CBS’s underrated Person of Interest starts, and we only wish that a few more people had taken a gander at the show itself. Now you can do it on Netflix. Barbara Nitke, CBS Fullscreen Looking for a grittier crime drama? Maybe one with an English flair? Peaky Blinders is for you if you want to spend this sunny weekend in darkness (we know that’s true for some of you). The British period drama stars Cillian Murphy, and the third season drops on Netflix on May 31. Robert Viglasky/Netflix, Robert Viglasky/Netflix Fullscreen Disappointed by 'Alice 2'? Find Mia Wasikowska in a much better, trippy fantasy movie in the form of Crimson Peak. The horror/fantasy film was acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro’s passion project, and is a gift to the many legions of Tom Hiddleston fans. Kerry Hayes, Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures Fullscreen Travel back in time (and do your homework for latest mutant film 'X-Men: Apocalypse') with the star-studded 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' Alan Markfield, 20th Century Fox Fullscreen In a College Edition of our recommendations, we picked the seminal 'Felicity.' Can't go wrong with the choice to follow Keri Russell to New York. Andrew Eccles/Warner Bros., TLP Fullscreen 'Greek' is what you need for a nuanced college TV show. RON TOM, ABC FAMILY Fullscreen The study group may have changed, but Greendale Community College was the rock that kept 'Community' going through its rocky six seasons. It's always worth revisiting. Justin Lubin, Justin Lubin/NBC Fullscreen If you're looking for a college movie, look no further than 'Pitch Perfect,' which has three of our favorite things: A capella, smart comedy and Rebel Wilson. Peter Iovino, Universal Pictures Fullscreen Also worth revisiting is the underrated Justin Long comedy, 'Accepted,' which follows a group of teens who didn't get into any college at all, so they create their own. It's got a very, very young Jonah Hill to boot. Suzanne Hanover, XXX Universal Pictures Fullscreen In honor of shows that have been canceled in May 2016, we are offering you still-airing shows to watch instead. Going to miss 'Nashville'? Why not try The CW's 'Jane the Virgin' for your dose of family melodrama. Greg Gayne, CW Fullscreen If 'Castle' was your favorite you can scratch that itch with Sherlock.' PBS Fullscreen We need more TV musicals and since 'Galavant' is no more, maybe try The CW's 'Crazy-Ex Girlfriend.' Scott Everett White, The CW Fullscreen We'll miss seeing Rob Lowe in 'The Grinder' but we can't tell you how thankful we war for Julia Louis-Dreyfus in 'Veep.' Patrick Harbron, HBO Fullscreen We'll mourn 'Marvel's Agent Carter' forever, but at least there's another female superhero on TV, in the form of Kara Zor-El, aka 'Supergirl.' We'll happily follow that show from CBS to The CW. CBS Fullscreen In honor of Mother's Day 2016, we had some mom-friendly recommendations, starting with the ultimate mom-and-daughter show, 'Gilmore Girls.' The WB Fullscreen If your mom loves melodrama and tears, try Freeform's 'The Fosters,' which follows a very complicated family through very relatable struggles. Randy Holmes, ABC Family Fullscreen Only have time for one episode with your mom? Try \"Band Candy,\" from season 3 of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.' It's like 'Freaky Friday,' but with more snake demons. The WB Fullscreen Your mom loves 'Mamma Mia!' We shouldn't have to tel you this. Go watch it with her. Peter Mountain, Universal Studios Fullscreen If you are willing to shed a few tears with your mom, try 'Anywhere But Here,' a heart-tugging mom-and-daughter drama with Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. 20th Century Fox Fullscreen Like this topic?

      "text": "technically the StringToSign include a date, which, whilst not random, is a nonce. Maybe there's smarts behind the scenes to check timestamps/dates. – Colin Cassidy Jul 19 at 9:25 @ColinCassidy How is a date a nonce? It can be used multiple times in a time window. – laktak Jul 19 at 9:28 1 Their documentation states: \"the client timestamp included with an authenticated request must be within 15 minutes of the Amazon S3 system time when the request is received. If not, the request will fail with the RequestTimeTooSkewed error code. The intention of these restrictions is to limit the possibility that intercepted requests could be replayed by an adversary. For stronger protection against eavesdropping, use the HTTPS transport for authenticated requests.\" Maybe they feel that timestamps and HTTPS is sufficient to cover that threat – Colin Cassidy Jul 19 at 9:38 Indeed, HTTPS alone is supposed to be sufficient. – George Bailey Jul 19 at 12:57 The problem with requiring a nonce is you then have to store it to do replay checking agains the list of previously seen nonces. What they do require is the timestamp and then limit its usability to a specific window. This provides replay protection outside of that window and doesn't require storage. – John Downey Jul 19 at 14:10",

      "text": "(Photo: USA TODAY/Netflix; Amazon; USA; Paramount; Castle Rock) Thanksgiving is over. Black Friday is over. It's time to sit back, relax, grab some leftovers and binge-watch your little hearts out.\nIf you're not spending your entire weekend watching Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (or you already finished it ), we have some suggestions for shows and movies you can watch with family and friends. Or you can watch up in the guest room alone to get away from them all.\nIf you want something light and lovely: Lovesick The British romantic sitcom used to be called Scrotal Recall , but now it has a name you can actually say to your parents. Despite its first unfortunate name, the comedy is a delightful portrait of a man and his romantic relationships, after he discovers he has an STD and has to contact his former partners. It's not about sex so much as it is about the people with whom we choose to live our lives.\nStream Lovesick on Netflix .\nIf you want to stir the pot a little bit: Catastrophe Catastrophe is also a perfectly lovely British sitcom, but where Lovesick goes for the sentimental, Catastrophe goes for the gut punch. The show, which was created by and stars comedians Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, follows a mature pair that accidentally gets pregnant during a vacation fling and decides to give commitment a try. It's one of the most realistic portraits of a couple working hard to stay together, and it's downright hilarious.\nStream Catastrophe on Amazon .\nIf you want to gossip with your relatives: Suits What better dinner-table conversation is there for you and your family than Prince Harry's love life? The younger British prince has a new girlfriend, American actress Meghan Markle. Markle is best known for the USA show,, which follows a con artist posing as a lawyer at at top NYC firm. It's the type of blue skies USA show that works for a big group, and has the added bonus of helping you get to know Markle.\nStream Suits on Amazon .\nIf you need something to watch with your dad: Top Gun Finding something that everyone will agree to watch can be tough, but your family can probably all agree on hanging out with Maverick. Top Gun has the action, comedy and romance to please most members of your family, plus there's that sequel on the horizon . Since the movie is leaving Netflix on Dec. 1 , this may be your last weekend to watch.\nStream Top Gun on Netflix .\nIf you need something to watch with your mom: When Harry Met Sally Fighter pilots not appealing to everyone in the family? Go for a safer pick with When Harry Met Sally , the classic rom-com that will please everyone. Well, except when you all get kind of uncomfortable in the \"I'll have what she's having\" scene.\nStream When Harry Met Sally on Hulu .\nYou can scroll through more of our binge recommendations below (see last week's here ).",

It's horrible. RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery LoP Guest Wrote: (Today 04:54 PM) Anyone else notice how f'ed up deliver times and failed deliveries have increased since Amazon began using the Post Office to deliver stuff. It's horrible. Amazon is basically saving the post office from bankruptcy. I worked for the PO for 2 weeks and then quit, it was the most disorganized company I have ever worked for. Post: #3 RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery I agree. Probably cut a sweet deal. Splitting delivery chain. Using jets to get to the big cities and USPS to bungle the delivery afterwards. Amazon has never been on time since. LoP Guest Post: #4 RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery The worst is that SmartPost BS. Basically FedEx drops off the package at your local PO in a timely manner, then it takes another 3-5 days to get to you. Every single time a package was shipped SmartPost it was painfully slow receiving my package. LoP Guest RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery I get stuff within 3 days. No complaints here. LoP Guest RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery LoP Guest Wrote: (Today 05:04 PM) The worst is that SmartPost BS.

RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery I'm still waiting for something that was shipped 7 days ago LoP Guest RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery LoP Guest Wrote: (Today 05:09 PM) I'm still waiting for something that was shipped 7 days ago Amazon built its business on Prime shipping and Amazon's failure to keep its promises and live up to customer expectations together with its no competitive prices are going to be its undoing. LoP Guest RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery Some mod must have been miffed. RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery I dont have many issues, I use priority mail. Here's a secret, if you use priority and buy the flat rate small envelope option, you can just use that on any size priority box such as the small, medium and large boxes. Nobody checks. So basically you can pay $6.75 for large shipping that cost $18.00.

And to think , it's the only proper BANK left in America . See : The Legacy via WayBack . LoP Guest RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery are you sure you are buying from amazon and not a reseller? LoP Guest Post: #13 RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery Never have had an issue with the USPS unless it gets routed through Chicago. Everything else comes faster than UPS. FedEx sucks here, unless you have a business address. LoP Guest RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery I never get anything on time if it's coming from the usps. RE: Amazon's use of US Postal Service for Delivery 4 days for a box of Linen Yarn from Turkey to Mid Missouri Ozarks . 4 - 5 days for a package of whatever from New York City or Chicago Town . FedEx can't find either home with a sat map app or a phone call giving directions . UPS usually gets it either place in good order . USPS close second but hasn't sent a delivery to the other end of another county in over a year . That's improvement at least . See : The Legacy via WayBack .

Advertisement XPH01Z Hammer Drill: 0-400/0-1500 RPM, 480 in-lbs max torque XDT04Z Impact Driver: 0-2,300 RPM, 0-3,200 IPM, 1420 in-lbs max torque \nBuy Now \nDeal ends 3am ET 11/27/16, unless supplies sell out sooner. \nI find Milwaukee’s similar deal to be more appealing , but this deal gets you a capable hammer drill, a capable impact driver, and Makita’s higher capacity compact battery packs. \nIf you just want one of the 2 tools, both are available as $99 kits, bundled with a charger and single 3.0Ah battery pack.",

Credit: Amazon Prime (Amazon Prime) An Amazon ad depicts the friendship of a Christian pastor and a Muslim imam to send a holiday message. Also, at the corner of Rugged & Trendy, Filson’s opens a Ballard shop. Share story Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff \nAs ethnic and religious tension roils across the secular West, Amazon.com has come out with a holiday ad that highlights the sometimes-unifying spirit of commerce. \nFilmed in the U.K., it features a Christian pastor and a Muslim imam. Both are men of a certain age who, in addition to devotion to their respective faiths, share a lifelong friendship, and are depicted commiserating about the pain in their knees. \nEnter Amazon Prime. As soon as they take leave of each other, both men have the same idea. They whip out their smartphones and buy knee pads for each other, soon delivered by Amazon. These come in pretty handy in the act of worship, both at church and at the mosque. \nAddressing the topic of religion in a commercial endeavor can ruffle some feathers. So Amazon worked with the Interfaith Alliance, the National Council of Churches and the Islamic Circle of North America to ensure that the depiction was accurate and didn’t offend anyone. The pastor in the ad is an actual vicar in London, and the imam is the principal of a Muslim school in the same city. The commercial was shot in the St. Dunstan and All Saints Stepney Church and in the East London Mosque, both in England’s capital. Most Read Stories Cyber Sale! Save 90% on digital access. \nThe ad, which is airing in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Austria, seems to have struck a chord in the wake of the U.S. election, as news coverage has been dominated by talk of tougher immigration laws, a surge in acts of vandalism allegedly motivated by ethnic differences, and the discussion of registries for U.S. travelers from predominantly Muslim countries. \nMore than 1 million people have seen the ad on YouTube . Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos praised the ad via one of his infrequent posts on Twitter. “Love this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team,” he wrote. \n— Ángel González: Filson’s now in Ballard as well \nFilson opened its second Seattle store Wednesday, in Ballard — the first of what it hopes will be several smaller-concept neighborhood stores as the venerable outerwear retailer expands nationwide. \nThe 119-year-old Seattle-based company, known for its “lumbersexual” aesthetic and for making most of its products in the U.S., opened a larger, 6,500-square-foot flagship store in Sodo last year, replacing a less-visible location nearby. \nNow it has added a much smaller space — 1,250 square feet — in the old Swan Hansen building at 5101 Ballard Ave. N.W. \nIn addition to traditional Filson favorites such as its Mackinaw wool cruiser jacket and cotton duffel bags, the Ballard location will carry more localized wares such as Ballard-branded beanies, caps and mugs. \nIn a nod to Ballard’s maritime industry, the store will carry some nautical items, including canvas ice totes and marlinespikes, tools used to separate the strands of a rope. Music in the store will come from vinyl records chosen by sales associates. \n“We’re referring to this as ‘Filson unplugged’ — the acoustic version of our souped-up retail concept,” said President Gray Madden. \nThese smaller stores — about half the size of most traditional Filson stores — will allow the company to test products more readily and to get a feel for each neighborhood it opens in. \n“We see this concept as something we can roll out to other locations,” such as towns in Alaska and Montana where there are Filson customers but perhaps not enough to support a larger store, he said. \nSince Filson’s acquisition by private investment firm Bedrock Manufacturing in 2012, the company has been on an expansion kick. It’s about doubled the number of its stores this year to 10, including the Ballard location. In recent years, it’s opened stores in San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C., and London. The company plans to open 10 more by the end of 2018. \nIt also has two outlet stores — in Burlington, Skagit County, and Eagan, Minn. \n“It has a lot of room to grow,” Madden said of Filson’s expansion potential. \nFilson currently employs 552 people, 405 of them in Seattle, where the company has two factories. It also has a factory in Post Falls, Idaho. \n— Janet I. Tu:",

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who calls AWS a “pillar,” earlier this year upgraded Jassy’s title to division “CEO.” \nIn an interview with The Seattle Times, Jassy said that AWS could one day evolve to become an even bigger business for Amazon than e-commerce because it’s addressing markets potentially worth “trillions of dollars worldwide.” But a spinoff is unlikely because there’s “no compelling reason” to do so, the executive said. Andy Jassy \nTitle: CEO, Amazon Web Services \nAge: 48 \nEducation: Bachelor’s degree and an MBA from Harvard \nBack story: Part of Amazon.com’s senior executive team since 2002. Joined the company in 1997. Conceived the company’s entry into the music business, was director of marketing, served as technical assistant to CEO Jeff Bezos, and in 2006 launched AWS, the largest computing cloud business in the world. \nJassy’s comments come before re: Invent, AWS’ annual mammoth Las Vegas conference, which this year takes place from Tuesday to Friday. Most Read Stories \nMore than 32,000 are expected to attend, reflecting, in Jassy’s words, the growing “movement” of builders embracing the possibilities of the cloud. “It is palpable when you’re there,” he says. \nHere’s an edited excerpt of the conversation. \nQ: AWS has evolved into a $12 billion business in a decade. Why did it grow so quickly so fast? Was that growth a surprise? \nA: I don’t think any of us had the audacity to predict it would grow to be that big when we were starting it. \nBefore, companies and startups had to lay up all this capital for data centers and servers, and take your scarce resource, which in most companies is engineers, and have them work on the undifferentiated heavy lifting of infrastructure. \nWhat the cloud has done is completely flipped that model on its head so that you only pay for what you consume. You’re able to get work done so much faster than ever before. \nStartups and smaller companies got that revolution started, but we always expected large enterprises and government agencies to be very large AWS companies, because they have very large amounts of infrastructure to spend. \nQ: Where is AWS now? Where is it going next? \nA: We have a pretty significant market-leadership position, and we’re not close to being done delivering capabilities for our customers. \nWe have a very broad geographic footprint, but we’re not close to being done. Over time we can expect we’ll have an AWS “region” (a cluster of data centers) in practically every Tier 1 country and a lot of developing countries as well. \nWe have a machine-learning service that we launched about a year and a half ago, and there are a lot of artificial intelligence (AI) machine-learning capabilities coming. We have a large number of people working in AI. \nIf you look around homes and the workplace, there are all these sensors in many devices. This is what people commonly call the Internet of Things. These sensors have a small amount of (computing power) and memory. Which means the cloud becomes disproportionately important to supplement their capabilities. Most of the big IoT cases today are built on top of AWS. \nWe are at the start of what we think is possible. Over time, many enterprises are going to think about their own infrastructure as servers and also as devices they use to collect data, do analytics and take action back on these devices. So that’s another area of significant investment for us. \nQ: What are the biggest bottlenecks you’re seeing? \nA: There are only 24 hours in the day. There is so much that we’re doing simultaneously. We’re going to launch 1,000 significant services or features this year. \nWe are hiring so many people all over the world and we have a very high hiring bar. We’re not willing to compromise in order to make sure we have the right quality of folks. That always takes a fair quality of focus and work from the team. \nQ: How do you see the competition? Who keeps you up at night? \nA: Probably the single biggest surprise is just how long it took for other large technology companies to build an offering here. I don’t think any of us believed, in our wildest dreams, that we would have a six-year head start. \nIt’s not a surprise to us that every large technology company is trying to build an offering like AWS’ because it’s such a good value proposition for customers. But the offerings and the platforms are in very different spots today. \nAWS has a lot more capability and functionality than anybody else by a large margin, and is also iterating at a faster clip than anybody else. We have an impression we use internally: There’s no compression algorithm for experience. \nQ: Tell us about re: Invent. What should we expect for the conference? \nA: Re: Invent is different from the typical technology-industry conference in that it’s not a sales and marketing event, but about learning and education. We will have 400 different sessions on virtually every imaginable topic in the cloud. \nThe first year (2012), we weren’t sure we could get 4,000 people to go. We’ll have 32,000 people there. It’s a lot of fun, there’s a lot of community, we’ll probably have some announcements there as well. \nThere’s a kind of a movement around the cloud. It is palpable when you’re there. \nQ: What are your thoughts on “moving up the stack” (offering clients more sophisticated applications beyond storage and computing power)? \nA: You’ll increasingly see us build services a little bit further up the stack. The ones we choose to add are the ones our customers tell us they’d like us to build. \nThe vast majority of applications that are really having success in the market today are run by AWS partners. We have a very large ecosystem of partners that cover the gauntlet of applications that our customers love using. \nQ: Will AWS become the largest business within Amazon? \nA: If it came to pass, it would likely take time. But I do think it’s possible that in the fullness of time AWS could be the largest business in Amazon. \nPart of that is because, if you look at the market segments AWS addresses — infrastructure software, hardware, data center services, plus some capability to build further up stack as well — that’s trillions of dollars worldwide. \nIt’s a very large opportunity and we’re very optimistic about where AWS will be in the long term. \nQ: Could AWS operate as a company separate from Amazon? \nA: AWS has always functioned as an independent, separable business distinct from (Amazon’s retail unit): a different customer base, a different leadership team. Amazon, the retailer, is a really important customer of AWS’, but they’re really one of several, very important customers. \nOne of the reasons why Netflix, (which) competes so aggressively with Amazon the retailer, is all in on top of AWS is because Net­flix knows and has seen that they’re every bit as important to AWS as Amazon the retailer is. \nI’ll never say never about anything, I’ve learned that in my time here. But I don’t anticipate that we’ll spin AWS out largely because there’s no compelling reason to do so. Amazon has been so generous and so gracious in funding AWS for whatever investment needs required that there is really no compelling reason to do so. \nQ: Has AWS’ culture had to change much in order to better serve enterprise customers? \nA: Over the last five or six years we’ve had to build out a really strong enterprise and public-sector capability. \nBut what enterprises have come to appreciate is that the culture is really different. We’re unusually customer-focused. We’re pioneers. Most large technology companies have lost their will and their DNA to invent. They acquire most of their innovation. We like to hire builders that look at customer experiences as flawed and figure out how to reinvent those. \nAlso, we’re unusually long-term-oriented. You won’t see our folks show up at customers’ doors the day before the end of the quarter, or the day before the end of the year and try to harass them into a sale not to be seen again for a year. We’re trying to build relationships and business that outlast all of us in this room. \nQ: Has the new CEO title changed things for you? \nA: No. It’s all the same. \nQ: What about corporate succession at the top? \nA: We’re really incredibly fortunate to have a leader as strong as Jeff (Bezos). I’ve been at the company now for 19 ½ years and I will tell you that Jeff has at least as much energy and passion for the business as he did when I started in 1997. \nJeff will be running the business for a very, very long time. We’re lucky that he will. Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or . On Twitter @gonzalezseattle Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

As long as `kindlegen` is callable globally (e.g. you've put it in `/usr/bin` or somesuch), there's no difference in how you call booksnake:```shell```### Preventing Sends, or Keeping FilesIf you want to prevent booksnake from deleting the files after downloading and sending, you can pass the `--keep` flag:```shellbooksnake --keep --query \"Great Expectations\"```You can combine this with `--no-send` if you want to _only_ download and convert the file, and not send it:```shellbooksnake --keep --no-send --query \"Great Expectations\"```",
