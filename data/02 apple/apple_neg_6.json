      "text": "print \nAP \nApple CEO Tim Cook sent a memo on Wednesday night to all Apple employees about Republican Donald Trump's election victory for the presidency, Buzzfeed reported on Thursday morning . \nCook personally raised funds for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in August, and Apple withdrew financial support for the Republican National Convention, where Trump accepted his party's nomination. \nThe memo does not mention Trump by name, and although it contains some language about celebrating diversity, it doesn't include a direct response of some of Trump's stated policy positions, such as limiting immigration. \nApple did not respond to a request for comment about a public response to Trump's election. \nRead the memo below: Team, I’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. Let’s move forward — together! Best,",

      "text": "11:30am #3 Orestes, the minute that you presented the negative side of the discussion, you should have followed up or added the positive explanation to the summary. That way your summary covers all of the important information within the paper. While there were a number of valid positive reasons to get a refurbished Iphone included in the article, you could have taken the time to choose at least one that you believed to be the most valid reason to get a 2nd hand phone. All you would have had to do was signify that you thought this was the best reason to support the decision to own a previously owned phone. By the way, the proper term to use is \"digital marketplace\" and not \"online market\". When summarizing articles, make sure to use the term used in the original article in order to keep the original statement as intact as possible while summarizing.",

      "text": "Apple TV Universal Search Now Includes MUBI, Hopster, and CW Seed Thursday November 10, 2016 6:45 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Apple recently expanded the universal search feature on its fourth-generation Apple TV to include MUBI, Hopster, and CW Seed. MUBI's universal search functionality has been added in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, while Hopster has been added in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, only users in the U.S. can take advantage of having CW Seed in universal search. For those unfamiliar, MUBI is a $5.99 per month service that gives subscribers a new film every day, with up to a month to watch it, \"so there will always be 30 extraordinary films\" for users to watch each time they open the app. Hopster is also a straight-forward $4.99 per month streaming service, aimed at providing \"safe and ad-free\" entertainment for kids. The CW Seed app is an offshoot of the main CW network, and is home to shorter digital series, as well as older shows like Pushing Daisies and V , but it doesn't include currently-running CW series, which are housed in the main app for The CW. With these apps added, users will now receive content updates from each service within relevant universal search prompts. Universal search lets Apple TV users conduct Siri voice searches or text-based searches to find TV shows and movies across any app supporting the feature. When the Apple TV launched, not many apps were included in universal search, but Apple has slowly been expanding its reach ever since. The current list of all apps supported in universal search, broken down by countries, can be found here .",

      "text": "Denis Gorchakov \nWith the arrival of Apple Pay and Samsung Pay in Russia, many are wondering just how secure these payment systems are, and how popular they are likely to become. A number of experts have commented on this, basing their opinions on the common stereotypes of Android being insecure and the attacks which currently take place on wireless payments. In our opinion however, these technologies require a more detailed examination and a separate evaluation of the threats they face. The conventional approach \nTraditional threats associated with the use of bank cards in ATMs and physical stores have already been studied and described in sufficient detail: the magnetic strip can be read using skimmers; modern versions of skimmers are advanced and very inconspicuous; to read EMV chips, dedicated skimmers have been designed that are planted into payment terminals; wireless payment systems (PayPass, PayWave) are potentially vulnerable to contactless, remote card reading attacks. \nHowever, the growth in popularity of mobile devices has given rise to a new type of wireless mobile payment: a regular card payment can now be emulated using the smartphone’s built-in NFC antenna. The functionality is turned on at the request of the user, meaning there’s less risk than carrying around a card that’s constantly ready to make a payment. Bank clients, in turn, don’t have to take out their wallets when making a payment, and don’t even have to carry their bank cards around with them. \nThe technology for emulating cards on mobile devices (Host Card Emulation, HCE) may have been inexpensive and available to a broad range of device users starting from Android 4.4, but it had several drawbacks: the payment terminal had to support wireless payments; the eSE (embedded Secure Element) chip made the device more expensive, so initially it was incorporated into just a few top-of-the-range devices from major manufacturers; if the manufacturer decided to cut costs on secure data storage, important information ended up being stored by the operating system which could be attacked by malware with root privileges on the device. However, this didn’t go beyond a few proof-of-concept attacks, because there are plenty of other easier ways of attacking mobile banking systems; the developers attempted to mitigate the risks associated with storing important payment information on a mobile device, e.g. by using secure element in the cloud. This made smartphone-assisted payments unavailable in locations with unstable mobile services; the risks associated with using software-based HCE storage made it highly advisable to introduce extra security measures into banking applications, making their development more complicated. \nAs a result, for many large banks, as well as users, paying with the help of card emulation using a smartphone is little more than a quirky feature used for promos or simply to show off in public. New technologies \nThe problems described above have given rise to a number of studies, including some by large international companies, in search of more advanced technologies. The next step in the evolution of mobile payments was tokenized payment systems proposed by major market players – Apple, Samsung, and Google. Unlike card emulation on the device, these systems are based on exchanging tokens. A token is a unique transaction ID; the card details are never sent to the payment terminal. This addresses the problem of payment terminals being compromised by malware or skimmers. Unfortunately, this approach has the same problem: the technology has to be adopted and maintained by the manufacturer of the payment terminal. \nSeveral years ago, a startup project called LoopPay attempted to address this problem. The developers proposed a kit consisting of a regular card reader for a 3.5 mm (1⁄8 in) audio jack and a phone case. Their know-how was a patented technology for emulating a bank card magnetic strip using a signal generated by their dedicated device. It has to be said that the creators took an early interest in secure data storage (on a dedicated device rather than on the phone) and protection from using the details of other people’s bank cards (personal data checked by comparing information about the user against information from the bank card’s Track 1 information). Later on, Samsung became interested in LoopPay and acquired the startup . After some time, the Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology became available, complementing Samsung Pay tokenized payments. As a result, regular users can use their smartphones to make payments at payment terminals that support new wireless payment technologies and use MST at any type of terminal by just placing their device next to the magnetic strip reader. \nWe have been monitoring this project closely, and can now safely say that this technology is, on the whole, a big step forward in terms of convenience and security, because its developers have addressed lots of relevant risks: secure element is used to reliably store data; activation of payment mode on the phone requires the user to enter a PIN code or use a fingerprint; on Samsung devices, a KNOX security solution and basic antivirus are pre-installed – these two block payment features when malware lands on the device; KNOX Tamper Switch – an object of hate among forum-based “experts” – protects against more serious rootkit malware. KNOX Tamper Switch is a software and hardware appliance that irreversibly blocks the device’s business and payment features during any privilege escalation attacks; payment functionality is only available from new devices for which security updates are available, and on which all vulnerabilities are quickly patched; on some of the Samsung smartphones sold in Russia, Kaspersky Internet Security for Android is pre-installed. This provides extended protection from viruses and other mobile threats. \nIt should be noted that Samsung Pay, when making payments, uses a virtual card whose number is not available to the user, rather than the actual banking card tied to the user’s account. This method of payment works just fine when there is no Internet connection. New old threats \nThere’s no doubt that the new technology has become an object of interest for security researchers. Potential attacks do exist for it and were presented at the latest BlackHat USA conference. These attacks may still only be potential threats, but we should still stay alert. Banks are just planning to introduce biometric authentication on ATMs in 2017, but cybercriminals are already collecting intelligence on which hardware manufacturers are involved, what sort of vulnerabilities exist in the hardware, etc. In other words, the technology is not even available to the wider public yet, but cybercriminals are already searching for weaknesses. \nCybercriminals are also studying Apple and Samsung’s technologies. To makes things worse for Russian users, these technologies only arrive in the Russian market a year after they are launched in Western countries. Cybercriminals discussing the prospects of exploiting Apple Pay in Russia \nAt the same time, cybersecurity researchers tend to forget about conventional fraud, which mobile vendors are completely unprepared for as they enter a new sphere of business. Wireless payments have made card fraudsters’ lives much easier both in terms of online trade and shopping in regular stores. They no longer have to use a fake card with stolen card data recorded onto it, and thus run the risk of getting caught at the shop counter – now they can play it much safer by paying for merchandise with a stolen card attached to a top-of-the-range phone. \nAlternatively, a fraudster can simply buy merchandise and gift cards in an Apple Store. In spite of all the security measures taken by Apple, the Apple Pay fraud rate in the US was 6% in 2015, or 60 times greater than the 0.1% bank card fraud. \nSamsung Pay also sacrificed some of the useful anti-fraud features for usability after it purchased the startup; one being that accounts be rigidly attached to the cardholder’s name. For instance, I added my own bank card to my smartphone, and then added my colleague’s as well; in the original LoopPay solution, this was impossible. \nTo conclude, it’s now safe to say that the new tokenized solutions are indeed more secure and convenient compared to their predecessors. However, there’s still plenty of room for improvement when it comes to security, and that’s very important for the future prospects of the technology. After all, no one likes to lose money, be it banks or their clients. Related Posts",

      "text": "– A + Reports differ on Casetek's future contribution to Apple iPhone case supply By Mike Wuerthele \nThursday, November 10, 2016, 06:13 am PT (09:13 am ET) \nWith one supply chain monitor claiming that Apple case manufacturer Casetek is on the path to supply future iPhone enclosures, remarks made by the manufacturer's CEO are far less clear on the matter, suggesting only a possibility of a future contract.\n\n\n\n\nWhile supply chain reports from Digitimes claims that machining company Casetek has already seized iPhone case orders, remarks from Casetek CEO Gary Chuang paint a different picture.\n\n\"From iMacs, iPads to MacBooks ... the [iPhone] is the only product we have not supplied,\" Chuang said to the Taipei Times . \"We will focus on developing this business next year.\"\n\nWhen directly asked about an iPhone casing contract, Chuang said that the company has a \"good chance next year\" given Apple's \"positive feedback\" on the current product lineup.\n\nCasetek garnered the production contract for the MacBook in 2015. It is the main supplier of case parts for the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro.\n\nChuang expects that the company's revenue climb in 2017 will be attributable to growth in notebook sales, and not an iPhone contract, as Digitimes has claimed.\n\nThe company has recently approved the expenditure of $66 million of production equipment for milling, as well as previously announced plans to install 1000 more CNC machines to improve existing plants construction capacity.\n\nChuang claims that the new machines will be capable of supplying Apple's case needs, regardless if the material used is aluminum or glass.\n\nIf the reports of the company expanding into iPhone case manufacture prove to be accurate, the company will be the fourth supplier of iPhone enclosures, including Catcher Technology, Foxconn, and Jabil.",

      "text": "Apple Shares 2016 Holiday Gift Guide; Offers Free Two-Day Shipping on In-Stock Products   \nAhead of the 2016 holiday season, Apple has shared its annual holiday gift guide on its website. Unlike previous years though, Apple’s gift guide is not as exhaustive and does not break the gifts into different categories. \nThe gift guide is titled “The art of giving”, Apple says that “there’s an art to finding the perfect gift. And nothing can bring to life the passion and creativity of the people on your list like a gift from Apple. Topping Apple’s gift guide is — not surprisingly — the iPhone 7 accompanied by the tagline “the best iPhone ever.” To go along with the phone, Apple is recommending customers to buy its leather case or Smart battery case. Other products that Apple is recommending in its gift guide include the Apple Watch, iPad Pro along with its Smart Keyboard accessory and Apple Pencil, and the 12-inch MacBook. \nThe company is also promoting third-party products that it sells through its online store under three different categories: Music gifts, Photography gifts, and Games & Toys. Some of the third-party products that Apple is recommending in its gift guide include the DJI Mavic Pro Drone, OSMO Mobile Gimbal, ROLI Live Control Block, Anki Cozmo Robot, and more. \nApple is offering its customers free two-day shipping for in-stock items for almost all items, with free next-day delivery being available for the iPhone.",

      "text": "Last month, Apple delayed the launch of its all-new AirPods beyond the late October timeframe it originally promised, saying it needed \"a little more time\" before the wireless earphones are ready for customers. Since then, AirPods have remained listed as \"currently unavailable\" on Apple's website.\nShortly thereafter, a report citing supply chain sources indicated AirPods will not launch until January 2017, suggesting they will not be available in time for this year's holiday shopping season. But that timeline would seem awfully late, especially considering some Apple retail stores have already received AirPods demo units.\n\nLending credence to a launch sooner rather than later, an employee at Apple reseller Conrad has reportedly told a customer it will receive AirPods stock on November 17, and make them available to purchase by November 18-19. Here is the loosely translated quote from German blog Apfelpage.de:\n\nHello, I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today. According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19.\n\nConrad's website still says AirPods will be available for delivery in 7 to 8 weeks, so it is entirely possible the employee provided incorrect information, but there now remains at least some hope that customers will be able to purchase AirPods in time for the holidays. Nevertheless, treat the conversation as anecdotal evidence at best.Tag: AirPods\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

In a White House press release the administration committed to steps that will reduce the United States’ dependence on oil, increase access to clean energy, and fight climate change by supporting EV deployment and the necessary charging infrastructure. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "text": "First look: Apple's Powerbeats 3 Bluetooth headphones with W1 chip and 12-hour battery life   07:23 am PT (10:23 am ET) After being announced at Apple's iPhone 7 event in September, the company's lightweight Powerbeats3 on-ear headphones, featuring the proprietary W1 chip for superior wireless connectivity, are now beginning to trickle out into the hands of consumers. AppleInsider offers a first look. The $199.95 Powerbeats3 Wireless earbuds can now be found on some Apple store shelves, albeit in extremely limited quantity and selling out rather quickly, based on AppleInsider's checks. The Bluetooth headphones come in a total of five colors: white, yellow, blue, black, and red. The basic form and function of the new Powerbeats is similar to its predecessor, though the coloring has been tweaked to remove an inside strip that appeared on the earpiece of the Powerbeats2 model. Inside, however, the Powerbeats3 has seen big changes— most notably the addition of the W1 chip, which helps Apple improve the battery life of the new sports headphones to a rated uptime of 12 hours. Apple has also included a feature dubbed \"Fast Fuel,\" which gives 1 hour of playback time with just 5 minutes of charging plugged in. Charging is done through micro USB, not Lightning. The W1 chip also makes pairing the Powerbeats3 to an iPhone dead simple. For us, initial setup was as basic as pressing the power button for one second, and then a pairing prompt immediately appeared on our iPhone SE. Another advantage of the W1 chip and its pairing process is it will automatically connect— and switch to— other compatible Apple devices logged into the same iCloud account. That means you can seamlessly switch from using the Powerbeats3 with your iPhone to your Apple Watch for a phone-free workout on the go, without the need to un-pair and re-pair Bluetooth. Apple also says the Powerbeats3 feature an \"improved ergonomic design,\" which allows for improved sound with dual-driver acoustics. The headphones also ship with multiple eartips that users can swap out for their preferred fit and comfort. Integrated controls let users trigger Siri, take phone calls, and control music. Designed for athletes, the Powerbeats3 are also sweat and water resistant. And the around-the-ear clips ensure they won't fall off during a strenuous workout. Apple began taking orders for the Powerbeats3 Wireless earbuds a few weeks ago, just before the end of October . But inventory has only trickled out since, with retail availability limited, and authorized Apple resellers like B&H still only showing the headphones as available to preorder . The Powerbeats3 are just the second headphones on the market featuring Apple's proprietary W1 chip, following the release of the Beats Solo3 Wireless back in September. Informal testing found that the W1 chip allowed for use at distances of up to 400 feet , notably farther than the distance for which typical Class 1 Bluetooth devices are rated. Despite improved availability of the Powerbeats3, the most-awaited W1 headphones —Apple's completely wireless AirPods— have yet to ship to consumers, after missing their October launch . AppleInsider's own sources revealed earlier this month that the AirPods remain on track to ship this year . Rounding out Apple's lineup of W1 headphones are the Beats X neck-draped earbuds. Like AirPods, they have yet to ship, with Apple's website simply saying the Beats X are \"coming this fall.\" Topics:",

      "text": "Citi is the latest company to enter the mobile wallet wars, which is dominated by Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal , Samsung Pay, and others.\nOn Thursday, the finance titan c unveiled Citi Pay, a new mobile wallet for Android phone users. The concept is similar to Android Pay, Google’s googl mobile payments service, in that customers load Citibank credit card and debit card information onto an Android app.\nShoppers can then use that app to make in-store purchases at any merchant equipped with point-of-sale registers supporting near-field communication (NFC) technology, which enables frictionless payments between smartphones and registers. Users place their phones near the registers' sensors for payments instead of swiping a card.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nCustomers can also use Citibank online login and password information to make online purchases and in-app purchases. Citi is also partnering with Mastercard ma to allow Citi Pay customers to use the platform as a payment method with hundreds of thousands of online merchants across 33 countries at launch.\nCiti Pay won’t launch in the United States until early 2017, but it will roll out later this year to customers in Singapore, Australia, and Mexico.\nCiti isn’t the first financial institution to take aim at the mobile wallet. Chase Bank ccf debuted its own mobile wallet in 2015. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo wfc launched a similar mobile wallet.\nBanks, like Apple aapl and Google, are hoping to connect with their customers where they are spending the most time: on their smartphones. Citibank even has a financial technology innovations group, called Citi FinTech, which is comprised of 40 employees from various parts of Citi and poached from tech companies such as Amazon and PayPal.",

      "text": "Target Black Friday Deals on iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, Apple TV and More Posted by Rajesh Pandey   \nAlong with Best Buy , Target has also posted its Black Friday ad detailing all the deals that it will be offering on Apple products this year. The retailer is offering similar deals as to what Best Buy is offering, though it is not offering any deals on MacBooks or iMac. \nOn the positive side, unlike Best Buy, Target is offering a pretty great deal on the iPad Pro. The retailer will be offering the 9.7-inch iPad Pro at $449 , down from its usual price of $599. It is also discounting the iPad Air 2 by $125 to $274. And if you want the smaller iPad mini, you can get the iPad mini 2 for only $199. \nIt is also dropping prices on the Series 1 Apple Watch by $71.99 thereby offering them from $198. Similar to Best Buy, Target is also offering a $250 gift card on the purchase of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. \nUntil Thanksgiving arrives when the above sales start, Target is offering an Early Access deal to its online and in-store customers. The deals include offering 25% discount on the 32/64GB Apple TV 4 and the third-generation Apple TV. It is also offering the Beats Solo2 wireless headphones for $180 , down from their regular price of $299.99. \nDisappointed by deals offered by Target? Or are you looking to grab one of the Apple products in the deals that the retailer will be offering for Black Friday? Like this post? Share it! Get top stories delivered daily Featured Stories",

Do you live in a state that bans ballot photography? \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

      "title": "iPhone 7 Plus Ship Times Hold at 3-4 Weeks or Higher",
      "text": "| Product News \nWait times for Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus remain at 3-4 weeks or 3-5 weeks, with none showing less than 3 weeks as of this writing. Almost 7 weeks after the initial ship date, that’s an unusual delay for Apple, and the question is why. Representative Sample of iPhone 7 Plus Shipping Times \nI mean, clearly it’s because demand is outpacing supply, but is that because demand is unusually high or because Apple is experiencing an unexpected bottleneck in its supply chain. It could be both, as discussed by me and John Kheit on Wednesday’s Apple Context Machine. \nDefinitions \nBy definition, a delay in availability means demand for a product is higher than a company’s ability to produce it. Once upon a time, this was a chronic issue for Apple, with long waits the norm for new iPhone launches. \nApple CEO Tim Cook and his operations team have largely licked this, however, and a month long delay two months into an iPhone launch is unusual. Known Unknowns \nIn that delays are consistent in every configuration for iPhone 7 Plus, but are not so for iPhone 7*, it’s likely some component specific to iPhone 7 Plus is to blame. My money would be on the camera/lens apparatus for the device, but that’s just a guess. \nBut, that doesn’t necessarily mean that Apple has fallen short of its goals for iPhone 7 Plus production. It’s entirely possible delays are due to unexpected demand that pushed the above-mentioned weak point in the supply chain. \nTo that end, we might have Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note 7 problem to blame. Or, people could be that enamored with the dual lenses and depth-of-field options on iPhone 7 Plus. Or maybe it’s a combination of the two. Seems Good \nThe significance is the difference between Apple not being able to meet expected demand and Apple needing time to scale production for increased demand. With that in mind, shipping delays for iPhone 7 Plus are probably a good thing for Apple’s overall iPhone shipments. Time will tell. \n*Jet Black iPhone 7 models are showing 2-week availability, but most other configurations are available now or for 2-days. Share this:",

      "title": "There probably won't be a new 4-inch iPhone SE in 2017",
      "text": "Sorry guys, but small iPhones just aren't as hot as big iPhones.\nApple is reportedly declining to update the iPhone SE next year, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nApple broke with its tradition this year when it launched the 4-inch iPhone SE in the spring. The iPhone SE is essentially an iPhone 5/5S design with the iPhone 6S's faster A9 processor and M9 motion coprocessor. It also has improved cameras.\nSEE ALSO: Gmail's iPhone app finally rolls out the unsend button you so desperately need\nBut despite its lower price point (starting at $399) and target at emerging markets such as India, slowing iPhone sales may contribute to there being no need to refresh the iPhone SE.\nNot that the iPhone SE needs to be updated annually, anyway. Apple knows its bread and butter are its larger 4.7- and 5.5-inch flagship iPhones. Those are the iPhones people really want and wait for.\nThe iPhone SE is kind of the oddball in the iPhone family. Aside from being cheap, it also exists solely to please people who want a small phone; they're a smaller slice of the market, but one that still exists.\nImage: screenshot: apple\n\"So why are people buying 4-inch iPhones?\" asked Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing, during the iPhone SE's announcement event in March. \"There's two reasons. First, for some people they simply love smaller phones; they want the most compact iPhone design. Second, we found that for a lot of these customers, it's there first iPhone.\"\n\"Our 4-inch iPhones are actually an important part of our lineup. This last year we sold over 30 million 4-inch iPhones. That's a lot of phones.\"\nApple's never been shy to continue selling old products to please a niche. For years, Apple continued to sell the old 13-inch MacBook Pro with built-in CD/DVD drive even though its flagship MacBooks dumped them years ago.\nAnd Apple still sells the old 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina displays with all of their ports even though the new MacBook Pros which only have USB-C ports have launched.\nSo yeah, big deal if there's no new iPhone SE next year. SE users are in the minority and it's clear the focus is on big screens and Jet Black .",

      "title": "Apple Enhances iOS Backup Encryption in iOS 10.2; Reincubate First to Support it",
      "text": "Apple Enhances iOS Backup Encryption in iOS 10.2; Reincubate First to Support it News   11:00   LONDON , November 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Reincubate ' s flagship product, the iPhone Backup Extractor, is the first in market backup recovery software that supports the latest security updates made in the upcoming iOS 10.2 release. After the security flaw introduced in iOS 10 was fixed earlier in October , Apple has updated and changed encryption algorithms in iOS 10.2, making brute force attacks impractical. The change is associated with a different key derivation process used for iTunes backup encryption than the one used previously. Finding the new derivation process was the missing piece to increase security to iTunes backups. In the most recent version of iPhone Backup Extractor, Reincubate has released a critical update which makes the software fully compatible with iOS 10.2 encryption changes. The encryption update included in iOS 10.2 removes the possibility for brute force attacks to be a viable option for hackers, because it takes significantly more time for each attempt to guess the backup password. Reincubate's expert iOS team estimated that with current CPUs it takes roughly 7 seconds for a password to be verified and validated before opening a backup. About the iPhone Backup Extractor The iPhone Backup Extractor was the first product to support recovering data from iOS 10 iCloud backups on Windows and macOS platforms. The software is used by consumers, forensic examiners, and businesses for various use cases, from recovery of lost data to evidence discovery. About Reincubate's iCloud API The Reincubate iCloud API makes the iCloud accessible to investigators, developers and integrators. The API includes functionality for extraction, manipulation and recovery of many types of iOS and app data. It fully supports iOS 9.3 and iOS 10 iCloud backups, and backups created with A9X and A10 chipsets. It can provide real-time iCloud data for a number of data-types, and supports access to content which has been previously erased from the iCloud. What Users Say About Reincubate's iCloud API \"Reincubate have been super responsive to our needs, and as the market's \"table stakes\" features have expanded, Reincubate has responded by constantly improving and expanding their technology solutions to help us meet those increased customer demands. We are super pleased with our decision to partner with Reincubate!\" -- Steve Woda , CEO, uKnowKids About Reincubate Reincubate is the app data company.

      "text": "In the wake of Donald Trump's election, Apple CEO Tim Cook this week sent an email to employees calling for a united front moving forward.\n\"Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,\" Cook wrote.\n\"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed,\" he continued. \"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world—regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship, or who they love.\"\nApple and the President-elect have had a rocky relationship. Trump once called for his followers to boycott Apple (while tweeting from an iPhone), while Cook & Co. refused to back the Republican party during its July convention in Ohio.\nMicrosoft chief Satya Nadella also weighed in on LinkedIn , congratulating Trump while reiterating that Redmond's \"commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\" He then pointed readers to a blog post from Microsoft's chief legal officer, which lays out the company's policy priorities going forward.\nNeither CEO mentioned Trump by name in their notes, nor did Mark Zuckerberg, who penned a public Facebook post about Election Day.\n\"Last night was Max's first election,\" Zuckerberg wrote next to an image of himself holding his 11-month-old daughter while watching the returns roll in. Now, \"the work ahead of us to create a world we want for our children.\"\n\n\"The most important opportunities of Max's generation—like curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone, and promoting equal opportunity—will take long-term focus and finding new ways for all of us to work together, sometimes over decades,\" Zuckerberg continued.\n\"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line,\" he wrote, reminding readers that \"we have the responsibility\" to make the world better, and encouraging them to \"go work even harder.\"\nSome might say the same of Facebook, which has been criticized for its spread of misinformation during the year-long presidential campaign. Following allegations that it regularly suppresses politically conservative news stories, the company in August transitioned from a human-curated trending news section to an algorithm-based system.\nThree days later, fake stories began appearing, claiming that Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly was on the chopping block for supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, or that planted bombs—not terrorists— were responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001 collapse of the World Trade Center.\nFacebook acknowledged the social network's blunders and outlined a plan to display more \"meaningful\" content, all the while reminding the world that it is \"not a media company.\"",

      "text": "Apple's Extended Holiday Return Policy Now in Effect Thursday November 10, 2016 8:15 AM PST by Joe Rossignol Apple's annual extended holiday return policy began today in the United States and several other countries. Most products and accessories purchased between November 10 and December 25 of this year are eligible for return until January 8, 2017 in the United States, Australia, Canada, and select other regions, or until January 20, 2017 in many European countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Apple products that can be returned include, among other things, the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV . The few items that cannot be returned include Apple or iTunes gift cards and opened software. Apple products can be opened and used prior to the return date, but must be returned undamaged with the original packaging. When making a purchase at an Apple retail store, we recommend that you ask for printed and emailed copies of your receipt. Both printed and emailed receipts will indicate the return date for each product purchased, while Apple also lists the cutoff date under the \"Your Account\" section on its website. All purchases made before today or after December 25 are subject to Apple's standard 14-day return policy in most countries.",

If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward,’” Cook wrote. “This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.” \nThe letter also acknowledges that there are “uncertainties ahead.”",

      "text": "– A + Apple publishes 2016 Holiday Gifts guide promoting iPhone 7, other core products By Roger Fingas \nThursday, November 10, 2016, 08:26 am PT (11:26 am ET) \nApple on Thursday published its annual holiday gift guide, this year putting an even stronger marketing spotlight on its core products. \n\n\n\n\nInstead of offering up last year's categories, the 2016 guide highlights specific devices: the iPhone 7, Apple Watch, iPad Pro, 12-inch MacBook, and Apple TV. Each product except for the Apple TV is accompanied by a pair of suggested accessories, and a link to see more.\n\nAll other possible gift ideas are relegated to three categories at the bottom —Music, Photography, and Games & Toys —plus the suggestion of gift cards as an alternative.\n\nIn the U.S., Apple is offering free two-day shipping through the holidays, as long as items are in-stock and ordered before 5 p.m. —iPhones can be delivered in just one day. People can't, however, get accelerated shipping on any engraved products or custom-built Mac configurations.\n\nShipping deals can vary considerably in other countries. In Canada for example the company is only offering free standard shipping, but Australia is promising next-day delivery in most major cities if an item costs over $250 and is ordered before 2 p.m. Otherwise, only free standard shipping is available.",

      "text": "Courtesy of Amazon November 10, 2016 | 08:38AM PT \nShares of Amazon , Apple , Facebook , Netflix and Google fell in morning trading Thursday, as tech investors evidently have grown more concerned that President-elect Donald Trump will adopt unfavorable policies toward Silicon Valley. \nIn mid-morning trading, shares of Netflix, Facebook and Amazon fell more than 4%. Apple’s stock was down 2.9%, while Google declined 3.4%. That’s below broader market indices, with the S&P 500 down 0.2% and the Nasdaq off 1.16%. \nAs a candidate, Trump had called for a boycott of Apple products over its refusal to cooperate with federal agents investigating the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, and has urged the company to bring its manufacturing operations to the U.S. \nTrump also has charged that Amazon is a monopoly that has avoided paying billions in taxes — and has accused CEO Jeff Bezos of buying the Washington Post, which has been a frequently critic of Trump, as a tax dodge. Meanwhile, the mogul/reality TV star turned U.S. president has indicated that he opposes the FCC’s network neutrality regulations — leading to speculation he will try to repeal the rules, which would be a setback for companies like Google, Netflix, Facebook and Amazon. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos posted a congratulatory tweet to Trump on Thursday, apparently seeking to build a bridge to the new administration after Trump’s harsh criticism of his company: Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 Filed Under:",

      "text": "Apple’s Extended Holiday Return Policy Goes Live in U.S. and Other Countries Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 10, 2016 | No Comments \nEarlier today, Apple shared its 2016 holiday gift guide, which included things like free two-day shipping. \nNow, if someone decides to buy something beginning today, Apple’s launched its annual extended holiday return window, which makes it easier for those gifts to be handed back to the Cupertino-based company if the receiver isn’t on board with the idea. That includes the majority of products purchased from both Apple’s online store and physical retail sites. \nThe extended return policy goes into effect today, November 10, and covers purchases made up until December 25, 2016. Those products, as long as they’re purchased within the time frame, can be returned as late as January 8, 2017 in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In some European countries (United Kingdom, France, Germany, others), though, the same purchase period can have returns or exchanges made as far out as January 20, 2017. \nThat includes iPhones, iPads, accessories, and other products on sale at Apple stores. \nWhat Apple gifts are you planning on buying this year?

Ireland will bring the fight over Apple taxes all the way to the EU Court \nIt looks like the fight between Ireland, Apple, and the EU is only set to escalate -- Ireland is prepared to bring that fight to EU courts.

More >> \nIt looks like the fight between Ireland, Apple, and the EU is only set to escalate -- Ireland is prepared to bring that fight to EU courts. An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes. \nBy Cristian de Looper \nProvided by \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country. \n\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Slice Intelligence \nApple's MacBook Pro , the company's newest model for power users, is generating vastly more revenue than the company's ultralight laptop that debuted a year and a half ago, an e-commerce tracking firm says. \nThe MacBook Pro revenue in its first five days has reached 78 percent of last year's MacBook , Slice Intelligence said Tuesday . In addition, the new Mac has generated nearly four times that of Microsoft's Surface Book challenger since its debut a year ago. \nThat may sound like great news for Apple , but there likely was pent-up demand for the new MacBook Pro since it's gone years without a major redesign. \nAnd shoppers showed a willingness to switch to Windows-powered machines during the long wait, Slice found. Among those who bought an Apple laptop in 2014, 40 percent bought another brand since, Slice said. The firm bases its statistics on the behavior of a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers. It tracks online sales only. \nThe new MacBook Pro is smaller and lighter, with a starting price of $1,499. Higher-end models feature a touch-screen strip called the Touch Bar instead of function keys at the top of the keyboard. Critics don't like its lack of old-style but still widely used rectangular USB ports. \nApple declined to comment. ",

      "text": "print \nOccipital \nA startup that makes a special sensor that integrates with Apple iPads wants to make home improvement easier for people who are more comfortable with a mouse and keyboard than with a tape measure. \nCanvas, a free new app from Occipital, lets iPad users capture a scale model of any room. Once users have scanned a room, they can go back and pull any measurement from it — like how wide a window is, or exactly how tall the ceilings are. \nIt's pretty easy. I saw Occipital CEO Jeff Powers accurately scan a lounge at Business Insider headquarters in 30 seconds. \nOccipital \nCanvas requires Occipital's Structure Sensor, though, and a wide-angle lens attachment. The Structure Sensor plugs into your iPad's Lightning port, and attaches to it with a customized bracket. Inside its aluminum hull is a 3D sensor which can accurately determine the distance of objects. \nCombined with some pretty complicated math, it means an app can accurately tell that your ceiling is, say, 14 feet high nearly instantaneously. It can produce detailed models that actually look like your rooms. \nAlthough the Canvas app is free, the Structure Sensor costs $379, and the required wide-angle lens costs $20. And if you want to export the Canvas model into an CAD file, for further manipulation, it costs $29 per model. \nPowers says the main target market for Canvas is professional interior designers and contractors, but he suspects some do-it-yourselfers will find it useful, too. \nHere's a screenshot of the scanning process on an iPad: \nOccipital \nTake a closer look at how Canvas works:",

According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19. \nInterestingly, Conrad has valued the AirPods at €210 (approximately $230) which is much higher than the $159 price tag Apple initially announced .",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nThe American tech giant has turned its Apple Watch Series 2 into a serious fitness tracker after learning that the Apple Watch, which it released in April last year, was primarily being used by consumers for self-betterment of their health and physical conditions. \nWhile the Apple Watch Series 2 remains a smartwatch in general, Apple has utilized modern technology to turn it into a fitness device to serve as the consumers’ alternative for Fitbits, Jawbones, Garmins, Polars, and smart scales, notes The Verge. \nApple learned that people are willing to shell out money to pay for technology that promises an ironic escape from technology, even if it is only for 30-minute sweaty increments of time. \nWith the addition of GPS and better swim-proof capability, Apple Watch Series 2 has certainly become more of a fitness tracker. The new, distilled software means it also does not have ambitions of acting like a smartphone replacement but more like a useful accessory for health purposes. \nFour variants of the Apple Watch Series 2 \nJust like its predecessor, the Apple Watch Series 2 initially comes in three models. The least expensive aluminum model starts at $369; the stainless steel model that starts at $549; and a ceramic model that starts at $1,249. \nIt should be noted that all of these models have the same internals, just different exterior materials. \nThere is also a Nike-branded version of the sports watch that shipped late last month. It is geared specifically toward runners. \nThe aesthetics are a bit different than other models of the Apple Watch Series 2. Most noticeable is a specially perforated band that Apple described as light, breathable, and lightweight. And on the software side, the interface is distraction free, a shortcut takes the user straight to run tracking, and basic metrics like calorie count and steps are a tap away. \nApple has even gone ahead and upgraded the original Apple Watch with a faster processor and a lower starting price point of $269. With the addition of the WatchOS 3 software, the first-gen watch will also get many of the features of the newer one. \nApple Watch Series 2 looks almost exactly like the Apple Watch. It is basically similar to the iPhone 7 because it looks exactly like the iPhone 6S or even the earlier iPhone 6. \nBut there are obvious differences too. The OLED display on the Apple Watch Series 2 is brighter. In fact, Apple claims that it’s the brightest display it has ever made. \nThe new level of water resistance of the smartwatch will please a lot of people because it is something that impacts not just swimmers but anyone who has jumped in a pool with the watch on, or simply in the showers. \nThe addition of GPS is a much bigger deal. It was easy to knock the first Apple Watch as a fitness device. \nNow a user can go outside, without his iPhone, and run and cycle and hike to his heart’s content and the Apple Watch Series 2 will receive a GPS signal. It will calculate his distances and show a map of his workout in the Activity app on his iPhone. \nStill a lot of work to do \nAmid all the improvements on the Apple Watch Series 2, some of the hassles from the Apple Watch still remain, which means that there is still a lot of work to do for Apple to do an even better Apple Watch 3 in the future. \nAlthough it has a bigger battery than the first Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Series 2 is still a charge-every-day kind of thing especially for those who are using it as a fitness tracker, notes Digital Trends. \nIt would have been good if the smartwatch can go longer than 24 hours and not be like an iPhone that needs charging on a daily basis.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan How Apple plans to make more money from its cheap iPhone Sitting out on the iPhone 7 while you wait for Apple to update the cheap but cheerful iPhone SE? You might be in for a long wait. | Topic: Hardware \nFrom a price versus performance standpoint, the 2016 iPhone SE might have been Apple's best handset ever. But if you're patiently awaiting a 2017 update, you might be in for a long wait. Microsoft fixes Windows security flaw under attack by hackers \nAccording to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (widely regarded as the best Apple analyst in the business, and who has an accuracy track record that's well above average) Apple won't be updating the iPhone SE this year because it wants to keep average selling prices buoyed up by the higher-end -- and higher-priced -- handsets. \nAfter all, cannibalization is a problem that Apple needs to keep in check. When Apple released the iPhone SE, there was a hit on the iPhone average selling price. \nLast quarter saw the average selling price increase slightly from $595 last quarter to $618, a sign that more buyers were willing to shell out for a higher-spec iPhone than the previous quarter. But the iPhone SE was still undeniably dragging down the average selling price compared to Q2 2016, where the average selling price was $641. \nAnother factor to bear in mind is that the longer the iPhone SE remains in circulation, the cheaper the components become, which in turn means that Apple pulls in more profit per iPhone SE sold. Sure, not all components will fall in price, but Apple wields tremendous power over its supply chain. \nAn upgrade would reset the clock on the component supply chain. \nBut I think it's also important to remember that for some, price is all that matters, and that it won't matter that there won't be a 2017 model to replace the 2016 one. Sure, that might encourage some to switch to Android, but at the end of the day Apple is seeing more people switch from Android than to Android, so the bar for pleasing users, especially at the budget-end of the spectrum, isn't that high.",

      "title": "Apple Enhances iOS Backup Encryption in iOS 10.2; Reincubate First to Support it",
      "text": "Blog This \nLONDON , November 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- \nReincubate ' s flagship product, the iPhone Backup Extractor, is the first in market backup recovery software that supports the latest security updates made in the upcoming iOS 10.2 release. \nAfter the security flaw introduced in iOS 10 was fixed earlier in October , Apple has updated and changed encryption algorithms in iOS 10.2, making brute force attacks impractical. \nThe change is associated with a different key derivation process used for iTunes backup encryption than the one used previously. Finding the new derivation process was the missing piece to increase security to iTunes backups. In the most recent version of iPhone Backup Extractor, Reincubate has released a critical update which makes the software fully compatible with iOS 10.2 encryption changes. \nThe encryption update included in iOS 10.2 removes the possibility for brute force attacks to be a viable option for hackers, because it takes significantly more time for each attempt to guess the backup password. \nReincubate's expert iOS team estimated that with current CPUs it takes roughly 7 seconds for a password to be verified and validated before opening a backup. \nAbout the iPhone Backup Extractor \nThe iPhone Backup Extractor was the first product to support recovering data from iOS 10 iCloud backups on Windows and macOS platforms. The software is used by consumers, forensic examiners, and businesses for various use cases, from recovery of lost data to evidence discovery. \nAbout Reincubate's iCloud API \nThe Reincubate iCloud API makes the iCloud accessible to investigators, developers and integrators. The API includes functionality for extraction, manipulation and recovery of many types of iOS and app data. \nIt fully supports iOS 9.3 and iOS 10 iCloud backups, and backups created with A9X and A10 chipsets. It can provide real-time iCloud data for a number of data-types, and supports access to content which has been previously erased from the iCloud. \nWhat Users Say About Reincubate's iCloud API \n\"Reincubate have been super responsive to our needs, and as the market's \"table stakes\" features have expanded, Reincubate has responded by constantly improving and expanding their technology solutions to help us meet those increased customer demands. We are super pleased with our decision to partner with Reincubate!\" -- Steve Woda , CEO, uKnowKids \nAbout Reincubate \nReincubate is the app data company. The company's mission is to provide data access and recovery for all app platforms, be they mobile, desktop, web, IoT or in-vehicle. The company was founded in 2008 and was first to market with both iOS and iCloud data extraction technology. With over half a decade's experience helping law enforcement and security organisations access iOS data, Reincubate has licensed software to government, child protection and corporate clients around the world. \nFor more information on Reincubate please visit https://www.reincubate.com/about/ \nContact : Catalina Butnaru ,",

      "title": "Apple Enhances iOS Backup Encryption in iOS 10.2; Reincubate First to Support it",
      "text": "Blog This \nLONDON , November 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- \nReincubate ' s flagship product, the iPhone Backup Extractor, is the first in market backup recovery software that supports the latest security updates made in the upcoming iOS 10.2 release. \nAfter the security flaw introduced in iOS 10 was fixed earlier in October , Apple has updated and changed encryption algorithms in iOS 10.2, making brute force attacks impractical. \nThe change is associated with a different key derivation process used for iTunes backup encryption than the one used previously. Finding the new derivation process was the missing piece to increase security to iTunes backups. In the most recent version of iPhone Backup Extractor, Reincubate has released a critical update which makes the software fully compatible with iOS 10.2 encryption changes. \nThe encryption update included in iOS 10.2 removes the possibility for brute force attacks to be a viable option for hackers, because it takes significantly more time for each attempt to guess the backup password. \nReincubate's expert iOS team estimated that with current CPUs it takes roughly 7 seconds for a password to be verified and validated before opening a backup. \nAbout the iPhone Backup Extractor \nThe iPhone Backup Extractor was the first product to support recovering data from iOS 10 iCloud backups on Windows and macOS platforms. The software is used by consumers, forensic examiners, and businesses for various use cases, from recovery of lost data to evidence discovery. \nAbout Reincubate's iCloud API \nThe Reincubate iCloud API makes the iCloud accessible to investigators, developers and integrators. The API includes functionality for extraction, manipulation and recovery of many types of iOS and app data. \nIt fully supports iOS 9.3 and iOS 10 iCloud backups, and backups created with A9X and A10 chipsets. It can provide real-time iCloud data for a number of data-types, and supports access to content which has been previously erased from the iCloud. \nWhat Users Say About Reincubate's iCloud API \n\"Reincubate have been super responsive to our needs, and as the market's \"table stakes\" features have expanded, Reincubate has responded by constantly improving and expanding their technology solutions to help us meet those increased customer demands. We are super pleased with our decision to partner with Reincubate!\" -- Steve Woda , CEO, uKnowKids \nAbout Reincubate \nReincubate is the app data company. The company's mission is to provide data access and recovery for all app platforms, be they mobile, desktop, web, IoT or in-vehicle. The company was founded in 2008 and was first to market with both iOS and iCloud data extraction technology.

      "title": "DoorDash iOS App Now Lets You Order Lunch Through iMessage Group Chat",
      "text": "11/10/16 AT 11:40 AM Close \nAt the World Wide Developer’s Conference in 2015, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi demoed new ways for DoorDash customers to place orders directly from the iMessage app. \nNow that Apple has officially rolled out the new iMessage for iOS 10, DoorDash, the popular food delivery app, has announced the new DoorDash app for iOS. The new DoorDash app for iOS makes it easy to order in lunch with coworkers, plan pre-football tailgate and order dinner for the family, directly from an existing iMessage group chat. \n“Since the launch of DoorDash for iMessage, we’ve seen many groups of friends and families taking advantage of this quick and easy way to collect group orders so everyone gets exactly what they want,” Eitan Bencuya, spokesperson for DoorDash told IBTimes. “DoorDash for iMessage provides a convenient way for each member of a group to make their food selections within one order on DoorDash. As you might expect, the times of day immediately preceding mealtimes (when people are planning ahead for larger group meals) are some of the most popular times of day for our customers to place group orders using DoorDash for iMessage.” \nHow do you order food within the new DoorDash app for iOS? \nTo order food within the new DoorDash app for iOS , you’ll need to make sure you have the DoorDash app enabled for iMessage. To do this, click on the App Store icon in iMessage, select add a store, and then under the ‘manage’ tab you can turn the DoorDash app ‘on.’ Related Stories Pandora Redesigns Website, Adds New Features \nOnce the app has been installed into iMessage, you’ll need to create a new group message, click on the App Store icon and choose DoorDash to see a list of restaurants, just like you would by browsing the DoorDash mobile app. \nBy opening the chat bubble, users who already have the DoorDash app will be taken to the store’s menu page, where they can browse and items to the group order. Users can send updates (ex: Mike added 3 items), to all participants by updating the group chat. For participants who don’t have the DoorDash app will be asked to download it directly in iMessage so they can proceed to add items to the group order. Once the food order has been added to the car, the creator of the group can easily submit the order. \nWhat types of food are most commonly ordered through DoorDash? In 2015, the most ordered category across the country was American food. From burgers and fries to bistro salads and sandwiches, American food was three times more popular with DoorDash compared to Mexican food or pizza. While the Big Apple is known for having some of the best pizza, it’s pretty low in popularity on DoorDash, with New Yorkers going for tasty treats like Ice Cream. When it comes to the S.F. Bay Area, the most ordered item was the burrito, while Chicagoans were all about the hot dogs.",

Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. \n\"Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. \n\"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world - regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\" Tags: Ric Cowley News Editor \nRic likes to read epic poems and watch classic films to hide the fact he plays way too many games.

      "title": "Review of the iPhone 7",
      "text": "color Share this article \nI’ve recently become the owner of the brand new iPhone 7 by Apple . With every new product, especially one this advertised, raved and complained about, I knew that I would like certain aspects more than others. Here’s my up close and personal dissection of the iPhone 7: Price \nThe first thing that cannot go unnoticed is the price of the iPhone 7. I was at the Apple Store a couple weeks after the 7 was released and after being charmed by the genius bar workers, I decided to use my summer-job money to buy one brand spanking new. The phone doesn’t come with a cheap price tag, coming in at around $680 with tax for a 32GB, the smallest storage option. Once you get past the shock of the price, you better hope it’s worth it! Overall appearance \nI have to admit, this is definitely the best looking iPhone to date. There are the classic options: Silver, Rose Gold and Gold, but they also introduced Black and Jet Black. Compared to the matte-like Black, Jet Black is shiny, which makes it look even darker. Honestly, I thought the Jet Black looked a little cheap (which is ironic because of the price), so I stuck with the classic-looking Black. Screen \nThe regular iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch display, and it that’s not big enough for you, the iPhone 7 Plus boasts 5.5 inches of bright, HD screen. Apple advertises the 7 to have to the brightest, most colorful Retina HD display yet. Personally, I’m no techie, but I think it looks nice! Home button \nThe home button grew on me. At first I didn’t like that the 7’s “button” isn’t an actual button. The circle is still there, but instead of it clicking in like a button, it vibrates. Honestly, the first time I pushed the home button on my 7 I thought it was broken. Now that I’ve had it for about a month, when I feel someone’s 6 or 5 theirs feels like the strange one. Camera \nThis is actually a very noticeable upgrade. I don’t know how they did it, but the 7 camera picks up the tiniest little details! I took a selfie and had to delete it because a blemish was so HD. Apple says that the reengineered camera on the back of the phone has added “optical image stabilization, a ƒ/1.8 aperture, and a six-element lens to make it even better for shooting photos and videos in low light. With advanced new features like wide color capture, your photos and Live Photos will look even more vibrant. In layman’s terms (or you know, words we can even understand?), the camera is really good. I also noticed the front camera is much improved, and makes things like Snapchatting even better! Speakers \nThis is another noticeable upgrade that I really like. According to Apple, the 7 is 2x louder than the 6, and now not only does sound come out of the bottom of the phone, it also comes out by where the front camera is. It seems like a better speaker near where you ear actually goes during a call, is a little overdue, but maybe that’s just me... Headphone jack/charger \nYes, we all know the travesty that is the iPhone 7 losing it’s earphone jack. I didn’t think this was going to be a huge deal, but trust me it’s a huge inconvenience (such a privileged problem, I know). On commercials for the phone, you see people wearing the new bluetooth earbuds that look exactly like the old ones, but wireless and 1000x easier to lose, so when I bought the phone I figured they were included. I was wrong. Instead, you get the normal earbuds, and a two-inch adapter, called a \"dongle.\" The name might be funny, but the price to replace it with the Bluetooth buds isn’t, coming in at $40. The dongle plugs the earbuds in on one side, and then plugs into the charging hole. It’s not terrible, except you have to bring the adapter everywhere you go if you want to listen to music, and you can’t listen to earbuds and charge your phone at the same time, unless you go buy an additional adapter with another plug-in hole. \nIn all, I do love my new iPhone 7. Although there are some aspects that I think Apple could have kept from earlier models, I love having the best, new products, and the shock of spending that much money out of pocket is finally starting to go down...

      "text": "11/10/16 AT 12:39 PM Close \nWhen Apple first announced its AirPods in September the company said the wireless earbuds would be available in October. Reports then said Apple delayed its AirPods until 2017 but that may not be the case. \nApple reseller Conrad says they will receive AirPods stock starting November 17, and will make them available to buy online by Nov.18-19, according to MacRumors . The German blog Apfelpage.de has translated the quote: \n“Hello, I have just talked with an employee of the Conrad Online Store, since I am there on 14.10 the AirPods ordered and I wanted to cancel today. According to information from the employee, they have stockpiles from 17.11, I will then have them between November 18-19.” Related Stories Apple Testing SOS Feature For iPhone \nConrad’s website says Apple’s AirPods will be available in about eight weeks, which means customers will be able to buy AirPods just in time for the holidays. \nApple announced the wireless AirPods during its Sept. 7 iPhone 7 event, where it said the AirPods will have up to 5 hours of music playback, high-quality-sound through a “seamless and automatic connection” between devices and a battery case that can hold more than 24 hours of listening time. \nAfter the initial delay Apple stated it wanted to get the product right before releasing it to the public. \n“The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,\" an Apple spokesperson said to TechCrunch . Join  ",

      "text": "Adam Jeffery | CNBC FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) apps on a smartphone. Thursday was was not a good day for technology stocks.\nIn late-morning trade, shares of tech giant Apple dropped more than 2.9 percent, while the so-called FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet ) all dropped at least 3.5 percent. Apple, Facebook , Amazon and Netflix also fell into correction territory, or down at least 10 percent from their 52-week high.\nThe drop in these stocks led to a momentary 2 percent dip in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\nPeter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said the prospect of higher interest rates is pressuring tech stocks, particularly the FANGs. These stocks \"don't like higher interest rates because higher interest rates exposes things that are overvalued,\" he said.\nThe Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet next month and is largely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.\nRegarding Apple, analysts at Baird said in a note Wednesday that \"meaningful changes in global trade policies could have a negative impact\" following Republican Donald Trump 's surprising victory over Hillary Clinton . Baird also said that \"with $238 billion of cash and equivalents, and 91% of that overseas, Apple could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a potential cash repatriation tax holiday or change in corporate tax rates.\"\nApple 12-month chart Source: FactSet\nDisclaimer",

      "text": "Getty Image\nDonald Trump is not a fan of Apple , and Apple is not a fan of Donald Trump . So many were wondering how, precisely, the company would react to Trump winning the election. The answer comes in the form of an email sent to employees.\nCook doesn’t tackle the election directly, in the letter. Instead he mirrors what many have done over the course of the last few days and called for unity in the Apple team. Cook acknowledges that many are nervous about the future, but that the only way to go is forward. Cook’s full email, acquired by Mashable, is reproduced below :\nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\nCook closes by encouraging everyone to reach out to other co-workers if they feel anxious or need to talk it out. He hopes their Apple “family” can “move forward together,” regardless of the unexpected outcome of the election.\n(via Mashable )\n",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 \nCook’s post-election letter does not reference Trump by name, nor mention the president-elect’s comments about Apple, but it did espouse some liberal rhetoric. \n“Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world—regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,” Cook said. \n“I’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.

      "title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook urges employees to move forward in response to Donald Trump’s election win",
      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook. Now that everyone has had some time to process the shocking presidential election victory of Donald Trump, reactions are trickling out. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who opposed Trump, but supported House Republicans, wrote in an email to employees Wednesday evening that “we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.”\nWithout mentioning Trump by name, or discussing any of his policies, Cook attempted to address anxiety felt by minority groups over the election results.\n“Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,” Cook wrote in the email, which was obtained by BuzzFeed .\nCredit: Shutterstock. Apple is one of several tech companies Trump has feuded with during his rise to the presidency. He famously singled out Apple for overseas manufacturing when he said he was going to get the company to “start building their damn computers and things in this country” during a speech in January at Liberty University.\nTrump went on to call for a boycott of Apple products after the company refused to give up confidential information from an iPhone owned by one of the terrorists involved in a shooting in San Bernadino, Calif. The FBI had been requesting that Apple supply the data.\nCook did not support Trump’s run, and his comments and actions unnerved Apple enough to convince the tech company to pull its funding and other support for the Republican National Convention. Cook held a fundraiser for Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton in August , but maintained his support for House Republicans, hosting a fundraiser for with House Speaker Paul Ryan over the summer as well.\nCook’s forward-looking approach to the election results is similar to that of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos , who also had issues with Trump during the campaign. Another tech giant, Microsoft, also took a diplomatic tone in its reaction to the election.\nOther’s weren’t so calm about the election. 500 Startups founder and investor Dave McClure voiced his frustration at the Web Summit in Lisbon Wednesday. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said he was stunned at the result but “hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.”\nHere is Cook’s memo in full:\nTeam,\nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings.\nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward.\nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious.\nLet’s move forward — together!\nBest,\nTim\n",

Regardless of how you feel about our new one port future for devices, wireless earbuds are here to stay. Apple’s AirPods aren’t out yet, but Samsung’s Gear IconX earbuds function exactly the same way. \nAmazon is offering $20 off the retail price of the black Gear IconX for today, bringing the total price down to just $179. That’s still $20 over what Apple will charge for its AirPods when they finally launch, as they’re priced at $159. Regardless, if you’re looking to move into the wireless future Apple is forcing upon us then you can’t go wrong with the Gear IconX.",

      "text": "When Indra Nooyi took over as CEO of PepsiCo in 2006, she met with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs . \n\"He was very very gracious to agree to see me when I first became CEO,\" she said Thursday at the DealBook Conference in New York City, hosted by CNBC anchor and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin. \n\"I didn't know him, but I knew somebody who knew him and he said come on down to the Apple office. … He taught me a lot in those two hours.\" \nMonica Schipper | Getty Images Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Indra Nooyi. Jobs, who was a driven and sometimes ruthless manager , told Nooyi that there is a time and a place to throw temper tantrums. \nNooyi recalled: \"He said, if you really feel strongly about something — if you don't like something people are doing — throw a temper tantrum. Throw things around, because people have got to know that you feel strongly about it.\" \nShe later talked to Jobs' agency partners who confirmed that if someone showed him a campaign or design for a product he didn't like, \"he would throw the papers across the room and make them work all night.\" \nWhile she hasn't gone that far, she told Sorkin, \"I'm beginning to use certain words a little bit more freely and I am screaming a bit more, pounding the table … which is really not the way I was. \n\"But it is effective. It shows the passion that I have for what I'm doing.\"",

      "text": "Reddit \nA rumor about the 2017 iPhone lineup has us recall our iPhone SE review and the reasons why this phone has staying power. In that review by Chris Davies, it’s mentioned that in this device is a reason for iPhone 5s (and earlier) owners to upgrade. Not because the iPhone SE is better than Apple’s alternatives, but because the device fills a hole not addressed by any other phone company today. \nMillions of people around the world own an iPhone, and we’re currently at a place where most countries are several generations deep. Apple has made the iPhone available in most places for several years now, going back to the original in many major countries. For people who keep their smartphone in good, working condition out of necessity, a 2-year cycle isn’t always realistic. \nSEE: our full iPhone SE Review \nIf someone is strapped for cash and cannot afford all the amenities upper-class citizens take for granted, they don’t just buy inexpensive goods. The smartphone is one of the few places that most people are willing to spend large amounts of money on themselves. The smartphone is a personal device to such a degree that it affects the way people feel about themselves and their social and economic situations. \nThe iPhone is a status symbol, not unlike a flashy piece of clothing or a piece of shiny jewelry. Apple has cultivated this perception since the inception of the iPhone, making sure that the iPhone is inextricably tied to the world of smartphones in the minds of the public. Because of that, the iPhone SE is a perfect candidate for several types of people. \nPeople who have little income but want to splurge on one product will be most likely to do so on a smartphone if a smartphone is an essential part of their life. As Apple remains the brand most commonly associated with smartphone ubiquity, the iPhone SE stays the most reasonable device to buy. The iPhone SE is best for people who want the Apple logo as a status symbol but need to spend as little cash as they can to get it. \nTo a lesser degree, the iPhone SE fills the void left by all other smartphone companies moving toward larger screens. People unexcited by the idea of getting a new smartphone because their old iPhone 5’s display broke are comforted by this old design with new innards. The iPhone SE is perfect for people who still use smartphones the way Apple foresaw smartphones being used back in 2007. \nIt would not be surprising if Apple continued to sell the iPhone SE for another year with the same hardware it uses now. People who prefer this old design don’t often know the difference between a processor from last year. To them, a new smartphone is good if it works better than the one they’re getting rid of. \nThe iPhone SE is an iPhone in the most basic sense of the brand. It has an Apple logo on it and it runs apps – and it has a couple of cameras. People can text and send messages, make phone calls, and feel like they’ve got their life together. Because even if it’s an iPhone SE, it’s still an iPhone. \nAnd even when everything else in a person’s life is falling apart, they can still feel comforted by the idea that they have an iPhone, brand name and all.",

      "text": "Contributing writer Silicon Valley Business Journal \nSILICON VALLEY — Apple shares fell more than 1 percent in trading on Wednesday, following Donald Trump ’s unexpected presidential victory. On the campaign trail, Trump mentioned the company by name several times, at one point even calling for his supporters to boycott Apple’s products. \nApple is America’s largest company by market value, and in some ways, represents a proxy for Trump’s grievances with American manufacturers. \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a January speech at Liberty University. In subsequent speeches, he imagined giving companies like Apple financial incentives to move manufacturing back to the U.S. by threatening to impose a 45 percent import tax on Chinese-made goods. \nApple currently builds its products in 18 final assembly plants : 14 are located in China, two are located in the U.S., one is in Ireland and the last is in Brazil. \nIf Trump follows through on this campaign promise, the price of manufacturing Apple’s products will rise: It’ll either cost more to import products from China or it’ll cost more to produce the same products in the U.S. \nIf manufacturing costs rise, Apple will either pass that cost to consumers in the form of higher retail prices (it’s estimated a U.S.-made iPhone would be $50 to $100 more expensive than iPhones today), or lower its profit margin. Either way, revenue would be impacted. \nIn February, Apple refused to comply with a U.S. Justice Department order to build a back door into iOS that would allow the government to unlock an iPhone it seized following last year’s mass shooting in San Bernardino. Apple refused, saying doing so would set a dangerous precedent and make iOS less secure. Page 1",

      "text": "print Apple CEO Tim Cook. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite \nNearly every major tech stock is down on Thursday, one day after Donald Trump was officially elected president. \nApple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are all in the red, despite the broader market being up. \nWhile the Dow Jones industrial average is up more than 200 points in midday trading on Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down about 20 points, and was down as much as 60 points earlier. \nBrian Wieser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, said tech stocks are getting hit because people are concerned inflation might be higher under Trump. \n\"Interest rates are spiking, presumably because of concerns of higher inflation under the new administration,\" Wieser told Business Insider in an email. \"As a result, anyone whose value is more dependent on future cash flow is worse off. I think that's why we are seeing a fall-off in technology/software-focused companies vs. the other media companies I cover, where moves haven't been very significant.\" \nHere's how some of the major tech stocks are faring on Thursday: Apple: -3.13%",

      "text": "Summary \nApple's new MacBook Pros appear to be selling better than any previous Pro notebooks. \nThe OLED Touch Bar is the key discriminator from previous Pro generations as well as other notebook PCs. \nApple seems to be betting on the Touch Bar to drive MacBook Pro sales growth for many years to come. Despite consternation and complaints about changes in the new MacBook Pro line-up, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) appears to be doing very well with its new notebooks. According to Slice Intelligence, the Pro has already generated more than seven times the sales as the Retina Display MacBook during an equivalent launch period. And launch sales of the Pro already dwarf cumulative sales to date of the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Book. Click to enlarge Source: Apple A Little Microsoft Inspiration In an interview , Apple's Phil Schiller claimed that the new MacBook Pros have outsold every previous Pro model on Apple's online store. The Pros with Touch Bar are still on back order on the Apple Online Store , with shipping delays of 4-5 weeks. Of course, it can always be argued that this only indicates lack of supply/demand balance, and not the magnitude of sales. However, this chart from Slice Intelligence neatly sums up where MacBook Pro stands in terms of sales relative to major notebook PC competitors, including those from Asus ( OTC:ASUUY ), Dell, and Lenovo ( OTCPK:LNVGY ). Click to enlarge In just its first five days of sales, revenue already is about 3.7 times total cumulative revenue of the Surface Book, and about 10 times the revenue for the other models listed. It's a very impressive achievement, and much of the credit for this must go to Apple's OLED Touch Bar since this is the key innovation that sets the MacBook Pros apart from the competition and from previous Pro generations. Interestingly, the Touch Bar concept isn't completely original. An article in Patently Apple points out that back in 2010, Microsoft had experimented with an Adaptive Keyboard concept that used a long, thin touchscreen positioned above a traditional keyboard, as shown in the image below: Source: Microsoft As shown in the video below, Microsoft not only provided a touchscreen, but also placed small displays underneath each physical key. This allowed the keys to have programmable functions that would be reflected in the individual key displays. What Apple has done is to combine both of the concepts of the touchscreen and configurable keys into the Touch Bar, which is more flexible, and a little more practical, since it doesn't require placing individual displays underneath each physical key. What to do When You Can't Patent It Apple's take on the Microsoft keyboard may have been developed independently, but undoubtedly, when AAPL looked into patenting the Touch Bar (such exercises are routine), it would have discovered the existence of the Microsoft work. Probably, Apple has no means of patenting the Touch Bar, which means it would have few options to prevent others from copying it. Lacking the option of patent protection, I believe that Apple has done the next best thing by trying to tie up available production of the Touch Bar. And not just this year, but many years into the future. This is the better explanation for an observation recently made by analysts at J.P. Morgan, and widely reported in Apple oriented media. They noted that Apple's fiscal 2016 SEC 10-K annual report contained manufacturing purchase obligations that stretched as much as five years in the future. These obligations totaled $3.896 billion, as shown in the table below, excerpted from the report. Click to enlarge What's interesting about this is that past 10-Ks have not shown such future commitments. For instance, the same table from fiscal 2015 shown below has zero commitments, and so did the fiscal 2014 10-K. Click to enlarge J.P. Morgan was quick to jump to the conclusion that Apple must be committing to buy OLED screens for coming generations of iPhone. This seems to be yet another repetition of the \"OLED envy\" thesis that has been so popular among analysts. Apple's iPhone LCD screens are so inferior to OLED, that the company would even buy them from Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ). Except that the thesis is bogus. With the new wide-color gamut displays in the new iPhone 7, the displays are not inferior to OLED. Far from it. They provide more accurate color, with better response uniformity than OLED. They will also probably last longer since they don't have OLED's problems of blue pixel life limitation. They also don't suffer from the OLED problem of screen burn-in. And finally, Apple's LCD screens are more energy efficient when used the way that is most common, with a white or light color background (as when reading text on a web page). At this point, given all the technical drawbacks of OLED, I don't buy into the thesis that a move to OLED is inevitable. Apple may choose to skip the technology altogether. But, in any case, the future purchase obligations almost certainly don't reflect a shift to OLED. The problem with the OLED interpretation of the future obligations is that the dollar amounts are too small. According to IHS , the display/touchscreen of the Samsung Galaxy S7 costs $55. Let's assume about half of that is the OLED display. Apple will probably sell at least 200 million iPhones in fiscal 2018 and the same in 2019 since it sold 211.9 million in fiscal 2016. If even a quarter of these have OLED displays, then the dollar commitment that Apple would need to make would be $2.75 billion, not the $939 million shown for the first 1-3 years. I believe that the commitment is for Touch Bar devices. The numbers fit a lot better. Assuming each Touch Bar costs $15, and assuming that Apple will sell at most 20 million MacBook Pros per year in fiscal 2017-2019, then the total bill would come to about $900 million, a pretty good fit to the projected expense. Investor Takeaway Considering that Apple is motivated to limit copying of the Touch Bar, this really looks like the company preemptively tying up its key suppliers. These suppliers have been reported to be Wistron and an unidentified Singapore company. Early on, it was reported that Apple's Singapore supplier was having production difficulties with the Touch Bar, which was why Wistron was brought on board. Apple normally doesn't provide such long-term commitments, but appears to have done so in order to keep its suppliers from building Touch Bars for others. If building the Touch Bars requires unique expertise, this would be an effective way to keep the technology out of the hands of competitors. It's a gutsy strategy that is not wholly without risk. Apple may miscalculate the demand for the new MacBook Pro and be stuck with Touch Bars it doesn't need. However, as noted above, Apple doesn't appear to have miscalculated at all. Strong demand for the MacBook Pros confirms my thesis that the key mission of the MacBook Pros is to provide a compelling upgrade path for current MacBook users. Pent-up demand for the new Pros seems to be sufficient to get Macs outgrowing the PC industry in 2017. 2017 is starting to look like a growth year for Apple on the strength of the iPhone 7 and new MacBook Pros. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. \n“Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” \nTrump, should be choose to stick to any of his campaign pledges, could be on a collision course over Apple’s manufacturing of products outside the US. \nThe new President-elect was upset with Apple over its refusal to unlock the iPhone of the terrorist behind the San Bernardino shooting last year. \nHe also wants tech giants like Apple to bring manufacturing back to the United States. Apple’s use of companies like Foxconn to manufacturer the iPhone in questionable conditions for employees has long been under the microscope. \nShould be company make a larger commitment to building products on home soil? Share your thoughts in the comments below. \nHere’s Cook’s email to staff in full (via Buzzfeed) \n“Team, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward — together! \nBest, \nVideo: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus 0 shares",

      "text": "Technology Apple, FANG Stocks Aren't Joining Trump Rally Apple and FANG Stocks -- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are tumbling Thursday after falling Wednesday even as the Dow hit a new high.(iStockphoto) Reprints \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average opened at a record high Thursday, after rallying strongly Wednesday following the presidential election. But Apple and the so-called FANG internet giants -- Facebook ( FB ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Google parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ) have not joined in. \nThere appears to be a sector rotation, with bank, drug, defense and basic material stocks soaring on the upcoming Trump administration. Meanwhile, investors are pulling out of defensive sectors such as consumer products and tobacco. They're also taking profits on the big-cap techs, though they are off session lows. Apple \nApple fell 2.25% to 108.36 in afternoon trade on the stock market today , once again undercutting its 110.33 buy point first cleared on Sept. 14. Apple hit 105.83 intraday. On Wednesday, shares fell, but rallied to close off 0.2% at 110.88, above the pivot. Apple shares have been retreating since giving mixed quarterly results after the close of Oct. 25. Facebook \nFacebook retreated 1.6% intraday, but is back above its 200-day line after briefly undercutting that key support area, with a session low of115.27. Facebook sank 0.8% on Wednesday. Shares hit a record high on Oct. 25, but have been pulling back. Facebook undercut its 50-day line just before reporting Q3 earnings. Earnings shot up 91%, but shares tumbled after Facebook said ad revenue growth rates will slow \"meaningfully.\" Amazon \nAmazon lost 3.6% intraday to 744.40 after falling to 717.70, hitting its lowest levels since late July. Amazon shares have fallen since reporting booming profit on Oct. 27 that fell well below expectations. It also gave weak guidance for the holiday quarter. IBD'S TAKE: While Apple and big internet stocks are falling, bank stocks are soaring on expectations for Fed rate hikes and hopes for lighter regulation under a Trump administration and GOP Congress. Netflix \nNetflix fell 4.9% intraday to 116.22 after hitting 113.70 earlier. Shares skyrocketed Oct. 18 after Netflix reported stronger-than-expected Q3 subscriber growth. Shares peaked on Oct. 24, and had drifting lower, forming a handle with a potential buy point of 129.39. Alphabet \nAlphabet is down 2.6% to 785 in the afternoon after hitting 768.23 intraday. Alphabet dipped 0.8% on Wednesday. The search giant fell below its buy point of 813.98 last week. The Google parent retook its 50-day line on Tuesday, but has now fallen back. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "Verizon \nBecause not everyone needs an expensive powerhouse of a tablet from a brand like Apple or Samsung, Verizon creates its own devices with simplicity and affordability being at the core. \nVerizon’s next tablet, as Evan Blass revealed yesterday, is the Ellipsis 8 HD which is available nationwide starting today. There’s a difference with this tablet, though, as it’s not as watered-down as its predecessors. \nSince Verizon is targeting customers who want an approachable device, the Ellipsis 8 HD comes with two years of free and instant access to the carrier’s Tech Coach service. What’s Tech Coach? It’s a platform that allows people to communicate by message or voice chat with a real U.S.-based representative whenever help is needed. The representatives, who Verizon refers to as “Tech Coaches,” will provide tips and tricks on everything there is to do on the Ellipsis 8 HD. \nKey specifications 8-inch Full HD (1920×1200) display Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 16GB (w/ microSD card slot) 8MP / 5MP cameras 5100mAh battery Android 6.0.1 \nAs you can see, it’s not a low-end tablet in any way. The Ellipsis 8 HD actually falls into the upper part of the mid-range segment. Maybe the only thing to be concerned with is software as it’s not likely for Android 7.0 Nougat to be ushered in at any point in the future. \nThe Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD in Midnight Blue and Arctic Grey is live on Verizon’s site right now, but you can also walk into retail stores and pick up one in-person. Verizon’s price on the tablet is $10.41 per month (for twenty-four months), $99 on a two-year contract, or $249 without any commitment necessary. Regardless of the payment option, you’ll have to add a one-time $20 activation fee to the total.

      "text": "Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ Apple's partnership with Nike lives on with the Apple Watch November 10, 2016 9:49 AM PST Apple Watch Nike+ versus the Series 2. What's really different? by Brian Tong Close Drag \nApple and Nike partnered 10 years ago for a special edition iPod -- the Nike+ iPod -- to get you running to the beat. The music player came bundled with a wireless sensor that could be placed in select Nike sneaks and used to measure pace and distance when running. \nThe two companies have buddied up once again for a special-edition Apple Watch. The Apple Watch Nike+ edition combines all of the features found in the Apple Watch Series 2 , but adds new features that would appeal to runners. \nThe Apple Watch Nike+ is available now in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes for $369, £369 or AU$529, and $399, £399 or AU$579, respectively. That's the same price as the Series 2. James Martin/CNET What's different The Nike+ Run Club app comes preloaded on the watch and works with exclusive Siri commands, such as asking her to start a workout. The app also offers daily motivation through run reminders, challenges with friends and alerts for when the weather is sunny. The watch comes with a lightweight, breathable (i.e. it has holes in it) two-tone silicon strap that's exclusive to the Nike+ model. Color options include black and silver bands with accents in either gray, white or yellow-green (which Apple calls \"Volt\"). It also features two exclusive Nike watch faces that can be personalized to show activity data and heart rate, or provide quick access to the Nike+ Run Club and weather apps. What else can it do? \nOther than the features listed above, the Nike+ model is identical to the Apple Watch Series 2. It's the same size and weight, and it can be used to make phone calls (when your iPhone is connected) and run apps. \nIt also features the same ultra bright display, dual-core processor and swim-proof design as the Series 2. You can even download and use the Nike+ Run Club app on the Series 2 model, which also includes GPS, but you won't have the Siri integration and run reminders from the Nike+ model. \nWe'll have a full review of the Apple Watch Nike+ edition in the coming weeks.

      "text": "Donald Trump is the President-elect, and the tech world is still figuring out how to react. After the vast majority of Silicon Valley stood in opposition to Trump’s policies and divisive rhetoric — which, among other things, called on Apple to make its phones in the US  and said Amazon “has a huge antitrust problem ” — many of those companies’ stocks are now taking a beating .\nHowever, for all the areas of disagreement, there’s at least one Trump policy that may sit nicely with big tech firms: tax repatriation.\nAs this chart from Statista shows, some of the biggest tech companies in America hoard most of their cash overseas. They do this because the United States — unusually in the world — does not tax foreign holdings of U.S. companies as long as that money stays overseas. But as soon as companies bring it back to the U.S., it's subject to a tax rate around 35% — higher than corporate tax rates in most other countries.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has been particularly vocal about this , telling the Washington Post this past August that “we’re not going to bring [the overseas cash] back until there’s a fair rate.”\nIn Trump keeps to his word, he might give that “fair rate” Cook desires. In a September speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump proposed bringing that tax rate all the way down to 10%. “By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country,” he said.\nWould this make Trump and the tech world hunky-dory? Probably not. But even in a landscape this tense, there’s at least some room for common ground.\nStatista \n",

      "text": "More Charts \nDonald Trump is the President-elect, and the tech world is still figuring out how to react. After the vast majority of Silicon Valley stood in opposition to Trump’s policies and divisive rhetoric — which, among other things, called on Apple to make its phones in the US and said Amazon “has a huge antitrust problem ” — many of those companies’ stocks are now taking a beating . \nHowever, for all the areas of disagreement, there’s at least one Trump policy that may sit nicely with big tech firms: tax repatriation. \nAs this chart from Statista shows, some of the biggest tech companies in America hoard most of their cash overseas. They do this because the United States — unusually in the world — does not tax foreign holdings of U.S. companies as long as that money stays overseas. But as soon as companies bring it back to the U.S., it's subject to a tax rate around 35% — higher than corporate tax rates in most other countries. \nApple CEO Tim Cook has been particularly vocal about this , telling the Washington Post this past August that “we’re not going to bring [the overseas cash] back until there’s a fair rate.” \nIn Trump keeps to his word, he might give that “fair rate” Cook desires. In a September speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump proposed bringing that tax rate all the way down to 10%. “By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country,” he said. \nWould this make Trump and the tech world hunky-dory? Probably not. But even in a landscape this tense, there’s at least some room for common ground. \nStatista Follow Tech Chart Of The Day and never miss an update!

      "title": "After Donald Trump's victory, Tim Cook sent this letter to Apple employees",
      "text": "Comments \nEarlier this week, Donald Trump shocked pollsters and political pundits across the country after winning the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Despite an incredibly close race, Trump managed to win the election after over-performing in a number of key battleground states, such as Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. Consequently, Trump received more than the needed 270 electoral votes even though Hillary Clinton received more votes in the popular vote. \nTaking a step back, it would be a gross understatement to call this year's election divisive. Trump is nothing if not controversial, and his recent victory has generated a tremendous amount of backlash and fear on the left and an equal amount of applause on the right. \nIn light of that, Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an effort to ensure that the Apple machine keeps running smoothly, penned a letter to Apple employees calling for unity and respect. The letter was originally obtained by Buzzfeed and reads as follows: \nTeam, \nI’ve heard from many of you today about the presidential election. In a political contest where the candidates were so different and each received a similar number of popular votes, it’s inevitable that the aftermath leaves many of you with strong feelings. \nWe have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together. I recall something Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said 50 years ago: “If you can’t fly, then run. If you can’t run, then walk. If you can’t walk, then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” This advice is timeless, and a reminder that we only do great work and improve the world by moving forward. \nWhile there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world—regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love. \nI’ve always looked at Apple as one big family and I encourage you to reach out to your co-workers if they are feeling anxious. \nLet’s move forward—together!Best,",

      "text": "\nKnocking on the doors of Apple's latest foldable iPhone concept is this strange, albeit rather innovative smartphone that boasts a bendable screen. According to Engadget , Samsung has filed a patent this past April for the aforesaid prototype. Thanks to a Dutch website dubbed Galaxy Club , we can now get a firsthand look at the actual application as well as details surrounding the flip phone-inspired handset. The device can presumably be “folded or unfolded semi automatically\" and it also contains a “secondary” display that only appears when you fold the smartphone. The entire project is apparently nicknamed \"Galaxy X\"— a moniker that may undoubtedly be the name of the actual device itself.\nThough, Slash Gear warns that \"this Galaxy X is obscenely long when unfurled. More like a remote control than a smartphone, it is significantly longer than most smartphones these days.\" However, the main reasoning behind the bizarre, foldable concept is so that the device can be used as a tablet when unfolded. Still, with all the recent news of Samsung mobile devices exploding , should the company be knee-deep in experimenting new concepts? Or, should they invest their time coming up with methods to ensure that their current phones are explosion-proof?\nTake a look at the patent illustrations and expect Samsung's foldable smartphone device to be realized sometime next year. To learn more about the concept head over to The Korea Herald .\n\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Comment Apple \nThe folks over at Apple are certainly not basking in the limelight and simply waiting for things to happen. Rather, they intend to make things happen. Well, the Cupertino-based company has recently introduced the second public beta version of iOS 10.2 that will be rolled out for three different devices -- the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. In the past, public betas of any iOS version were made available only to registered developers for testing purposes. This time around, the iOS 10.2 beta will come with a slew of new features that will certainly whet your appetite if you love having new Unicode 9.0 emojis to share your thoughts with another person, a new TV app, more wallpaper choices for the iPhone 7, and of course, new camera features. \nThis particular public beta program will be free for all to participate, which is a pleasant departure from the previous policy that caters only for paid developers. iOS 10.2 will be released to all and sundry in due time, with the speculated release date being December. This particular public beta would enable more users to test pre-release versions of the software update prior to it being finalized, sort of like a massive soak test \nWhat are some of the new changes that will be part and parcel of iOS 10.2 beta? Well, the masses have sniffed around the Internet, and these have been more or less confirmed to date: The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners will be pleased to know that a trio of new wallpapers will be part of the deal in iOS 10.2 beta. New widget for Videos app New Preserve Camera setting New emoji which would most probably resemble the Unicode 9.0 update) New ‘Press and Hold to Speak’ menu under Home Button Accessibility settings New ‘Celebration’ Messages screen effect New ‘Show Star Ratings’ option under Music Settings New headphone icon in status bar for Bluetooth audio devices (which was seen with the Beats Solo3 in the past) TV app now part of the mix Videos app still available TV widget accompanies Videos widget SOS feature that is found on the Apple Watch whenever you click the power button 5 times Music points to relocated shuffle and repeat controls \nWhat is interesting, however, is the fact that the presence of the TV app is in dispute by those who have actually downloaded the iOS 10.2 Dev Beta 2, citing that the TV app has failed to pop up for no apparent reason. This phenomenon has affected not only those who are rocking to the latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but also older eligible iPhone models like the iPhone 6s as well as the iPad Pro. Of course, this is not the case for every single person who have installed iOS 10.2 public beta, but only for selected ones. The root cause behind this has yet to be determined, so hopefully it is not too huge a glitch for the folks at Apple to fix -- preferably sooner rather than later. ",

      "text": "Comment Hackers are working on an iOS 10 jailbreak. Kārlis Dambr/ Wikipedia \nIt seems that Apple is keeping its lead against hackers and maybe even increasing it. Some owners of Apple devices have received notifications informing them that the iOS 10.1.1 is now ready for installation. That would keep Apple ahead of the hackers who are still working on an iOS 10 jailbreaking tool. \nPangu iOS 10 Jailbreak \nWord has come out that Pangu has been able to jailbreak the iOS 10 on an iPhone 6. There is supposed to be a video showing that achievement. The problem is that the crack is yet to be made public so it can be used by others. But Pangu is not alone in claiming that they were successful in jailbreaking the iOS 10. \nThere is another site that claims they have cracked Apple's iOS 10 though there are limitations to the crack that it is offering. It seems that they were only worked with the 64-bit system. Another downside of their crack is the fact that it requires a lot of link clicking which could lead to potential malware infection. \nThese jailbreak claims are not going to mean anything until the cracks are released publicly. There have been plenty of jailbreaking claims in the past that were not released in public. \nOther Jailbreaks \nWhile Pangu and other hacker teams are the best hopes for a jailbreak for the iOS 10, others are working on it too. A hacker with a Twitter handle name @ijapija00 showed a demo of a successful jailbreak of an iPhone 7 Plus that runs iOS 10.1. The demo was shown on a YouTube video. The lone hacker might have been inspired by Luca Todesco, who is a prolific iOS hacker working alone. \n@ijapija00's jailbreak can supposedly work on iOS 10.1.1 as well which, if true, would be a huge development in the history pf jailbreaks. But there are a lot of skeptics of the jailbreak claim. First, the jailbreak seems to be semi-untethered. Another important reason why others are doubting the jailbreak is because @ijapija00 used a third-party app to unlock the jailbreak access upon rebooting. This is not the usual way for jailbreak demos. \nThis jailbreak is not going public however. The hacker himself admitted that it would require too much work for him to release a public version on his own. \nThe Coming of the iOS 10.1.1 \nPangu and other hackers should work fast if they want to come out publicly with an iOS 10 jailbreak. Users may start applying the iOS 10.1.1 update which could render the void the iOS 10 jailbreak useless. \n",

      "text": "MacBook Pro with Touch Bar orders updating, Apple readies first shipments By Thursday, November 10, 2016, 01:20 pm PT (04:20 pm ET) A batch of orders for early MacBook Pro with Touch Bar have updated, with some very early purchasers being told that the order was \"preparing for shipment\" and could be delivered as soon as Friday afternoon. Preorder customers are reporting that Apple is packaging up for the first wave of shipments of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, in every configuration, and are gearing up for a second wave as well. Most users who saw credit card charges made on Monday are seeing a status update of \"preparing for shipment\" The earliest shipments seem limited to those who ordered machines on the day of, or early the day after, the Oct. 27 \"Hello Again\" press event. Delivery dates for the first batch of shipments reported to us fall between Nov. 11 and Nov. 17. Some of the first wave of purchasers are reporting a date range ending as late as Nov. 25, with the second batch looking at delivery from December 5 to 15. Some users with custom configurations focused around the 15-inch MacBook Pro Touch Pad with Radeon Pro 460 GPU have yet to receive an estimated ship date beyond \"December\" and in some cases \"early January.\" AppleInsider sources within the retail chain at Apple and elsewhere tell us that they aren't expecting \"boosted\" configurations of the MacBook Pro 13- and 15-inch with Touch Bar (including higher-end GPUs) in store at launch. Most Apple stores have demonstration units of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now, and are expecting a few \"baseline\" models for customers to purchase on or around Nov. 15, with other retail channels like Best Buy expecting \"limited quantities\" around Nov. 17. \"Refunds\" reported by customers, aren't cancellations Some users are reporting \"refunds\" by Apple —but this is not actually the case. As expected, and confirmed by AppleInsider an apparent \"refund\" is actually an available funds hold expiring prior to charge. Apple informed us that customers with order numbers will still see the charge finalize, or a new hold placed \"within a few days.\" The 2016 MacBook Pro family, announced at Apple's \"Hello Again\" event , is a major redesign of Apple's flagship notebook, and comes in screen sizes of 13 and 15 inches, with core models starting at $1,799. AppleInsider was at the event, and was able to spend some time with all the latest hardware. To grab the lowest prices on Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, see AppleInsider's Mac Price Guide .
