      "text": "Fifteen years ago today, Microsoft released the original Xbox, a console whose legacy lives on today in the form of the Xbox One and Xbox Live. Microsoft’s first games machine – originally codenamed the DirectXbox – was practically a PC. But by virtue of its PC-like built-in 8GB hard drive and Ethernet adapter, along with its infamous not-so-PC-like first controller (the Duke!), it left its mark with a memorable game library during its all-too-brief four-year run. And while it saw many great games grace its DVD tray, these are our favorite 15 exclusives* to have ever hit the original Xbox. \n(*Some of these games came to other platforms much later, but were for all intents and purposes Xbox-exclusive at the time. Feel free to argue about it in the comments below.) \nContinue reading… ",

      "text": "\nAt Build earlier this year, Microsoft announced Azure Functions Preview, a serverless compute platform for building IoT solutions. Today, they announced the general availability of Azure Functions. They support the development of event driven solutions on a serverless architecture, enabling on demand scaling and developers pay only for the resources they consume. Functions support for both C# and JavaScript is generally available and F#, PowerShell, PHP, Python and Bash are in preview.\nThey now support creating, running, and debugging Functions locally on Windows, with the beta Azure Functions CLI. For JavaScript Functions on NodeJS, the CLI integrates with Visual Studio Code and sets up debug targets automatically. While the CLI currently only works on Windows, they are working on support on Mac and Linux. Microsoft will also release Visual Studio 2015 tooling support soon and it will allow developers to create and develop new Function Apps, debug them locally or remotely, and publish them to Azure.\nLearn more about Azure Functions here .",

      "title": "How To Set Up Two-Factor Authentication for a Microsoft Account",
      "text": "Tweet 0 Share \nA couple of weeks ago, I showed you how to set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for Office 365 users. In today’s Ask the Admin , I’ll show you how to do the same thing but for consumer Microsoft Accounts. \nPasswords are easily stolen or guessed, so it’s important not to rely on them alone. Multifactor authentication adds one or more factors, in addition to your password, to make it harder to use guessed or stolen credentials. A second factor might be something you have, such as a smartphone or token, along with something you know, like a password. \nEnabling 2FA for a Microsoft Account is relatively simple, and a smartphone application, email, or phone number can be used as the second form factor. If you are exclusively using Windows and Microsoft apps, you’ll find that enabling 2FA doesn’t cause any applications compatibility issues. If you are using apps with your Microsoft Account on other platforms, you might be required to enter app passwords where 2FA isn’t directly supported. \nFor more information on how to enable 2FA in Office 365, see Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for Office 365 Users on the Petri IT Knowledgebase . Enable Two-Factor Authentication \nBefore starting, it’s worth considering Microsoft’s advice about keeping three pieces of security information on your account. That means that your contact details should be up-to-date, and if you forget your password, you will need two contact methods if 2FA has been enabled. \nIn the instructions that follow, I’ll set up 2FA for my Microsoft Account using the Microsoft Authenticator app installed on a Windows 10 Mobile device. The Microsoft Authenticator app provides the most convenient and secure means of using 2FA. You can download the app here for Windows 10 Mobile. For iOS or Android devices, you can find Microsoft Authenticator in the Apple or Google Play stores respectively. The instructions for iOS and Android devices will vary slightly from what follows. Go to the security information page for your Microsoft Account here . Sign in using your Microsoft Account email and password. On the Security settings page, make sure that you have three or more pieces of security info configured below Security info helps to keep your account secure . \nIf you need to add a phone number or alternate email address, click Add security info and fill out the required information. You’ll need to verify the number or address you provide. Set up two-factor authentication for a Microsoft Account (Image Credit: Russell Smith) Under Two-step verification , click Set up two-step verification . On the Set up two-step verification screen, click Next . On the Setting up an identity verification app screen, click the device on which you will install a verification app, and then Next . Sponsored Choose an platform for the verification app (Image Credit: Russell Smith) Now open the Microsoft Authenticator app on your chosen device, and select + Add account from the hamburger menu in the top left. On the What kind of account are you adding? screen, click Personal account . On the Choose an account screen, click the Microsoft Account that you are configuring for 2FA. Verify your PIN or gesture if Windows Hello is enabled. Your Microsoft Account will now appear in the list of accounts in the Microsoft Authenticator app. Set up Microsoft Authenticator in Windows 10 Mobile (Image Credit: Russell Smith) \nIf you’re not using Windows Phone, you’ll be prompted to scan a barcode on the Set up the Microsoft Authenticator app screen. Click Skip at the bottom of the Set up the Microsoft Authenticator app screen. Go back to the security information page for your Microsoft Account here . Under Two-step verification , click Set up two-step verification again. On the Two-step verification is turned on screen, make a note of your recovery code or print it out, and then click Next . You’ll be prompted to set up app passwords for Windows Phone 8.1 if you’re using Windows 10 Mobile, you can skip this step and click Done . Click Finish to complete the process. Sponsored \n2FA is now enabled for your Microsoft Account. On trusted devices, you won’t be required to provide a second factor when logging in. On all other devices, you will need to use the second factor when signing in. Sponsored",

      "text": "OpenAI will use Microsoft's cloud, as Azure gains more features The partnership shows momentum for AI workloads in Microsoft's cloud More good reads \nA pedestrian walks past a sign on Microsoft Headquarters campus July 17, 2014 in Redmond, Washington. Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft Email a friend   Microsoft \nMicrosoft's continued investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is paying dividends. The company has partnered with OpenAI, a non-profit company founded earlier this year to advance the field of machine intelligence for the benefit of humanity. \nAs part of the deal, announced Tuesday, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud provider, an important win for Microsoft as it competes with the likes of Amazon, Google, and IBM to power the next generation of intelligent applications. OpenAI is backed by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, controversial investor Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Y Combinator Partner Jessica Livingston. \nOn top of that, Microsoft also launched a set of cloud services all aimed at furthering intelligent applications. The new Azure Bot Service makes it easier for people to spin up intelligent chat bots in Microsoft's cloud, while Azure Functions lets customers run compute functions without provisioning servers. The company also announced the general availability of its N-series virtual machines, which give customers the ability to use GPUs for high-performance computing tasks.   \nMicrosoft has been working to position its cloud as the home for intelligent applications, and these announcements demonstrate further momentum toward that goal. \nThe N-series virtual machines made generally available Tuesday are an important part of that. They provide users with the ability to run high-performance workloads in the cloud that require the power of GPUs to handle massive parallel computing tasks. It's a service that OpenAI has already been taking advantage of, along with other customers like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures. \nFor companies that want a pre-built service, the Azure Bot Service provides users with a number of templates that they can use to get started building intelligent, conversational assistants. It's built to easily plug into other Azure services, like Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which helps computer programs parse human language. \nOne of the other key services included in Microsoft's news dump Tuesday is Azure Functions, which lets customers set up a snippet of code that runs whenever a set of conditions is met. Microsoft handles all the provisioning of compute resources necessary to run the Functions, so users don't have to worry about running a virtual machine all the time to handle irregular events. \nMaking Azure Functions generally available is important to Microsoft's ongoing competition with Amazon Web Services. The other Seattle-area cloud provider launched its AWS Lambda service N years ago, and it has proven a popular tool for leveraging the power of what people have begun calling \"serverless\" computing.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft released a new Insider Preview build of Office Mobile for Windows 10 this week, bringing the version number to 17.7571.xxxx. The update was released on the 11th, although it wasn't announced until last night. \nNew Previews are generally offered monthly, with the last one being made available on October 6 . The November update includes a number of new features for all of the apps in the Office suite, which are Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Here's what's new: \nAccessibility built right in to Office Mobile We have improved support for using Narrator and other assistive technologies as well as your keyboard to edit documents with others, sort data in worksheets, read and edit presentations, and more. \nSharing Notifications in Word Mobile, Excel Mobile and PowerPoint Mobile* No need to keep checking your shared documents, workbooks, or presentations. We'll send you a notification when there's activity. *This feature is available with an Office 365 subscription only. \nOpen more file types with Excel Mobile You can now open more file types than you before, such as files that contain snapshots from your Camera tool. \nPage background colors now in OneNote Does your OneNote page need a change? Switch it up by adding a background color in just one click and change the mood of your page. \nLasso Select now at your fingertips with PowerPoint Mobile The Surface pen button allows you to use lasso select on ink without visiting the ribbon. \nUse your Pen to select and change objects in PowerPoint Mobile* Grab object handles with the Surface pen to resize, rotate, move, and more. *This feature is available with an Office 365 subscription only. \nTo sign up for the Office Insider Program on Windows 10 (all platforms have different steps to take), you'll need to have opted into the Windows Insider Program, and you'll need an active Office 365 subscription. If that sounds like too much, you can always wait a few weeks until this update hits the Production channel (non-Insiders). Tags",

      "title": "Microsoft Introduces CRM for Small Businesses with Outlook Customer Manager",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has just introduced a new Customer relationship management (CRM) tool for small businesses called Outlook Customer Manager. The release Follows the launch of the new customer scheduling tool Bookings earlier this year.\nIn a post on its official Office Blogs, Microsoft’s outlook team describes the tool as, ‘”Relationships made easy for small businesses.”\nAs more small businesses deploy Office 365, many of the cloud productivity and collaboration tools within the suite of products can now be used for seamless CRM integration .\nBookings simplified the way small businesses schedule appointments with customers. With the new Outlook Customer Manager, you can now manage your customer relationship just as easily, the company claims.\n\nThe Outlook Customer Manager platform lets you track reminders, deals in progress, tasks and other ways in which you interact with a customer in a complete view. You will now be able to see everything you do with your customers at all times, the Outlook claims. And best of all, the company says you don’t have to learn or install another application because it all takes place within Outlook inbox with a single click on the icon.\n\nThe platform is designed to let you get all of your customer’s information on the same page and in one place next to your inbox. The idea is that if you need to take action on an item, you are less likely to forget this way.\nYou can also access Outlook Customer Manager on the go with your mobile device. The mobile app lets you access the same information as on your desktop, the Outlook team says. This enables you to check the latest information about your customer before you meet them. It also gives you the option to add more notes after the meeting has taken place. The company says you can even use the app to scan documents and business cards using your phone’s camera. The mobile app is currently only available for iOS, with other platforms coming soon.\n\nOutlook Customer Manager is available at no extra cost with an Office 365 Business Premium subscription starting with those in First Release.

      "title": "Xbox One Design Labs Custom Controller Impressions",
      "text": "\nIt was during E3 that Microsoft surprised and enthused gamers by making an unexpected announcement. That is, their plans to enter the custom controller business, making them the inaugural first party manufacturer to do so. Needless to say, it created quite a talking point, with everyone from collectors and enthusiasts to casual gamers wanting to design an Xbox One controller that would highlight their inner selves.\nThanks to Microsoft, We Got This Covered was able to obtain a code that allowed us to design, order and test out one of these Design Lab custom controllers for editorial purposes. I was lucky enough to get that opportunity — being the controller collector and obsessor that I am — and took to the process with much excitement. The result is something truly my own, which, while somewhat basic, advertises both my love of red and subdued personality.\nThe process is rather simple. To start, one must visit the Xbox Design Labs, wherein they’ll be presented with a decent amount of colour-coded options. It doesn’t take long — maybe five minutes or so — and very easy to understand, as all you need to do is click on the colours you want each part to be, before hitting next. If you want a blue controller with pink triggers and shoulder buttons, so be it. Or, if you’re like me and want a heavy dose of red, that option is available too. As people have proven, there are a lot of possibilities to be discovered, allowing each gamer (and personality type) to be serviced.\nWhat’s nice is that, in addition to two-dimensional images, a 3D version of your creation can be inspected and rotated before purchase. It’s not exact, as the final product will likely look a bit different, but it’s a good guideline for what to expect.\nIn addition to being able to select the colours for each part of your controller, including the face and back plates, the triggers and shoulder buttons, and all of the face buttons, you can also opt to personalize it further, by adding a name or nickname of your choice. This moniker — which costs about ten dollars extra to add — is written in golden text near the bottom of the accessory, nestled in-between its d-pad and its right joystick. Whether you go that extra mile is entirely up to you (and your budget, of course), but it certainly adds another layer of personalization to the already unique process.\nWhen I ordered my controller, E3 2016 had just finished, and June was coming to a close. Although it was hinted that the thing may ship during August, that wasn’t the case. In fact, I waited a bit longer than some others did before getting mine, and kept an impatient eye out for a shipping notice. That was fine, though, because the demand was surely high, and the Chinese production plant must’ve had its work cut out for it in those beginning months.\nSpeaking of which, it’s important to state that these controllers are manufactured and shipped from China. That didn’t cross my mind until I saw the tracking number and plugged it in, but I ended up getting to watch as my creation went from China to the Phillipines and then on to Anchorage, Alaska, before coming home to Canada. The thing is undoubtedly more of a world traveler than its owner is, and I’m happy to report that — thanks to some smart packaging — everything arrived in perfect condition, within a really nice-looking box that is unique to the Design Labs process.\nI’ve since opened and tested out my newfound friend, and am pretty happy with the results. The red — which I worried I’d maybe overused — looks great, and the grey backplate is perfectly fitting. It works very well, too, outside of having shoulder buttons that make a louder clicking noise than I was expecting. Hopefully they will quieten down over time.\n\nBeing that they’re the new and redesigned Xbox One S controllers, those who purchase these expensive toys can expect all of the bells and whistles that come with that. This includes Bluetooth, a refined form factor and etched in grips. The only downside is, unfortunately, said grips, because they’re not nearly as defined as they should have been. In comparison to the black rubber grips that the special edition Forza Motorsport 6 and Lunar White controllers had, these imitations leave a lot to be desired. It is what it is, though, and at least they’re kind of there.\nAlthough your mind was likely made up before you visited this article, I hope that I’ve shone some light on the simple process that is creating an Xbox One Design Labs controller. It’s an impressive, fun and exciting option, and one that has led to some gorgeous creations. The only true downside is how expensive it is, especially for us Canadians who are looking at well over $100 before taxes.\nThis impressions piece is based on a product we were provided with.\n",

      "text": "Xbox One gets over-the-air DVR through a set-top box Nuvyyo's Tablo is filling in where Microsoft won't. Share Save \nJust because Microsoft has ruled out an Xbox One DVR feature doesn't mean that you're without choices. Nuvyyo has introduced an Xbox One (and Windows 10 Anniversary Update) version of its Tablo app , letting you watch and record over-the-air TV streamed from the company's networked set-top box . You'll get the \"majority\" of features you see on other platforms, including a TV guide as well as options to pause live shows and skip ads. \nAs always, the only real gotcha is the cost. The Tablo DVR's entry two-tuner model officially costs $220 (a four-tuner version is $300), and the TV guide requires a subscription ($5 per month, $50 per year or $150 lifetime) if you plan to use it. If you're a cord-cutter and want to use your Xbox as your central media hub, though, the up front price may be small compared to what you save by ditching cable or satellite.",

      "text": "Market News  26am EST Elon Musk-backed AI startup and Microsoft sign cloud agreement \nNov 15 OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's flagship cloud service, Azure. \nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. \nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp co-founder Reid Hoffman. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. \nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. ( bit.ly/2gdxifR ) \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.

      "text": "Technology News | Tue Nov 15, 2016 | 11:42am EST Elon Musk-backed AI startup and Microsoft sign cloud agreement Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk attends a forum on startups in Hong Kong, China January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nOpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's ( TSLA.O ) Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) flagship cloud service, Azure. \nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. \nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's ( AMZN.O ) Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp ( LNKD.N ) co-founder Reid Hoffman. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. \nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp ( NVDA.O ) graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. ( bit.ly/2gdxifR ) \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "(BigStock image.) Microsoft’s Azure will be the preferred public-cloud service for running experiments at OpenAI, the $1-billion non-profit initiative from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Y Combinator President Sam Altman and others to accelerate AI research, Microsoft said in a blog post today. The idea behind OpenAI is to share AI advances equally and publicly, rather than having them accrue to any one company.\n“Azure has impressed us by building hardware configurations optimized for deep learning,” Altman said in OpenAI’s blog post . “In the coming months, we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machine, to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train.” He said more and faster computers are essential to AI technologies such as reinforcement learning and a major OpenAI research focus: generative models , a branch of unsupervised machine learning.\nAltman specifically cited the value of Azure’s K80 GPUs – graphical processing unit accelerators from NVIDIA Tesla that are claimed to outperform CPUs in high-performance computing applications by a factor of up to 10. And he said OpenAI is pleased that Microsoft envisions bringing NVIDIA’s advanced Pascal GPU-based architecture to Azure.\nHarry Shum, Microsoft AI and Research Group executive vice president (left), and Sam Altman, co-chair of OpenAI. (Photo by Brian Smale/Microsoft) The deal gives Microsoft increased access to OpenAI’s robotics and experts, potentially helping it become a better provider for AI services to its customers. Microsoft may also collaborate on some projects within OpenAI.\n“We’re exploring a couple of specific projects” for collaboration, Altman said. “I’m assuming something will happen there.”\nPart of the idea behind OpenAI’s inception last year was to counter Musk’s stated fear that AI is the “biggest existential threat” to humanity. It is sponsored by Altman, Musk, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, early PayPal board member Reid Hoffman, Y Combinator founding partner Jessica Livingston, and CTO and co-founder Greg Brockman.\nIn a related development, Microsoft and NVIDIA said that starting next month they’ll offer NVIDIA’s GPUs and Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit for AI applications in Azure or on premises. “Every company around the world can now tap the power of AI,” Microsoft said in its blog post.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella announced in September that the company is forming a new 5,000-person engineering and research team to infuse AI into all of its products and everything it does across hardware and software, and to accelerate the path from research into products.\n“Thanks to cloud computing power, more advanced algorithms and the availability of massive amounts of data, the AI field has exploded,” wrote Harry Shum, executive VP for Microsoft’s AI and research group. That progress is “allowing computer scientists to create technology many of us only dreamed about just a few years ago,” he said.\nMicrosoft also said it’s introducing the Azure Bot Service, a cloud service that lets companies and developers store and run bots in Azure. And, as part of a big news blast before online developer conference Connect starts tomorrow, Microsoft announced the general availability of Azure Functions. That service is roughly equivalent to Amazon Web Services’ Lambda, which executes code upon the occurrence of specified conditions.",

      "text": "Security Firms Allege Microsoft as Anti-competitive By Kevin Townsend on November 15, 2016 Tweet Kaspersky Lab Accuses Microsoft of Aggressive Attitude Towards Endpoint Security Firms With Windows 10 \nOn Thursday November 10, the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) announced that it was investigating Microsoft following a complaint from endpoint security firm Kaspersky Lab. On the same day Kaspersky Lab Chairman and CEO, Eugene Kaspersky, published a hard-hitting explanation in the form of a blog post. Kaspersky Lab believes Microsoft is abusing its dominant position to squeeze third party vendors with competitive offerings out of the Windows 10 ecosystem – and in particular, to force users to switch to Microsoft's own Defender anti-virus product. The Complaint Individual consumers and privacy activists will not be surprised. They have long complained about the high-handed Windows updates coming from Redmond. This, however, is the first time that a major world business firm has both publicly complained and actively sought redress. In his blog post, Kaspersky makes it clear that he does not believe that Microsoft is limiting this approach to security and security products. He quotes gaming as another target. In March 2016, Tim Sweeney (founder of Epic Games) wrote in The Guardian , \"Microsoft has built a closed platform-within-a-platform into Windows 10, as the first apparent step towards locking down the consumer PC ecosystem and monopolizing app distribution and commerce... They're curtailing users' freedom to install full-featured PC software, and subverting the rights of developers and publishers to maintain a direct relationship with their customers.\" Kaspersky believes that Microsoft is taking a similarly aggressive attitude towards endpoint security firms. In a separate statement, Kaspersky Labs gave two examples. Firstly, when a user migrates to Windows 10, if the current AV software is not specifically compatible with W10 it is arbitrarily removed without notice; and Microsoft Defender is switched on by default. Secondly, the two months warning that Microsoft once gave to security vendors before a new build of Windows 7 or 8 has been reduced to a few days for Windows 10. \"Several days,\" says the statement, \"are not enough for developers to modify security solutions properly, to make them compatible and effective against all types of cyber threats from the day of release, leaving users without the level of protection they have chosen and paid for.\" Note that two weeks ago Microsoft complained that Google researchers had only given it seven days to prepare a patch against an active threat. Kaspersky has also announced that it will make a similar complaint against Microsoft to the European Commission, and is \"currently preparing the application.\" For its part, Microsoft does not appear to be conciliatory. In an emailed statement to SecurityWeek , it simply said, \"Microsoft Russia and Kaspersky Lab has a long history of cooperation in different areas. Microsoft is committed to work in full compliance with Russian law. The company hasn't received an official notification from FAS. As soon as we get it, we will review it carefully.\" There is no suggestion of Microsoft trying to reconcile differences with Kaspersky before hearing from FAS. Noticeable by its absence is any immediate indication that Kaspersky will take similar action in the US. This could leave it open to accusations of geopolitical bias. Indeed, this is suggested by Carl Gottlieb, CTO at Cognition (a next-gen endpoint security reseller): \"I doubt many vendors will support Kaspersky in this 'crusade',\" he told SecurityWeek . \"When it comes to selling AV to the mass market, the Windows platform is the only game in town, and vendors know that partnering with Microsoft is always a better business model than poking the bear. We can't rule out geopolitical involvement here either.\" Industry Support; and its Lack Nevertheless, there is already support among European endpoint security vendors. Luis Corrons, technical director at Panda Labs, commented, \"I do agree with him [Eugene Kaspersky]. So does Panda Security (Spain), and I am sure he won't be alone. I know that some other European vendors have the same concerns.\" There is also at least moral support from F-Secure (Finland). \"We agree with Kaspersky that Microsoft's current practice is not allowing the best protection for the end-customer,\" its CTO Mika Stahlberg told SecurityWeek . \"Any operating system vendor needs to carefully balance its own against its customers' interest. Free and open competition is essential to provide users the innovation necessary to face the escalating threats we encounter in this connected world.\" Avira (Germany) also shares Kaspersky's concerns. \"Eugene is right to be upset,\" CEO Travis Witteveen told SecurityWeek in an emailed statement. \"Microsoft is making significant changes within the security, specifically antimalware, setup. We are in active dialogue with Microsoft, as not all changes, as well as upcoming changes, are considered as beneficial for the user. We are glad they are investing effort, but have warned them about abusing their position.\" \"Similar to the upgrade to Windows 10 and the unauthorized users default browser settings change to Edge,\" he added, \"we expect consent be required before changes are made. Currently we are in active talks and have not decided to take a legal route. Our goal is to preserve user choice and ensure the best user experience and security possible.\" SecurityWeek also reached out to more than a dozen US-based endpoint security vendors. Not one had a spokesperson available or willing to comment. This is perhaps unsurprising since there is currently no planned or threatened legal action against Microsoft in the US; and a 'wait and watch' strategy makes sense. The only comment from North America came from Canada-based malware researcher, educator and author Rob Slade. He is no fan of Windows 10 and its intrusive behavior, and has written several critical articles. \"Win 10 is a disaster in many ways,\" he told SecurityWeek . \"I've written about the network problems as well as the updates. Win 10 has turned off my main backup... Interestingly, Win 10 did not turn off the AV that I currently have under test.\" But, he added, \"I agree that MS is getting really high-handed about what they will let you do with your machine; and I'm this close to switching to Linux.\" Some Legal Views Moral support, however, is not the same as legal support. Two US lawyers approached by SecurityWeek have concerns over whether any such action would succeed in the US. Mitzi Hill, a technology law specialist with Taylor English Duma, pointed out that the US is moving \"from an eight-year Democratic presidency, which generally showed a desire to rein in business excesses, to a new Administration.\" That's not to say that Microsoft is without critics. \"Various forces in the US are going after this under different theories: advertising opt-in, forced upgrade, etc. I would imagine that privacy rather than anti-competition is a better bet for the current business and political climate.\" This has already happened in Europe, with the French data protection regulator (CNIL) serving notice on Microsoft over its 'excessive' collection of user data. David Willson, an Attorney with considerable security expertise, believes that if anything was going to happen in the US, it would have already done so. The FCC, he said, \"has been very heavy-handed lately with companies regarding security under the banner of consumer protection.\" He added, \"I would suspect if they were going to go after MS they would have.\" But he does have a warning for Microsoft. \"If MS forces only their security on all users, then when that security fails or is substandard and users suffer breaches, they have no one else to point the finger at.\" There is more support for Kaspersky's position from UK lawyer Dr. Brian Bandey, a Doctor of Law specializing in international technology matters. He points out that competition law is mostly about prohibiting agreements or practices that restrict free trading and competition between business. \"I believe that is the thrust of Eugene Kaspersky's argument,\" he told SecurityWeek ; \"especially where Microsoft (as he alleges) restricts connectivity information to 3rd party Anti-Virus suppliers and includes an almost (perhaps de facto) covert programming method of disabling installed third party software.\" He adds, \"I also speculate whether Microsoft is involving itself in some form of misrepresentation to its licensees. Most licensees (you and I) would not (I suggest) have a legitimate expectation that the operating system would seek out competing product, disable it and then activate its own competing product.\" What Next? From a legal point of view, the devil is in the detail of the various competition laws. Microsoft has been here before and probably knows what to expect. After an eight year Democratic administration, it would not have been unreasonable for Microsoft to make its long term plans on the assumption of a business-friendly Republican administration next. Kaspersky will also have considered its steps carefully. It won't be by chance that the Russian FAS was the first step. Certainly the FAS will be politically friendly towards Kaspersky; but more pertinently it is already taking action against other US giants. In August 2016 it fined Google $6.75 million for abusing its dominant market position, and also started action against Apple for allegedly fixing the retail prices for iPhones in Russia. Europe will be the big one. While the European Commission is friendly towards Microsoft, European laws are strong and rigorously upheld by the independent court of justice. Europe is slow, and this could drag on for many years. But if Kaspersky were to prevail over Microsoft in Europe, then action in the US – if still felt necessary – would undoubtedly follow.",

      "text": "Nov 15 (Reuters) - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's flagship cloud service, Azure.\nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies.\nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp co-founder Reid Hoffman.\nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December.\nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations.\n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. (http://bit.ly/2gdxifR)\nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities.\nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years.\nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.

      "title": "Microsoft May Be Transforming Itself Into The Next Apple",
      "text": "  11:46 AM EST Microsoft May Be Transforming Itself Into The Next Apple \nFrom Jon Markman : Microsoft Corporation ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) suddenly is about more than spreadsheets and stale PowerPoint presentations. It’s about making innovative products that drive narratives about the future of computing. \nThe company late last month held its Windows 10 Update event. Making software presentations interesting is a chore. So Microsoft decided to go to a place far away from its utilitarian roots. \nIt showed off hardware so cool you could imagine seeing the gear in an episode of the tech-trendy, sci-fi TV series Black Mirror . We’re talking sleek, futuristic and aimed at the hip, creative people Apple ( AAPL ) normally attracts. \nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio PC (shown below) is a gorgeous 28-inch all-in-one computer with a single hidden cord. \nThe most striking feature of the device is the massive high-resolution touch-screen monitor. Microsoft says the 4500 x 3000 screen will easily push its 13.5 million pixels thanks to a best-in-class Nvidia ( NVDA ) graphics unit, backed by Intel ( INTC ) core i5 or i7 chipsets and 32-gigs of RAM. But the real shocker is the slim 13-millimeter aluminum case and the adjustable arm that allows the unit to lie nearly flat for drawing. The Microsoft Surface Studio PC boasts features that rival the top-of-the-line Macs and that have Apple fans drooling. \nAnd because Microsoft is primarily a software company, it saved one new trick to leave tech observers slack-jawed: Surface Dial, a small, metal, puck-like device can be placed on the screen to manipulate the software in new ways. You can rotate the screen, select pen tips and colors for the stylus and much more. When the machine lies flat, it’s virtually like working on a drawing board. \nThis appeal to creative professionals might seem out of character for Microsoft. Its Microsoft Office productivity suite remains the first choice for corporations to create and manage documents. That strength has carried into the cloud. Despite a multiple-year head start for Google Docs, Office 365 has enjoyed rapid adoption. The suite added 900,000 subscribers in the most recent quarter reported October 20. \nThe Office lock-in is also helping Microsoft continue to build out its hybrid and public cloud businesses, which are led by Azure. And while Azure still runs a distant second to Amazon Web Services overall, sales and profit margins are soaring despite continued massive investment in infrastructure. In the first quarter, Azure had a profit margin of 49% on sales of $6.32 billion. \nAnd it is worth noting that Azure is becoming a major player in fast-growing business concentrations like Blockchain and the Internet of Things . \nIn a research note, Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson wrote: “We view Microsoft’s public cloud offering Azure as a multifaceted service that not only provides substantial growth opportunities, but also serves as a natural hedge against potential declines in other aspects of its business.” \nMicrosoft has a reputation for building utilitarian software products your boss makes you use to get work done. The Surface Studio is certainly not that. It’s something traditional Apple customers will want to buy. That’s a good narrative for a company best known for spreadsheets. \nMicrosoft shares were down as much as 10% for the year in mid-summer but are now up 9%. They are just emerging from a 16-year trough, so they are rested and ready for their next leg higher. \nThis article is brought to you courtesy of Money and Markets .

      "text": "Equal Access International Wins 2016 Tech Award In The Microsoft Education Category Award celebrates the \"Best of the Best\" Tech Award Laureates Using Technology to Benefit Humanity   12:00   SAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Equal Access International, an innovative non-profit creating positive social change for millions of underserved people across the developing world, today announced it is the recipient of the 2016 Tech Award in the Microsoft Education Category. The award recognizes Equal Access for its dramatic expansion and significant global impact since first being named a laureate in 2003. Equal Access will receive a $50,000 cash award at the Tech Awards Gala on November 17 to further its programs which reach more than 137 million people in 21 languages in nine countries across Asia and Africa . Since its inception in 2000, The Tech Awards, sponsored by Applied Materials, Inc., are considered the \"Oscars\" of Silicon Valley. To mark the award's fifteenth anniversary, former laureates were invited to compete again in their respective categories with the judging committee selecting the \"best of the best\" Tech Award laureates who continue to address the world's most challenging problems. \"This award means so much to our worldwide staff across Afghanistan , Burkina Faso , Cambodia , Cameroon , Chad , Nepal , Niger , Nigeria , and Pakistan , who leverage the power and reach of interactive media, innovative technology and community action to inspire the voices, stories, and movements driving positive change when our world needs it most,\" said Ronni Goldfarb , Equal Access President and CEO. \"We are thrilled to be recognized for our work.\" Dan'l Lewin, Corporate Vice President of Technology and Civic Engagement at Microsoft Corp, said, \"It is an honor to further recognize Equal Access International for its life-changing work, which has successfully scaled beyond the initial 2003 program launch in Nepal .

Overcoming barriers of illiteracy and poor infrastructure, Equal Access launched a pioneering educational satellite radio platform/distribution system providing original, locally-produced programming to low-cost receivers in remote villages for the very first time. Today, Equal Access has replicated this model, expanding impact across nine countries in Asia and Africa where they implement large-scale country programs in six inter-related areas ranging from Youth Life Skills, to Women's and Girls' Empowerment to Peacebuilding and Civic Engagement. Last year, more than 67 million people listened, viewed, participated and benefitted from Equal Access programming. And more than 102,000 people participated in community engagement activities. Over the years, Equal Access has continued to develop new, innovative platforms to reach beneficiaries in ways they prefer, including mobile and online platforms and TV programs delivered via satellite, YouTube and mobile apps. Additionally, Equal Access provides annual organization metrics that demonstrate continued global impact, found at http://www.equalaccess.org .

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nNVIDIA announced yesterday that they were collaborating with Microsoft to improve their upcoming Tesla server GPUs with an AI framework . Inspired by Microsoft Research’s strides towards deep learning and reaching human parity with speech recognition, NVIDIA will be optimizing enterprise AI framework to run on the Tesla GPUs for both the Microsoft Azure cloud and on-premises servers. \n“We’re working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world’s most pressing problems,” said Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft. “By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we’ve made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.” \nThe toolkit mentioned is the open source and commercial grade Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit used for Skype, Cortana, Bing, and Xbox. It trains and adjusts algorithms to scale according to the input discovered, making GPUs more efficient with a hybrid cloud platform. In fact, according to the press release, the GPU-accelerated toolkit was over 170 times faster on NVidia GPUs than it was with former the former CPUs. Which isn’t surprising given the thousands of cores in GPUs processing unilaterally. \nMicrosoft and NVIDA are both looking to improve enterprise and industry across many fields with these deep learning GPUs. One step further, the “world’s first supercomputer in a box” built specifically for using AI and deep learning is now available. The NVIDIA DGX-1 just might revolutionize data server processing for enterprises thanks to the collaboration. In this story stream:",

Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 8:08 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft's continued investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is paying dividends. The company has partnered with OpenAI, a non-profit company founded earlier this year to advance the field of machine intelligence for the benefit of humanity. \nAs part of the deal, announced Tuesday, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud provider, an important win for Microsoft as it competes with the likes of Amazon, Google, and IBM to power the next generation of intelligent applications. OpenAI is backed by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, controversial investor Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Y Combinator Partner Jessica Livingston. \nOn top of that, Microsoft also launched a set of cloud services all aimed at furthering intelligent applications. The new Azure Bot Service makes it easier for people to spin up intelligent chat bots in Microsoft's cloud, while Azure Functions lets customers run compute functions without provisioning servers. The company also announced the general availability of its N-series virtual machines, which give customers the ability to use GPUs for high-performance computing tasks. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nMicrosoft has been working to position its cloud as the home for intelligent applications, and these announcements demonstrate further momentum toward that goal. \nThe N-series virtual machines made generally available Tuesday are an important part of that. They provide users with the ability to run high-performance workloads in the cloud that require the power of GPUs to handle massive parallel computing tasks. It's a service that OpenAI has already been taking advantage of, along with other customers like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures. \nFor companies that want a pre-built service, the Azure Bot Service provides users with a number of templates that they can use to get started building intelligent, conversational assistants. It's built to easily plug into other Azure services, like Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which helps computer programs parse human language. \nOne of the other key services included in Microsoft's news dump Tuesday is Azure Functions, which lets customers set up a snippet of code that runs whenever a set of conditions is met. Microsoft handles all the provisioning of compute resources necessary to run the Functions, so users don't have to worry about running a virtual machine all the time to handle irregular events. \nMaking Azure Functions generally available is important to Microsoft's ongoing competition with Amazon Web Services. The other Seattle-area cloud provider launched its AWS Lambda service N years ago, and it has proven a popular tool for leveraging the power of what people have begun calling \"serverless\" computing.

      "text": "Share View photos Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk attends a forum on startups in Hong Kong, China January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo More (Reuters) - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's (TSLA.O) Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) flagship cloud service, Azure. OpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. Musk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N) co-founder Reid Hoffman. OpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. These cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. ( http://bit.ly/2gdxifR ) The non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. The investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. OpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.

      "text": "Tweet by Al McCarthy on November 15, 2016 \nHow much will Microsoft’s new Xbox Scorpio cost when it’s released? Well, nobody knows at this point, but according to Phil Spencer it’s going to cost more than an Xbox One S. In a recent video interview with Levelup, Spencer revealed a few new details about the Xbox Scorpio price. \n“Scorpio will be a premium console, it will cost more than S, obviously that’s how we’re building it,” the Xbox exec explains. “I want to make sure that the investments that we’re putting into the product of Scorpio meets the demands of the higher end customer and that will be a higher price.” \nScorpio is for a more demanding, high-end customer, says Spencer \nThe Xbox Scorpio price hasn’t been determined yet, but that hasn’t stopped analysts from weighing in on what they think it should cost. Michael Pachter recently said in an interview that the Xbox Scorpio needed to launch at a $399 price point. If the Scorpio launched above $399, Pachter believes Microsoft would be ‘committing suicide’ with the new hardware. \nIt doesn’t sound like Spencer agrees with Pachter. “For us, when we think about Scorpio it’s for a higher end customer who demands the most that they can get out of a console and we built a console to meet that demand.” \nFor those that keep up with costs associated with achieving the highest visual fidelity in gaming, it’s common knowledge that you simply can’t put together a machine for $399 that does 4K gaming at high frame rates. The questions that remain to be answered are just how high end will the Scorpio be, and how much does Microsoft think consumers are willing to spend? For now, we know that it will certainly be more than the Xbox One S and likely more than $399 if they plan to make good on their promises from E3. \nFor those that don’t want to spend the money, there are other options. \n“Our most affordable console will be the S console,” says Spencer. “We make sure that we’re building that console and putting the features in that console to make it as enjoyable and as desirable to as many people as possible at the price.” \nWhile the Xbox Scorpio price has yet to be determined, the release date for the new Xbox console is slated for sometime in 2017.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft releases preview of its Azure cloud bot-as-a-service Microsoft is making a preview available of its Azure cloud bot-as-a-service, which is built on top of Azure Functions serverless compute capability. | Topic: Artificial Intelligence \nMicrosoft is making available a preview of a new Azure service meant to hasten the development of bots using the Microsoft Bot Framework. \nMicrosoft announced the Azure Bot Service preview on November 15. The service is built on Azure Functions, its serverless compute service , which allows bots to scale on demand. Microsoft's alternative to Amazon's Lambda, Azure Functions, is generally available as of today, November 15 . \nThe Azure Bot Service will enable developers to \"build, connect, deploy and manage intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking - from your app or website to text/sms, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Teams, Kik, Office 365 mail and other popular services,\" said officials in a blog post. Artificial intelligence Read More \nThe service will allow devs to build intelligent bots using Microsoft's Cognitive Services, which are integrated directly into an integrated developer experience built for bot development. The development environment includes out-of-the-box templates that let developers build bots in C# or Node.js directly in the browser, or use an IDE and code editor of their choice. \nMicrosoft took the wraps off its Bot Framework at the Build conference earlier this year. The Framework consists of three pieces: Bot Builder software development kit (hosted on GitHub) for those interested in building bots using C# or Node.js; the Bot Connector for registering, connecting, publishing, and managing bots to text/SMS, Office 365 mail, Skype, Slack, Telegram, Kik, and more; and a Bot Directory of bots developed with the Bot Framework. \nDevelopers can try out the Azure Bot Service preview starting today. \nMicrosoft also announced today that OpenAI has chosen Azure as its \"preferred cloud platform.\" OpenAI is a nonprofit research organization founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever to further advances in artificial intelligence. \nIn other AI-related news, Microsoft officials also said that the Azure N-series of virtual machines, which are the ones designed for the most compute-intensive workloads, including deep learning, simulations, renderings, and training of neural networks, will be generally available starting in December 2016.

      "text": "Email Microsoft GPU-Accelerated Virtual Machines in the Cloud Go Public \nFour months after Microsoft’s preview of its Azure N-Series virtual machines in the cloud attracted thousands of customers, the GPU-accelerated machines will now be generally available to a wider segment of customers . \nCompanies in the south-central U.S., eastern U.S., Western Europe and Southeast Asia will gain access to the cutting-edge N-Series virtual machines in December. The rollout is part of an ongoing collaboration by Microsoft and NVIDIA that aims to help companies everywhere benefit from advances in AI and machine learning. \nThe N-Series machines that are designed for computationally intensive tasks (known as the NC-Series) use our Tesla K80 GPUs and CUDA to run applications like deep learning , real-time data analytics, high performance computing simulation and DNA sequencing. \nSo far, the accelerated virtual machines with GPUs in the cloud have garnered rave reviews from customers who tried the technology during the preview, Microsoft said. For many, the GPU-accelerated performance was a game-changer. GPUs Speed Deep Learning Financial Analysis \nOne satisfied customer is Noonum , a startup that uses deep neural networks to bring the kind of sophisticated financial analysis used by hedge funds and large investment firms to smaller institutional investors and investment advisors. The virtual machines use our Tesla K80 GPUs and CUDA for compute-intensive tasks. \n“Azure’s GPUs have been a boon for our data pipeline,” said Shankar Vaidyanathan, Noonum’s founder and CEO. \nWhen the market closes each day, Noonum downloads data on several hundred economic indicators and feeds it into its deep neural networks to analyze and forecast the impact of the data on all of the S&P 500 stocks. \n“These neural networks need to be trained on new data before our customers wake up the next morning on the East Coast, and Azure’s GPU options help make that possible,” Vaidyanathan said. Using the N-Series virtual machines with NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs, the company cut its training time in half and could ensure its predictions are on time for customers. GPUs for Real-Time Radio Search \nAnother preview customer, AudioBurst , is making it possible to search, share and integrate audio clips from broadcast media such as radio and online video. It does this by using natural language understanding and a compute-intensive process called Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to create live transcriptions of speech so it can be indexed. \n“On a non-GPU server, you can manage to run a single stream of live ASR transcription,” said Gal Klein, the company’s co-founder and chief technology officer. \nBefore switching to the N-Series virtual machines in the Azure cloud, AudioBurst was able to transcribe eight live radio feeds concurrently. After moving to the Tesla K80s on Azure, the company was able to transcribe four times as many feeds. \n“For a company like AudioBurst, the ability to digest as many concurrent live radio feeds as possible is crucial,” Klein said. “This gives us the capability to let users search and access radio content a minute after it was aired.”",

      "text": "By Karen Graham 8 mins ago in Business Microsoft announced on Monday two new contracts for 237 megawatts of wind energy capacity, capable of running its Cheyenne, Wyoming data center entirely on wind power. The windows-maker has made its largest purchase ever of wind energy, writes Beta News , standing by its commitment to use less fossil fuels and reduce its carbon footprint, bringing the company's U.S. wind energy projects to 500 megawatts, Brad Smith, the president and chief legal officer at Microsoft says that the latest deal brings the company one step closer to building a \"responsible cloud.\" Smith also points out the wind energy deal will make it more affordable for cities and states to switch to clean energy, and part of the plan involves Microsoft hooking up the backup generators at the data center to the local grid. On Monday, Smith said in his blog post , \"We announced earlier this year that roughly 44 percent of the electricity consumed by Microsoft's data centers comes from wind, solar and hydropower, and we committed to raising this to 50 percent by 2018 and to 60 percent by early in the next decade.\" Microsoft contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to support the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas. The remaining 59 megawatts will come from a partnership with Black Hills, with the energy coming from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \"Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace\", says Microsoft, according to Beta News . ZD Net points out that Google has used a similar arrangement to fund development of new wind farms in the south of Norway by agreeing to purchase their total output for 12 years. One 160-watt capacity wind farm is expected to be operational by late 2017. This will offer Google's European data centers access to more renewable energy.",

      "text": " Equal Access International\nAward celebrates the \"Best of the Best\" Tech Award Laureates Using Technology to Benefit Humanity\nSAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Equal Access International, an innovative non-profit creating positive social change for millions of underserved people across the developing world, today announced it is the recipient of the 2016 Tech Award in the Microsoft Education Category. The award recognizes Equal Access for its dramatic expansion and significant global impact since first being named a laureate in 2003. Equal Access will receive a $50,000 cash award at the Tech Awards Gala on November 17 to further its programs which reach more than 137 million people in 21 languages in nine countries across Asia and Africa .\nSince its inception in 2000, The Tech Awards, sponsored by Applied Materials, Inc., are considered the \"Oscars\" of Silicon Valley. To mark the award's fifteenth anniversary, former laureates were invited to compete again in their respective categories with the judging committee selecting the \"best of the best\" Tech Award laureates who continue to address the world's most challenging problems.\n\"This award means so much to our worldwide staff across Afghanistan , Burkina Faso , Cambodia , Cameroon , Chad , Nepal , Niger , Nigeria , and Pakistan , who leverage the power and reach of interactive media, innovative technology and community action to inspire the voices, stories, and movements driving positive change when our world needs it most,\" said Ronni Goldfarb , Equal Access President and CEO. \"We are thrilled to be recognized for our work.\"\nDan'l Lewin, Corporate Vice President of Technology and Civic Engagement at Microsoft Corp, said, \"It is an honor to further recognize Equal Access International for its life-changing work, which has successfully scaled beyond the initial 2003 program launch in Nepal . It has provided the ideal mix of innovative communications technology and direct community engagement to produce lasting education and social change that is beyond impressive.\"\nEqual Access Programs and Impact Areas\nEqual Access previously won the 2003 Tech Award in Education for providing life-changing education on women's and girls' empowerment and HIV/AIDS prevention to 10,400 Nepalese living in remote and marginalized regions of the country. Overcoming barriers of illiteracy and poor infrastructure, Equal Access launched a pioneering educational satellite radio platform/distribution system providing original, locally-produced programming to low-cost receivers in remote villages for the very first time. Today, Equal Access has replicated this model, expanding impact across nine countries in Asia and Africa where they implement large-scale country programs in six inter-related areas ranging from Youth Life Skills, to Women's and Girls' Empowerment to Peacebuilding and Civic Engagement.\nLast year, more than 67 million people listened, viewed, participated and benefitted from Equal Access programming. And more than 102,000 people participated in community engagement activities.\nOver the years, Equal Access has continued to develop new, innovative platforms to reach beneficiaries in ways they prefer, including mobile and online platforms and TV programs delivered via satellite, YouTube and mobile apps. Additionally, Equal Access provides annual organization metrics that demonstrate continued global impact, found at http://www.equalaccess.org .\nAbout Equal Access International\nFounded in 2000, Equal Access (EA) is an international non-profit organization dedicated to creating positive social change for millions of underserved people across the developing world by providing critically needed information and education.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \n'Tis the season for savings, and many companies have already announced their plans to offer big discounts on some of their products in the annual Black Friday shopping extravaganza. Among them is Microsoft, which has promised to sell its Xbox One S from $249, along with savings of up to $430 on some of its Surface devices . \nBut if you just can't wait for the Black Friday sales to arrive, you might be interested in discounts currently available on the Surface Book. 256GB SSD / 8GB RAM / dGPU | normally $2,099 | now $1,899 512GB SSD / 16GB RAM / dGPU | normally $2,699 | now $2,499 1TB SSD / 16GB RAM / dGPU | normally $3,199 | now $2,999 \nThe $200 discount on these models will remain available until November 19. If your budget is a bit tighter, or if a Core i7 processor is overkill for your needs, you might want to wait for Microsoft's Black Friday sale, when you'll be able to pick up a Surface Book with Core i5 for as little as $1,249.",

      "text": "Publicly traded customer relationship management (CRM) software company Salesforce is today talking up new artificial intelligence (AI) research that’s been conducted by the Salesforce Research division the company formally announced in September , following the MetaMind acquisition .\nMetaMind’s team was skilled in a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which involves training artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make inferences about new data. The new Salesforce Research division, headed up by former MetaMind cofounder and chief executive Richard Socher, does research in an academic context, and over time its learnings can lead to Salesforce product improvements. Salesforce competitors like Microsoft also operate units that regularly publish academic research.\nBut today the news is about new research. Salesforce Research has developed a neural network called a dynamic coattention network, which can answer questions about text, thanks to a coattentive encoder and a dynamic decoder. “The DCN interprets documents based on specific questions, builds a conditional representation of the document for each different question asked, iteratively hypothesizes multiple answers, and weeds out initial incorrect predictions. In the end it arrives at the most accurate and intuitive answers,” Socher wrote in a Medium post .\nQuestion answering is an established domain and an area of ongoing research for other major technology companies, such as Facebook . Salesforce tested out the dynamic coattention network’s performance on on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) , and it came out ahead of systems from Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Research Asia, Google, and IBM.\n“The Dynamic Coattention Network is the first model to break the 80 percent F1 mark, taking machines one step closer to the human-level performance of 91.2 percent F1 on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset,” Salesforce research scientists Victor Zhong and Caiming Xiong wrote in a blog post . (The full paper is here .)\nAbove: An illustration of the dynamic coattention network.\nImage Credit: Screenshot In addition, Salesforce Research has thought up an alternative to the longstanding long short-term memory (LSTM) type of recurrent neural network (RNN) called a quasi-recurrent neural network, or QRNN. The advantage is that it’s possible to process all of a given text at once, in parallel, rather than one word at a time, which means you can do it more quickly, as research scientist James Bradbury explains in a blog post . The team applied the QRNN to sentiment analysis, translation, and predicting the next word in text, and overall it performed better than an LSTM RNN. (Paper here .)\nSalesforce Research has also built a model that can be likened to a Swiss Army knife: It can handle dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, semantic relatedness, syntactic chunking, and textual entailment. “These results are notable because many of the previous models were designed to handle single or a few related tasks to achieve the best results only for the limited number of the tasks,” former Salesforce Research intern Kazuma Hashimoto wrote in a blog post .

      "text": "  Download Current Issue \nThe state of identity technology on the internet is cause for concern, says Kim Cameron, architect of identity at Microsoft. \n“We have inherited an identity infrastructure that is a hodge-podge of ad-hoc responses by people who did not understand the threats,” he told the Eema ISSE 2016 security conference in Paris.   Your exclusive guide to CIO trends \nA collection of our most popular articles for IT leaders from the first few months of 2016, including: - Corporate giants recruit digitally-minded outsiders to drive transformation - Analytics platforms to drive strategy in 2016 - Next generation: The changing role of IT leaders.   \n“We have to deal with a conjunction of amateurism and increasingly sophisticated threats – not from college kids, but from PhD graduates working in criminal organisations and nation states,” he said. \nBut the good news, said Cameron, is that most company leaders are beginning to understand the need to improve this state of affairs to avoid legal liability and damage to company reputations. \n“Legislation is also starting to be introduced, and this is a good thing because the internet has been an unsupervised playground that needs to be regulated,” he said. \nThe other positive development is the availability of cloud-based infrastructure that can be harnessed to take care of online identity infrastructure problems, he added. \nAccording to Cameron, Microsoft is working to use cloud-based technologies to “democratise” the availability of affordable, high-availability identity infrastructure. \n“The withering away of the enterprise domain boundary [with the advent of the internet] means identity technology must evolve from an app-to-domain federation model to an app-to-world federation model,” he said. \nThe loss of the domain-era single truth means is allowing people to take advantage of a variety of identity providers, said Cameron.

      "text": "It looks like chatbots will be taking center stage at Microsoft Corp.’s upcoming Connect() developer conference in New York this week.\nHarry Shum, the head of the company’s artificial intelligence group, laid the groundwork for the event today by announcing a new cloud tool designed to speed up the creation of virtual agents. The Azure Bot Service, as it’s called, offers a hosted implementation of the Microsoft Bot Framework that the software giant released at its Build conference back in March. Shum claims that the open-source toolkit has since been adopted by more than 50,000 developers around the world.\nThose users will now be able to run their chatbots in a managed environment that doesn’t require any maintenance and includes an array of features for streamlining the application lifecycle.\nWhen a developer launches a new project in the Azure Bot Service, they can choose between starting out with a clean slate or using one of four templates that Microsoft has helpfully built into the platform. These blueprints are available alongside a native code editor that the company says was specifically designed with artificial intelligence applications in mind. It currently only supports C# and Node.js on launch, but the software giant will no doubt add more languages over time as it works to expand the appeal of the service.\nSoftware teams with more advanced requirements, meanwhile, can connect the Azure Bot Service to their external code editor and source control system of choice. Microsoft also provides integration with its Azure Cognitive Services to let users quickly incorporate advanced machine learning features such as voice recognition into their chatbots. The company says that agents created using its tool can be deployed to Slack, Skype, Office 365 and numerous other popular platforms.\nThe introduction of Azure Bot Service adds Microsoft’s name to a growing list tech companies that are working to capitalize on the rapid rise of conversational artificial intelligence. Previously, Google acquired a startup called API.AI Inc. to develop its own chatbot development platform. And Oracle Corp. introduced a competing cloud-based tool a few weeks earlier that enables business workers to create virtual agents using drag-and-drop commands.\nMicrosoft is relying on Azure Cognitive Services and the other advanced features in its public cloud to stand out from the pack. This strategy already appears to be yielding fruit: The company announced this morning that it has landed a landmark infrastructure deal with OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research group backed by the likes of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. The firm is using Microsoft’s recently introduced N-Series instances to power its experimental neural networks.\nImage via Pixabay ",

      "title": "Microsoft adds two more games to Xbox One Backward Compatibility",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nToday is Tuesday, which means that Microsoft added two more games to the Xbox One Backward Compatibility list, including Dead Space Ignition and Escape Dead Island . The news comes just three days after the feature turned one-year-old, with the company announcing that there are now over 280 backward compatible games. \nDead Space Ignition ($4.99) \nFree download with pre-order of Dead Space 2 from participating retailers.* Dead Space 2 unlocks activated after completion of first hack and game save in Dead Space Ignition. In Dead Space Ignition you must survive the initial Necromorph outbreak on The Sprawl. The game blends a comic presentation with three unique hacking games. You’ll receive unlocks in Dead Space 2 including an exclusive suit. Can you survive the events leading up to Dead Space 2? *Free download requires prior reservation and unique redemption code from participating retailers. Dead Space Ignition is also available for purchase without the pre-order of Dead Space 2. \nEscape Dead Island ($19.99) \nEscape Dead Island is a Survival-Mystery adventure that follows Cliff Calo, who sets sail to document the unexplained events on Banoi. Arriving on the island of Narapela, he finds that not everything is as it seems. This title lets players delve into the Dead Island universe and unravel the origins of the zombie outbreak. Escape is just the beginning. \nWhile backward compatible games are a great way to get \"new\" content on the cheap, don't forget about Games with Gold, which allows Xbox Live Gold members to grab four (two Xbox One and two backward compatible Xbox 360) free games per month, as long as you claim them within the specified dates. \nIt's also November 15, which means that it's your last day to grab The Escapists (Xbox One) - which was among last month's offers - and Monkey Island: SE (Xbox 360), which is among this month's titles . You can also get Super Dungeon Bros (Xbox One) until the end of the month, and beginning tomorrow, you'll be able to claim Murdered: Soul Suspect (Xbox One) and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon (Xbox 360).

Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 8:08 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft's continued investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning technology is paying dividends. The company has partnered with OpenAI, a non-profit company founded earlier this year to advance the field of machine intelligence for the benefit of humanity. \nAs part of the deal, announced Tuesday, OpenAI will use Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud provider, an important win for Microsoft as it competes with the likes of Amazon, Google, and IBM to power the next generation of intelligent applications. OpenAI is backed by the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, controversial investor Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Y Combinator Partner Jessica Livingston. \nOn top of that, Microsoft also launched a set of cloud services all aimed at furthering intelligent applications. The new Azure Bot Service makes it easier for people to spin up intelligent chat bots in Microsoft's cloud, while Azure Functions lets customers run compute functions without provisioning servers. The company also announced the general availability of its N-series virtual machines, which give customers the ability to use GPUs for high-performance computing tasks. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 10 Most Powerful IaaS Companies \nMicrosoft has been working to position its cloud as the home for intelligent applications, and these announcements demonstrate further momentum toward that goal. \nThe N-series virtual machines made generally available Tuesday are an important part of that. They provide users with the ability to run high-performance workloads in the cloud that require the power of GPUs to handle massive parallel computing tasks. It's a service that OpenAI has already been taking advantage of, along with other customers like Esri and Jellyfish Pictures. \nFor companies that want a pre-built service, the Azure Bot Service provides users with a number of templates that they can use to get started building intelligent, conversational assistants. It's built to easily plug into other Azure services, like Microsoft's Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS), which helps computer programs parse human language. \nOne of the other key services included in Microsoft's news dump Tuesday is Azure Functions, which lets customers set up a snippet of code that runs whenever a set of conditions is met. Microsoft handles all the provisioning of compute resources necessary to run the Functions, so users don't have to worry about running a virtual machine all the time to handle irregular events. \nMaking Azure Functions generally available is important to Microsoft's ongoing competition with Amazon Web Services. The other Seattle-area cloud provider launched its AWS Lambda service N years ago, and it has proven a popular tool for leveraging the power of what people have begun calling \"serverless\" computing.

      "text": "Microsoft and Code.org announce free Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial for Computer Science Education Week, Dec. 5-11 With 30 million trials of last year's Hour of Code tutorial, Microsoft and Code.org believe the new offering will again introduce tens of millions to coding for the first time; Microsoft Stores to also host coding workshops worldwide during Computer Science Education Week. Canada NewsWire\nREDMOND, Wash., Nov. 15, 2016\nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 15, 2016 /CNW/ -- Microsoft Corp. and Code.org on Tuesday unveiled the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer, a coding tutorial for students and educators created for Hour of Code , an annual, global campaign held during Computer Science Education Week, Dec. 5 – 11. The new web-based tutorial — available for free at http://code.org/minecraft — enables beginner coders to create and share their own simple \"Minecraft\" game, and is designed to empower anyone to begin learning the problem-solving and critical thinking skills required in today's tech-fueled world.\nCreated by \"Minecraft\" game designers at Mojang and Microsoft, in partnership with Code.org, the fun and easy-to-learn one-hour experience builds on the success of last year's record-breaking \"Minecraft\" tutorial, which reached more than 30 million students worldwide. With the goal of inspiring millions more to try coding for the first time — and to keep going on their journey of learning computer science — as of today's launch, the tutorial is available in 10 languages, including Spanish. It is scheduled to be available in 50 languages by Dec. 5 .\nWith the immense popularity of \"Minecraft\" around the world, Microsoft and Code.org believe the tutorial has the potential to reach people of all ages and likeness. Women and girls already compose nearly half of the game's global fan base. The tutorial also underscores Microsoft's commitment to ensuring all young people have the opportunity to learn computer science, an economic and social imperative in this era of digital transformation, which is expected to generate 1.4 million computing jobs in the U.S. alone by 2020 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . In the U.S., 40 percent of schools do not teach computer science, and Microsoft aims to reach students most likely to be among those without access, particularly girls and minorities.\n\"We are partnering with Code.org again this year to make computer science more accessible to millions of youth around the world with 'Minecraft' and Hour of Code,\" said Satya Nadella , CEO, Microsoft. \"I am inspired by the 'Minecraft' generation who view themselves not as players of a game, but as creators of the new worlds they dream up. This is the generation that will imagine, build and create our future, and together we can equip them with the computational thinking and problem-solving skills to seize the opportunities ahead.\"\nDesigned for ages 6 and up, the Minecraft Hour of Code Designer teaches students to create their own \"Minecraft\" experience where they can program the rules. They can make chickens that drop gold, or zombies that run away instead of attacking. Along the way, students use Code.org's familiar drag-and-drop coding interface to learn computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, event handlers and repeat loops. Players face a series of 12 challenges, culminating in creating their own simple game, which they can share with friends.\n\"The 2016 Minecraft Hour of Code tutorial builds on the success of the original in a great way,\" said Mike Harvey , technology teacher from Falmouth, Maine . \"By programming familiar game events themselves, learners will be able to experience computer science in a way that is authentic as well as fun. The open-ended challenges help to show that our favorite games (like 'Minecraft') are ultimately created with code.\"\n\"Code.org was founded with the vision that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science — not only because it's foundational for any career, but because students love it,\" said Hadi Partovi , co-founder and CEO, Code.org. \"'Minecraft' is a special game that appeals to a diverse global community. We're delighted to have the chance to teach students coding with the fun familiarity of 'Minecraft,' to engage students of all backgrounds and skill levels.\"\nIn support of Code.org and the global Hour of Code campaign, Microsoft will also lead thousands of youth coding events in more than 60 countries. During Computer Science Education Week, this includes hundreds of free workshops hosted by Microsoft Stores across the globe. Students can reserve a spot in a store workshop by visiting microsoft.com/youthsparkprograms and also visit their local Microsoft Store to learn more.\nIn addition to the latest tutorial and coding events, Microsoft has also been receiving rave reviews from educators on the newly launched \"Minecraft: Education Edition\" title, a fully featured title that brings the magic of \"Minecraft\" to the classroom for more immersive, long- term lesson plans.\nAbout Code.org\nCode.org® is a 501c3 public non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. Its vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer programming. Code.org is the organizer of the annual Hour of Code campaign, which has engaged 10% of all K-12 students in the world, and the leading provider of curriculum for K-12 computer science in all of the largest school districts in the United States . Code.org is supported by philanthropic donations from corporations, foundations, and generous individuals, including Microsoft, Facebook, the Infosys Foundation, Google, Omidyar Network, Ballmer Family Giving, and others.\nAbout Microsoft\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\nFor more information about Code.org, visit https://www.Code.org .\nFor more information about Minecraft's use in education, visit http://education.minecraft.net .\nFor more information about Microsoft's commitment to ensuring access to computer science education for all youth, visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/philanthropies/youthspark .\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20000822/MSFTLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-and-codeorg-announce-free-minecraft-hour-of-code-tutorial-for-computer-science-education-week-dec-511-300362628.html\nSOURCE Microsoft Corp.\n ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft won't provide extended support for Office 2007 products beyond October 2017 deadline IT administrators take note: Microsoft's Office 2007/Exchange 2007 wave of client and server software is set to exit support in October 2017, and extended custom support agreements are going away. | Topic: Enterprise Software \nIt may seem like a long way away, but Microsoft's Office 2007 products are hitting their end of support dates in 2017. \nFor larger enterprise shops which, in the past, have been able to extend support a bit longer with a custom contract as part of their Premier status, there's a new wrinkle next year. Microsoft will not be offering this custom support extension as in the past. \nI heard about the no more custom support for Office 2007 on-premises client and server products from a reader and a Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed it -- attributing the change to growth in Office 365 subscriptions. \nHere's the statement acknowledging the change from a company spokesperson: \n\"The Office 2007 wave of products will be reaching end of support over the next 12 months, as per Microsoft Lifecycle Policy. After those end of support dates, we will no longer offer custom support on any version of Office products (Exchange Server; Office Suites; SharePoint Server; Office Communications Server; Lync Server; Skype for Business Server; Project Server and Visio). \n\"In the past we have offered custom support for a subset of Office products to customers with Premier support contracts. We have seen demand for custom support decline as more customers move to Office 365. Note that this change applies only to custom support, but does not impact any of the standard support offerings. \n\"As always, customers should consult with their account manager regarding their individual migration plans, and may consider services such as Software Assurance Deployment & Planning Services for on-premises upgrades, and Microsoft FastTrack for cloud migrations. \nExtended, free support for Microsoft Exchange 2007 with Service Pack 3 is set to end in April 2017. Support for Office 2007 with Service Pack 3 is slated to end next October. \nIn the on-premises Microsoft software world, mainstream support is the typically five-year period when Microsoft provides free patches and fixes, including but not limited to security updates, for its products. When a product exits the mainstream support phase, Microsoft continues to provide a period (also typically five years) of extended support, which means users get free security fixes but other types of updates are paid and require specific licensing deals. \n\"End of support\" means there will be no more fixes or patches -- paid or free, security or non-security -- coming for specific products. Up until now, Microsoft has allowed Premier support customers to get around this by paying for pricey custom support contracts, provided that they could show they had a specific plan to migrate to a newer version of a product. (See this example of Windows Server 2003 custom support agreements .) \nAlthough it's not mentioned in Microsoft's official statement, I've heard there still might be a bit of an extension for Premier customers on Exchange 2007 with Service Pack 3. \nI've heard approved Premier customers still on the 2007 release of Exchange might be able to request a one-time free six-month extension that would let them get critical security updates between April 2017 and October 2017. But it is sounding like after October 2017, the Microsoft 2007 wave of Office client and server products won't be getting security updates any longer. Read this",

      "text": "But one month later, Microsoft suddenly removed the bundle from its UK Store, replacing it instead with a handset-only listing, priced at £199 - and at that price it quickly sold out . More stock arrived a couple of weeks later, offered at the same price ; but now, the company has quietly increased the cost of the device. \nThe Microsoft Store is now selling the Liquid Jade Primo for £209.99 , an increase of 5.5% over its most recent price. The listing previously made no mention of £199 being a 'temporary' price or a special offer of any kind, so it's not clear what prompted the company to raise its cost following the earlier price cut. \nEven so, Microsoft's price is far lower than that of Acer itself. The manufacturer is still selling the Liquid Jade Primo for £449.99 ; that price includes a free desktop docking station and flip cover for the handset, but the £240 difference compared with the Microsoft Store considerably exceeds the value of those freebies. \nThe Liquid Jade Primo's key specs include: 5.5-inch Full HD (1920x1080px) AMOLED screen Hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor 3GB RAM 32GB storage (plus microSD card support up to 128GB) 21MP rear camera with dual-LED flash and 4K (3840x2160px) video recording 8MP front-facing camera with Full HD (1920x1080px) video recording Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n",

The entrepreneurs started it in 2015 with a $1 billion in investment. Open AI will now use Microsoft Azure, the company’s cloud-based operating system, to power their research into deep learning and neural networks, as they run their large-scale   experiments in the cloud. Open AI plans to use “thousands to tens of thousands” of Microsoft’s virtual machines, the nonprofit wrote in a blogpost today. Microsoft Azure supports open source technologies, which is a crucial part of Open AI’s mission. Altman has described his nonprofit’s commitment to open source as a way of protecting against the possibility of centralized, monopoly power over  , which he says has the power to harm humanity if used irresponsibly. Elon Musk has spoken extensively on his fear that artifical intelligence is “potentially more dangerous than nukes” and has described the search for artifical intelligence as “summoning the demon.” Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 3, 2014 Watch Elon Musk talk about how he believes there’s an overwhelming possibility that we live in a simulation. recode_divider",

      "text": "Microsoft partners with Elon Musk-backed AI non-profit The research project will run experiments on Azure's cloud-based virtual machines. Save Petrovich9 / Getty Images \nOn its own front, Microsoft has been keen to get more folks developing AI, enough to recently open-source the deep learning tools it used to build Skype Translate and Cortana for users to train their own AI. It's also opened its arms to other tech companies, partnering with Google, Amazon, IBM and Facebook in a coalition to trumpet the benefits of AI and agree on best practices. The initiative left out the Elon Musk and Peter Thiel-backed OpenAI , a research project dedicated to democratizing artificial intelligence. But today, the nonprofit announced a separate team-up with Microsoft to run large-scale experiments on the software giant's Azure cloud platform. \nAzure's open-sourced tools appealed to the nonprofit, as well as its computation-boosting Batch and machine learning capabilities, Microsoft said in a blog post . The partnership also nets OpenAI early use of the software giant's GPU-based Azure N-series virtual machines, which will be opened for general use next month. \nIt's not the first AI partnership, nor the only one to rely on cloud-based systems to run computations, but Microsoft is devoting plenty of development to boost Azure's appeal. While their current N-series virtual machines run on Nvidia Tesla GPUs, those will be replaced by next-generation Pascal-based GPUs in the near future. \nMicrosoft is also announcing its new Azure Bot Service, which aims to let developers speed up development of bots within the software giant's Bot Framework and manage them in a serverless Azure environment, according to Microsoft.

      "text": "Asa Mathat | ReCode Slack exec April underwood. \nEmail killer Slack is under attack from email giant Microsoft , but Slack executives say they welcome competition, with a little trepidation. \n\"It's flattering in some ways,\" said April Underwood, vice president of product at Slack. \"It's also, honestly, it's a little scary.\" Underwood' comments came at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. Microsoft launched a rival workplace messaging service earlier this month . \nMicrosoft's investment in this space has brought more attention to the overall category and validates Slack's thesis that people need better ways to communicate at work, said Underwood. But the Seattle-based giant of email has many more users and far greater resources than venture-backed start-up Slack. \n\"They're a little bit larger than us as a company, they have some resources available to them and some distribution advantages available to them that we don't have,\" she said. \nCEO Stewart Butterfield took out this ad in the New York Times ahead of Microsoft's launch of Teams, its rival product. That feeling when you think \"we should buy a full page in the Times and publish an open letter,\" and then you do. \n\"We're not surprised that that product came out, we had a sense that it was coming,\" said April Underwood, vice president of product at Slack. \nIndeed, completion is heating up. Facebook , with its last month rolled out a business chat product called Workplace by Facebook , which incorporates some similar messaging features. \nSlack now has 4 million daily active users, 750 developer apps integrated into its service which are used by 90 percent of companies which use Slack's paid service. \nApps and artificially intelligent bots on Slack are two key things the company hopes will differentiate its service from competitors. Slack has recently announced with partnerships with IBM Watson to make its bots on Slack smarter, Salesforce , and Alphabet 's Google, whose venture arm has invested in Slack.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today confirmed that the software giant will not be providing extended support to Office users who are still using Office 2007. As announced previously, Office 2007’s support will be ending over the 12 next months — however, Microsoft will not provide any extended custom support as they used to before. Similar to Windows, Microsoft provided custom support to some of its customers at an additional cost — unfortunately, that won’t be available this time around. Here’s the full statement Microsoft provided to ZDNet : \n“The Office 2007 wave of products will be reaching end of support over the next 12 months, as per Microsoft Lifecycle Policy. After those end of support dates, we will no longer offer custom support on any version of Office products (Exchange Server; Office Suites; SharePoint Server; Office Communications Server; Lync Server; Skype for Business Server; Project Server and Visio).\nIn the past we have offered custom support for a subset of Office products to customers with Premier support contracts. We have seen demand for custom support decline as more customers move to Office 365. Note that this change applies only to custom support, but does not impact any of the standard support offerings.\nAs always, customers should consult with their account manager regarding their individual migration plans, and may consider services such as Software Assurance Deployment & Planning Services for on-premises upgrades, and Microsoft FastTrack for cloud migrations.”\nThis is quite understandable as most users, and even business customers are likely using the latest version of Office (2016) or Office 2013. As Microsoft stated, the demand for custom extended support is declining due to the increasing number of Office 365 users.",

Photo by Microsoft \nMicrosoft has formed a partnership with OpenAI, an Elon Musk-based company, to research artificial intelligence. \nThe two companies will focusing on \"making significant contributions to advance the field of AI\" and will work on their \"mutual goal of using AI to tackle some of the world's most challenging problems,\" Microsoft said Tuesday in a blog post. \nMicrosoft add that it is \"committed to democratizing AI and making it accessible to everyone.\" \nAI is one of the hottest trends in tech right now, fueled by powerful chips, fast networks and the massive trail of data we all leave behind us as we go about our digital days. Everyone from the biggest names in tech like Apple and Google to the smallest startups are focusing on making software smarter. The vision is making devices think and behave like humans. \nOpenAI -- a nonprofit research organization co-founded by Musk, Y Combinator's Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former Google research scientist Ilya Sutskever -- also will use Microsoft's Azure cloud computing technology to run \"most\" of its large-scale experiments, the company said Tuesday . \n\"One of the most important factors for accelerating our progress is accessing more and faster computers; this is particularly true for emerging AI technologies like reinforcement learning and generative model ,\" OpenAI said.",

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo More REUTERS - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's flagship cloud service, Azure. OpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. Musk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp co-founder Reid Hoffman. OpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. These cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. ( http://bit.ly/2gdxifR ) The non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. The investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. OpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI.

      "text": "Elon Musk-backed AI startup and Microsoft sign cloud agreement Reuters Reuters Photo: \n(Reuters) - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's <TSLA.O> Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's <MSFT.O> flagship cloud service, Azure. \nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. \nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's <AMZN.O> Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp <LNKD.N> co-founder Reid Hoffman. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. \nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. (http://bit.ly/2gdxifR) \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru) Related Links",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft has pushed today a new update to the Windows 10 Maps for Windows Insiders in the Fast Ring which adds new options to submit corrections about the maps’ data (via Neowin ). Looking at the app’s hidden menu, you will see that the “Feedback” item has been replaced with a “Suggest change” option. If you don’t do any search in the app, tapping this new option will give you these three choices: Add a missing business or landmark Suggest a modification about inaccurate data on a specific area Open the feedback hub The new “Suggest change” option has replaced the previous link to the Feedback Hub. \nIf you do a search and then tap the “Suggest change,” the app will give you another set of options to submit corrections about the place you were searching for. You will then be able to suggest name changes, location adjustments, and more. More options are available with search results. \nMicrosoft’s Windows 10 Maps uses data from Here Maps which is usually top notch, but there is always room for improvement (especially in some countries such as Japan ) and crowdsourcing can be definitely helpful. To try this new feature, make sure to download the latest version 5.1611.3162.0 which should be rolled out to the production ring in the coming weeks.",

      "text": "As the Microsoft’s Xbox One gaming console enjoys some well-deserved momentum the last few months , the original Xbox celebrates its 15th birthday today . \nOver its nine years of retail availability, the first Xbox lacked the same mainstream success as its Xbox 360 successor, though it seems that some of Microsoft ideas were definitely forward looking at the time such as the x86 architecture, the global shape of the Xbox controller and the Xbox Live online gaming service. \nToday, Xbox’s Major Nelson shared a couple of images of the original Xbox dashboard focusing on the Xbox Live experience, and just a week after Microsoft i ntroduced Clubs, Looking for Groups and more to the gaming network . It is quite fascinating to look back at the beginnings (as a reminder, Xbox Live introduced in November 2002, a full year after the launch of the original Xbox in the US) When I joined the Xbox team 13 years ago (!) this dashboard update was one of the first projects I worked on. #15YearsofXbox pic.twitter.com/OqU2hrMyV3 \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 15, 2016 A few more images from the Original Xbox dashboard showing early Xbox Live support. pic.twitter.com/xyjGKwNg0c \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 15, 2016 \nIn this last tweet from Major Nelson, you can watch a video recap of all the different Xbox dashboard experiences that Microsoft developed for the original Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One over the last fifteen years. I tweeted this out last year…but it's worth it again. Here are all of the major Xbox dashboards: OG Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One pic.twitter.com/OWlyPj8qy9 \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 15, 2016 \nAs those of you who own an Xbox One may know, Microsoft’s latest gaming console has been running an optimized version of Windows 10 since the release of the New Xbox One Experience last year, and it’s safe to say that the new dashboard is a vast improvement over the previous versions. \nNow with more and more UWP apps reaching the Xbox Store, better social features on Xbox Live and upcoming native support for Microsoft’s Beam live streaming network , the Xbox One is also a much better entertainment device. It’s a worthwhile to look back at the past, but the future is more exciting. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft and CRM and cloud solutions provider Salesforce have had a complicated relationship over the last few years. While Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff claimed last year that former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer had “a hard time having relationships with other CEOs ,” Benioff stated at the time that Satya Nadella was “the opposite.” As a reminder, Microsoft even tried to acquire the CRM giant last year . \nWhile both companies still continued to work together this year, releasing a Salesforce Lightning add-in for Outlook earlier in June , Microsoft’s CRM Dynamics solution has went to become a great competitor to Salesforce core business. Earlier in September, we reported that HP chose Microsoft’s offering over Salesforce’s, with Microsoft’s executive VP of cloud and enterprise Scott Guthrie sharing at the time that the deal was “a Salesforce takeout.” \nAdditionally, Salesforce entered in a bidding war with Microsoft to acquire LinkedIn earlier this year, which pushed the Redmond giant to improve its offer quite significantly . Since then, Salesforce has been making moves to make the European Union block the blockbuster deal . \nBut Benioff, who was interviewed yesterday by tech reporter Kara Swisher at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco, revealed why he came to change his mind about the new, partner-friendly Microsoft that Satya Nadella has been trying to promote since he took the reins of the company nearly three years ago. Specifically, Benioff recalled getting a phone call from Nadella asking him to meet with Scott Guthrie, then head of Microsoft’s Azure Business. But what Benioff didn’t know at the time was that Guthrie would become head of Microsoft’s CRM business just a few weeks later. \n“I was just very kind of surprised by this,” Benioff told Swisher, adding that “I just kinda came to the conclusion at that point that the new Microsoft was actually the old Microsoft.” In the following months, the Salesforce CEO also mentioned that Microsoft invited the company to a partner conference but later had a change of mind. “Little things like this started stacking up,” explained Benioff, who then shared that “I don’t feel like this is exactly the new Microsoft that we were looking for.” You can listen a more complete version of his statements in the video below. \nBefore Benioff met Guthrie last year, the exec acknowledged that the company did look at “every possible option” to partner with Microsoft, including a sale. We invite you to check the full interview as Benioff also has a lot to share about Microsoft’s LinkedIn acquisition and why he still has some doubts about what the company will do with all its very valuable data.

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nLili Cheng, a Distinguished Engineer at the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group has taken to the Microsoft Azure Blog to announce the new Azure Bot Service. The announcement comes after the launch of the Bot Framework on Github in March, and marks a way for Microsoft to make it easier for software developers to get started creating a bot. \nThe Azure Bot Service will become the first public cloud bot-service powered by the Microsoft Bot Framework and serverless compute in Microsoft Azure. According to Lili Cheng, “With this cloud service, you can build, connect, deploy and manage intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking.” Bots will also scale based on demand, meaning you will only pay for the resources your bots consume. Thanks to an integrated developer experience designed for bot development, and integrated continuous deployment, Bots also will help you boost operational efficiency, and accelerate development cycles. Lastly, thanks to Microsoft Cognitive Services, plus built-in configurable channels to improve your customer interactions and increase your reach to more customers, your bots will also be enriched. \nMicrosoft has made significant advances over the last few years in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In fact, the company recently announced that it has partnered with Elon Musk’s Open AI to help make Azure a better AI platform. To learn more about Azure Bot Service, be sure to head over to this official Microsoft web page . And, to get started with it today, sign up for an Azure Trial . Also be sure to give Microsoft your feedback via the UserVoice , and check out the official documentation . In this story stream:",

      "text": "Windows Video Converter Ultimate Microsoft to Replace Security Bulletin Index with A Database-Driven Portal \nFor the longest time, Microsoft has published a list of security bulletins on the second Tuesday of each month, famously known as Patch Tuesday. Each bulletin is numbered with a prefix that designates the year it was released, followed by a sequential number. While the controversial schedule worked out quite well for Microsoft and the IT customers, the technical content of these security bulletins isn’t that easy to follow and keep in place. \nThe latest Security Bulletins Index has a 57 pages updates released from 2008 all the way to November 2016, with each update including details about that patch for each software it affects and the links to Knowledge Base numbers that contain additional details. \nWell, this is going to change in early 2017, according to Microsoft . After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide , which is a database-driven portal that lets you sort, search, and filter the database to find details about a specific security bulletin and its associated updates. \nIn the portal, you can filter by product category to find all updates that are only related to one or a few products, narrow down a date range, or simply search the KB if you know the number. The search results appear in a grid that you can filter directly using a text box or sort by clicking column headings. \nEach entry in the search results contains links to the associated KB article and to details about the vulnerability and affected products, as well as the download link for that update. \nMost importantly, the entire list or any filtered subset can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet in CVE format, allowing IT pros to integrate security information into their own infrastructure without having to manually scrape the index. \nThe Security Portal is currently still in beta.The bulletins for November 2016 through January 2017 are being published to both the old index and the new portal. But after January 2017, new bulletins will only be published to the new portal. \n/via ZDnet/",

      "title": "What you need to consider before adopting Microsoft Office 365",
      "text": "Tweet \nThe cloud-based office productivity software market is expected to reach $17 billion in 2016. That’s more than a 400 percent increase from 2009 when the market was valued at $3.3 billion. \nWith the success of cloud-based applications and their pay-as-you-go model, it shouldn’t be surprising that the cloud version of one of the most widely used desktop application packages would grow to become a popular choice for businesses. I’m of course referring to Office 365, Microsoft’s leading productivity and work software package delivered via the cloud. \nWhat’s the Fuss? \nMobile devices and cloud technologies at large have drastically changed the way we work. Most office workers don’t need to be \"tied to their desk\" or even be in the office itself to get things done. \nOffice 365 is designed to further enable and reflect this trend by delivering anytime, anywhere, access to Microsoft applications through (virtually) any device. Simplifying application management further, it also offers businesses a fully integrated solution - including built-in communication, collaboration and social-networking capabilities. The integration of these tools helps enable teams to better share, communicate and collaborate -- something that is not only helpful, but essential to being successful and effective in the modern workplace. \nAlso offering cloud storage, documents saved on Microsoft’s OneDrive for Business can be shared with others to simultaneously collaborate on the documents and create a common site where all work is automatically saved. Solutions such as Microsoft Yammer and Skype make it easy to communicate via text, voice video and more. \nMobility of the technology today is not only demanding of collaboration but is essential to be successful and effective in the day to day life. As is the case with most cloud solutions, adopting Office 365 also reduces and can even eliminate upfront capital investments with an OpEx model. And by delivering it as an online subscription, businesses no longer need to buy or upgrade to each release of Office, but will instead have updates installed every time there’s one available. \nDo I Need to Consider Anything First? \nYes. Before making the move to Office 365, every organization needs to carefully evaluate what’s involved for a successful deployment. Here are a few: No one size fits all : There really is no single \"Office 365\", but rather different options with varying levels of application functionality. Mixing and matching of plans is definitely an option, one that you need to evaluate thoroughly. On-premises, cloud or hybrid \" As well as applications, customers can also mix and match cloud and on-premises capabilities. A hybrid approach involves moving some users to the cloud while keeping others \"on-premises\" for compliance or operational reasons -- though users will of course not feel the difference, and you get to use the same tools across online and on-premises servers. Preparing your infrastructure : Moving applications and services to the cloud inevitably increases the demands on your network infrastructure. End users are accustomed to the high performance of locally provided services, so when moving these local services to cloud-hosted Office 365, it’s important to anticipate performance issues and other complexities that can arise during, and after, the migration. Working closely with managed service providers (MSP) can be vital to helping prepare infrastructures for these changes. Provisioning your Office 365 environment : In principle, making the transition to Office 365 involves setting up the appropriate accounts, the access permissions, file integrations and, in the case of existing users, transitioning current premise-based solutions to the cloud. This process can be simple, but in cases involving the migration of multiple data sources and application integrations, many businesses choose to draw on the expertise of a managed service provider. Compliance and Security : Concerns over security keep many organizations -- especially those in healthcare and financial services—from moving to the cloud, but those concerns are lessening. With Office 365, security is truly inbuilt; starting from encryption of the data to the different levels of privacy that can be applied with both administrators and people at the user level able to control what and with whom documents can be shared with. Employing certified security frameworks based on International Standards Organization (ISO/IEC 27001:2005) standards, services such as cloud-access security solutions help detect activity and usage of data across Office 365 in order to analyse actions and activity sequences to identify possible data theft or abuse. Support : Ongoing account support is an important consideration in any Office 365 implementation and is one of the major factors that brings organizations to deploy the package through a MSPs. With a good MSP, support issues can be opened via phone, email and on the web using a customer-facing portal. Many will also offer 24x7x365 support helplines, and where internal staff are unable to address an issue, an MSP is also able to own the relationship with Microsoft support services and leverage existing relationships. \nWhile there are many things to consider before implementing Office 365, the benefits of the software-as-a-service model has meant that many analysts have predicted that the cloud will become the primary way most people access their office applications. \nToday’s Office 365 allows organizations to break down traditional office silos to enable better knowledge sharing, manage and predict costs, always remain up to date with the latest product suite, and continues on the path of better enabling users to work from anywhere, anytime. \nVivek Vahie is a senior director of Service Delivery at NaviSite . \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

      "text": "​Microsoft uses Minecraft to get kids to learn programming ​Microsoft uses Minecraft to get kids to learn programming A new one-hour programming tutorial lets students understand better how to build something as sophisticated as the wildly popular Minecraft game. ​Microsoft uses Minecraft to get kids to learn programming 0 Share: \nMicrosoft is trying to use Minecraft to teach kids how to program. Photo by screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET \nWith more than a million copies sold, Minecraft already is squarely in the center of tech kids' lives . Now Microsoft wants to take advantage of that position to encourage kids to program the game, not just play it. \nOn Tuesday, the company released a new online tutorial for Code.org's Hour of Code, an non-profit effort sponsored by many tech companies to get children programming. \nIt'll look familiar to those who've used introductory programming projects like Google's Pencil Code or MIT's Scratch : commands take the form of Lego-like pieces you snap together into a sequence that controls an on-screen character. Puzzles alternate with video tutorials explaining new programming concepts. \nProgramming isn't for everyone, but many schools and businesses are trying to expose students to it as a way to build skills for the 21st century, when tech is spreading beyond PCs and phones into cars, refrigerators , thermostats, and many other corners of our lives. \nPresident Barack Obama has endorsed the Code.org effort. \"If we want America to stay on the cutting edge, we need young Americans like you to master the tools and technology that will change we do just about everything,\" Obama said in a 2013 video. \"Don't just buy a new videogame. Make one... Don't just play on your phone. Program it.\"",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced the general availability of the Azure N-Series of Azure Virtual Machines as of December 1, 2016. Azure N-Series virtual will be first available in East US, West Europe, and South East Asia at GA joining the current South Central US region. N-Series instances are enabled with NVIDIA’s GPUs to allow you to run GPU-accelerated workloads and visualize them. N-Series VMs are split into two categories: NC-Series and NV-Series.\nAzure NC virtual machines—GPU compute: \nAzure NC-based instances are powered by NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs and provide the compute power required to accelerate the most demanding high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads. Customers can now use these instances to run deep learning training jobs, HPC simulations, rendering, real-time data analytics, DNA sequencing, and many more CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)–accelerated tasks. Additionally, customers have the option to utilize RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) over InfiniBand for scaling jobs across multiple instances. Using InfiniBand between instances provides close to bare-metal performance when scaling out to tens, hundreds, or even thousands of GPUs across hundreds of nodes—allowing customers to submit tightly coupled jobs like Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)–based training for natural language processing, image recognition, and object detection.\nAzure NV virtual machines—GPU visualization: \nAzure NV-based instances are powered by NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs and provide NVIDIA GRID capabilities on demand. Scientists, designers, and engineers can now utilize these new instances for running hardware-accelerated workstation applications, designing the next concept car, or creating the next blockbuster movie. These instances support applications utilizing both DirectX and OpenGL.\nFind the pricing details about these new N-series VMs here .",

      "text": "Cloud Microsoft partners with OpenAI to advance AI research with Azure Nonprofit research organization OpenAI recently chose Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud platform, to further support their research and innovations in the space. By Conner Forrest | November 15, 2016, 10:39 AM PST Google Plus Image: Claire Reilly/CNET \nOpenAI, the nonprofit artificial intelligence research organization co-founded by tech visionaries Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever, announced Tuesday that it was partnering with Microsoft to advance its work in AI. As part of the deal, announced via a blog post , Microsoft Azure will act as the primary cloud platform for OpenAI. \nIn the post, Microsoft said that it is \"committed to democratizing AI and making it accessible to everyone,\" and that is a mission that they share with OpenAI. As part of the deal, Microsoft isn't just providing infrastructure, it will also help OpenAI \"advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud,\" the post said. \nThe reasoning behind OpenAI's decision to partner with Microsoft, according to the post, is due to Microsoft's focus on deep learning, open source technologies, and the capabilities available in tools such as Azure Batch, Azure Machine Learning, and the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit. Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines, which are optimized for high computer workloads like deep learning, are already being used by OpenAI, the post said. \nSEE: Microsoft Azure: The smart person's guide \nMicrosoft's focus on AI has been ramping up heavily over the past few years, and the company seems to be hitting its stride in 2016. In June, Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, laid out his 10 rules for AI , further outlining how the company would be approaching the technology. Must-Read Cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy \nSince the, Microsoft has recently unveiled new innovations in the space such as its Concept Graph to help \"make sense\" of AI, and its advances in speech recognition . And, the Microsoft Azure cloud platform has been a part of it all as well, with Nadella saying the company was building out Azure as \"the first AI supercomputer .\" \nIn addition to the partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft also announced the its Azure Bot Service preview that allows developers to build bots on the \"Microsoft Bot Framework and easily deploy and manage them in a serverless environment on Azure.\" These bots run on Azure Functions—available now—to help them scale and more efficiently use resources. \nHowever, Microsoft hasn't always had the best luck with bots. Back in April, a chatbot from Microsoft called Tay was manipulated by users into spewing racist and sexist messages before being taken offline. \nWhile interesting, the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI was preceded by the launch of the Partnership on AI in September, when Microsoft joined Facebook, IBM, Google, and Amazon to promote best practices in AI development. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Microsoft recently partnered with OpenAI to provide Azure cloud resources to further OpenAI's efforts in AI research and development. Microsoft also announced the preview of its Azure Bot Service, which allows developers to build intelligent chatbots. Microsoft has been steadily increasing its focus on AI, with CEO Satya Nadella outlining its 10 rules for AI development in the summer.

Photo by Microsoft \nMicrosoft has formed a partnership with OpenAI, an Elon Musk-backed company, to research artificial intelligence. \nThe two companies will focus on \"making significant contributions to advance the field of AI\" and will work on their \"mutual goal of using AI to tackle some of the world's most challenging problems,\" Microsoft said Tuesday in a blog post. \nMicrosoft added that it is \"committed to democratizing AI and making it accessible to everyone.\" \nAI is one of the hottest trends in tech right now, fueled by powerful chips, fast networks and the massive trail of data we all leave behind us. Everyone from the biggest names in tech, like Apple and Google, to the smallest startups are focusing on making software smarter. The vision is making devices think and behave like humans. \nOpenAI is a nonprofit research organization co-founded by Musk, Y Combinator's Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former Google research scientist Ilya Sutskever. The company said it will use Microsoft's Azure cloud computing technology to run \"most\" of its large-scale experiments. \n\"One of the most important factors for accelerating our progress is accessing more and faster computers; this is particularly true for emerging AI technologies like reinforcement learning and generative models ,\" OpenAI said.",

(AP) — Microsoft has announced that it will purchase 178 megawatts of production from a wind farm under construction near Dodge City.\nThe Wichita Eagle ( http://bit.ly/2gdpTwL ) reports that the purchase from Bloom Wind will be a portion of the 237 megawatts of alternative energy Microsoft is buying to supply through the grid to its Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center.\nThe wind farm will consist of 54 towers across 15,000 acres of privately-owned land about 20 miles south of Dodge City in Ford and Clark counties.\nCapital Power will operate the wind farm and has contracted the facility's output to a subsidiary of Allianz, which plans to sell the power to Microsoft for 10 years.\n___\nInformation from: The Wichita (Kan.)

      "text": "Microsoft launched its Azure Bot Services today to give bot creators the option to move their bots into the cloud and let Microsoft handle server and storage issues, the company announced today.\nAlexa Web Service is cloud-based, but until today, none of the big three cloud providers — Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform — have provided a solution for developers to create bots in the cloud.\nThe service was created, wrote Microsoft FUSE Labs general manager Lili Cheng in a blog post today , to “give you the operational agility to run and handle scale as your bots grow in popularity and you only pay for what you use. Moreover, you also don’t need to worry about provisioning or managing servers that run your bots. Patching and infrastructure maintenance is handled for you – you focus on writing code.”\nThe Microsoft Bot Framework can make bots that operate on more than half a dozen platforms including Skype, Microsoft Teams, Facebook Messenger, and Kik.\nBots that use Azure Bot Service will automatically be added to the Microsoft Bot Directory, Cheng wrote. In an interview with VentureBeat last month, Cheng expressed a desire to create a more robust bot directory or bot search engine with the help of developers and the largest chat apps on the planet.\nAzure Bot Service is free up to one million server requests a month , and provides templates like a bot that helps fill out forms or one that utilizes Language Understanding Intelligent Service (aka LUIS), the primary natural language processor provided by Microsoft Cognitive Services.\nDevelopers can use GitHub, BitBucket, and other services to share code with Azure, Cheng wrote.\nIn a coming-out year for bots and intelligent assistants, it’s been a week of significant firsts for bots.\nOn Monday, Facebook became one of the first of the tech giants with a bot platform to offer analytics for everyone with a Messenger bot .\n",

Two new titles have hit Xbox One Backward Compatibility today, providing ever more support for Xbox One owners in playing their old Xbox 360 titles. \nHere’s the tweet from the always-on-top-of-things Major Nelson: Dead Space Ignition and Escape Dead Island are coming to Xbox One Backward Compatibility today https://t.co/qPMRNs2ZLo pic.twitter.com/A3vV6c32yb \n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 15, 2016 \nIf you have either of these two titles sitting around, then get them loaded up on your Xbox One or Xbox One S and get playing. Let us know in the comments if there are other titles you’re particularly looking forward to seeing make their way to the Backward Compatible list.",

Related Media Rackspace Brings Managed Application Services to Azure Advertisement \n(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. struck a partnership with Elon Musk's artificial intelligence research group, OpenAI, and said the organization will use the company's Azure cloud system for most of its large-scale experiments. \nOpenAI has been an early customer for Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines, a powerful cloud-computing service that relies on Nvidia Corp. graphical processing units. The two will also collaborate on ways to advance AI research and its use, Microsoft and Open AI said Tuesday in blog posts. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in its post. \nMicrosoft is investing in artificial intelligence research and product development in a variety of areas including medicine and bots, programs that chat with users to automate tasks. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has discussed the need for ethical rules as AI develops as well as creating ways to spread its benefits. Musk, who heads Tesla Motors Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies, teamed up with Y Combinator President Sam Altman and others, to form the nonprofit OpenAI in December, seeking to ensure AI is developed safety and its benefits are widely distributed. \nMicrosoft also said it's introducing the Azure Bot Service, a cloud service that lets companies and developers store and run bots in the Azure cloud.",

The two will also collaborate on ways to advance AI research and its use, Microsoft and Open AI said Tuesday in blog posts. \n“In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,” OpenAI said in its post. \nMicrosoft is investing in artificial intelligence research and product development in a variety of areas including medicine and bots, programmes that chat with users to automate tasks. \nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has discussed the need for ethical rules as AI develops as well as creating ways to spread its benefits. \nMusk, who heads Tesla Motors Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies, teamed up with Y Combinator President Sam Altman and others, to form the non-profit OpenAI in December, seeking to ensure AI is developed safety and its benefits are widely distributed. \nMicrosoft also said it’s introducing the Azure Bot Service, a cloud service that lets companies and developers store and run bots in the Azure cloud.

      "text": "Microsoft Makes Largest Wind Energy Investment (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | November 15, 2016 — 8:24 AM EST \nMicrosoft Corporation ( MSFT ) announced on Monday that it has inked two agreements that translate to its largest deal for renewable wind energy, aimed at powering the massive collection of datacenters it has in the U.S. \nOn Monday, the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant said it signed a deal with insurance organization Allianz Risk Transfer to buy energy from a new 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project located in Kansas. In a statement, Microsoft explains that the deal \"fixes\" its contracted energy costs over a long-term agreement. The second deal is a long-term contract with Black Hills Energy to buy 59 megawatts of energy \"certificates\" related to two wind projects near Microsoft’s Cheyenne, Wyo., datacenter site. (See also: Top 5 Wind-Power Stocks of 2016 .) \nBoth contracts amount to 237 megawatts of generating capacity , which brings Microsoft's U.S.-based wind power total to more than 500 megawatts. The megawatt (or 1,000 kilowatts) is a standard measurement of electricity production. According to the company, the combined output of both sites should produce enough energy annually to supply Microsoft's Cheyenne facility with all the energy it needs. \n\"Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud , and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,\" said Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer in a statement. \"Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.\" (See also: Amazon Announces Its Largest-Ever Renewable Energy Project .) \nFor Microsoft, these two contracts follow two other agreements the company has made to further its efforts in renewable and carbon-free energy. Earlier this year, the company reached an agreement with the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and the 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas. It also reached an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy in March. \nMicrosoft shares closed Monday at $58.12, down 1.52%. The shares have risen 4.76% year to date, compared with a 5.76% rise in the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index. (See also: Microsoft Stock Caught in Tech Downdraft .)

      "text": "by Brittany Goetting — Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Microsoft’s Cheyenne Datacenter Entirely Powered By ‘Green’ Wind Energy Microsoft is furthering its efforts to go green. The company just made its largest wind energy purchase (237 megawatts) through wind farms aligned with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) and Black Hills Corporation. Microsoft plans to power its datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming entirely by this windpower. According to Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, “Innovation and sustainability go hand in hand. We’re thinking differently about our datacenters and how we can build and operate them in a more sustainable way. And the innovations we’re piloting in this deal are not only good for business, but also good for local communities and the environment as well.” Currently, roughly 44 percent of Microsoft’s consumed energy comes from wind, solar, and hydropower. It hopes to increase this number to 50 percent by 2018 and to 60 percent in the early 2020’s. This latest purchase brings Microsoft's wind energy consumption to 500 megawatts. This does not count the power it also receives from other solar and hydropower sources. Microsoft also has wind generators in Illinois that supplies its Chicago datacenter and a Texas plant with project developer RES America. Microsoft is not only concerned about the environment, but about energy costs. The corporation is the first buyer to participate in the ART new finance structure for wind generation projects. It noted that new infrastructure usually means higher costs to ratepayers. The ART’s system supposedly cuts costs, reduces risks, and improves certainty. How is new infrastructure created at a lower price? For example, Microsoft and Black Hills Corporation established a new tariff that is available to all eligible customers. The tariff allows the utility to access datacenter’s backup generators as a secondary resource for the entire grid. The end result is less expensive and more environmentally-friendly.",

      "text": "\nThere was a brief period when Microsoft and CRM leader Salesforce got along like a house of fire , particularly when Microsoft wanted to give CEO Marc Benioff $55 billion for the company in 2015 (and Salesforce demanded $70 billion).\nIf seems when the money went so did the love.\nWhile previously fast friends with Satya Nadella Benioff now claims that ‘The new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft’, accusing Microsoft of feigning interest in the company just to steal their secrets.\nHe claims for example that Microsoft arranged a meeting between him and the then head of Azure Scott Guthrie to see if Salesforce could run their CRM software on Azure.\n“The message was ‘Why don’t you meet with Scott Guthrie? He runs Azure and would really like to walk you through the details of your business because maybe we could get Salesforce to run on Azure’… and I’m like OK, and it was clear also that he was someone not in our business, he was running Azure.”\nBenioff notes a few weeks later Guthrie was suddenly promoted to also run Microsoft’s CRM business, which is a direct competitor to Salesforce and not long after Salesforce was disinvited from a Microsoft customer event without prior notice.\nThe final insult was likely when Microsoft snatched LinkedIn from Salesforce’s jaws . Salesforce actually offered more for the company, but LinkedIn preferred Microsoft’s all cash deal to Salesforce’s cash and shares deal.\n“I just came to the conclusion at that point that the new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft. … And little things like this started stacking up and we put it all together, I don’t feel like this is exactly the new Microsoft that we were looking for.”\nInstead of going Azure Salesforce now went to Amazon’s AWS, and the company is now trying to block Microsoft’s LinkedIn purchase with the EU competition authorities, claiming Microsoft would block their access to LinkedIn’s data despite Microsoft’s assurances to the contrary.\nOf course another reason may be that Microsoft has just overtaken Salesforce as tops Software as a Service provider , with Benioff’s protests the epitome of the “ If you can’t compete, Complain ” culture.\nIs Benioff right and was he watching too many reruns of the Simpsons?\n",

      "text": "- Source: OpenAI \nHarry Shum and Sam Altman OpenAI , the nonprofit co-funded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever , announced that it has partnered with Microsoft to use its Azure cloud for research and to “democratize” access to artificial intelligence , a goal seemingly shared by both companies. \nThe OpenAI partnership is “focused on making significant contributions to advance the field of AI, while also furthering our mutual goal of using AI to tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems,” wrote Harry Shum Microsoft AI and Research Group executive vice president, on the Official Microsoft Blog . \nOpenAI was created as an alternative to proprietary artificial intelligence so that when super-human machine intelligence is achieved, it won’t be owned only by a few corporations or governments. Instead, it could be shared by many more entities and individuals, which could also help defend against potential “rogue” artificial intelligence. \nAlthough not yet part of it, OpenAI may have also encouraged not just Microsoft, but also Google, Amazon, IBM, and others to create a consortium where they can discuss how AI can evolve and how to deal with new and unexpected issues. \nThe OpenAI group said that it was impressed by Microsoft’s existing machine learning-optimized infrastructure, as well as by what’s coming on the company’s roadmap, which includes Pascal GPUs from Nvidia. OpenAI has already been the world’s first beneficiary of a Pascal-based Nvidia DGX-1 “AI supercomputer in a box” system for research purposes. \nIn the coming months, the OpenAI group said that it would use up to tens of thousands of Nvidia K80 GPUs for the training of its AI algorithms. Microsoft’s Shum also said that starting in December, OpenAI will be one of the first to use its Azure N-Series Virtual Machines. \n“These virtual machines are designed for the most intensive compute workloads, including deep learning, simulations, rendering and the training of neural networks,” said Shum. \n“They also enable high-end visualization capabilities to allow for workstation and streaming scenarios by utilizing the NVIDIA GRID in Azure,” he added. \nNow that OpenAI has the necessary hardware, it should be able compete more easily with machine learning systems from large corporations such as Google, Amazon, and even Microsoft itself.
