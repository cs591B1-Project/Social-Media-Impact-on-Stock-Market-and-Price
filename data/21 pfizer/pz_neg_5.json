      "text": "  4:06am EST Britain fines Pfizer record $107 million for huge drug price hike The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo By Ben Hirschler | LONDON \nLONDON Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. \nThe decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\" \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier. \nNo one was immediately available at Flynn for comment. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Jane Merriman/Keith Weir) Next In Health News",

      "text": "Health Britain fines Pfizer record US$107 million for huge drug price hike Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds (US$106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. Posted 07 Dec 2016 17:10 The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File photo A \nLONDON: Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds (US$106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. \nThe decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\" \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier. \nNo one was immediately available at Flynn for comment. \n(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Jane Merriman/Keith Weir) - Reuters",

Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form from another supplier.\nFlynn also plans to appeal. Chief executive David Fakes said punishing Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules for less than phenytoin tablets \"beggars belief\".\n(US$1 = 0.7903 pounds)\n(Editing by Jane Merriman/Keith Weir/Alexander Smith)\n- Reuters\nEmail More",

Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds ($106 million) and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds.\nThe authority says the companies intentionally rebranded a drug previously known as Epanutin so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the price of phenytoin sodium capsules increase from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million pounds in 2013.\nPfizer plans to appeal.\n ",

      "text": "Pin it Share LONDON (AP) — British regulators have fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma almost 90 million pounds ($114.6 million) for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. The Competition and Markets Authority says Pfizer and Flynn Pharma broke competition law by charging \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by some 48,000 people in Britain. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds ($106 million) and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. The authority says the companies intentionally rebranded a drug previously known as Epanutin so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the price of phenytoin sodium capsules increase from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million pounds in 2013. Pfizer plans to appeal.",

      "text": "Pfizer Fined $107 Million for Epilepsy Drug Price Hike in UK -- Update December 07, 2016, 05:02:  Denise Roland \nLONDON-- Pfizer Inc. has been fined GBP84.2 million ($106.7 million) by the U.K.'s competition regulator for charging the country's National Health Service excessively high prices for an anti-epilepsy drug. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday that Pfizer and drug distribution company Flynn Pharma broke competition law by charging unfair prices in the U.K. for phenytoin sodium capsules, an anti-epilepsy drug used by around 48,000 patients in the country. \nA spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company refuted the CMA's findings and would appeal all aspects of the decision. Flynn Pharma couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \nThe CMA said the price of a 100mg pack of phenytoin sodium shot up--to GBP67.50 from GBP2.83--after Pfizer sold the rights to sell the drug to Flynn Pharma in September 2012. It said the price decreased to GBP54 in May 2014. Before the agreement, Pfizer had sold phenytoin sodium capsules directly to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin. \nThe price increase was partly because Pfizer, which continued to manufacture phenytoin sodium, sold the drug to Flynn Pharma at up to 17 times the price than it charged wholesalers and pharmacies previously, the regulator said. Flynn Pharma hiked the price further still. \nThe regulator said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma \"deliberately debranded\" the drug in 2012 to raise its price. In the U.K., the price of branded drugs is determined by negotiations between the government and pharmaceutical companies. But unbranded, or generic drugs, may be freely priced. Typically, generic drugs cost a fraction of the branded version because there tend to be several competing suppliers, but in this case, no other company made phenytoin sodium. \nA spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company \"approached this divestment with integrity and believes it fully complies with established competition law.\" \nShe said phenytoin capsules were loss-making for Pfizer before the deal with Flynn Pharma and the transaction secured ongoing supply of the medicine. The spokeswoman added that the price charged by Flynn Pharma was 25-40% lower than that for an equivalent, branded epilepsy medicine whose price was regulated. \nPhilip Marsden, the chairman of the case decision group for the CMA investigation, said the companies \"deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price of a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients.\" \nAlthough Pfizer said the drug was loss-making before de-branding, the losses would have been recovered within two months of the price rises, Mr. Marsden said. \n\"There is no justification for such rises when phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug for which there has been no recent innovation or significant investment,\" he said. \nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com  160502ET  ",

      "text": "Pfizer Inc. has been fined £84.2 million ($106.7 million) by the U.K.’s competition regulator for charging the country’s National Health Service excessively high prices for an anti-epilepsy drug.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday that Pfizer PFE, -0.09% and drug distribution company Flynn Pharma broke competition law by charging unfair prices in the U.K. for phenytoin sodium capsules, an anti-epilepsy drug used by around 48,000 patients in the country.\nThe regulator fined Flynn Pharma £5.2 million ($6.6 million) and has ordered both companies to reduce their prices.\nA spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company refuted the CMA’s findings and would appeal all aspects of the decision. Flynn Pharma couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.\nThe CMA said the price of a 100mg pack of phenytoin sodium shot up—to £67.50 from £2.83—after Pfizer sold the rights to sell the drug to Flynn Pharma in September 2012. It said the price decreased to £54 in May 2014. Before the agreement, Pfizer had sold phenytoin sodium capsules directly to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin.\nWhat is the future of bitcoin?

      "text": "Britain fines Pfizer record £84m for huge drug price hike - Dec 07, 2016 \nBritain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record £84.2m for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600%. \nThe UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma £5.2m for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the National Health Service rose from £2m a year in 2012 to about £50m in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. The decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said today. \"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds,\" he added. \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe US drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. \nPfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25-40% less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier.",

      "text": "LONDON (AP) - British regulators have fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma almost 90 million pounds ($114.6 million) for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority says Pfizer and Flynn Pharma broke competition law by charging \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by some 48,000 people in Britain. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds ($106 million) and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds.\nThe authority says the companies intentionally rebranded a drug previously known as Epanutin so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the price of phenytoin sodium capsules increase from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million pounds in 2013.\nPfizer plans to appeal.\n ",

      "text": "Britain fines Pfizer record $107 million for huge drug price hike >> Reuters Published: 2016-12-07 15:35:59.0 BdST Updated: 2016-12-07 15:36:48.0 BdST The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York Apr 28, 2014. Reuters Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. \nThe decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\" \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe US drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier. \nNo one was immediately available at Flynn for comment.",

      "text": "Pfizer Fined In UK For Charging Unfair Prices For Anti-epilepsy Drug  34:  The Competition and Markets Authority in UK has imposed a 84.2 million pounds fine on Pfizer ( PFE ), and a 5.2 million pounds fine on the distributor Flynn Pharma after finding that each broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices in the UK for phenytoin sodium capsules, an anti-epilepsy drug. CMA stated that the fines follow prices increasing by up to 2,600% overnight after the drug was deliberately de-branded in September 2012. \nPhenytoin sodium capsules are used in the treatment of epilepsy to prevent and control seizures. As a result of the price increases, NHS expenditure on phenytoin sodium capsules increased from about 2 million pounds a year in 2012 to about 50 million pounds in 2013. \nPhilip Marsden, Chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation, said: \"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited.\"",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK   6:10 am 12/07/2016 06:10am Share \nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged “excessive and unfair prices” for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer’s name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n“In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,” Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n“The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,” the company said. “Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.” \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals’ former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.  ",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK Posted:   By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK Posted: By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.  ",

As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n“In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,” Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n“The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,” the company said. “Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.” \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals’ former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent.

Advertisement \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Loading more articles...",

The CMA said UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012. \nIt was then debranded, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation, and the price soared. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior.\" \nPfizer said in a statement it planned to appeal all aspects of the CMA's verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form from another supplier. \nFlynn also plans to appeal. Chief executive David Fakes said punishing Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules for less than phenytoin tablets \"beggars belief.\" \n($1 = 0.7903 pounds) (Editing by Jane Merriman/Keith Weir/Alexander Smith) Published: December 7, 2016 — 4:26 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.  ",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK Posted: By DANICA KIRKAAssociated Press \nLONDON (AP) - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.  ",

      "text": "Caterpillar CEO, Other Leaders Warn Trump Tariffs Could Backfire \nBritain’s National Health Service spent about 50 million pounds on the anti-epilepsy capsules in 2013 and 40 million pounds in 2014, the CMA said in its August 2015 complaint. The amount the NHS was charged for 100-milligram packs of the drug \"rocketed\" from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 pounds, before dropping to 54 pounds starting in May 2014, the CMA said Wednesday. \nLoss-Making Product \nPfizer said that it “refutes” the findings of the regulator. Both companies said they will appeal. \n“Phenytoin capsules were a loss-making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture,” the company said in a statement. “When Flynn launched its product, the company set a price that was between 25 and 40 percent less than the price of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS which had long been regulated, and appeared to be acceptable to, the Department of Health.” \nA Flynn spokesman said the CMA had \"ignored or misunderstood\" important aspects of its investigation, including the fact that alternative epilepsy drugs were more expensive than phenytoin. \n\"Phenytoin sodium capsules are already less expensive than the alternative equivalent drugs in the U.K. market,\" a Flynn spokesman said. \"It beggars belief that the CMA seeks to punish Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules at a significant discount to phenytoin tablets.\" \nPrior to September 2012, prices were regulated when Pfizer manufactured and sold phenytoin sodium capsules to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin, the CMA said. In September 2012, Pfizer sold the distribution rights for Epanutin to Flynn Pharma, which de-branded the drug, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"Although Pfizer has claimed that Epanutin was loss-making before it was de-branded, the CMA has calculated that, according to Pfizer’s figures, all such losses would have been recovered within two months of the price rises,\" the regulator said. \nPhenytoin sodium, sold as Dilantin in the U.S., is used to prevent and control seizures by reducing the spread of seizure activity in the brain. \nCrack Down on Behavior \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" the CMA’s Marsden said. \nBy Patrick Gower",

It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.  ",

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton (Copyright Reuters 2016) \nBritish regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Britain Just Fined Pfizer a Record $107 Million Over a Huge Drug Price Hike \nBritain’s competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($107 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600%. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. \nThe CMA’s ruling comes amid a growing debate on both sides of the Atlantic about the ethics of price hikes for old off-patent medicines that are only made by a few firms and where there is little competition. \nU.S. drugmaker Turing Pharmaceuticals, led at the time by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli, caused outrage last year by raising the U.S. price of Daraprim, an old anti-infective drug, by more than 5,000% to $750 a pill. \nIn the case of phenytoin sodium capsules, the U.K. price charged for 100 mg packs of the drug jumped from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 in 2012, before reducing to 54.00 from May 2014. \nAs a result, annual spending on the capsules by Britain’s National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said U.K. prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \n\nPfizer pfe used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012. \nIt was then debranded, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation, and the price soared. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA’s case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour.” \nPfizer said in a statement it planned to appeal all aspects of the CMA’s verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25% to 40% less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form from another supplier. \nFlynn also plans to appeal. Chief executive David Fakes said punishing Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules for less than phenytoin tablets “beggars belief.” ",

      "text": "December 7, 2016 6:16 AM Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press   LONDON \nBritish regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Related content",

      "title": "UK fines Pfizer $113 million for drug price hike",
      "text": "AP December 7, 2016, 8:18 AM UK fines Pfizer $113 million for drug price hike Stumble \nLONDON - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer ( PFE ) and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged “excessive and unfair prices” for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. An analysis by Reuters earlier this year found that list prices for the best-selling drugs in the U.S. has risen anywhere from 50 to 100 percent ... \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer’s name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n“In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,” Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n“The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,” the company said. “Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.” \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan ( MYL ) said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals’ former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. © 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images)\nUS pharma giant Pfizer, along with a distributor, have been slapped with a record fine for hiking UK drug prices by 2,600% overnight.\nIn September 2012, the amount the NHS was charged for 100mg packs of the anti-epilepsy drug phenytoin sodium went from £2.83 to £67.50, according to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). As a result of the price increase, NHS expenditure on the drug increased from about £2 million a year in 2012 to around £50 million in 2013.\nThe CMA has ordered the two companies involved, the US pharma giant Pfizer and UK-based distributor Flynn Pharma, to pay record fines of £84.2 million and £5.2 million respectively, and to reduce their prices for phenytoin sodium. Both have said that they will be taking legal action to overturn the decision.\nRead 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Wall Street Breakfast: Senate Committee Mulls AT&T-Time Warner Merger (Seeking Alpha) \nShares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) were little changed after the company said it will appeal a $106 million fine by the United Kingdom's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). \nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Pfizer was slapped with a £84.2 million fine for charging the country's National Health Service high prices for its phenytoin sodium capsules which is an anti-epilepsy drug. \nThe CMA also fined a distributor of the drug, Flynn Pharma, £5.2 million and ordered both companies to reduce their prices. \nClose to 50,000 patients in the United Kingdom rely on Pfizer's therapy, which has seen the price of a 100mg pack soar to £67.50 from £2.83 after Pfizer sold the rights to sell the drug to Flynn Pharma back in 2012. \nWednesday's fine marks yet another concerning headline and shows that the drug price debate is far from being settled. \nThe price of the drug was reduced to £54 in May of 2014 although even including the price reduction the price of the drug has risen higher compared to any other European country. \nThe fine represents the highest penalty the CMA has ever imposed. \n\"Businesses are generally free to set prices as they see fit but those holding a dominant position should not abuse this situation and set prices that are excessive and unfair,\" Philip Marsden, Chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation, said in a press release . \"There is no justification for such rises when phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug for which there has been no recent innovation or significant investment.\" © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "title": "Britain fines Pfizer record £84.2 million for huge drug price hike",
      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | December 7, 2016 : 9:10 PM MYT Translated by Google Translator: Translated by Google Translator: \nLONDON (Dec 7): Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record £84.2 million for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600%. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma £5.2 million for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. \nThe CMA's ruling comes amid a growing debate on both sides of the Atlantic about the ethics of price hikes for old off-patent medicines that are only made by a few firms and where there is little competition. \nUS drugmaker Turing Pharmaceuticals, led at the time by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli, caused outrage last year by raising the US price of Daraprim, an old anti-infective drug, by more than 5,000% to US$750 a pill. \nIn the case of phenytoin sodium capsules, the UK price charged for 100 mg packs of the drug jumped from £2.83 to £67.50 in 2012, before reducing to £54 from May 2014. \nAs a result, annual spending on the capsules by Britain's National Health Service rose from £2 million in 2012 to about £50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately-owned British company, in September 2012. \nIt was then debranded, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation, and the price soared. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior.\" \nPfizer said in a statement it planned to appeal all aspects of the CMA's verdict. \nThe US drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40% less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form from another supplier. \nFlynn also plans to appeal. Chief executive David Fakes said punishing Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules for less than phenytoin tablets \"beggars belief\". Related Articles",

      "text": "LONDON -- British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. The authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. Pfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. Pfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" Regulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. In one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. In another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.",

      "text": "Home » News » Health News » Pfizer fined $106 mn for 'unfair' prices of epilepsy drug Pfizer fined $106 mn for 'unfair' prices of epilepsy drug 45   London, Dec 7 : Britain's competition regulator on Wednesday imposed a record 84.2 million pound ($106 million) fine on the pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer, and a 5.2 million pound ($6.55 million) fine on the distributor Flynn Pharma after finding that each broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices for an anti-epilepsy drug. [NK Health] The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also ordered the companies to reduce their prices. The fines -- the highest the CMA has imposed -- follow prices increase by up to 2,600 per cent overnight after the drug was deliberately de-branded in September 2012, the CMA said in a statement. Pfizer rejected the findings and said it would appeal against the decision, BBC reported. In order to ensure that there should be no risk to the ongoing supply of phenytoin sodium capsules to those patients who rely on it, the competition regulator has given Pfizer and Flynn between 30 working days and four months to reduce their respective prices. As a result of the price increases, Britain's National Health Service (NHS) expenditure on phenytoin sodium capsules increased from about 2 million pound ($2.52 million) a year in 2012 to about 50 million pound ($63 million) in 2013, the CMA noted. The prices of the drug in Britain have also been many times higher than Pfizer's prices for the same drug in any other European country, the regulator said. Phenytoin sodium capsules are used in the treatment of epilepsy to prevent and control seizures, and are an important drug for an estimated 48,000 patients in Britain. Epilepsy patients who are already taking phenytoin sodium capsules should not usually be switched to other products, including another manufacturer's version of the product, due to the risk of loss of seizure control which can have serious health consequences. As a result, the NHS had no alternative to paying the increased prices for the drug. Prior to September 2012, Pfizer manufactured and sold phenytoin sodium capsules to UK wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin and the prices of the drug were regulated. In September 2012, Pfizer sold the distribution rights for Epanutin to Flynn Pharma, which de-branded the drug, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients. These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds,\" said Philip Marsden, Chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation. Since September 2012, Pfizer has continued to manufacture phenytoin sodium capsules and has supplied them to Flynn Pharma at prices that were significantly higher than those at which it previously sold Epanutin in Britain. Flynn Pharma then szold on the products to wholesalers and pharmacies in Britain charging them prices which have been between 2,300 per cent and 2,600 per cent higher than those they had previously paid for the drug. The final decision and fines relate to both the prices that Pfizer has charged to Flynn Pharma and the prices that Flynn Pharma has charged to its customers, since September 2012, the CMA said. Although Pfizer has claimed that Epanutin was loss-making before it was de-branded, the CMA calculated that, according to Pfizer's figures, all such losses would have been recovered within two months of the price rises. Both companies will continue to be able to charge prices which are profitable, but their prices must not be excessive and unfair, the CMA said. gb/vt",

      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nLONDON—Pfizer Inc. has become the latest drugmaker taken to task for high prices after U.K. authorities slapped the company with a record £ 84.2 million ($107 million) fine over the price of an anti-epilepsy drug.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday that Pfizer and drug-distribution company Flynn Pharma broke competition law by charging unfair prices in the U.K. for phenytoin sodium capsules, an anti-epilepsy drug used by around 48,000 patients in the country.\nThe CMA said the Pfizer fine was the highest it had ever imposed. The regulator also fined Flynn Pharma £ 5.2 million and has ordered both companies to reduce their prices.\nDrug prices have become a hot political issue in the U.S., where companies are free to set the price and increase it at any time. The issue is less incendiary in the U.K., where the price of drugs typically is well-controlled.\nThe CMA said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma took advantage of a peculiarity of the U.K. system. The price of branded drugs is determined by negotiations between the government and pharmaceutical companies. Unbranded, or generic, drugs may be freely priced, but competition between suppliers typically drives the cost down.\nThe regulator said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma \"deliberately debranded\" the drug in 2012 to raise the price and were able to do so because there were no competing suppliers.\nThe CMA said the price of a 100-milligram pack of phenytoin sodium shot up—to £ 67.50 from £ 2.83—after Pfizer sold the rights to sell the drug to Flynn Pharma in September 2012. It said the price decreased to £ 54 in May 2014. Before the agreement, Pfizer had sold phenytoin sodium capsules directly to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin.\nThe price increase was partly because Pfizer, which continued to manufacture phenytoin sodium, sold the drug to Flynn Pharma at up to 17 times the price than it charged wholesalers and pharmacies previously, the regulator said. Flynn Pharma hiked the price further still.\nThe case has echoes of the scandal that gained U.S. pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli widespread notoriety over the past year and a half. His company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the rights to Daraprim, a half-century-old drug that treats a parasitic infection, and raised the price more than 50-fold.\nA spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company \"approached this divestment with integrity and believes it fully complies with established competition law.\"\nShe said phenytoin capsules were unprofitable for Pfizer before the deal with Flynn Pharma and the transaction secured ongoing supply of the medicine. The spokeswoman added that the price charged by Flynn Pharma was 25% to 40% lower than that for an equivalent, branded epilepsy medicine whose price was regulated.\nPhilip Marsden, the chairman of the case decision group for the CMA investigation, said the companies \"deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price of a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients.\"\nAlthough Pfizer said the drug was unprofitable before debranding, the losses would have been recovered within two months of the price rises, Mr. Marsden said.\n\"There is no justification for such rises when phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug for which there has been no recent innovation or significant investment,\" he said.\nA spokesman for Flynn Pharma said the CMA's judgment used \"an entirely novel theory as to the level of margin that can be made by a generic company [that] has never been discussed, let alone agreed, with the pharmaceutical industry.\"\nWarwick Smith, director-general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, an industry body, said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma's behavior \"broke the virtuous cycle\" between innovator and generic companies in which drugs that lose patent protection sharply fall in price, allowing the health system to afford the higher prices for new medicines.\n\"We would never support activity designed purely to artificially increase prices,\" he said.\nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-07-160835ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Pfizer ( PFE ) was fined by the U.K. competition regulator on Wednesday over the sale of epilepsy drug rights to Flynn Pharma, which saw treatment prices rise by 2,600% less than a year after the transaction.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority imposed an £84.2 million ($106 million) fine on Pfizer and a £5.2 million fine against Flynn for anti-competitive practices.\nPfizer sold the U.K. rights for Epanutin, a Phenytoin sodium capsule treatment, to Flynn in 2012. In September of the same year, Flynn debranded the drug which made it a generic and took it outside the scope of government price regulation.\nThe move enabled Flynn to implement a steep price hike, pushing up the price packet up to £67.50 from £2.83. Subsequently, expenditure on the genericized Epanutin at the National Health Service rose to £50 million in 2013 from £2 million in 2012.\n\"There is no justification for such rises when phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug for which there has been no recent innovation or significant investment,\" Philip Marsden, Chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation, said in a statement.\nThe regulator said Pfizer and Flynn have up to four months to reduce their prices or they will face further regulatory action.\nThe U.S. drug giant's stock was indicated 0.54% higher, at $31.73 at 06:30 EST, in pre-market trading on Wednesday.\nWednesday's fine is not the first time that the CMA has taken action against pharma companies over drug pricing related issues.",

      "text": "Pfizer Fined $107 Million for Overcharging U.K. for Epilepsy Drug -- 2nd Update December 07, 2016, 08:20:  By Denise Roland \nLONDON-- Pfizer Inc. has become the latest drugmaker taken to task for high prices after U.K. authorities slapped the company with a record GBP84.2 million ($107 million) fine over the price of an anti-epilepsy drug. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday that Pfizer and drug-distribution company Flynn Pharma broke competition law by charging unfair prices in the U.K. for phenytoin sodium capsules, an anti-epilepsy drug used by around 48,000 patients in the country. \nSpokespeople for Pfizer and Flynn Pharma said the companies rejected the CMA's findings and would appeal all aspects of the decision. \nDrug prices have become a hot political issue in the U.S., where companies are free to set the price and increase it at any time. The issue is less incendiary in the U.K., where the price of drugs typically is well-controlled. \nThe CMA said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma took advantage of a peculiarity of the U.K. system. The price of branded drugs is determined by negotiations between the government and pharmaceutical companies. Unbranded, or generic, drugs may be freely priced, but competition between suppliers typically drives the cost down. \nThe regulator said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma \"deliberately debranded\" the drug in 2012 to raise the price and were able to do so because there were no competing suppliers. \nThe CMA said the price of a 100-milligram pack of phenytoin sodium shot up--to GBP67.50 from GBP2.83--after Pfizer sold the rights to sell the drug to Flynn Pharma in September 2012. It said the price decreased to GBP54 in May 2014. Before the agreement, Pfizer had sold phenytoin sodium capsules directly to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin. \nThe price increase was partly because Pfizer, which continued to manufacture phenytoin sodium, sold the drug to Flynn Pharma at up to 17 times the price than it charged wholesalers and pharmacies previously, the regulator said. Flynn Pharma hiked the price further still. \nThe case has echoes of the scandal that gained U.S. pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli widespread notoriety over the past year and a half. His company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the rights to Daraprim, a half-century-old drug that treats a parasitic infection, and raised the price more than 50-fold. \nA spokeswoman for Pfizer said the company \"approached this divestment with integrity and believes it fully complies with established competition law.\" \nShe said phenytoin capsules were unprofitable for Pfizer before the deal with Flynn Pharma and the transaction secured ongoing supply of the medicine. The spokeswoman added that the price charged by Flynn Pharma was 25% to 40% lower than that for an equivalent, branded epilepsy medicine whose price was regulated. \nPhilip Marsden, the chairman of the case decision group for the CMA investigation, said the companies \"deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price of a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients.\" \nAlthough Pfizer said the drug was unprofitable before debranding, the losses would have been recovered within two months of the price rises, Mr. Marsden said. \n\"There is no justification for such rises when phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug for which there has been no recent innovation or significant investment,\" he said. \nA spokesman for Flynn Pharma said the CMA's judgment used \"an entirely novel theory as to the level of margin that can be made by a generic company [that] has never been discussed, let alone agreed, with the pharmaceutical industry.\" \nWarwick Smith, director-general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, an industry body, said Pfizer and Flynn Pharma's behavior \"broke the virtuous cycle\" between innovator and generic companies in which drugs that lose patent protection sharply fall in price, allowing the health system to afford the higher prices for new medicines. \n\"We would never support activity designed purely to artificially increase prices,\" he said. \nWrite to Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-07-160820ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press Updated 17 min ago ( … ) \nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Tags",

      "text": "December 7, 2016 - Business - no comments By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press FILE – In this Monday, Nov. 23, 2015, file photo, a woman passes Pfizer’s world headquarters, in New York. British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016 for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged “excessive and unfair prices” for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer’s name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n“In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,” Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n“The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,” the company said. “Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.” \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals’ former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Share this:",

      "text": "Shares of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) were little changed after the company said it will appeal a $106 million fine by the United Kingdom's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Pfizer was slapped with a £84.2 million fine for charging the country's National Health Service high prices for its phenytoin sodium capsules which is an anti-epilepsy drug.\nThe CMA also fined a distributor of the drug, Flynn Pharma, £5.2 million and ordered both companies to reduce their prices.\nClose to 50,000 patients in the United Kingdom rely on Pfizer's therapy, which has seen the price of a 100mg pack soar to £67.50 from £2.83 after Pfizer sold the rights to sell the drug to Flynn Pharma back in 2012.\nWednesday's fine marks yet another concerning headline and shows that the drug price debate is far from being settled.\nThe price of the drug was reduced to £54 in May of 2014 although even including the price reduction the price of the drug has risen higher compared to any other European country.\nThe fine represents the highest penalty the CMA has ever imposed.\n\"Businesses are generally free to set prices as they see fit but those holding a dominant position should not abuse this situation and set prices that are excessive and unfair,\" Philip Marsden, Chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation, said in a press release . \"There is no justification for such rises when phenytoin sodium capsules are a very old drug for which there has been no recent innovation or significant investment.\"\n ",

      "title": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK",
      "text": "By DANICA KIRKA\nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent.\nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds.\n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement.\nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012.\n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said.\nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma.\n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said.\nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS.\n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\"\nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development.\nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions.\nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.\n ",

      "text": "LONDON - British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 per cent.\nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds.\nFILE - In this Monday, Nov. 23, 2015, file photo, a woman passes Pfizer's world headquarters, in New York. British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016 for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)\n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement.\nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012.\n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said.\nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma.\n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said.\nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 per cent to 40 per cent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS.\n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\"\nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development.\nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions.\nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 per cent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.\n ",

      "text": "Modal Trigger Photo: Getty Images \nBritain’s competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record 84.2 million pounds ($107 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. \nThe CMA’s ruling comes amid a growing debate on both sides of the Atlantic about the ethics of price hikes for old off-patent medicines that are only made by a few firms and where there is little competition. \nU.S. drugmaker Turing Pharmaceuticals, led at the time by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli, caused outrage last year by raising the U.S. price of Daraprim , an old anti-infective drug, by more than 5,000 percent to $750 a pill. \nIn the case of phenytoin sodium capsules, the UK price charged for 100 mg packs of the drug jumped from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 in 2012, before reducing to 54.00 from May 2014. \nAs a result, annual spending on the capsules by Britain’s National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012. \nIt was then debranded, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation, and the price soared. \n“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA’s case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n“This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behaviour.” \nPfizer said in a statement it planned to appeal all aspects of the CMA’s verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form from another supplier. \nFlynn also plans to appeal. Chief executive David Fakes said punishing Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules for less than phenytoin tablets “beggars belief”. Share this: ",

The CMA said UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012. \nIt was then debranded, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation, and the price soared. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior.\" \nThe previous highest fine of 58.5 million pounds was handed to British Airways (L: ICAG ) in 2012 for colluding with rival Virgin Atlantic ( VA.UL ) on fuel surcharges. That was imposed by the CMA's predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading. \nPfizer said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form from another supplier. \nFlynn's chief executive David Fakes said punishing his company, which also plans to appeal, for selling phenytoin capsules for less than phenytoin tablets \"beggars belief\". \nThe CMA also ordered both to reduce their prices, a move that lawyers said could trigger claims for redress from customers who had been over-charged. \nIn February it fined GlaxoSmithKline (L: GSK ) 37.6 million pounds for striking deals to delay the launch of cheap generic copies of its former blockbuster antidepressant Seroxat. \nThe watchdog has four other ongoing investigations into the pharmaceutical sector.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) London • British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. Pfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. Pfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" Regulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. In one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. In another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.",

      "text": "Pfizer chief executive Ian Read. PA \nLONDON — Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer a record £84.2 million ($106.5 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma £5.2 million for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. The CMA had first accused the companies over the matter last year. \nPfizer is appealing the decision. \nAs a result of the price increase, spending on the capsules by the NHS rose from £2 million a year in 2012 to about £50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices for the capsules were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine itself, under the brand name Epanutin, but it sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012, after which the product was debranded and the price soared. \nThe decision to debrand the drug, or make it available as a generic product, meant that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by debranding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group, said on Wednesday. \n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.\" \nPfizer, in a statement, disputed the CMA's decision and said it planned to appeal all aspects of the verdict. \nThe U.S. drugmaker said the medicine had been loss-making and it was therefore forced to consider whether it could continue supplying it. Pfizer added that the price set by Flynn was actually 25 to 40 percent less than the cost of an equivalent tablet form of the medicine from another supplier. \nNo one was immediately available at Flynn for comment.

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600 pct in UK By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press Updated 1 hr ago ( … ) \nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS.   \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. Tags",

      "text": "London (AFP) - Britain's competition watchdog said Wednesday it had fined Pfizer Â£84 million after the US pharmaceutical giant hiked massively the price of an anti-epilepsy drug, heavily impacting the tax-funded National Health Service.\n\"The Competition and Markets Authority has imposed a record Â£84.2 million ($106.3 million, 99.1 million euros) fine on... Pfizer, and a Â£5.2 million fine on the distributor Flynn Pharma after finding that each broke competition law by charging excessive and unfair prices in the UK for phenytoin sodium capsules,\" the CMA said in a statement.\nThe watchdog also ordered the pair to reduce their prices.\nIn a separate statement, Pfizer said it \"refutes the findings\" and would lodge an appeal.\nThe CMA said the fines followed \"prices increasing by up to 2,600 percent overnight after the drug was deliberately de-branded in September 2012\", meaning it was no longer subject to price regulation.\nAs a result, National Health Service expenditure on phenytoin sodium capsules increased from about Â£2 million a year in 2012 to about Â£50 million in 2013, the watchdog claimed.\n\"The prices of the drug in the UK have also been many times higher than Pfizerâs prices for the same drug in any other European country,\" it added.\nThe CMA said phenytoin sodium capsules are used to prevent and control seizures for around 48,000 patients in the UK.\nBut since epilepsy patients who take the capsules are advised not to switch to other products owing to possible loss of seizure control, the NHS had no choice but to pay the increases, it added.\n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" said Philip Marsden, who chaired the CMA investigation's decision group.\n\"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds,\" he added.",

      "text": "LONDON, Dec. 7 (UPI) -- Britain's antitrust regulator fined Pfizer Inc. a record $107 million Wednesday because of skyrocketing price increases for generic versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority announced Pfizer and drug-distribution company Flynn Pharma hiked prices of the drug by up to 2,600 percent for around 48,000 patients in the country in September 2012. Pfizer had transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium. Flynn was fined $6.55 million.\n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation, said in a statement. \"These extraordinary price rises have cost the [National Health Service] and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.''\nThe NHS spent about $63 million on the anti-epilepsy capsules in 2013 and $50 million in 2014, the CMA said in its August 2015 complaint.\nThe prices jumped 25 fold. The 100-milligram packs of the drug soared from $3.53 to $84.69, before dropping to $68.05 starting in May 2014, the CMA said Wednesday.\nWarwick Smith, an official with the British Generic Manufacturers Association, an industry body, told The Wall Street Journal the two companies \"broke the virtuous cycle\" between innovator and generic companies when drugs sharply fall in price after they lose their patent protection.\nBoth companies plan to appeal .\n\"Phenytoin capsules were a loss-making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture,\" the company said in a statement. \"When Flynn launched its product, the company set a price that was between 25 and 40 percent less than the price of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS which had long been regulated, and appeared to be acceptable to, the Department of Health.\"\nA Flynn spokesman said, \"Phenytoin sodium capsules are already less expensive than the alternative equivalent drugs in the U.K. market. It beggars belief that the CMA seeks to punish Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules at a significant discount to phenytoin tablets.\"\nThe CMA calculated that, according to Pfizer's figures, all such losses would have been recovered within two months of the price increases.\n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" the CMA's Marsden said.\nPhenytoin sodium is sold as Dilantin in the United States.\nOther drugmakers have been blasted for soaring prices.\nIn 2015, U.S. pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli 's Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to Daraprim, a half-century-old drug that treats a parasitic infection, and raised the price more than 50-fold.\nAnd Mylan has rocketed the price of its injectable medication EpiPen to more than $600, a six-fold increase from 2007.\n European Commission fines JP Morgan Chase, HSBC, Credit Agricole $520M for collusion Pfizer to acquire part of AstraZeneca's antibiotics business Pfizer to buy prostate cancer drug maker Medivation for $14 billion FDA panel votes to remove serious warning from Chantix label",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600% in UK By Danica Kirka , Associated Press | Updated - Dec 7th, 2016 @ 9:28am 0  \nLONDON (AP) — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said.

But it’s far from being the drug company with the most pricing power. File photo taken in 2016 shows Pfizer's company logo outside the pharmaceutical giant's New York headquarters. (Photo: DON EMMERT, AFP/Getty Images) \nA British regulator on Wednesday hit U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer with a record $107 million fine for imposing a 2600% price hike on an anti-epilepsy medication, the latest episode in widening public controversy over prescription drug prices. \nNew York-based Pfizer broke a competition law by \"charging excessive and unfair prices\" in the United Kingdom for phenytoin sodiumcapsules in Sept. 2012, after the drug was deliberately de-branded, said the Competition and Markets Authority , Britain's top regulator. \nPfizer ( PFE ) denied the allegation and said it would appeal the ruling. The company's shares were down 2.1% at $30.89 in morning trading after the announcement. \nThe regulator said the cost of the anti-epilepsy drug used by an estimated 48,000 U.K. patients to prevent and control medical seizures jumped from $3.57 for 100-milligram packages of the medication to $85.06. The price was ultimately reduced to $68.05 in May 2014, the CMA said. \nAs a result, Britain's National Health Service annual spending for the drug rose from roughly $2.5 million in 2012 to approximately $63 million the following year, the CMA said. \nEpilepsy patients who have already been using phenytoin sodium capsules usually should not switch to alternative medications, so the health service was forced to pay the higher prices, the regulator said. A timeline of eye-popping drug prices \n\"Businesses are generally free to set prices as they see fit but those holding a dominant position should not abuse this situation and set prices that are excessive and unfair,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the CMA's case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement issued with the announcement. \nThe regulator also imposed a $6.5 million fine on British drug distributor Flynn Pharma over separate price increases of the anti-epilepsy medication. \nFlynn and Pfizer have held a dominant position in their respective U.K. markets for the manufacture and supply of the drug, the CMA said. \nThe companies were ordered given 30 working days to four months to cut their prices for the drug. The regulator also said the firms would be allowed to charge prices that are profitable but not excessive. \n\"Pfizer refutes the findings set out in the Competition and Markets Authority decision. In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" the company said in a formal statement. \nThe medication was \"a loss making product\" for the company, the Pfizer said. The fine and ruling \"highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.\", Pfizer added, saying it will seek clarity on the issues as part of its appeal. \nFlynn also said it would appeal, characterizing the CMA ruling as \"based on a wholly flawed understanding of the U.K. pharmaceutical market.\" \nThe British fines come amid U.S. complaints and investigations of other pharmaceutical companies for similar price hikes on widely used prescription drugs. Mylan to pay $465M settlement over EpiPen, cuts earnings outlook \nMylan drew criticism this year after the cost of EpiPen, a life-saving anti-allergy injection, rose to about $600 for a two-pack, up from about $100 in 2009. The company agreed to a $465 million settlement with regulators over the way the medication was classified for reimbursement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Former Shkreli firm responsible for 5,000% drug hike sued \nSimilarly, Turing Pharmaceuticals and Martin Shkreli, the company's former CEO, became subjects of drug pricing investigations following a price hike that raised the cost of a drug that treats dangerous infections in people weakened by AIDS and cancer from $13.50 to $750 per pill. \n  Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc  ",

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600% Wednesday Dec 7, 2016 at 7:42 AM Dec 7, 2016 at 7:46 AM Associated Press \nLONDON — British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record $112.7 million Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent.Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged “excessive and unfair prices” for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. “This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,” Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement.The authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer’s name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012.“The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,” Marsden said.Pfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma.“In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,” Pfizer said.Pfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS.Regulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development.In one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions.In another, Turing Pharmaceuticals’ former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. About Us ",

      "title": "Pfizer, Flynn get record fine on 2,600 percent drug price increase",
      "text": "Pfizer, Flynn get record fine on 2,600 percent drug price increase By Patrick Gower, Bloomberg Published: December 7, 2016 10:15 AM CDT Updated: December 7, 2016 10:35 AM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma were fined a record amount for abusing their dominant position in the U.K. by charging unfair prices for unbranded versions of the Epanutin anti-epilepsy drug. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority fined Pfizer 84.2 million pounds ($106 million) and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds after they increased prices by as much as 2,600 percent in September 2012, the regulator said Wednesday. The price increases occurred after Pfizer transferred distribution rights to Flynn, which sold the medicine by its generic name, phenytoin sodium. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" said Philip Marsden, chairman of the Case Decision Group for the CMA's investigation. \"These extraordinary price rises have cost the NHS and the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds.'' \nBritain's National Health Service spent about 50 million pounds on the anti-epilepsy capsules in 2013 and 40 million pounds in 2014, the CMA said in its August 2015 complaint. The amount the NHS was charged for 100-milligram packs of the drug \"rocketed\" from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 pounds, before dropping to 54 pounds starting in May 2014, the CMA said Wednesday. \nPfizer said that it \"refutes\" the findings of the regulator. Both companies said they will appeal. \n\"Phenytoin capsules were a loss-making product for Pfizer and the Flynn transaction represented an opportunity to secure ongoing supply of an important medicine for patients with epilepsy, while maintaining continuity of manufacture,\" the company said in a statement. \"When Flynn launched its product, the company set a price that was between 25 and 40 percent less than the price of the equivalent medicine from another supplier to the NHS which had long been regulated, and appeared to be acceptable to, the Department of Health.\" \nA Flynn spokesman said the CMA had \"ignored or misunderstood\" important aspects of its investigation, including the fact that alternative epilepsy drugs were more expensive than phenytoin. \n\"Phenytoin sodium capsules are already less expensive than the alternative equivalent drugs in the U.K. market,\" a Flynn spokesman said. \"It beggars belief that the CMA seeks to punish Flynn for selling phenytoin capsules at a significant discount to phenytoin tablets.\" \nSteep price hikes have put a string of drugmakers under the microscope in the U.S. with companies like Mylan and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. bearing the brunt of the public outrage. President-elect Donald Trump, who had been cited as a boon to free-market health care, also declared himself an opponent of high drug prices in an interview with Time magazine. His comments weighed down biotech stocks in the U.S. on Wednesday. \n\"Illegal excessive pricing is usually very difficult to prove -- how do you identify the 'right' price and how much extra margin is 'excessive?'\" said Duncan Liddell, a competition partner at law firm Ashurst. \"Here the CMA has clearly decided to make a point with a record U.K. fine.\" \nPrior to September 2012, prices were regulated when Pfizer manufactured and sold phenytoin sodium capsules to U.K. wholesalers and pharmacies under the brand name Epanutin, the CMA said. In September 2012, Pfizer sold the distribution rights for Epanutin to Flynn Pharma, which de-branded the drug, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation. \n\"Although Pfizer has claimed that Epanutin was loss-making before it was de-branded, the CMA has calculated that, according to Pfizer's figures, all such losses would have been recovered within 2 months of the price rises,\" the regulator said. \nPhenytoin sodium, sold as Dilantin in the U.S., is used to prevent and control seizures by reducing the spread of seizure activity in the brain. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" the CMA's Marsden said. \n(c) 2016, Bloomberg Subscribe to NewsOK's Business Headlines Stay up to date with business news in Oklahoma and around the country.

      "text": "Pfizer fined for hiking epilepsy drug price 2,600% in UK DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 12:56   Previous Next \nLONDON (AP) -- British regulators fined U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and distributor Flynn Pharma a record 89.4 million pounds ($112.7 million) Wednesday for increasing the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nPfizer and Flynn Pharma charged \"excessive and unfair prices\" for the drug used by 48,000 people in Britain, the Competition and Markets Authority said. Pfizer was fined 84.2 million pounds and Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds. \n\"This is the highest fine the CMA has imposed and it sends out a clear message to the sector that we are determined to crack down on such behavior and to protect customers, including the NHS, and taxpayers from being exploited,\" Philip Marsden, chairman of the case decision group for the investigation, said in a statement. \nThe authority said the companies removed the official brand of Epanutin, Pfizer's name for phenytoin sodium capsules, so they could increase the price. As a result, the National Health Service saw the bill for drug increase to 50 million pounds in 2013, from 2 million pounds in 2012. \n\"The companies deliberately exploited the opportunity offered by de-branding to hike up the price for a drug which is relied upon by many thousands of patients,\" Marsden said. \nPfizer rejected the ruling, saying that Epanutin was a loss-making product and the deal with Flynn Pharma helped secure supplies of the drug for patients. It plans to appeal, as does Flynn Pharma. \n\"In this transaction, and in all of our business operations, we approached this divestment with integrity, and believe it fully complies with established competition law,\" Pfizer said. \nPfizer said the increased price of the drug was still 25 percent to 40 percent lower than the cost of an equivalent medicine by another supplier to the NHS. \n\"The ruling highlights real policy and legal issues concerning the respective roles of both the Department of Health and the CMA, in regulating the price of pharmaceutical products in the U.K.,\" the company said. \"Pfizer will seek clarity on these issues as part of the appeal process.\" \nRegulators around the world are getting tough on drugmakers amid soaring prices that companies say are justified by years of research and product development. \nIn one recent case, drugmaker Mylan said it would pay $465 million to settle allegations it overbilled Medicaid, the U.S. program that provides health insurance for poor people, for its EpiPen, used to provide emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions. \nIn another, Turing Pharmaceuticals' former CEO Martin Shkreli increased the price of Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The drug is the only approved treatment for toxoplasmosis, a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients.  ",

      "text": "Britain fines Pfizer record $107 million for huge drug price hike Wed Dec 7, 2016 9:22am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Ben Hirschler \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog has fined Pfizer PFE.N a record 84.2 million pounds ($107 million) for its role in ramping up the cost of an epilepsy drug by as much as 2,600 percent. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also fined Flynn Pharma 5.2 million pounds for overcharging for phenytoin sodium capsules, following a dramatic price hike in 2012. \nThe CMA's ruling comes amid a growing debate on both sides of the Atlantic about the ethics of price hikes for old off-patent medicines that are only made by a few firms and where there is little competition. \nU.S. drugmaker Turing Pharmaceuticals, led at the time by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli, caused outrage last year by raising the U.S. price of Daraprim, an old anti-infective drug, by more than 5,000 percent to $750 a pill. \nIn the case of phenytoin sodium capsules, the UK price charged for 100 mg packs of the drug jumped from 2.83 pounds to 67.50 in 2012, before reducing to 54.00 from May 2014. \nAs a result, annual spending on the capsules by Britain's National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe. \nPfizer used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012. \nIt was then debranded, meaning that it was no longer subject to price regulation, and the price soared.
