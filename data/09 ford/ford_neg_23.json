      "title": "Why Ford?",
      "text": "About interest rates and automakers. \nThe valuation of Ford raises eyebrows, the bears argue. \nBut is it really expensive at $12 a share? About a year ago, CNBC wrote : \nOne of the industries that will be most keyed in on what the Fed does with interest rates is the automobile sector, which has used seven years of cheap rates to rebound after nearly capsizing during the financial crisis .\" It noted that light vehicle sales had doubled since the crisis lows, \" from just more than 9 million in February 2009 to just more than 18 million in November 2015 .\" Latest annualized vehicle sales figures in the US are shown in the chart below. Click to enlarge (Source: tradingeconomics.com) If you think interest rates will return to their long-term average, then you should read this paper flagged by CNBC last year, which discusses the effect of less accomodative monetary policies on the household and automakers. This is relevant due to the importance of consumer spending trends across the US, and given how rates have fared in recent times, which clearly has had an impact on several stocks in the consumer staples world . (Source: marketwatch.com) Expectations are not particularly encouraging for the bulls here, I am afraid, with the market forecasting a rate hike of at least 50 basis points next month. Click to enlarge (Source: cmegroup.com) So, big-ticket items might feel the pinch of rapidly rising rates -- but will Ford (NYSE: F ) shareholders be affected, too? To understand how things are going, here are the highlights for sales in October . Click to enlarge (Source: Ford Motor) True, the headline figures were poor. However, its performance outside of the US also deserves a mention. China The Detroit News reported in early November that in China \" the automaker and its joint ventures sold a record 107,618 vehicles in China last month, as sales rose 13.6 percent year-over-year, \" helped by \" the Mustang, Explorer, Edge and small sedans. \" This is an important detail, given the size of the Chinese auto market, trends and forecasts. Click to enlarge (Source: FT.com) News agency Reuters noted on 18 November that carmakers in China \" are fretting over whether a tax break that has propped up sales this year will be extended, with an end to the policy possibly leading to the first annual decline in sales on record for the world's largest auto market. \" \nThe topic has dominated talk at the Guangzhou auto show which starts on Friday, even as industry executives work hard to promote new SUVs and electric cars, currently the highest growth segments in China. \" The risk is that next year China would bring less benefits and more risk as competition intensifies in the SUV segment . Still, Ford has delivered in China and long-term trends there make it a compelling market where to establish new ties and partnerships. Ford should continue to do just that. In The News While the automaker recently hit the headlines for the real story behind \" that exaggerated Ford tweet from Donald Trump ,\" Ford eventually informed Mr. Trump that \" no Lincoln SUV production (was) going to Mexico \". Click to enlarge (Source: CNBC ) Meanwhile, a very interesting article published on this platform -- and titled \"Is Ford Going Under $10?\" -- recently questioned what could happen to the dividend if Ford's margins and earnings continue to shrink. Projections are shown in the table below. Click to enlarge (Source: 4-traders.com) In fairness, if the valuation of Ford drops to $10 a share its forward yield would rise to 6%, excluding special dividends early next year, which are very likely in my opinion -- and this is why Ford remains a solid yield play even at about $12 a share, where it currently trades. Dividends Between 1956 and 1965 , its quarterly dividend per share ranged between $0.45 and $0.60, surging up to $0.80 over the next ten years, excluding special dividends. Then Ford started to be serious about the payout in 1976, and trends over the next three decades were good, barring the early 1980s and 1990s. In those days, SAAR figures comfortably averaged around 15 million, but other markets were nowhere close to reaching that threshold. Click to enlarge (Source: amigobulls.com) Recession risk is real now, yet there are no concrete signs that we'll be deeply troubled until mid-2018. Although consumer spending growth could become less effective in the second half of 2017, investors still have one full quarter or more, in my opinion, to add Ford to their portfolios, even at a slightly higher price than $12 a share, as I recently argued . Its stock is not a hard bargain, of course, but offers protection to downside risk. Even a dividend cut to $0.40 annually ($0.10 quarterly) would imply a yield north of 3%. How about that in a world where rates at the front end of the yield curve may not rise as fast as the bulls expect? Click to enlarge (Source:calculatedriskblog.com) Given the current strength in the US dollar and the shape of the yield curve, mid/long-term yields may also find it more difficult to keep rallying, particularly considering the latest headlines that paint a mixed picture with regard to inflation and the prospects for substitutes in the auto industry. Click to enlarge (Source: marketwatch.com) CAT and bears There are other risks, of course, but in order to gauge the dividend risk embedded in Ford stock, you should also look at Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ), which is a highly cyclical heavy-duty name; its stock has skyrocketed in recent months despite obvious pressures on its operating performance, after years of rapidly falling revenues and diminishing cash flows, which are unlikely to surprise on the upside through to 2017. CAT yields 3.2% on a forward basis. While some pundits have argued that the dividend of Ford is at risk, chief financial officer Bob Shanks recently noted that: \nCapital allocation through 2018 will focus mainly on product, emerging opportunities and shareholder actions. In line with this, Ford reiterated its plan to pay regular dividends through a business cycle, as well as pay a supplemental dividend when appropriate.\" Moreover, most of the downgrades from analysts might have already occurred, at least judging from the table below. Click to enlarge (Source: 4-traders.com) Undoubtedly, auto sales and the payout are intimately tied, but then Ford has been recently included in a list comprising six solid dividend stocks unfairly punished by investors , according to MarketWatch. Click to enlarge (Source: marketwatch.com) That is another reason why Ford deserves some consideration.

Photo courtesy Ford Motorsports History. \nA half-century after the Ford Motor Company shocked the world by sweeping the podium at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the International Motor Racing Research Center in Watkins Glen, New York, will present a discussion on Ford’s historic Ferrari-stopper, the GT40 Mk. II, by author Preston Lerner. The presentation will take place at 1 p.m. on Saturday, December 10, at the Racing Research Center, which is located at 610 S. Decatur St. in Watkins Glen. \nLerner is the author of Ford GT: How Ford Silenced the Critics, Humbled Ferrari and Conquered Le Mans, and has bylines on racing history in publications as varied as Sports Illustrated , Wired , Smithsonian and The New York Times . He teamed with longtime Hemmings contributor and photojournalist Dave Friedman to create the GT40 book, which received strong, positive reviews. \nProving that the 1966 win was no fluke, A.J. Foyt and Dan Gurney drove a GT40 Mk. IV to victory at Le Mans in 1967. Photo courtesy Ford Motorsports History. \nThose unable to travel to Watkins Glen to see the presentation in person can watch it via a live feed on YouTube ( YouTube.com/User/IMRRC/Live ) and also on the Center’s website ( RacingArchives.org/Stream ). After the event, the content will be archived on the IMRRC’s YouTube channel for future viewing. \nThe Watkins Glen Area Chamber of Commerce is a sponsor of Lerner’s talk, which is free to the public.

      "text": "Buy Now Chris Lee \nSt. Louis University head coach Travis Ford (left) and assistant coach Corey Tate during an exhibition game between St. Louis University and Greenville on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016, at Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis. Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nWe were talking hoops, under a hoop, when Corey Tate began to fiddle with his phone. \nSaturday at Chaifetz Arena, the St. Louis University assistant coach quickly tapped out a text message, and as I looked at that little rectangle in the big man’s hand, all I could think was: Man, the effect that thing has on an entire program, on an entire university, on an entire sports culture in this city. \nOn this phone, the recruiter works and networks — and works his network — connecting St. Louis youth basketball talent with St. Louis U. \nThe top senior in the area, Jordan Goodwin, signed to play for SLU next year. \nThe top junior in the area, Carter’Are Gordon, said he’ll play for SLU in two years. \nIt’s happening so fast, is this surprising you? \n“No,” Tate bluntly said. \nWhy? \n“Because I work!” he said, chuckling. “I lay the groundwork. I’m not being arrogant, but I’ve known these kids.” \nTravis Ford and Corey Tate. These unlikely cohorts have teamed up to shake it up. It is astounding what head coach Ford, Tate and the other SLU coaches have accomplished in essentially seven months. Just astounding. No, it doesn’t guarantee they’ll be the next Dayton, the program Ford said he admires across the Atlantic-10 Conference. Or the next Xavier. Or, dare we, the next Villanova, the small-sized, religious-based, big-city school that won it all last April. Many schools have notched top talent and have still floundered. But Ford and his staff are winning recruiting battles that are way more important than the games they’re losing this season. \n“I’m wanting to make this St. Louis’ team more than anything,” said the first-year coach Ford. “Yes, it’s St. Louis University, but I want all of St. Louis to get around this program, whether you’re an alumni or not. \n“Corey’s strength is in the St. Louis area as well as nationally, and we’re having some success. He’s opened up a lot of doors, not just in recruiting, but getting to know coaches, getting to know people around the city who we invite to the games. It’s all been positive.” \nTate is fascinating. His swagger has sway. No, this isn’t John Calipari, but he seems to have found his footing as a straight-talking recruiter with little smoothness to his game. He doesn’t come off as one of those eloquent orators who can raise arm hairs and raze preconceived notions. He speaks low and soft and shoots from the hip. \nYou may recognize his name. At Mizzou, the St. Louis native rattled home the shot that beat Kansas, in double overtime, in 1997. He was the head coach at Mineral Area College. He coached AAU. And most recently, he was at Mizzou, which makes local recruiting that much juicier. \nTate has the ability to affect SLU’s recruiting the way Jerrance Howard did Illinois’ recruiting, a decade ago. \nWith recruiting, no, fans and media don’t always know how the sausage is made. It can get ruthless out there. Relationships are everything, and in recruiting, they can go from strong to strained quicker than a fast break. But what matters is if you’re relevant — and Tate is. \n“Sometimes people see how genuine you are, and it fits with them. Sometimes, it doesn’t,” Tate said. “It’s not putting on an act. And there’s no formula to recruiting. … You just have to throw yourself into it, we have nothing to hide and we’re working hard. \n“I’m from St. Louis — there’s not another coach in the country that knows these kids better than me. I’ve walked the steps of all of these kids.” \nGetting Carter’Are Gordon to commit to SLU was a coup. Seven months ago, that surely would’ve read like a typo. But really, the process is just beginning, for Ford and friends will have to fend. Vultures forever flock in high-stakes hoops recruiting. \nAnd SLU itself has to get through this season, with three transfers redshirting and Goodwin and Hasahn French playing out their senior high school seasons. \nFord will lose a lot, but can he set a tone for his brand of basketball? Can he make this season into something of its own and not just a plodding process heading into the heralded “next season” that everyone gushes about? \n“I want it for this basketball team,” Ford said. “Mike Crawford, Reggie Agbeko – I don’t think they have any idea how bad I want it for them. \n“We are excited about our future, no doubt about it, but this is a process. But my mentality is — I think we should win every game right now. I get really into the moment. I’m not one of these guys who looks ahead. My coaches know, I have no clue who we play next. I live in the moment — how can I be the best for this team right now (while preparing for the upcoming opponent)?” \nSLU hung around against Alabama and actually led by nine with 5:25 left. But the Bills faltered, falling to 2-3. \nAfter the game, Ford apologized to the team for not “getting them through the game.” The coach felt like he could’ve managed the team better down the stretch. It was an honest appraisal that all of this — 2016, 2017, 2018 — is a process. \nAnd it’s going to be a fun one to follow. \nBenjamin Hochman",

      "text": "The 2017 Ford F150 is Laughably Good The nation's best-selling truck got even better -- no, really. Full Size Truck Ford \nFirst off, let it be said that the full size truck segment is well and alive. Some manufacturers have shifted their focus towards smaller, light duty pickups for the common buyer, leading some to forget about the half-ton class. Ford wants to let you know that it's still their number one priority, as shown here in the 2017 F-150. With capability and comfort abundant, the repeatedly praised pickup continues to build its empire with more livability then you'd think to find anywhere near a worksite. Oh, and the power. Don't forget about the power. \nNot to worry -- Ford won't let you. The F-150 has undergone the first major changes since the introduction of their alumnimum body in 2015. Their premium engine selection, the 3.5L Ecoboost, has been boosted up 10 horsepower and a momentous 50 lb. ft. to bring the numbers to 375 and 470, respectively. This model year also introduces the company's new 10-speed automatic transmission that was co-developed with their unlikely partner, General Motors. And if you have any reason to doubt the twin-turbo V6, the ever-present 5.0L V8 will give you proven reliability with plenty of oomph. As more 2017 F-150's are built, we will see the new powertrain options pop up more frequently. And don't forget about the oncoming Raptor that should turn these figures up to 11. \n\nAlong with the truck's performance, luxury has become standard for the F-150. It trickles down throughout the range, with the Platinum and King Ranch being the stars of the show. Comfort is remarkably exceptional in the lower XL, XLT, and Lariat trim levels as well. Its cockpit provides plenty of space for both the driver and passengers, leaving enough room in the back for the legs and head of construction workers and family members alike. The higher you go on the trim ladder, the more goodies you will get -- those features including power-folding steps as well as massaging seats, like you see in Mercs and Bentleys of today. All of these creature comforts in a crazy, go-like-stink pickup. Go figure! \nTech is largely the same for 2017, and that's a good thing. The rejuvenated SYNC 3 infotainment system is back, providing easy to use controls for navigation, audio, and even climate control in some models. This is a beautifully simple setup that outperforms RAM and Chevrolet in terms of design and accessibility. Adaptive Cruise Control bolsters that next-level concept of convenience along with Blindspot Information and Lane Keep Assist, helping the F-150 achieve a five-star NHTSA safety rating. The new Sync Connect functionality works in tandem with the Ford Pass app so that you can lock the vehicle's doors and even set up scheduled remote starts, just to add a little bit of flair. You won't find a truck that outplays the Ford in technology. \nThis all inclusive package aids the Ford in improving year after year. A new powertrain option here, a convenience feature there, it all adds up to make the F-150 an unstoppable motif in the best-seller winner's circle. 2017's rendition plays on prior years to make up what is one of the most capable vehicles available. After unmeasurable amounts of attention, the details of this truck are what make it so special. We can't wait to see how Ford follows this class-act.",

Years of use left Dallas, Texas, Fire Station 43 in ragged shape. The firefighters acknowledged the state of affairs but accepted it as a fact of life. Surveying the condition of Firehouse 43, the Dallas Cowboys offensive line teamed up with Ford and actor Denis Leary to help overhaul the old firehouse and show their gratitude to the firefighters of Station 43 in time for them to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal in their new kitchen and dining area.   8 Photos Photo 2/8 | Ford Dallas Cowboys Fire Station 43 Makeover Reveal Leary’s passion for firefighters is a personal one. The Leary Firefighters Foundation was formed in 2000, after Leary’s cousin and five other firefighters lost their lives in a fire in Worcester, Massachusetts. In addition to the extensive interior overhaul the station received, Ford donated a new 2017 Super Duty , and the Leary Firefighters Foundation donated $50,000 in firefighting equipment. Highlights of the rehab were shown on the Fox Sports NFL Pregame Show before the Cowboys/Redskins game Thanksgiving Day. You can watch the video below. Source: Ford",

      "text": "2016 Ford F-150 Freedom Blues By Hanro Studios It’s Engraved! Hanro Studios Works on Its Masterpiece During SEMA   4 Photos I stumbled across something remarkable Wednesday afternoon at the SEMA show. No, it wasn't a display of stealthy large cheetahs available for petting (if they felt like it)—not this time. I could never condone such a thing at SEMA, but I really think it would draw a crowd and get your name out, to say the least. Hey, did you see the cheetahs at the Bobz Gadgetz booth? Yeah, cheetahs. Nonetheless, it was something remarkable. It wasn't quite a work truck in the traditional sense, but it was a guy working on a truck. I'm talking about a blue ’16 Ford F-150 in the American Force Wheels outdoor booth, and the guy working on it was engraving—yes, etching by hand—various military scenes into its aluminum body. The F-150’s brilliant satin blue etching canvas came courtesy of House of Kolor paint and a matte clear. I heard the zzzz sound of the Dremel tool (imagine the sound at a dentist office) and joined the crowd to watch the artist permanently “tattoo” the truck. (Not a cheetah-sized crowd, of course.)   4 Photos Photo 2/4 | Hanro Studios Works 2016 F150 Rear The artist, Hank Robinson of Hanro Studios, is a U.S. Infantry veteran. His work on Freedom Blues, as the tribute truck was aptly named, was amazing, a feat I'd have trouble believing had I not been watching it with my own eyes. You can relive it with your own eyes, too. I took some Facebook live video of it, which you can find on the 8-Lug Facebook page. Hanro specializes in custom metal, wood, glass, and plastic engravings. It claims to be one of two shops to do this. I could have spent hours watching him transform a void canvas into a detailed soldier’s face.   4 Photos Photo 3/4 | Hanro Studios Works 2016 F150 Engraved Sign Hundreds and hundreds of hours would be spent on this project—about 800. That’s 20 weeks of full-time work. I overheard they had been working on it since May. I simply cannot fathom the investment of talent and time that went into Freedom Blues.   4 Photos Photo 4/4 | Hanro Studios Works 2016 F150 Engraved It was remarkable—almost as remarkable as a cheetah petting exhibit would be. And yes, I know how remarkable cheetahs are, because I’ve pet one before.",

      "text": "Kurt Ernst on at 4:00 pm Share \n1985 Ford LTD LX. Photo by Jeff Koch. \nIn 1984 and 1985, Ford build a four-door, 5.0-liter Mustang. It wasn’t called a Mustang, of course, but it carried a Mustang V-8 (albeit the de-tuned one that came with the automatic transmission) and it rode on the Fox platform, just like its smaller stablemate. The Ford LTD LX sedan probably wouldn’t have been built, had it not been for the relationship between the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving, the Ford Motor Company, and its then-president, Donald Petersen. \nThe Bondurant school had long used Mustangs for its instructional programs, but packing students into the rear seat for demonstration laps was challenging. In search of a sedan that could be modified for track use, Bondurant realized that the fourth-generation LTD rode on the same platform as the Mustang, and therefore could (likely) be modified to meet his needs without a significant amount of effort. \n1985 Ford LTD brochure, highlighting the LTD LX’s features. Brochure images courtesy The Old Car Manual Project . \nStories differ as to whether Bondurant built a Mustang-powered LTD, with the police suspension package, in his own shops or with Ford’s assistance and engineering. Once the Bondurant car was completed and tested, Petersen was reportedly so enamored with the end result that a production version was given the green light, and the Ford LTD LX hit the market in mid-1984. \nWhile the Bondurant car had been built with a five-speed manual transmission, the production LX models came only with a four-speed automatic, limiting output of the 5.0-liter, throttle body fuel-injected V-8 to 165 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque. With a 3.27:1 final drive, the sedan was capable of a 9.0-second 0-60 time, on the way to a quarter-mile time of 16.84 seconds at 81.3 MPH. Top speed was said to be 115 MPH, and in comparison to other affordable performance sedans of the day, the numbers were respectable. \nTo ensure the LX was fast in more than just a straight line, the model received handling upgrades like a Traction-Lok differential; front and rear anti-roll bars; unique gas-filled struts and 205/70 HR14 Goodyear Eagle GT tires, which could be mounted on lightweight cast aluminum wheels as an option. Outside, the LTD LX wore charcoal bumper guards, black moldings with a red accent, and a chrome-plated dual-tip exhaust, while inside highlights included front sport seats and a tachometer. \nDespite Ford’s best efforts, the LTD LX was not a sales success, and LTDLX.org advises that just 3,260 examples were built in the car’s two years of production. Though the model has developed something of a cult following in the decades since, it isn’t clear how many examples remain today. \nIt certainly isn’t a car we were familiar with, although one did appear in a Modified Muscle segment in the March 2008 issue of Hemmings Muscle Machines . It was reader (and former LTD LX owner) Wayne who tipped us off to the car, which brings us to our Open Diff question: what other obscure performance-related cars, from domestic and foreign manufacturers, are we missing out on?",

Photo courtesy Ford Motorsports History. \nA half-century after the Ford Motor Company shocked the world by sweeping the podium at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the International Motor Racing Research Center in Watkins Glen, New York, will present a discussion on Ford’s historic Ferrari-stopper, the GT40 Mk. II, by author Preston Lerner. The presentation will take place at 1 p.m. on Saturday, December 10, at the Racing Research Center, which is located at 610 S. Decatur St. in Watkins Glen. \nLerner is the author of Ford GT: How Ford Silenced the Critics, Humbled Ferrari and Conquered Le Mans, and has bylines on racing history in publications as varied as Sports Illustrated , Wired , Smithsonian and The New York Times . He teamed with longtime Hemmings contributor and photojournalist Dave Friedman to create the GT40 book, which received strong, positive reviews. \nProving that the 1966 win was no fluke, A.J. Foyt and Dan Gurney drove a GT40 Mk. IV to victory at Le Mans in 1967. Photo courtesy Ford Motorsports History. \nThose unable to travel to Watkins Glen to see the presentation in person can watch it via a live feed on YouTube ( YouTube.com/User/IMRRC/Live ) and also on the Center’s website ( RacingArchives.org/Stream ). After the event, the content will be archived on the IMRRC’s YouTube channel for future viewing. \nThe Watkins Glen Area Chamber of Commerce is a sponsor of Lerner’s talk, which is free to the public.

      "text": "Kurt Ernst on at 4:00 pm Share \n1985 Ford LTD LX. Photo by Jeff Koch. \nIn 1984 and 1985, Ford build a four-door, 5.0-liter Mustang. It wasn’t called a Mustang, of course, but it carried a Mustang V-8 (albeit the de-tuned one that came with the automatic transmission) and it rode on the Fox platform, just like its smaller stablemate. The Ford LTD LX sedan probably wouldn’t have been built, had it not been for the relationship between the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving, the Ford Motor Company, and its then-president, Donald Petersen. \nThe Bondurant school had long used Mustangs for its instructional programs, but packing students into the rear seat for demonstration laps was challenging. In search of a sedan that could be modified for track use, Bondurant realized that the fourth-generation LTD rode on the same platform as the Mustang, and therefore could (likely) be modified to meet his needs without a significant amount of effort. \n1985 Ford LTD brochure, highlighting the LTD LX’s features. Brochure images courtesy The Old Car Manual Project . \nStories differ as to whether Bondurant built a Mustang-powered LTD, with the police suspension package, in his own shops or with Ford’s assistance and engineering. Once the Bondurant car was completed and tested, Petersen was reportedly so enamored with the end result that a production version was given the green light, and the Ford LTD LX hit the market in mid-1984. \nWhile the Bondurant car had been built with a five-speed manual transmission, the production LX models came only with a four-speed automatic, limiting output of the 5.0-liter, throttle body fuel-injected V-8 to 165 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque. With a 3.27:1 final drive, the sedan was capable of a 9.0-second 0-60 time, on the way to a quarter-mile time of 16.84 seconds at 81.3 MPH. Top speed was said to be 115 MPH, and in comparison to other affordable performance sedans of the day, the numbers were respectable. \nTo ensure the LX was fast in more than just a straight line, the model received handling upgrades like a Traction-Lok differential; front and rear anti-roll bars; unique gas-filled struts and 205/70 HR14 Goodyear Eagle GT tires, which could be mounted on lightweight cast aluminum wheels as an option. Outside, the LTD LX wore charcoal bumper guards, black moldings with a red accent, and a chrome-plated dual-tip exhaust, while inside highlights included front sport seats and a tachometer. \nDespite Ford’s best efforts, the LTD LX was not a sales success, and LTDLX.org advises that just 3,260 examples were built in the car’s two years of production. Though the model has developed something of a cult following in the decades since, it isn’t clear how many examples remain today. \nIt certainly isn’t a car we were familiar with, although one did appear in a Modified Muscle segment in the March 2008 issue of Hemmings Muscle Machines . It was reader (and former LTD LX owner) Wayne who tipped us off to the car, which brings us to our Open Diff question: what other obscure performance-related cars, from domestic and foreign manufacturers, are we missing out on?",

      "text": "up vote 7 down vote favorite \nIn The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , when Arthur and Ford are picked up by the Heart of Gold, they experience the effects of the Infinite Improbability drive, causing their surrounding to shift through several surreal and absurd iterations as the improbability factor spins down to 1:1. \nDuring these iterations, the narration states that the void \"spewed up a payment\" which seems to actually be a pavement (or, I believe, a \"sidewalk\" to us Americans); the word \"pavement\" is used in the remaining narration. \nIs this a misprint in my edition of the book (paperback with the \"42 puzzle\" on the cover)? Or was it supposed to be a subtle clue as to what Arthur and Ford were experiencing? Occam's razor suggests the former, but Adams's style might imply the latter. I would expect the word to continue changing in that case, however (\"payment\" -> \"pavement\" -> \"pair of mints\" -> etc.). Or, maybe because I would expect that, it makes more sense for it to change just the one time as it does in the novel. \nI realize I am probably paving too much attention to one small detail but I wanted to know if anyone had any special insights into this.",

      "text": "November 28, 2016 — American / German / Under $20k | 10 Comments Two Owners & 29K Miles: 2004 Ford Focus SVT \nThis 2004 Ford Focus SVT is said to have just 29k miles and still smells new according to the seller. Highly optioned with desirable extras like a European Appearance Package, several good quality and easily reversible mods have been fitted as well, including a Steeda short shift kit, a full stainless Magnaflow exhaust and new Koni shocks. The window sticker and build sheet are included as well, and it’s hard to imagine a better preserved example hiding anywhere outside of Ford’s private collections. Find it here on Craigslist in suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin for $9k OBO. Special thanks to BaT reader Patrick L. for this submission. \nA re-badged version of Europe’s ST170, these cars had re-tuned suspension, 17″ wheels (excellent stock items seen here), a quick-ratio steering rack, bigger brakes, and much more, some of which is detailed further below. A simple, handsome bodykit along with body-colored rub strips and door handles cleaned up the standard car’s appearance, and this example appears to be in really nice shape throughout. \nInside, full leather factory Recaros offer heat and side airbags, neither of which were available in lesser trim. The seller says that the seats have no creases or other signs of use and that the cabin even smells new. The upgraded factory stereo seen here comes with a subwoofer, and everything including A/C is said to work. \nDeveloped by Cosworth, this 2.0 liter twin cam was based on the standard Duratec item, but a unique high-flow cylinder head with variable valve timing and other changes helped liberate an extra 47 HP, for a total of 170. Elsewhere, the gearbox offered six forward gears instead of the five in standard models. Among the very best FWD models we’ve ever driven, good ones are disappearing quickly, setting up ideal conditions for those remaining to become future classics. \nSays the seller: “I have the original window sticker, build certificate, and everything that came with the car, including all three keys and both fobs. All original glass and panels (no dents etc.), motor, and trans. It has a full stainless Magnaflow exhaust, K&N drop-in filter, SCT tune, Steeda short shift kit, Steeda billet antenna, and brand new Koni shocks. Original Argent EAP wheels (no curb rash) with new continental ExtremeContact DW tires. I believe it even has the original battery in it. HID headlamps, block heater, traction control. No leaks, no issues. Car is flawless.” Related Stories",

      "text": "Ford develops next Bronco in Australia, report says   SHARE \n  revived Ford Bronco may be a few years away, but development of the next-gen SUV is underway in Australia, according to Motoring, an Australian website. \nFord's Asia-Pacific product development center is working on the Bronco, which will be based on the next-generation Ford Ranger pickup platform that also underpins the Ford Everest SUV, according to the website. \nThe Ranger and Everest are sold in a number of world markets. \nThe next-gen Bronco will be based on a shortened version of the updated T6 ladder-frame platform that will debut in 2018, Motoring reports. \nProduction of the Bronco and the Ranger for the U.S. will take place in Wayne, Mich., a UAW representative confirmed in October. \nThe U.S. Bronco is likely to receive a gasoline V-6 engine, Motoring reports. \nUnlike the last Bronco, the version due in 2020 will be aimed more directly at the next-gen Jeep Wrangler, which has been without a serious rival for years. \nThe redesigned 2018 Wrangler will be on sale by the time the next Bronco debuts, though it remains to be seen if the Bronco mimics the compact and rugged exterior of the Wrangler and how many body styles it will offer. \n-- Autoweek",

      "text": "Twitter 0 \nFord’s EcoBoost technology for petrol-powered engines with turbochargers, variable valve timing and direct fuel injection system make their cars more fuel efficient than most of their rivals. \nAmerican automajor, Ford Motor Company believes that the fuel economy is a crucial factor among buyers investing into a car. With an aim to analyze Indian drivers’ driving habits and fuel efficiency knowledge, Ford has conducted a survey that reveals that 95% people claimed they knew how to drive the car for attaining maximum fuel efficiency and 96% said they make a concerted effort to drive efficiently on daily basis. A total of 9,500 drivers participated in the study across 11 markets in Asia Pacific, including 1,023 Indian respondents. \nFord’s fleet of study has revealed some interesting facts about driving habits of people that are listed below – \n– Nearly 40% of Indian drivers were unaware of negative impact of harsh acceleration and braking on the car’s fuel consumption. Fact is, aggressive driving – like braking harshly or taking off too quickly – causes fuel wastage. \n– Keeping the engine running during idling will save more fuel; this is what 26% of respondents believe. Though, one must know that switching off the engine and restarting it is actually an easy way to enhance fuel efficiency of a car. \n– The survey shows that 78% of drivers were unaware about the fuel efficiency benefits of cruise control system. The cruise control technology stops you from driving faster than allowed. So, it helps maintain a constant speed and avoid unnecessary accelerating and braking that translates into less fuel consumption or wastage. \n– Using GPS to map the shortest route before heading out can save your time and money. This fact was known to only 27% of the survey participants. Ford’s SYNC 2 system in-car infotainment system provides driver vocal control over built-in apps for navigation, temperature and more. You can pre-set your most frequent destinations in the system to save our time. \n– Around 52% of drivers were unaware of the fact that driving in hilly areas can affect fuel consumption. The vehicle consumes more fuel during long drives in the mountains compared to driving on straight road and flat surfaces. \n– Most participants were unaware that cold weather (73 percent) and hot weather (64 percent) affect a vehicle’s fuel efficiency. In cold climate, the engine takes longer to reach its most efficient temperature. On the other hand, in warmer climate you need to keep a check on usage of the air-conditioner. It is better to use air-conditioner at highway speeds, and put windows down at lower speeds. \n– The survey finds that 35% of drivers knew that by removing or cluttering heavy items from the car can help save fuel. An extra 20kg of weight can reduce the vehicle’s mileage by roughly 1%. \n– One third of the drivers were unaware of the fact that regular servicing can also improve the fuel efficiency of the vehicle. And over 58% of respondents were unaware that regular tire pressure checking can also save fuel. \nFord’s EcoBoost technology for petrol-powered engines with turbochargers, variable valve timing and direct fuel injection system make their cars more fuel efficient than most of their rivals. Furthermore, it reduces CO2 emission of the powertrain without impacting its performance. In India, the EcoBoost technology is available on the EcoSport compact SUV . \n ",

Maeve ( Thandie Newton ) has more control than ever, and a confrontation between her and Ford seems imminent. Maeve also seems to stumble across the cold storage facility. If she finds and revives the dead Bernard ( Jeffrey Wright ), the two hosts could make a formidable team. And the Man in Black is closer than ever to finding the maze, though Dolores ( Evan Rachel Wood ) might be closer to the answers he seeks, having been led by voices in her head. ‘Westworld’ episode 9 recap: Top 5 biggest mysteries from ‘The Well-Tempered Clavier’ \nThe title of the episode may refer to those voices Dolores hears. Bicameralism is an idea created by Julian Jaynes , published in his book “The Origin of Consciousness.” It is the idea that the human mind was once split into two states: one that speaks and one that listens and obeys. According to Jaynes’ theory, this type of mind started to break down as humanity advanced. The same phenomena seems to be taking place in the hosts of Westworld.

      "text": "2017 Ford F-150 3.5 EcoBoost First Test: Gazing Head On Into Peak Pickup Motor Trend 23 hrs ago Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford F-150 3.5 EcoBoost First Test: Gazing Head On Into Peak Pickup We shouldn't feign awe and disbelief when the inevitable \"peak pickup\" sales taper off hits, but trucks such as the Ford F-150 are constant reminders of how much OEMs value their high-visibility, high-profit products. Some might say it's the best time to be shopping for a new pickup.\nResearch 2017 ford f-150 See Full Specs See Pricing The F-150 plays the critical numbers game. That's for sure. The big update for the 2017 model year is the rise of the second-generation 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. It's the same unit that initially gained fame as the chosen reciprocating one (albeit juiced up) in the new 450-horsepower Raptor. With 375 horsepower in the regular F-150, it has 10 horsepower more than before (penciling out to a 3 percent leap) alongside a torque peak 50 lb-ft higher. The torque increase locks in a 10-lb-ft advantage over GM's L86 6.2-liter V-8, which lead to best-in-class torque claims, although that Ford torque peak has shifted north from the first-gen V-6's 2,500 to 3,500 rpm.\nThat engine continues to be positioned as the truck line's most premium set of rods and pistons, and it does a masterful job of pitching the EcoBoost lifestyle. It's not a trim elitist, either; the 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 can be had from entry-grade XL all the way up to the 22-inch-wheel-wearing Limited, where it's standard. As road test editor Chris Walton calls out on the F-150, \"It's such a solid, easy-to-drive truck with way more power than most people will need, which is probably what Ford needed to do considering it's not powered by a V-8.\"\nRead more on the Ford F-150 from 2017 Truck of the Year testing HERE .\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford F 150 Platinum 4x4 EcoBoost front three quarter in motion 04 There's plenty of non-V-8 muscle to flex. Instrumented testing ascertained a 060 time of 6.1 seconds and quarter mile of 14.7 seconds at 95 mph, 0.3 second fleeter and 2.5 mph rapider than a 2015 F-150 Platinum FX4 with the retro, cool 3.5-liter EcoBoost and six-speed automatic we ran when aluminum-body trucks were still an infrequent sight. The P552-platform F-150 is more common now, but the 10-speed automatic transmission backing this Platinum 4x4 EcoBoost is rare for the time being.\nWith a 7,000-pound trailer affixed, the additional grunt and gearing assistance is more noticeable. Our \"half-ton typical weight\" trailer has been tethered to more than a few full-size trucks over the past couple years, and the F-150 hardly broke a sweat. Its 13.0-second 060-mph and 19.3-second quarter-mile times outmaneuver an L86-motivated GMC Sierra Denali tested last year pulling the identical weight (13.3 and 19.5 for the Sierra, respectively).\nThat same weight stress on the rear bumper had strained the 2015 Platinum FX4 even more, to the tune of 14.7 seconds to 60 mph and 20.2 seconds in the quarter mile. A 1.7- and 0.9-second improvement from old Ford to new Ford in the 060 and quarter mile effusively shows off the new excess capability on tap. The transmission shifts about as undetectably and at the driver's will as one could hope for, but it seemed to be more sensitive after a cold start as it stuttered along in the lower gears. Once warmed up, all was well.\nThe new V-6, which comes with more gears and features both port and direct fuel injection and a remarkably nonintrusive auto start/stop system, gets real-world Real MPG benefits. Our latest Real MPG test (trailer not attached) earned 17.1/21.1/18.7 mpg city/highway/combined, an 11 percent combined upgrade over the 2015 Platinum FX4's 14.8/19.9/16.8. If history hadn't already conditioned us to expect something better to be lurking around the corner, we might actually have to start believing that this is it. Surely, the bottom of the gasoline-efficiency barrel has been scraped. That's why spy photos of a diesel F-150 exist, we imagine.\nBeing ruthlessly efficient at turning gas into momentum has never been an EcoBoost inadequacy, especially not in the F-150. As before, the F-150's sense of highway-rolling invincibility is reinforced by the easy speed and quiet cabin. It's a quietness that's interrupted by the pleasing thrum of the V-6 upon rolling on the throttle.\n© Motor Trend Staff 2017 Ford F 150 Platinum 4x4 EcoBoost front three quarters in motion This is an engine that's prepared to oblige its operator. \"Ford has this turbo engine dialed now,\" associate editor Scott Evans said. \"No more big delay while boost builds to get moving with a trailer. This truck has demonstrated that the future of trucks is turbocharging.\" We were pleased with the 2017 model's heavier revised steering, which helped settle the truck and vanquish the sensation of nervousness that startled us in years past. Equipped with 275/55R20 Hankook Dynapro AT-M tires, it's also worth noting that the braking distance from 60 to 0 shortens up by 5 feet (from 126 to 121) and the figure-eight lap time drops from 28.1 to 27.8 seconds when comparing the 2017 vehicle to the 2015 example.\nSome might say it's the worst time to be going after a new truck, too. List prices remain heroic. Our Platinum 4x4 test truck starts at $58,455 with the EcoBoost V-6 and 10-speed automatic. (It's $57,455, or $1,000 less, for a Platinum 4x4 with the trim's stock 5.0-liter V-8 and six-speed automatic.) As equipped, we're looking at $63,610, an amount we've become numb to for the segment. The top-shelf F-150 Limited 4x4 opens the bidding at $64,220.\nIf we've reached peak pricing and powertrain performance, things can't get any better, right? That'd be untrue, As with the 2015 F-150s we met, the interior design and ergonomics are polarizing. \"I like the chamfered-square design theme,\" Walton said. But executive editor Mark Rechtin dinged the shifter. \"The gear shifter knob is ridiculously oversized, like the size of the World Cup trophy,\" he said. \"I get it. It's so you can work the controls while wearing work gloves, but it's almost cartoonish.\" The truck rode smoothly on well-kept and level surfaces but was jumpy and stiff everywhere else. Amusingly (or should it be bemusedly) the truck had a tendency to self-aim toward the roadside shoulder when crossing our drive loop's cattle guards at brisk but not outrageous speeds.\nFrom their hauling and towing abilities to trailer-attaching in-truck electronic guidance to the quality of materials lining the cab's innards to the sticker prices slapped on the driver-side window, pickups have never been more impressive. Which means the eager, post-peak secondhand pickup shoppers have a lot of F-150 to look forward to.\n2017 Ford F-150 Platinum 4x4 EcoBoost BASE PRICE $58,455 PRICE AS TESTED $63,610 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front-engine, 4WD, 5-pass, 4-door truck ENGINE 3.5L/375-hp/470-lb-ft twin-turbo DOHC 24-valve V-6 TRANSMISSION 10-speed automatic CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 5,521 lb (57/43%) WHEELBASE 145.0 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 231.9 x 79.9 x 77.2 in 0-60 MPH* 6.1; 13.0 sec QUARTER MILE* 14.7 sec @ 95.0 mph; 19.3 sec @ 72.8 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 121 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 0.77 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 27.8 sec @ 0.63 g (avg) EPA CITY/HWY/COMB FUEL ECON 17/23/20 mpg ENERGY CONS, CITY/HWY 198/147 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS, COMB 1.01 lb/mile *Unladen; towing 7,000-lb trailer\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Car giants have banded together to charge up Europe's major highways in a joint venture aiming to accelerate the mass-market take-up of electric vehicles.\n\nBMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company and Volkswagen Group with its brands Audi & Porsche, have announced a joint venture to deploy a high-powered charge network for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). It will cover long-distance travel routes across Europe.\n\nThe companies have signed a memorandum of understanding with the goal of quickly building up a sizeable number of charging stations to pave the way for easy long-range travel for BEV drivers. The initial target is to have 400 European sites established so by 2020 drivers will have access to thousands of charging points. \n\n*Read more*: Jaguar wants to build its electric car in the UK - creating 10,000 jobs\n\nThe projected charging network with power levels up to 350 kW will be \"significantly faster\" than the most powerful system currently deployed, with the build-up planned to start next year.\n\nThe companies are envisaging the charging experience to one day become as convenient as simply refuelling at a traditional petrol station.\n\n\"The joint project is another major milestone clearly demonstrating that competitors are combining forces to ramp up e-mobility,\" said Harald Krüger, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG.\n\n\"A reliable ultra-fast charging infrastructure is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving,\" said Mark Fields, president and chief executive of Ford.\n\nThe network will be based on the so-called combined charging system (CCS) technology, enhancing existing AC and DC charging standards.\n\n*Read more*: Here's everything you need to know about Jaguar's new electric car\n\nThe founding companies will be equal partners in the venture, but are encouraging other car manufacturers to participate in the network too.\n\nThe announcement comes with a flurry of activity in the electric car market of late. Just last week Jaguar Land Rover announced it was building its very first electric car in the UK, and will likely create thousands of jobs in the process. And Toyota has created a new in-house company responsible for developing electric vehicles.",

BMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Group with its Audi and Porsche brands said Tuesday that they've signed a memorandum of understanding that foresees the network being built up starting next year. Their \"initial target\" is to have 400 charging sites in Europe and the goal is to have thousands in place by 2020.

Paulo reported on Tuesday. \nAccording to the report, the claim was related to Ford's cancellation, in 1999, of a project to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil's southernmost state. Instead, Ford decided to build the factory in the state of Bahia. \nCash-strapped Rio Grande do Sul will use the money to help pay state employees, Folha reported. \n($1 = 3.4009 reais) (Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Mark Potter) Next In Market News",

      "text": "BERLIN--BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG said Tuesday they plan to build together with Ford Motor Co. a network of hundreds of ultra-fast, high-powered charging stations for electric cars in Europe.\nThe car makers have signed a memorandum of understanding to start building stations next year that will make charging cars significantly faster than is possible with even the most powerful charging systems deployed presently. The initial target for the joint venture is to equip about 400 sites with power levels of up to 350 kilowatts.\nBy 2020, customers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points, according to BMW. The goal is to enable long-distance travel through charging stations along highways and major thoroughfares.\nWrite Friedrich Geiger at friedrich.geiger@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch Opinion Journal: Trump Ends the Clinton Era First Lady Welcomes White House Christmas Tree How Election 2016 Changed the Political Parties",

Paulo reported on Tuesday. \nAccording to the report, the claim was related to Ford's cancellation, in 1999, of a project to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil's southernmost state. Instead, Ford decided to build the factory in the state of Bahia. \nCash-strapped Rio Grande do Sul will use the money to help pay state employees, Folha reported. \n($1 = 3.4009 reais) (Reporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Mark Potter) Published: November 29, 2016 — 5:03 AM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "Top German carmakers, Ford set up Europe recharging network Posted: Updated: \nBERLIN (AP) - Top German automakers and Ford are setting up a joint venture to create a fast recharging network in Europe for electric cars. \nBMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Group with its Audi and Porsche brands said Tuesday that they've signed a memorandum of understanding that foresees the network being built up starting next year. Their \"initial target\" is to have 400 charging sites in Europe and the goal is to have thousands in place by 2020. \nThe automakers say the planned network will have power levels of up to 350 kilowatts, faster than the most powerful system currently in service. They didn't give financial details. \nThe aim is to make it easier for electric cars to travel long distances and help make them more appealing to the mass market.  ",

      "title": "Ford’s Stock Recovers after Trump’s Election: Will It Continue?",
      "text": "Trump Card in Action: Why Auto Stocks Rose Last Week PART 4 OF 5 Ford’s Stock Recovers after Trump’s Election: Will It Continue? By John Parker | Nov 28, 2016 6:47 am EST Minor recovery in Ford’s stock \nFord’s stock ended last week on a positive note after consistently remaining in negative territory for the previous five weeks. Last Friday, the company’s stock delivered a 2.45 positive return and closed at $12.04. Notably, the stock remained bearish in the first three quarters of 2016 due to weakening home market sales ( VCR ) as well as falling margins from its flagship F-Series trucks. On a YTD (year-to-date) basis, Ford’s stock is still trading with 14.5% losses as of November 25, 2016. Can Ford continue to recover? \nOn November 9, 2016, after the US election results were announced, Ford’ stock posted a closing low of $11.58. On the same day, prices witnessed a sharp recovery later during the session. Donald Trump’s views on easing emission standards, as discussed in the previous part of this series, could be the primary reason behind these gains. \nNow, let’s look at the technicals and find out if Ford’s stock has the potential to recover more in the short term. Key technical levels \nWe clearly saw a sharp rise in trade volumes for three consecutive sessions during the recovery in Ford’s stock after November 9, 2016. These volume gains suggest that the underlying short-term momentum is still strong. Therefore, the price could extend these gains beyond the $12.28 swing high posted on November 11, 2016. The level should also act as an immediate resistance this week. \nOn the downside, the stock price could continue to find horizontal support near $11.75–$11.60 levels. \nNote that Ford’s 3Q16 results had very little to be optimistic about—unlike other auto companies’ strong results including General Motors ( GM ), Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ), and Tesla ( TSLA ). Therefore, we can expect the ongoing upward price movement to remain restricted in the medium term. \nIn the next part, we’ll look at Fiat Chrysler’s movement last week and its key support and resistance levels for the week ahead. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"F\",\"GM\",\"VCR\",\"FCAU\",\"TSLA\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Ford Motor Company\",\"General Motors Company\",\"Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF\",\"Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.\",\"Tesla Motors Inc\"]} X",

      "text": "Tweet Share SAO PAULO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The local unit of Ford Motor Co will pay almost 217 million reais ($63.8 million) to Brazil's state of Rio Grande do Sul after the parties reached a settlement regarding a law suit, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported on Tuesday. According to the report, the claim was related to Ford's cancellation, in 1999, of a project to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil's southernmost state. Instead, Ford decided to build the factory in the state of Bahia. Cash-strapped Rio Grande do Sul will use the money to help pay state employees, Folha reported.

      "text": "BMW, Daimler, Ford and VW to build high-power European EV charging network Posted Cyber Monday hauls in $3.39B of online purchases, smashing the single-day sales record \nA new joint venture between major carmakers will attempt to make it easier to get around Europe using electric cars, thanks to a network of chargers with up to 350 kW charging capacity, which could drastically reduce overall charging times compared to what’s available today. The team-up includes BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen, and plans for roll-out of the fast-charging stations call for installations to start in 2017. \nInitially, the venture has identified 400 sites in Europe, with the ultimate aim of delivering as many as “thousands” or charge points by 2020 (which is, not coincidentally, around when many of the product lines of the participating car makers are expected to skew more heavily towards EVs). \nThe base technology upon which the network will be based is called Combined Charging System (CCS), which is a quick-charging method that uses a combo AC/DC connector referred to as the “Combo Coupler” in order to deliver a max 350 kW delivery charging rate. The standard is supported by BW, BMW, Daimler, and Ford, but also by Hyundai, GM and FCA. \nThe newly released Chevy Bolt uses CCS, for instance, and the standard is controlled by the Charging Interface Initiative, a group founded by Audi, BMW, Daimler, VW and more specifically to push CCS as an industry standard. Tesla joined the standards body in March of this year, and was reported in February to be working on an adapter that would help it support the standard used by CCS chargers. 0",

      "title": "BMW, Daimler, Ford and VW plan Europe-wide EV fast-charge network",
      "text": "The four manufacturers are working together on a fast-charging network across Europe, in the hope it will encourage EV adoption\n\nElectric vehicle fast charging is getting a boost, as four large car makers – BMW Group, Daimler, Ford and VW Group, are co-operating on a fast-charging network for electric vehicles across Europe.\n\nThe four manufacturers plan a network of around 1000 chargers along major routes across Europe, with power outputs of up to 350kW.\n\nWork starts on the network in 2017, and the group says that as technology evolves, it’s expected that charging will become akin to filling a petrol-powered car in terms of convenience, suggesting a similar duration is being targeted. BMW's i-sub-brand cars, the i3 and i8, already use CCS for their charging methods, as do VW's e-Up and e-Golf, and in the future, so will Ford's raft of planned electric vehicles, as well as Mercedes' EQ-sub-brand cars. \n\n*Read about Porsche's commitment to EV charging here*\n\nOnly cars equipped with the Combined Charging System (CCS) will be able to charge if they’re equipped with this charge system. As calls for standardisation of electric charging systems continue, it’s likely that this will push CCS towards becoming the de facto charge system, as the four giants invest in its infrastructure .\n\nThe collaboration is the largest in the history of EV infrastructure, and as each manufacturer either already has or plans to have its own range of electric vehicles in the near future, could eventually become the deciding factor in what the industry chooses as its standard charging system.\n\nCompeting systems include Tesla’s own charging system, and the ChaDeMo system, which is used by PSA, Nissan and Mitsubishi, among others.\n\nAlthough the four founding manufacturers are investing, more parties are being invited to join the scheme and pledge investment along the line. This split in charge systems could create a similar split to that seen between the two standards of mobile phone batteries, between Android and Apple.\n\nOliver Blume, chairman of the Porsche executive board said: “There are two decisive aspects for us: ultra-fast charging and placing the charging stations at the right positions.”\n\n“Together, these two factors enable us to travel in an all-electrically powered car as in a conventional combustion engine vehicle. As automobile manufacturer, we actively shape our future, not only by developing all-electrically powered vehicles but by building up the necessary infrastructure as well.”\n\nIt’s not yet known if the charging network will be free to use, and it’s likely, given the current political climate, that the network will not extend to the UK. The partnership will officially begin at the start of 2017, so it’s likely that details such as these will be announced then. A Mercedes-Benz spokesman could not add any further comment.",

      "title": "Spec Comparo- Hyundai Tucson vs Honda CR-V vs Innova Crysta vs Ford Endeavour 2.2 litre Express",
      "text": "With a high SUV demand in the country, car manufacturers have introduced new contenders in this segment. The recently introduced Hyundai Tucson might just upset the sales of the reigning champion, Toyota Innova Crysta, the heavy duty Ford Endeavour and the much-acclaimed Honda CR-V. We do a specification comparison of new-kid-on-the-block with existing players .\nHyundai Tucson Engine Engine:\nThe third generation Hyundai Tucson has been introduced in India with two engine options, a 2.0-litre Nu petrol engine and 2.0-litre CRDi diesel engine. The petrol engine produces 153 hp of power and 192 Nm of torque while the new R e-VGT (electronic Variable Geometry Turbo) 2.0-litre CRDi motor churns out 183 hp of power and 400 Nm of torque. Both the engines have the option of a 6-speed manual and automatic transmissions. According to the recent first drive review of the car, diesel engine is a refined unit, although the gear shifts on the automatic transmission aren't for the spirited driver. (Read the first drive review of the Hyundai Tucson diesel here)\nOn the other hand, the Honda CR-V is the only car here which is powered only by petrol engines, a 2.0-litre unit for the base version and a 2.4-litre engine for the higher variants. The 2.0-litre i-VTEC motor produces 154 hp of power and 190 Nm of torque, while the 2.4-litre i-VTEC engine churns out 187 hp of power and 226 Nm of torque. The 2.0-litre unit comes with a 6-speed manual transmission and a 5-speed automatic transmission, however, it is available only in a two-wheel drive format. The CR-V which is powered by the larger engine has a 5-speed automatic transmission and is also available in 4WD mode.\nThat said, the Ford Endeavour variants which are powered by the 2.2-litre, TDCi, inline, 4-cylinder diesel engine produces 155hp of power and 385Nm of torque. The engine is available with options -speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission with two-wheel or four-wheel drive formats. The recent price cut through all Ford models also makes it an enticing option over others. The Ford Endeavour 2.2 AT Trend 4X2 version has a sticker price of Rs 23.78 lakh while the price tag of the Tucson diesel Automatic GLS trim more expensive by Rs 1.21 at Rs 24.99 lakh (Both prices are ex-showroom, Delhi)\nIn case you are looking for an MPV, another option to consider is the Toyota Innova Crysta. It comes with three engine options, 2.4-litre GD VNT Intercooler diesel, a 2.8-litre GD diesel and a new 2.7-litre dual VVT-i petrol. The 2.4-litre unit produces 146 hp of power and 343 Nm of peak torque, and the 2.8-litre GD diesel churns out 174 hp of power and 360 Nm of torque. The 2.7-litre petrol engine produces 166 hp of power and 245 Nm torque. These units have the options of a 5-speed manual and the 6-speed automatic transmissions depending on the variant chosen.\nAlso read about: Ford Endeavour off road review\nDimensions\nIn terms of dimensions, Hyundai Tuscon measures 4,475 mm in length, 1,850 mm in width and 1660 mm in height while the Honda CR-V is longer at 4,545 mm, but thinner at 1,820 mm in width and taller at 1,685 mm.\nWhen compared to the Innova Crysta which measures 4,735 mm in length, 1,830 mm in width and 1,795 mm in height, the Hyundai Tucson has considerably lesser dimensions. That said, the Innova Crysta is an MPV with seven seats while the Tucson is an SUV that can accommodate up to five occupants.\nThe Ford Endeavour has the highest numbers in this regard that measures 4,892 mm in length, 1,860 mm in width and 1,837 mm in height. This would make parking the behemoth in tight parking spots cumbersome over the other. The Tucson in this regards is compact, however, the other rivals can seat more occupants.\n7 SRS airbags for driver and all passenger Safety\nSafety is paramount in Hyundai's approach to a vehicle and the Tuscon gets active safety features such as six airbags, front parking sensors (first-in-segment), HAC (Hill-start Assist Control), DBC (Downhill Brake Control), ESC (Electronic Stability Control), VSM (Vehicle Stability Management).The Tuscon achieved the 5-star EURO NCAP (New Car Assessment Programme) safety rating.\nIn comparison, the Toyota Innova Crysta has also achieved a 5-star rating at the ASEAN NCAP for South-east Asian Countries thanks to a host of safety features. These include rear parking sensors, dual front airbags and driver knee airbag, ABS (anti-lock braking system), EBD (electronic brake-force distribution), vehicle stability control (VSC) and hill-start assist control (HAC) as standard. The ESC (Electronic Stability Control) equipped trim has received the 5-star rating in for Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) while other versions have received four stars. The top-end version of the Toyota Innova Crysta also has additional airbags for added safety.\nAdditionally, the Honda CR-V is equipped with 6 airbags, Vehicle Stability Assist, Anti-lock Braking System( ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) and Hill Start Assist. The Ford Endeavour get safety features such as dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, Traction control, Hill Launch Assist, Hill Descent Control and Ford Mykey. So, in terms of safety, all cars in comparison here have safety as a priority and one can be reassured that occupants in any of the cars will remain safe during an impact.\nRead about: Hyundai Tucson AWD to launch in May 2017\nPrices\nHyundai launched Tuscon from Rs 18.99 lakh to Rs 24.99 lakh. Although it is unable to undercut the Toyota Innova Crysta which has a huge price bracket that starts from Rs 13.70 lakh and goes all the way up to Rs 19.62 lakh for the petrol and some diesel variants, the larger diesel engine powered versions have a rather hefty starting from Rs lakh.\nComparably, the Honda CR-V is the least value-for-money in this regard as it does not have an option of a diesel engine and is priced between Rs 22 lakh and Rs 26 lakh. That said, the SUV from Honda's stable will be more reliable owing to its 2 years standard warranty. Hyundai Tucson also comes with 5 years standard warranty and 24 hour roadside assistance.\nComing to the Ford Endeavour, it is available in 4x2 and 4x4 versions, however, it has a close competition in terms of price with the Hyundai Tucson as the American SUV starts from Rs 23.63 lakh to Rs 28.15 lakh. That said, there is no option in the Ford Endeavour's portfolio of a petrol engine powered SUV.\nIf you are looking at a five-seater, tall car, the Hyundai Tucson will fit your budget easily. That said, if you are looking for a seven-seater, the Hyundai Tucson would be a let down over the other cars which is the only possible limitation of the new offering from the Korean carmaker.",

      "text": "\nA charging plug sits next to a VW badge cover. Photographer: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg Venture to include Ford as partner in battery-charging sites Automakers plan first stations on European highways in 2017 Share on Facebook \nVolkswagen AG, BMW AG and Ford Motor Co. plan to set up a European network for speedy charging of electric-car batteries as the auto manufacturers seek to overcome customer resistance to the vehicles. \nThe partnership, which will also include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG, aims to establish “thousands” of stations along European highways by 2020, the automakers said Tuesday in a statement . With an initial target of about 400 sites, the group plans to start the rollout in 2017, deploying technology that will be “significantly faster” than current setups. \n“A reliable, ultra-fast charging infrastructure is important for mass consumer adoption and has the potential to transform the possibilities for electric driving,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said in the statement. \nThe rare broad-based cooperation shows the strains on carmakers as they invest billions of dollars to develop battery-powered vehicles to comply with tighter environmental regulations. Buyers have so far shown little interest in the models because of limited driving range, the time needed for recharging and the high price of vehicles. BMW sold fewer than 24,100 of its i3 electric city car last year, out of the company’s total 2.2 million deliveries, while the Renault-Nissan automaking alliance has only handed over 350,000 electric vehicles to customers since 2010, versus a target of 1.5 million by the end of 2016. \nGermany’s government agreed earlier this year to a 1 billion-euro ($1.06 billion) financing package to encourage electric-car purchases, with about two-thirds of the figure slated for developing roadside charging stations. U.S. carmaker Tesla Motors Inc.’s network of 744 Supercharger -branded stations includes outlets across Europe. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE ",

      "text": "The front three quarters of Ford’s new Fiesta hatchback has been shown; car pictured is an ST-Line\n\nThe 2017 Ford Fiesta has been partially revealed in an image released six hours before the car’s world debut in Cologne, Germany .\n\nThe single picture shows the evolutionary design that’s been applied to the car’s front three quarters. The grille is similar to that of the latest Focus, while the headlights look like softened and shrunken versions of the outgoing Fiesta’s.\n\nThe pictured car is a five-door ST-Line, but it also previews how the proper ST model will look. It sits on 10-spoke alloy wheels and wears sporty bumpers and side skirts, appearing slightly more toned down than current-generation ST models.\n\nOverall dimensions look slightly larger than that of the outgoing Fiesta, supporting earlier information that the model will grow to offer more cabin space. Previous spy shots show that the car’s rear end will also introduce new horizontal taillights.\n\nSo far Ford has been tight-lipped about the car's technical specifications, but a range of small-capacity turbocharged three and four-cylinder engines seems almost inevitable.\n\nThe Fiesta ST range-topper is likely to retain a boosted 1.6-litre engine but, like the other engines in the range, it'll produce more power than before along with lower emissions.\n\nFord recently dropped the base models from the current Fiesta range following the arrival of the five-door Ka+. This trend will continue in the next-gen car, which will be moved slightly upmarket with a more premium cabin and a more mature appearance.\n\nThe covers will be pulled off the 2017 Ford Fiesta at 8pm tonight. Check back here at that time for a gallery of images and more information.",

      "text": "Bounce Top German carmakers, Ford set up Europe recharging network \nBERLIN (AP) - Top German automakers and Ford are setting up a joint venture to create a fast recharging network in Europe for electric cars. \nBMW, Daimler, Ford and the Volkswagen Group with its Audi and Porsche brands said Tuesday that they've signed a memorandum of understanding that foresees the network being built up starting next year. Their \"initial target\" is to have 400 charging sites in Europe and the goal is to have thousands in place by 2020. \nThe automakers say the planned network will have power levels of up to 350 kilowatts, faster than the most powerful system currently in service. They didn't give financial details. \nThe aim is to make it easier for electric cars to travel long distances and help make them more appealing to the mass market.

      "text": "The front three quarters of Ford’s new Fiesta hatchback have been shown; car pictured is an ST-Line\n\nThe 2017 Ford Fiesta has been partially revealed in an image released six hours before the car’s world debut in Cologne, Germany .\n\nThe single picture shows the evolutionary design that’s been applied to the car’s front three quarters. The grille is similar to that of the latest Focus, while the headlights look like softened and shrunken versions of the outgoing Fiesta’s.\n\nThe pictured car is a five-door model in ST-Line trim, but it also previews how the full ST model will look. It sits on 10-spoke alloy wheels and wears sporty bumpers and side skirts and appears slightly more toned down compared with the current-generation ST models.\n\nOverall dimensions look slightly larger than those of the outgoing Fiesta, supporting earlier information that the model will grow to offer more cabin space. Previous spy shots show that the car’s rear end will also introduce new horizontal tail-lights.\n\nSo far Ford has been tight-lipped about the car's technical specifications, but a range of small-capacity turbocharged three and four-cylinder engines seems almost inevitable.\n\nThe Fiesta ST range-topper is likely to retain a boosted 1.6-litre engine but, like the other engines in the range, it'll produce more power than before along with lower emissions.\n\nFord recently dropped the base models from the current Fiesta range following the arrival of the five-door Ka+. This trend will continue in the next-gen car, which will be moved slightly upmarket with a more premium cabin and a more mature appearance.\n\nThe covers will be pulled off the 2017 Ford Fiesta at 8pm tonight. Check back here at that time for a gallery of images and more information.",

      "text": "BMW, Daimler, Ford And Volkswagen Plan JV For High-Power Charging In Europe  20:  BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford Motor Company ( F ) and Volkswagen Group with Audi and Porsche have signed a memorandum of understanding to create the highest-powered charging network in Europe. The goal is the quick buildup of a sizable number of stations to enable long-range travel for battery electric vehicle drivers. \nThe projected ultra-fast charging network with power levels up to 350 kilowatt will be significantly faster than the most powerful charging system deployed today. The buildup is planned to start in 2017. An initial target of about 400 sites in Europe is planned. \nBy 2020, consumers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points. The goal is to enable long-distance travel through open-network charging stations along highways and major thoroughfares, which has not been feasible for most battery electric vehicle drivers to date. \nThe joint venture formation is subject to execution of definitive agreements and merger control approval in various jurisdictions. \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

      "text": "BMW, Daimler, VW and Ford to Build Auto-Charging Station Network November 29, 2016, 09:05:  \nBERLIN—BMW AG, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG said Tuesday they plan to build together with Ford Motor Co. a network of hundreds of ultrafast, high-powered charging stations for electric cars in Europe. \nThe auto makers have signed a memorandum of understanding to start building stations next year that will make charging cars significantly faster than is possible with even the most powerful charging systems deployed presently. The initial target for the joint venture is to equip about 400 sites with power levels of up to 350 kilowatts. \nBy 2020, customers should have access to thousands of high-powered charging points, according to BMW. The goal is to enable long-distance travel through charging stations along highways and major thoroughfares. (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-29-160905ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",
