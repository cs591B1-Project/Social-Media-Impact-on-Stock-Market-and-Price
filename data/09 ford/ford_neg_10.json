      "title": "Ford: An Investor Can Almost Double His Income In A Very Simple Way",
      "text": "Investors don't have to be content with just dividend income. \nExtra income can be earned using a simple, low-risk options strategy. \nTime duration is until June 2017. Ford Motor (NYSE: F ) touched a low of $11.07 last week before it sharply rebounded to close at $12.28 per share. I had been calling for $11 per share for quite some time, and now that the target was successfully tested, we must look ahead. I had recently penned an article on its competitor General Motors (NYSE: GM ) in which I suggested how an investor could increase his/her income by more than 100 percent. In this article, I will use simple technical analysis to lay the base for an options strategy which can boost the income by almost 100 percent. *For an easier understanding and for the sake of clarity, commissions and fees have been omitted. There are definitely some risks which I will discuss as well, but before that we must keep in mind some points: As one can see from the weekly Ford price chart below, Ford has been trading in a broad downward range since 2014. Ford closed in on its target price of $11.00, following breakdown from the sideways consolidation range. This has been highlighted in the chart below as the two horizontal lines. $12.50 continues to be the strong weekly resistance, and any break above it should propel the stock to the upper range of the broader downtrend. As of this moment, the higher resistance is at $14. Following this broad channel, the stock can have the lowest possible value of $9 and the highest possible value of $13 on June 1, 2017. This can be clearly seen in the weekly price chart below. I do not expect the stock to trade below the support but it can definitely break out on the upside. If the breakout from the higher resistance is achieved successfully, the bulls will strive for $16 (marked in the chart). Click to enlarge Source: TradingView The options strategy I will discuss now will make money even if the stock drops to $9-$10 or if it jumps to $16 by June 2017. Using this broad range of $9-$16, I recommend investors a short strangle options strategy, which requires selling of an out of the money call option and an out of the money put option, both expiring on the same date. The call option to be sold is the $16 call option expiring on June 16, 2017. This option last traded for $0.08, and the market currently sees a formidable 93% probability that this option will expire worthless. In simple terms, it means that the market does not believe that the stock will close above $16 on the expiration date. If the stock rises further, this call option will increase in value. Selling this call option (hypothetically) for $0.08 (last traded price) would bring an investor $0.08 in income for the risk that the stock does not close above $16 on the expiration date, but this risk will be mitigated by the shares he holds. So, there is no reason to worry even if the stock continues to climb higher. The investor would not lose money. Click to enlarge Source: StockOptionsChannel.com On a similar note, I am assuming the worst-case scenario and assuming that the stock plummets almost 30 percent in value from the current level i.e. close to $9 per share. I will discuss later in this article why I believe that the stock will not relentlessly dig deeper using a very simple but proven fundamental metric. As you can see, the market agrees with me and does not see downside below $9. The current probability of the $9 June 2017 put option expiring worthless is a significant 90%. This option last traded for $0.21, and therefore, selling it would bring in approximately $0.21 in income. But, this price will be pressured if the stock opens/closes higher on Monday. Click to enlarge Source: StockOptionsChannel.com So, the total income that an investor can hypothetically get is $0.21 (put) + $0.08 ((call)) = $0.29. This income translates into a return of 2.36% until June 16, 2017. On an annualized basis, this equates to 4%. Combining this with the dividend yield of 4.89% gives ~9 percent in annual returns. The return can be improved for someone willing to take a higher risk. He can choose to instead sell the $10 put option expiring on the same date as the call option. Since the strike price is closer to the market price, this option is rightly trading for a higher value of $0.32. Click to enlarge Source: StockOptionsChannel.com If an investor shorts this option, then his total income would be $0.40 ($0.32 + $0.08). This income is a low-risk return of 3.26% until the expiration date and 5.53% on an annual basis. Comparing this to the current dividend yield, this is clearly a 100 percent potential jump in an investor's income. The one big risk to this strategy is that if the stock drops and accelerates its slide below $9 until the expiration date. I cannot imagine a possible scenario which would cause such a mayhem apart from a recession which seems unlikely in the near-term. Another reason why I do not see stock trading significantly lower than $10 is because of the consistently improving tangible book value of the company. This fundamental metric has been respected by the market for the last 17 years, and the stock has always traded at a premium to it. Please check out the chart below, and check that the current tangible book value is $31.48 billion. Even during the severest of the times such as the 2008-recession, the market has awarded Ford a 10%-20% premium over its TBV. Click to enlarge Pessimistically, if one considers that Ford will be unable to enhance its tangible BV until June 2017 (highly unlikely), and the premium drops to 15% (very less probability), then also the calculations suggest a price of $9 (assuming no dilution or buybacks). A 15% premium on the current TBV = $36.20 billion. Converting $36.20 billion to stock's market price = ($36.20/$49.69) * $12.28 = $8.94. This also suggests that investors don't have to worry about the stock going under $10 as there could easily be a sharp comeback in the price. Conclusion Ford is trapped in a very broad trading range since 2014, but investors can continue to make more income than just the company's fat dividend to richly compensate themselves for their time. The extremely low-risk short strangle options strategy will work even if the stock drops by 30 percent to $9 per share, which is a highly unsustainable price, considering the company's strengthening tangible book value. It would only be merrier if the stock shoots to $14 or higher in the discussed timeframe. Investors are advised to consult their brokers for the commissions and fees involved in this strategy.

      "text": "Learn More \nThe Ford EcoSport is a tiny crossover sold in numerous other countries, but not in the U.S. That’s about to change, though, as Ford plans to launch the EcoSport in its home market. \nThe EcoSport will debut later this week at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford announced on Twitter . DJ Khaled, who will apparently be involved in the unveiling, previously mentioned it on Snapchat. Ford has hinted at bringing the EcoSport to the U.S. as far back as 2014 , and test mules haves been spotted around the company’s Dearborn, Michigan, development center for a while. With crossover sales booming, this is probably the ideal time to launch the EcoSport here. \nFord launched the EcoSport back in 2003, and then debuted the current, second-generation model in 2012. That makes the current design fairly old by industry standards. Automobile reports the U.S. launch will coincide with a face-lift that will include an upgrade to Ford’s Sync 3 infotainment system , among other changes. \nRead more: Updated 2017 Nissan Versa Note to debut at L.A. Auto Show \nThe EcoSport is based on the same platform as the Fiesta, and is significantly smaller than the most compact utility vehicle in Ford’s current U.S. lineup, the Escape . It’s currently offered with a variety of engines in different world markets, but U.S. engine offerings could be derived from the Fiesta, which is currently offered with 1.6-liter four-cylinder and 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engines here. \nWhen it arrives in the U.S., the EcoSport certainly won’t be lacking in competition. It will give Ford an entry into the burgeoning subcompact crossover segment, which in about six years has grown from virtual nonexistence to include a plethora of models such as the Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, and Mazda CX-3. Toyota will show its own subcompact crossover, called the C-HR , in L.A. as well. \nCan an aging design intended for non-U.S. markets compete against all of these rivals? We’ll find out soon. Stay tuned. ",

      "title": "2016 Ford Focus RS review - Roadshow",
      "text": "Ford 2016 Ford Focus RS \nFinally, this one's for us. Ford has been making hotted-up versions of its compact cars for decades, teasing American buyers with machines like the Escort RS and RS Cosworth. They were fast, they were affordable and none of them were available in the US. \nThat changes now. This is the $36,000 Focus RS, the fastest RS ever to wear a blue oval on the nose and perhaps the hottest of hot hatches on the market today. It's fast, no doubt about that, but what about the rest? Let's dive in and find out. Powering around the track \nThe Focus RS feels remarkably planted on the track. Nick Miotke/Roadshow \nThe heart of the Focus RS is a 2.3-liter inline four-cylinder engine making a nicely symmetrical 350 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. Also symmetrical? How that power gets through the ground. After a trip through a six-speed manual transmission (there's no auto or DCT available on Focus), the torque is routed to all four wheels via an advanced AWD system. \nA central differential directs more power to the rear wheels than the front, providing a lively feel, while clutch-type differentials at either end vector torque from left to right as well. In other words, the car can send its power where it wants to ensure great handling. When flirting with the limit the car is just as responsive to adjustments made with your right foot as those made with your hands on the wheel. \nOn the road, and even more so on the track, this results in a car that reacts differently than what you might be expecting -- at least, it was certainly different from what I was expecting. I've spent a lot of time driving Subarus and Audis and other AWD powerhouses, and of course the prevailing trend is to understeer wide when pushed. \nThe Focus RS, however, has an eager, direct response when driven hard. Yes, it too will wallow in understeer if you get into the corner too hot, but it's never of the terminal sort. Simple, light corrections get the nose headed in the right direction, and when flirting with the limit the car is just as responsive to adjustments made with your right foot as those made with your hands on the wheel. \nThis is helped by a suspension that's well stiffer than even the Focus ST, with two-way adaptive dampers situated on all four corners. On their standard stiffness the car is, indeed, quite stiff. Toggle into track mode and they get even more resistant to movement, adding even more sharpness to the feel of the car. \nYes, this is a tall hatchback and with a fair bit of body roll through the corners, but the feel is still legitimately, remarkably good. Drift mode \nFor those times when you want to feel less planted, enter Drift Mode! Nick Miotke/Roadshow \nI would be remiss if I didn't at least mention the Focus RS's Drift Mode, though I confess I think it's more of a gimmick than a good way for Ford's engineers to spend their time. That said, there is a bit of a method to their madness. \nSet the car in drift mode and disable the traction control and the car does feel immediately different -- different, but in a decidedly bad way. The suspension moves to its softest setting, so the RS flops about more than usual, and power sent to the rear wheels is set to maximum. This results in a car that feels very, very unstable: perfect for drifting. Continue Reading Page 1 of 2 Ford More News and Reviews See all",

      "text": "Ford: Eagles close the deal for a change Updated: November 14, 2016 — 4:33 PM EST 1 Share Bob Ford INQUIRER COLUMNIST \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. Ford has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1981, when he served as the Phillies beat writer and later as a general sports columnist for the Delaware County Daily Times. More by Bob Ford Nov 11 \nIn their four losses this season, games that were decided by an average of five points, the Eagles had the ball in the fourth quarter each time with the opportunity to put together a drive that would either assure a victory or provide one. If you have studied the season, or just the words \"four losses\" in the previous sentence, then you know how those opportunities turned out. Smallwood: NFL needs crackdown on helmet-to-helmet hits \nSunday against the Falcons, however, in a game that probably kept alive their playoff hopes, the Eagles took the ball with just over 10 minutes remaining, 76 yards from the end zone and down two points. Nine snaps later, they had the lead and the game. They didn't just travel the distance from their own 24-yard line, but all the way from Detroit, with intermediate stops in Landover, Arlington and East Rutherford. Whatever Doug Pederson learned from the past failures about his team and his options combined to produce the drive that beat the Falcons. \nThe fourth-quarter drive was a distillation of what had worked all game for the Eagles, and comprises what Pederson calls \"a blueprint\" for how his offense will need to operate to win. It involves the short, low-risk passes of the classic West Coast offense, a running game that is more than just an occasional change-up, and solid blocking from a line that appears to be holding together. It's not an exciting mix - Carson Wentz didn't complete a pass that went for more than 20 yards - but losing isn't very exciting, either. \n\"The biggest thing coming out of this game as opposed to some of those other games is we did a little better on first and second down this game than we did in previous games where we kept ourselves in third and long,\" Pederson said. \"We had situations that were at least manageable in terms of down and distance and that gave us an opportunity to stay on the field.\" \nIt was a combo platter of issues that got in their way during the losses. In the Detroit game, a bad holding penalty made them settle for a field goal instead of a probable touchdown, and then a Ryan Mathews fumble followed by an ill-considered interception from Wentz closed the door on that game. Against the Redskins, the Eagles trailed by seven and were driving late when the line crumbled and Wentz was sacked twice. The Cowboys game was lost several times, but the offense had the ball with the score tied and three minutes left when Jordan Matthews lost 2 yards on a second-and-2 completion that cost the drive its momentum. There were two failed fourth-quarter drives against the Giants, the second of which began at the New York 34-yard line following a Jordan Hicks interception and proceeded to a first down at the 17-yard line before dying out. \nSunday's result doesn't mean the Eagles are going to be great at closing games. Falling behind isn't a good recipe for them because it strips away the run game to an extent. It also doesn't mean Pederson's late-game decisions are going to be perfect. But it does mean that for one afternoon, the thing that had been killing them, keeping a vital fourth-quarter drive alive, didn't happen this time. \nThe linchpin of the drive was a second and 10 from the Atlanta 45-yard line in which Pederson went against type and called a running play out of the shotgun. Darren Sproles took the handoff and moved quickly to the outside, getting around the end as Jason Peters locked up Dwight Freeney and gaining 8 yards as Jason Kelce got ahead of him to delay linebacker De'Vondre Campbell for Sproles. \nOne short pass later, it was another first down, and with the help of a pass-interference call in the end zone, the drive ended on a Mathews run around the right end, with Kelce and Brandon Brooks pulling to clear the path. \n\"Obviously, the run to Sproles was huge, but it was just the offensive line taking control of the line of scrimmage that was a big benefit,\" Pederson said. \"We didn't have to necessarily throw the ball as much. Our running game had been taking over and we wanted to continue that late in the game.\" \nThe Sproles run and the Mathews touchdown were the only running plays on the drive, however. The rest were passes to Matthews, Zach Ertz or Sproles, each of whom enjoyed man-to-man coverage with favorable matchups. The threat of the run is what kept Atlanta's defense tight to the line of scrimmage, though. That's \"the blueprint\" Pederson will attempt to replicate the rest of the season. \nWhat remains to be seen is whether the Atlanta result was an outlier, that one day in which the running game didn't dissolve in a game up for grabs, or in which turnovers didn't put the team in a hole too deep to escape. \nMaybe, but it doesn't matter this week. For once, the fourth-quarter drive got all the way home and everyone who said this offense couldn't do it was wrong. Now let's see if they can do it again. \n@bobfordsports",

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport Subcompact SUV Coming To USA With 1.0L And 2.0L Engines | By Share The US version of Ford’s tiny EcoSport SUV made an appearance on the web today, including on Motor1 and other forums , ahead of its motor show debut in Los Angeles this Wednesday. North America’s 2018 EcoSport is the facelifted version of the global model that’s produced in various parts of the world , including Brazil, India and Thailand. It’s unclear where the North American vehicle will be built, but Mexico does sound plausible. Positioned below the Escape in Ford’s crossover and SUV lineup, the EcoSport will go up against the Chevrolet Trax, Jeep Renegade and Nissan Juke in the increasingly competitive subcompact SUV segment, where sales have more than doubled over the past couple of years. From a quick look at the images posted, it seems that the 2018 EcoSport, which will most probably reach other markets next year as the facelifted model, has adopted a front that mimics the latest Escape and Kuga SUVs with a single (instead of double) grille, together with changes to the bumpers, lights and wheels. We didn’t see any pictures of the interior, but Ford’s PR says that it inherits Ford’s SYNC 3 infotainment tech that works with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, coupled to an eight-inch touch screen, with a premium 675-watt B&O PLAY audio system also being available. The EcoSport will arrive in the USA in early 2018 in four trim level offerings named, S, SE, SES and Titanium, 10 colors, and a choice of two gasoline engines, a 1.0-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost, or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, both paired to a standard six-speed automatic transmissions. The bigger engine gets Ford’s Intelligent 4WD as standard. Placing the specs aside, there’s a looming question whether Ford has addressed all the criticisms in regards to quality and handling, especially in Europe where journalists found the EcoSport severely lacking compared to the competition. Autocar’s Matt Prior wrote that last year’s revised EcoSport’s “perceived quality is regrettable, its diesel powertrain is rough and flat, and its chassis is so rudimentary that it could even damage Ford’s prized reputation for dynamic excellence.” Photo Gallery",

      "text": "0 November 14, 2016 Fake Facebook Trump News Brings Teens $3,000 Per Day: Ford Shifts From Mexico To Ohio Under President Obama, Not Trump Paula Mooney \nAnother fake article is making the rounds on Facebook, with folks sharing the article and claiming it is the Gospel truth, without first using Google to verify its voracity. Fake news stories have been a common thing — especially since Trump fever struck the nation, as reported by BuzzFeed . Such fake stories coming out of Macedonia has brought teenagers a world away as much as $3,000 per day, at least for viral stories that get plenty of hits. Another such article about President-elect Trump and Ford is making the rounds today, with fake sites co-opting news from 2015 — and pretending as if it’s recent 2016 news. \nAs reported by CNN , an article titled “ Ford shifts truck production from Mexico to Ohio” was published in August 2015 . Noted within that article published last year are facts about Ford heavy duty pickup trucks that began being assembled in Avon Lake, Ohio, instead of Mexico. [Image by Paul Sancya/AP Images] \nHowever, at least two fake websites have copied the article word-for-word — but have also added the false news that the events happened “Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency” to their titles. Folks spreading the fake articles are being chided for believing that the shift from Mexico to Ohio could happen within the few days since Mr. Trump became President-elect Trump. \nFor example, one article is titled, “BREAKING: Since Donald Trump Won The Presidency Ford Shifts Truck Production From Mexico To Ohio,” and is being shared in droves on Facebook via a donaldtrumpnews.co website. Simply plopping the phrase in Google — with quotes included — such as “Ford’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000” would lead folks to the original CNN piece, and inform them that the fake article being spread is indeed fake. \nInstead, as reported by the following trend graph via Trendolizer , it shows that some people are sharing the article and giving President-elect Trump plenty of praise for the fake article. As seen below, at least one of the fake articles has gotten 25,000 likes on Facebook as of this writing. \nTrend graph: <noscript><iframe src=\"http://pro.trendolizer.com/graph.html?type=likes&hash=14e4232a537a2107e5c88d3fc5abb028&width=510&height=280&noaverage=1&nomovingaverage=1&nochangerate=1\" width=\"530\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></noscript> \nSearching for the phrase “ Since Donald Trump Won the Presidency ” on Facebook reveals plenty of people sharing the fake article and making comments about the piece — whether they know it’s a hoax or not. The fake article on the donaldtrumpnews.co website also links to a site titled ETF , with a duplicate article spreading the fake news. \nThe reason such a story tends to spread so fast on social media, before being roundly debunked, is due to the fervor with which folks demand it be spread. For example, Facebook user Roberto Perra ‎ wrote such a comment to Donald Trump President about the fake article . \n“***BREAKING: God bless Donald J. Trump. He just did something so incredible that every President in US History would be jealous of him. Let’s get this man 1 Million #SHARES to thank him for his hard work. Also remember to comment ‘Thank You Mr. Trump!'” \nThe irony of such pro-Trump enthusiasm is that many times, as reported by the New York Magazine , is that many of the fake articles are created in Macedonia by people who simply want to make money off of the Trump craziness — instead of being invested in any one political party. [Image by Carolyn Kaster/AP Images] \nThe photo directly above shows President Obama viewing new Ford vehicles in 2015. \nAs seen in the top photo above, President Barack Obama ran up the stairs at the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan. That happened on Wednesday, January 7, 2015, as Mr. Obama spoke about America’s surging sectors in manufacturing and the automotive industry. \n[Featured Image by Carolyn Kaster/AP Images]",

      "text": "A software company that has accused Ford Motor Co of patent infringement can't block the Michigan-based automaker from seeking to invalidate those patents, a federal judge in Detroit ruled Thursday.\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Leitman denied Austin, Texas-based Versata Software Inc's bid to block Ford from proceeding with seven petitions for inter partes review (IPR) it has filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Versata said the petitions were barred by a provision in a 2002 contract between the companies that obligated Ford to help Versata \"protect and perfect\" the patents.\nTo read the full story on Westlaw Practitioner Insights, click here: bit.ly/2eX1Uju",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nFord’s heavy duty pickup trucks which used to be built in Mexico started rolling off an assembly line in Ohio this week. That’s good news for the 1,000 Ford workers in Ohio, who might have otherwise been out of work.\nIt’s also good publicity for Ford (F), which has been under fire for investing so much in Mexico. In April, the automaker said it would invest $2.5 billion in transmission plants in the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Guanajuato, creating about 3,800 jobs there.\nFord’s south-of-the-border strategy has drawn heavy criticism from groups such as the United Auto Workers union and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nThe Avon Lake, Ohio, plant produced its first batch of Ford’s full-size F-650 and F-750 pick up trucks on Wednesday.\n“Our investment…reinforces our commitment to building vehicles in America,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president, The Americas. “Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio.”\nThe move comes at a delicate time for Ford.\nThe United Auto Workers union is in negotiations with the automaker as well as General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAM) on new labor deals to replace those that expire next month. And promises by the automakers to keep production and jobs at U.S. plants is a major focus of the union.\nThe union is particularly worried about the plan Ford announced in July to shift production of the C-Max and Focus out of a Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The automaker hasn’t said where that work will go, but employees fear those cars will be built in Mexico. It’s also not clear whether any other cars will be made at the Wayne plant instead, in order to protect about 4,000 jobs.\n“We’re actively pursuing other alternatives for the Wayne plant that will be discussed with our UAW friends. We haven’t decided what will go there,” said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently said that if he’s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to Mexico and then export the items back to the United States.\n“How does that help us?” Trump said about the Ford investment in Mexico while campaigning in Michigan this week. “Mexico is becoming the new China.”",

Saturday November 12 2016. Hokies-UVa kickoff still TBD, Hodges a Mackey semifinalist and Ford's bittersweet record-setter By Andy Bitter | The Roanoke Times Updated ( … ) MATT GENTRY | The Roanoke Times \nGeorgia Tech defender Lance Austin (17) breaks up a pass intended for Virginia Tech wide receiver Bucky Hodges (7) in the first half of the Virginia Tech - Georgia Tech NCAA football game in Blacksburg Va. Saturday November 12 2016. \nIn the middle of the ACC race, the Hokies have an oddly-timed non-conference game at Notre Dame this week. I wrote about that for Tuesday's newspaper . \nBut there were a few more notes and quotes to come out of Monday's press conference. Here they are ... \nFollow me on Twitter and Facebook . \n1. Because it doesn't want you to finalize your Thanksgiving plans, ESPN requested a six-day hold on games for Nov. 26. \nThe network requested one of its six-day holds for a handful of games, meaning it won't have to make an announcement on the kickoff time for Virginia Tech and Virginia until this Sunday. \nThe other games being considered are: South Carolina at Clemson Florida at Florida State Kentucky at Louisville \nOf those four, only Virginia Tech-Virginia has any implications in an ACC division race, although that may not matter much. Florida-Florida State figures to be the most attractive matchup of that group. \n2. Bucky Hodges, a wide receiver, is a semifinalist for the John Mackey Award, given annually to the nation's top tight end. \nHodges is one of eight players listed as a semifinalist, joining Adam Breneman (Massachusetts), Jake Butt (Michigan), Evan Engram (Ole Miss), Gerald Everett (South Alabama), Cole Hikutini (Louisville), O.J. Howard (Alabama) and ​Jordan Leggett (Clemson). \nAs I've noted all year, Hodges has not been a tight end this season. He's been a receiver, having been split out wide and working pretty much exclusively with the receivers at practice, throwing a wrench into the logic of him chasing both Virginia Tech and ACC tight end records. Apparently that doesn't matter in this selection process. \nWith 36 catches for 514 yards and five touchdowns, Hodges is on pace to set personal highs in all three categories. \nFinalists for the award will be named Nov. 22. \n3. Isaiah Ford became the school's all-time receptions leader against Georgia Tech, although it was bittersweet. \nThat's because the Hokies lost. Still, Ford's catch to move past Jarrett Boykin for first on Tech's all-time list came in a big spot, with the Hokies down 20-0 early in the third quarter and trying to find some way to get back in the game. He hauled in a 5-yard touchdown catch, the 24th of his career. \n“At the time, I was just trying to make a play for my team,\" Ford said. \"And it was kind of unfortunate. The play before, I thought I felt like I should have had that one. Got another chance at it and looked at Jerod [ Evans ] and I knew it was coming back to me.\" \nFord also has a critical drop in the fourth quarter on a short fourth down pass, a rarity for the receiver. \n\"The win would have been more important but we didn’t get it,\" he said. \nFord's 2,668 receiving yards are now second on Virginia Tech's all-time list to Boykin's 2,884, a 216-yard difference he likely will make up in these last few weeks. \n4. What's ailing the offense? Execution. \nIt's a boring answer but usually the right one. Coach Justin Fuente said a lot of it has been basic stuff the Hokies haven't done the last couple weeks. \n\"I’m not taking away from what other people are doing, I think they’re doing a good job of making adjustments and stuff,\" Fuente said. \"But some of our execution on some very fundamental things that don’t show up in the stat line -- I’m not talking about interceptions and drops or rushing yards -- I’m talking about blocking the most dangerous man at wide receiver, a couple things in pass protection: it just hasn't been as sharp as it needs to be.\" \nOpponents now having 10 weeks worth of film on the Hokies' new offense might be contributing some too. Fuente has noticed opponents not playing in as tight of coverage as they were earlier this year. \n\" I think people have tried to keep the ball in front of them a little more than they were,\" he said. \"We hit a span there, I don’t remember the order of the games, but we hit a span there where people were playing us pretty tight and we had a couple weeks where we hit some big plays. And it seems to me just in general terms that people are trying to keep the ball in front of them a little bit more and force us to execute on a consistent basis.\" \n\" As the season went on we knew that teams would try to not let us take the roof off the defense and things like that,\" Ford said. \"We’re just going to have to get more plays with yards after the catch.\" \n5. It's tough to get a read on Notre Dame's defense right now. \nMostly because the Fighting Irish have played such a diverse group of offenses since firing coordinator Brian VanGorder in late September. \nThat came after a 38-35 loss to Duke. Since then, the Irish have played Syracuse (a Baylor-like, up-tempo group), N.C. State (in a hurricane on a terrible field), Stanford (uniquely pro-style relative to the rest of college football), Miami (about as normal as there is on this list) and Navy and Army (two option teams). \nAfter giving up 36 or more points three times in its first four games, Notre Dame has kept everyone else but Syracuse under that mark. Opponents have averaged 20.2 points per game against the Irish in the last six games, not elite numbers, but better than their 25.5 ppg average for the season would indicate. \"We’re still in the process of kind of discerning the noticeable differences, because you don’t quite have as much film as you think you do when you realize it’s been six weeks,\" Fuente said. \"So we’re still working on all that. Just from reading coach [ Brian ] Kelly’ s comments and watching some film, I think the kid are playing hard.

      "title": "Ford EcoSport cute ute unveiled at 2016 LA Auto Show",
      "text": "Reddit \nThe burgeoning cute ‘ute scene just got that much bigger, thanks to tonight’s introduction of the Ford EcoSport. Perhaps ‘introduction’ is too strong of a word – the EcoSport has been on sale for more than 10 years all around the world, but has thus far eluded American buyers. \nWhy has Ford kept the EcoSport a secret? It’s all about the shifting market: with SUVs suddenly the hottest segment in the industry, every car company is doing whatever it can to snag a piece of the action – and that includes deputizing models from their global portfolios. This is how a subcompact like the EcoSport, previously judged to be too small for American tastes, suddenly finds itself getting a crash course in U.S. safety and emissions standards. \nWe haven’t been told much about the EcoSport, other than that it will be offered in the first quarter of 2018 – which is quite a long ways away. This helps to explain the lack of details, for while we were informed that the Ford SUV will offer both a 1.0-liter turbocharged EcoBoost three-cylinder engine and a non-turbo 2.0-liter four-cylinder, that was as far as the mechanical discussion went. All-wheel drive will of course be available – although only on 2.0-liter models – and a six-speed automatic transmission handles the gear shifting duties for all versions of the EcoSport. \nFord currently offers each of those engines in the compact Focus (with the 1-liter also found in the Fiesta), where they produce 123 horsepower and 160 horsepower, respectively. It’s reasonable to expect similar performance out of the Ford EcoSport once it clears all of the regulatory hurdles set before it, and both of those numbers (plus the torque that comes with the turbo engine) will keep it competitive against other pint-size SUVs like the Mazda CX-3 and the Chevrolet Trax. \nAlso helping the EcoSport fight the good fight are tech features like the SYNC 3 infotainment system, which comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support, as well as a 675-watt stereo system developed by Bang & Olufsen. Ford is specifically targeting young buyers as well as empty-nesters looking for extra cargo space with the new EcoSport SUV.",

      "text": "Enlarge / Say hello to the littlest Ford SUV, the EcoSport. If you're the kind of person who would rather spend your money on experiences than stuff, Ford thinks this is the vehicle for you. Ford \nHOLLYWOOD, Calif.—On the eve of the Los Angeles Auto Show, Ford unveiled its latest SUV for the US market. Called the EcoSport, it's the smallest SUV the company has brought to these shores, and it's fitted into the range below the Edge. The rapidly growing \"compact SUV\" segment (think Honda HR-Vs and Buick Encores) has sold more than 1.7 million vehicles sold since 2003, and Ford hopes to sell more than half-a-million of its own small SUVs by 2020.\n\"Young Americans are spending their money on experiences, not stuff,\" Ford SUV group marketing manager Michael O'Brien told me. \"But they need a vehicle to enable those experiences.\"\nThe EcoSport, which is loosely based on the Ford Fiesta platform, will come with a choice of two engines and four different trim packages. Buyers can get either the company's award-winning 1.0L three-cylinder EcoBoost engine or a 2.0L four-cylinder, naturally aspirated direct injection option. Both use the same six-speed automatic gearbox. The EcoSport will be available in front-wheel and all-wheel drive versions. The latter sends up to 50 percent of available torque to the rear wheels when necessary.\nLoosely based on the Fiesta platform, the EcoSport looks quite dashing in the flesh. Ford Interior space is remarkably good for a small SUV, and it comes with plenty of storage bins and cubbies as well as USB ports and power outlets. The funky copper accents come with the SES trim. Ford Unusually for a small SUV, the hatch opens to one side rather than lifting up. Ford \"Years of experience taught me there's three things the customer is looking for: performance, capability, and technology,\" said the EcoSport's Chief Engineer Eric Loeffler. As such, the EcoSport will come packed with connectivity. There are a pair of fast-charging USB ports up front, 12v power outlets front and rear, and even the option of a 110v power outlet for the rear passengers.\nThe EcoSport comes with Ford's latest SYNC 3 infotainment system, which uses an 8-inch (203mm) touchscreen on the dash. During our brief hands-on, the system proved impressive compared to previous generations, particularly when it comes to responsiveness. (Android Auto and CarPlay are both present and correct.)\nDespite the SUV's size, the interior is surprisingly roomy, even for backseat passengers. The EcoSport is festooned with storage cubbies and pockets, and the rear hatch opens out to one side rather than lifting up as you might expect.\nOne thing we don't know yet is the price. The EcoSport doesn't arrive in the US until 2018, but expect the base S trim to be significantly cheaper than Ford's current cheapest SUV. If you're in the Los Angeles area and fancy checking out the EcoSport out for yourself, Ford has set up the Go Small, Live Big experience at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. In addition to the EcoSport, you can listen to DJs, look at some displays from local artists, or fawn over tiny rescue animals with the LA Wildlife Learning Center. There will even an urban beach.\nGo Small, Live Big is open from 2pm-10pm this Tuesday and Wednesday, and free tickets are available from FordPresents.com .\nListing image by Ford",

      "text": "St. Paul’s police horses find a home at Como Zoo Mayor Chris Coleman called the opportunity to guide the 135-acre river bluff development in one of St. Paul’s most desirable neighborhoods a unique opportunity within Minnesota and the nation. The mayor has led a delegation of planners and civic partners as far as Europe to study best practices for a “21st century community” that showcases environmentally sensitive urban design.\n“There is no better site for redevelopment, anywhere, that I’ve ever seen, that comes close to this,” said Coleman, who met with Ford officials in Dearborn, Mich., a few months ago. “It could be a home for (seniors) as they continue to downsize. It could be a home for millennials. … I want everything.” \nThe mayor said Ford has been a responsible partner, working hand in hand with the city and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to perform dozens of soil borings and determine where to remove and replace contaminated ground on the site of the former automotive factory. \n“I rarely ask us to give a round of applause for a corporation, but we should give a round of applause,” Coleman said. “We’re getting closer. But most importantly, we’re getting it right.” \nFord will go on the market sometime in 2017-18 to court a master developer for the land. A 25-member community task force has met over the past 10 years, and 34 community meetings have helped craft public priorities around transportation access, job creation and environmental concerns. A dozen technical studies have gauged real estate potential, traffic, open-space demand, options for sustainable energy and other amenities. \nThe site includes 122 acres on top of the bluff and an adjoining 13-acre, five-mile Canadian Pacific Railway spur, which could become a future public transit, bicycle and pedestrian route into the neighborhood. The city plans a rail spur study funded in part by federal transportation grants and East Metro Strong, a public-private economic development partnership with a transit focus. \nCity Council member Chris Tolbert, who represents the neighborhood, called the redevelopment of the former Ford land a “once-in-a-century opportunity to plan the next 100 years. … We have an opportunity for a great development, not just for today, but for the future.” \nThe next Ford site meeting, at 7 p.m. Nov. 21 at Lumen Christi Catholic Church, will focus on transportation and traffic studies.

      "title": "Los Angeles Auto Show Preview: New SUVs From Ford, Jeep, Toyota, and Subaru",
      "text": "0 \nThe U.S. auto show season kicks off with this week's Los Angeles International Auto Show. As usual, several automakers have plans to present important new products at the show. \nWhile we don't know everything about what's coming at the show, we do know this: Some important new crossover SUVs are coming from Ford (NYSE: F) , Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ' (NYSE: FCAU) Jeep brand, Toyota (NYSE: TM) , and Subaru, among others. \nHere's what we know. Ford's EcoSport is finally coming to the U.S. \nThe Blue Oval's smallest crossover SUV has been a staple of its lineup in Europe, South America, and Asia for a few years now. Now the EcoSport, which shares some of its underpinnings with the subcompact Fiesta, will make its U.S. debut in L.A. The U.S. version of the EcoSport may get a new face, but it's otherwise expected to be similar to the European version, shown. Image source: Ford Motor Company. A new global Jeep to replace two current models \nFCA gave us a preview of the all-new 2017 Jeep Compass in September, including the photos you see below (and not much else). FCA hasn't shared a lot of details yet, but we know that the Compass will replace both the current Compass and its brawnier (but similarly sized) sibling, the Jeep Patriot, when it arrives in the U.S. early next year. It's expected that FCA will build the all-new Compass in Mexico . The all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will replace Jeep's current Compass and Patriot models. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The all-new 2017 Jeep Compass will arrive at U.S. dealers in the first quarter of 2017. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Toyota gears up to take on Honda's HR-V \nToyota is jumping into the small-crossover fray with its all-new C-HR, a model that was originally planned for the discontinued Scion brand. The C-HR is built on the highly flexible Toyota New Global Architecture that also underpins the new-for-2016 Prius. \nIn U.S. trim, the C-HR is expected to come with Toyota's mainstay 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Toyota showed off the all-new C-HR crossover at the Paris Motor Show in October. The U.S. version is expected to be similar. Image source: Toyota. Something brand-new: A big Subaru \nFuji Heavy Industries ' (NASDAQOTH: FUJHY) quirky-but-beloved Subaru brand is expected to launch a \"three-row\" 7-passenger crossover SUV in L.A. This new Subaru will replace the Tribeca, a model that never quite caught on with brand loyalists. Being a Subaru, standard all-wheel drive is a safe bet, as is a choice between the brand's mainstay 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and its larger 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine. Will Volkswagen bring a new electric car to Los Angeles? \nVolkswagen (NASDAQOTH: VLKAY) took the wraps off its overhauled Golf lineup in Germany earlier this month. But it didn't show an expected battery-electric version of the compact hatchback, leading your humble Fool (among others) to speculate that VW was saving its electric Golf for the L.A. show.",

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport Antuan Goodwin/Roadshow \nTonight the 2018 Ford EcoSport becomes what Ford claims to be the world's first vehicle revealed on Snapchat. The compact SUV joins the automaker's alliterative family of SUVs , filling out the smallest end of the scale. \nSome of you may already recognize the little EcoSport. The model has already seen two generations elsewhere in the world; first in Brazil in 2003 and then a global second-gen model in 2012 . The EcoSport debuting tonight features a significant facelift both inside and out and new technology highlighted by Sync 3 and B&O Play. Ford's smallest SUV \nIn a way, it's no surprise to see Ford, a company known for its big trucks and SUVs, going small by bringing the tiny EcoSport stateside. Compact SUV sales have exploded into a feeding frenzy over the last few years and are continuing to grow. Ford needs to compete at this small scale to remain competitive. \nThe EcoSport features styling cues that are a blend of the Ford Fiesta and Ford Escape -- which is sort of what the EcoSport is, really. The SUV's footprint very similar to that of the Fiesta hatchback, but its greenhouse is a bit more upright and there's a tad more ground clearance to work with. \nOut back is a rear gate that swings horizontally like a door rather than vertically like a hatchback. Room for people and cargo and the general proportions of the EcoSport remind me of the Kia Soul , which will be one of its fiercest competitors. (Can you even consider cars this cute \"fierce\"?) 2018 Ford EcoSport Titanium comes to... See full gallery 1 - 6 of 32 Two performance tiers \nUnder the hood, the EcoSport buyer will find one of two powertrain options. \nThe first is a turbocharged and direct-injected 1.0L Ecoboost three-cylinder with a front-wheel drive powertrain. Ford hasn't stated output yet but previous incarnations of the cutest little EcoBoost make between 99 and 123 horsepower depending on the market. \nThose wanting more capability can choose the 2.0-liter naturally aspirated model with Ford's Intelligent 4WD system, an on-demand all-wheel drive setup similar to the one found on the Escape. Again, power figures haven't been stated, but the 143 horsepower and 137 pound-feet of torque for the global model is a good starting point for guesses. \nBoth feature six-speed automatic transmissions -- though not the same one -- and four-wheel disc brakes as standard equipment. Audio by B&O Play \nPerhaps the most interesting bit of new tech for the 2018 EcoSport is the optional B&O Play premium audio system, the first fruit of the new partnership between Ford and Bang and Olufsen's portable audio brand. This setup brings 675 watts of amplification and 10-speakers to the party for the Titanium level. \nWe expected the cabin around that audio system to look a lot like that of the Escape, Focus and Fiesta, but the EcoSport makes a pretty dramatic departure with its large 8-inch floating touchscreen display. It's an imposing piece of hardware jutting out from the little SUV's dashboard; Ford claims that it's the \"largest display in the segment.\" Antuan Goodwin/Roadshow \nPowering the infotainment is Ford's Sync 3 software with all of the voice recognition, FordPass app integration and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration that we've come to love from this generation of Ford's dashboard tech. \nJust below the dashboard are a pair of fast-charging USB ports for juicing gadgets on the go. There's also an optional 110-volt AC inverter available as an option for those who need to power larger devices. \nFord hasn't made mention of any driver aid features -- optional or standard -- for the 2018 EcoSport, but we'll update with details as they come available. Available in 2018 \nThe EcoSport will be available in four trim levels: S, SE, SES and the aforementioned Titanium. Titanium is the top-tier model with chrome brightwork and premium amenities. \nSES is the \"sporty\" trim level with dark Magnetic Gray grille and wheel treatments, tinted headlamps, black roof rails with crossbars and unique copper accents on the seats and dashboard. The more powerful 2.0-liter engine, all-wheel drive system and sport-tuned suspension and steering should add a bit of extra performance to match the SES' sported-up looks. \nThe all-new Ford EcoSport starts arriving in dealerships in early 2018, which is quite a way off. We expect it'll be some time before pricing is finalized.

Ford EcoSport Equipped with either an award-winning, 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost® engine or 2.0-liter four-cylinder with Intelligent 4WD, all-new Ford EcoSport provides power and control.

All other major automakers also have expanded and built new plants in Mexico. \n\"We build EcoSport in six locations around the globe. We sell it in 100 markets, and so, just like we make Explorers and export from here into other global markets, we are going to export EcoSport from Asia Pacific, and we are going to sell it here in the U.S,\" said Michael O'Brien, Ford marketing manager for SUVs. \nFord has made the EcoSport in India since 2013. The EcoSport also is assembled in Brazil, Thailand and Russia and will be made in Romania starting in autumn 2017. \nFord EcoSport (Photo: Ford) \nFord imports its Transit Connect commercial van from Turkey into the into the U.S., but this will be the first time the Dearborn automaker has produced a vehicle in India for sale in the U.S. \n\"We are a global company, we have a logistics operation shipping Explorers, F-Series and Escapes all over the planet,\" O'Brien said. \"We know how to do it.\" \nFord is launching the subcompact EcoSport at a time when sales of small SUVs are exploding. U.S. sales of compact SUVs topped 276,000 in 2015. Ford predicts that number will double over the next five years, to more than 550,000. \nSome would argue that Ford is late to the subcompact SUV game. EcoSport will compete with vehicles such as the Chevrolet Trax, Fiat 500X, Honda HR-V, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3 and Nissan Juke. \n\"I think our view is that while (the) segment has grown significantly, there is lots more growth coming in 2020. We love our position. ... We think our timing is going to be just great,\" O'Brien said. \nFord says it sells more SUVs and crossovers than any automaker. It has sold more than 12.5 million SUVs globally over the past 25 years. Since 2003, Ford has sold 1.7 million EcoSports. \nIn the U.S., Ford is aiming the EcoSport at two main consumer groups — millennials and empty nesters. That's why Ford choose to reveal the EcoSport right off the Hollywood Walk of Fame at an event headlined by DJ Khaled titled \"Go Small, Live Big.\" \nKhaled is an American record producer and radio personality known for short, esoteric speeches on Snapchat. Snapchat is a social media service that sends a photo or video to someone that lasts only up to 10 seconds before it disappears. \n\"He's the king of Snapchat. ... He gets about 3 to 4 million views per day from his content,\" said Chantel Lenard, executive director of U.S. marketing. \"So he is very well known in that space, and we think it connects well with the millennial audience.\" \nThe styling of the EcoSport reflects that of the Ford Escape, but in a smaller, bolder and more athletic package. It will be powered by a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine with front-wheel drive, or an optional 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine with all-wheel drive. Ford did not release information on horsepower, fuel economy or pricing. \nFord EcoSport (Photo: Ford) \nThe EcoSport will be sold in four versions, starting with the S, moving up to the SE, then the SES and finally, the titanium. \nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport Titanium will come equipped with a 10-speaker, 675-watt sound system developed by B&O Play, a Harman brand. Ford says Harman's acoustic engineers spent hundreds of hours perfecting the in-vehicle music experience. \nThe EcoSport also will have optional HD Radio technology, SiriusXM satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals. \nContact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

      "text": "The wee little EcoSport is Ford’s new small SUV But you can’t buy one for more than a year Nov 14, 2016, 10:00pm EST Image credit: Ford share Ford is jumping on the small SUV bandwagon with the new EcoSport, joining wee trucks like the popular Nissan Juke and Jeep Renegade. It’s aimed straight at the active millennial market and Ford says the EcoSport is “fun, capable, and connected.” The car’s tagline is “going small and living big.” Okay then! The EcoSport is available with a itty-bitty 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engine, or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder power plant (which includes 4WD standard). Other features include an astounding thirty places to store your stuff, including pockets, bins, and hooks; there’s also a movable floor board in the cargo compartment and fold-flat seats to fit even more stuff. pockets and bins and hooks, oh my! It’s got all the tech features you’d expect: an available 8-inch screen complete with CarPlay and Android Auto; the FordPass smartphone app that can remotely start, lock/unlock the doors, see vehicle location, or data like fuel level; and a horizontally swinging tailgate (ok, that’s not really a tech feature). It all sounds great! What’s not great is when the EcoSport will hit dealers: it’s not expected until early 2018 — that’s right, Ford is introducing a car it won’t actually launch for more than a year. These pictures will have to tide you over until you can go and buy one, or you can just decide to buy one of its myriad competitors that are available today. Whichever.",

(Photo: Ford) \nHollywood — After more than a decade of sales overseas, Ford Motor Co. will bring the small Ford EcoSport SUV to the United States, arriving in dealerships in early 2018.\nThe Dearborn-based automaker unveiled the latest generation of the subcompact SUV in Hollywood on Monday — a day before the Los Angeles Auto Show media days begin — with the help of popular-artist DJ Khaled via the world’s first Snapchat vehicle reveal.\nFord’s EcoSport arrives several years after some automakers began selling their own subcompact SUVs in the U.S. Competitor General Motors Co., for example, introduced the popular Buick Encore in 2013 and recently added a sibling, the Chevrolet Trax, to the stable.\nSmall SUVs have gained a following among drivers in urban areas who want the functionality and easy parking of a tiny crossover.\nBuyers will be able to choose from a 1-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine or a 2-liter, four-cylinder EcoBoost. The 2-liter will come standard with four-wheel drive. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Ford did not offer fuel-economy estimates.\nThe automaker says the small crossover with a swinging tailgate is full of connectivity, charging and storage options, including as many as 30 pockets, bins and hooks in the interior. In the rear, the EcoSport has a movable floor board and fold-away second-row seats that create a flat cargo area.\nThe vehicle is built on the same platform as the Ford Fiesta. The EcoSport is expected to be the smallest utility vehicle from the Dearborn-based automaker for the U.S.\nFord introduced the first generation of the EcoSport in select markets in 2003. A second generation launched in Brazil and other global markets in 2012.\nIt is currently produced in Brazil, India, Thailand and Russia. Versions destined for the U.S. will be built in India.\nDrivers will be able to customize their EcoSport, choosing from 10 exterior colors, seven ambient lighting options and four trims: S, SE, SES and Titanium. The SES trim includes four-wheel drive, a sport-tuned suspension and steering, sports seats and bold copper accents in the interior.\nFord’s SYNC 3 infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen has Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities.\nIt also showcases an available premium B&O PLAY audio system. B&O PLAY will come standard on the EcoSport Titanium and features 10 speakers, branded tweeters and woofers in the front doors, and a subwoofer in the rear. The small SUV also will be available with HD radio, SiriusXM satellite radio and dual FM radio antenna.\nDrivers also will be able to start or lock their vehicle using SYNC Connect with the FordPass mobile app.\nFord is holding a Hollywood pop-up event that is open to the public through Wednesday night.\nSmall crossovers and SUVs are expected to be a major part of the LA Auto Show, which officials say will feature more than 50 vehicle debuts.\nToyota on Thursday will reveal a compact crossover, the 2018 C-HR. Mazda plans to reveal its redesigned 2017 CX-5 compact SUV at the show on Wednesday.\nThe Jeep Compass compact SUV will make its North American debut for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV alongside an all-new SUV from Italian brand Alfa Romeo. \nmwayland@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2504\nTwitter: @MikeWayland",

      "text": "Ford's Tiny EcoSport SUV Revealed Before Early 2018 U.S. Release | By Share Just a few hours after surfacing online , the 2018 Ford EcoSport has been officially unveiled for the North American market ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show . Although Ford says the model is all-new, it is essentially just a facelifted version of the EcoSport available elsewhere in the world. Nevertheless, it acts as an interesting addition to Ford’s North American range and according to the brand, “is a perfect companion for those who believe in going small and living big”. Customers of the 2018 EcoSport will be able to opt for either a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged engine or a larger 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Ford hasn’t released technical specifications of these engines just yet but has confirmed that the 2.0-liter unit will come paired with a four-wheel drive system as standard. Both will then be coupled with six-speed automatic transmissions. Despite the model’s small size, Ford has packed the cabin full with all of its latest technologies, including the new B&O Play audio system as standard on the EcoSport Titanium featuring 10 speakers and 675 watts of power. This audio system was developed in part by acoustic engineers from Harman and promises to provide an excellent listening environment. Elsewhere, the EcoSport includes SiriusXM satellite radio, a dual FM radio antenna and HD Radio technology incorporated into Ford’s SYNC 3 communications and entertainment system. The 8-inch system also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Also found within the sub-compact SUV are two fast-charging USB ports, two 12-volt power outlets and a 110-volt outlet. In total, customers will be able to opt between four different trim levels, the S, SE, SES and Titanium. All are offered with the same palette of 10 exterior color options as well as seven ambient lighting options. While the Titanium is the range-topper, the SES is the sportiest of the four and includes four-wheel drive, sport-tuned suspension and steering as well as copper accents throughout the interior, including on the sport seats. Ford says the EcoSport will arrive in local dealerships in early 2018. Prices have yet to be released. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "It was hard to miss the message behind Ford Motor Co.’s pop-up event in Hollywood on Monday night. The tiny homes, vignette of Venice Beach, signs emblazoned with social media messages, and food stand hosted by the trendy Smorgasburg flea market were all code for “Hey, millennials, this is for you.”\nAnd that’s the market--at least one of them--that Ford hopes its new EcoSport subcompact crossover will attract.\nFord’s SUV group marketing manager, Michael O’Brien, said Monday the company is also targeting women and empty nester baby boomers with the EcoSport. The idea, as its Go Small, Live Big tagline suggests, is to introduce a vehicle desirable to mobile, connected consumers who want to experience things, not collect them.\nFord, with the help of rap artist DJ Khaled, introduced its EcoSport to the North American market Monday night at the event and on Snapchat. Ford says it’s the first vehicle to be revealed on Snapchat.\nA social media message at the Ford EcoSport launch party. ( Photograph by Kirsten Korosec) Ford f introduced the subcompact crossover ahead of AutoMobility LA, the new industry trade show that combines the automotive press days for the LA Auto Show and its related (and former) Connected Car Expo. AutoMobility LA, which officially kicked off Monday night, gets down to business Tuesday morning with a keynote from Ford CEO Mark Fields.\nThe EcoSport was introduced in 2003, but it’s never been available in the U.S. or Canada. It was originally built and sold in Brazil. It’s also sold in Argentina, Asia, and Europe.\nThe new EcoSport will come in four trim level offerings, including the S, SE, SES, and Titanium. Customers will be able to pick from 10 exterior color choices and seven ambient lighting options. The Titanium trim, pictured below, features more chrome details, and comes standard with a B&O PLAY audio system and 10 speakers. The SES is designed to look more rugged.\n(Photograph by Kirsten Korosec) The vehicle will be offered in two different powertrains: a 1.0-liter ecoboost engine that is 2-wheel drive and a 2.0-liter engine with a 4-wheel drive. The latter is the same system on the Ford Escape SUV.\nThe inside features an 8-inch floating touchscreen with enhanced voice recognition. The vehicle will be equipped with its Sync 3 infotainment platform that will include Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, two rival software services that let the driver or passengers bring the functions of their smartphone into the vehicle's central screen. This is in line with Ford’s previous announcement in July that all of its 2017 model-year cars, trucks, and SUVS will come with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\nOther notable items include the EcoSport aiming to make more room, even though it’s a subcompact. The back storage area is accessed via a swing gate. The handle for the swing gate, which is incorporated into the taillight pictured below, is one of the cooler design details.\n(Photograph by Kirsten Korosec) There are easy places for passenger to stash their smartphones, with a cooled glovebox and dual pockets behind the front seats. There’s even a small shirt-sized pocket on the side of the passenger seat that a driver could easily access.\nFord EcoSport. (Photograph: Courtesy of Ford) The vehicle also has two fast-charging USB ports and a standard 12-volt power outlet.\nFord says the new EcoSport will start arriving in dealerships in early 2018.",

      "text": "Multifamily housing, park and green space featuring a pond nearer the Mississippi River, bike and walking trails and a bustling commercial district near existing stores abutting Ford Parkway.\nThat was the rough vision presented Monday night as a first glimpse into what redevelopment of the former Ford site in St. Paul's Highland Park could look like, according to a presentation at the O'Shaughnessy Educational Center at the University of St. Thomas. About 400 people heard about the preliminary plan , which includes possible zoning changes and the outline of a connected transportation network on the site.\nSt. Paul leaders shared an idyllic vision of a bike-friendly, transit-oriented community on the 122 acres where Ford once produced cars and trucks — a community complete with a variety of jobs, housing and retail. A more detailed look at transportation to and from the site will be held next week.\n\"I want everything. I want this to be our everything,\" St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman said of a development that could increase tax revenue by an estimated $22 million. \"But to get this right is going to take patience. It's going to take time.\"\nThe city will collect community input through February 2017, by holding additional meetings and through Open Saint Paul.\nA formal master plan, incorporating feedback, is expected to go to the Planning Commission next spring and to City Council next summer. Final adoption is expected by late summer or early fall.\n\"The end goal that we are starting [Monday] is to get through City Council approval next summer,\" said Jonathan Sage-Martinson, director of Planning and Economic Development. \"But there will be lots of time for input and to tweak.\"\nFord officials have said they plan to begin marketing the site to a master developer in late 2017 or in 2018.\n\"After nearly a decade of community conversations, studies, and planning, city staff has compiled that information and will put forth the first draft of a formal zoning and public realm plan,\" said Council Member Chris Tolbert, who represents the area. \"We still have much work to do as a community as we move toward a final plan for this amazing site on the Mississippi River and in the heart of Highland Park.\"\nFord Motor Co. officials told the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in June that they expect to finish cleaning up the site — which they began in 2012 — and sell it to a developer in 2019.\nThe site where the assembly plant long stood is a prime piece of real estate, sandwiched among Ford Parkway, Cleveland Avenue and Mississippi River Boulevard in the Highland Park neighborhood.\nThe site is zoned primarily for industrial use. Rezoning will be necessary for the mixed-use urban village envisioned by area residents and city leaders. City officials said rezoning will clearly identify the site's redevelopment potential and market value to prospective buyers, as well as create more certainty of what is to come.\nMuch will change over the next couple of years. Still, officials said it's an exciting new phase.\n\"This is just to get your imagination going,\" said Merritt Clapp-Smith, principal planner.",

      "text": "By Mary Conway 2016-11-14 23:18 Ford is roaring into the small SUV market in a big way with 2018 EcoSport SUV Ford unveiled the 2018 EcoSport on Snapchat, a strong indication of their target audience. The small SUV is loaded with premium audio and other amenities, is perfect for the young buyer who demands the latest in technology delivered in a small package. \nRyan Seacrest and DJ Khaled unveiled the 2018 Ford EcoSport SUV to a cheering crowd on Hollywood Boulevard with the motto, Go Small, Live Big. The unveiling was on the eve of the Los Angeles auto show. \nAll of the promotional material appears aimed at the younger market. A video on the news release compares the new compact SUV to your favorite backpack, “Enough room for the things you love but still manageable”. \nThe head of Ford’s U.S. marketing, Chantel Lenard says “More people are choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff. EcoSport fits perfectly into this growing lifestyle. It’s our smallest SUV, packed with features and personality.” Ford has been selling the EcoSport in other markets for years. It will arrive in American showrooms in early 2018. \nFord is the latest to join the compact SUV market. Buick started selling the luxury “baby Enclave” called the Encore in 2013. Chevrolet has the tiny Trax and Honda has the HR-V. \nMary Barra told me, long before she became CEO that GM was convinced that the U.S. was ready for small-premium SUVs. The Encore was filled with luxury, from the leather seats to the latest in amenities. They had a dual target audience, young people, who liked and could afford nice vehicles, but didn’t need a family hauler. They were also aiming at older drivers, people who wanted luxury but were looking to downsize. GM’s gamble paid off. The Encore has found its market and now Ford is hoping to find it as well. \nThe little EcoSport is built on the same platform as the Fiesta, so it is a small vehicle. It will have a swing-style tailgate. It will come in four different trim levels. \nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport will feature the latest in gadgetry, including electrical outlets for staying charged up and ready to take on the world. According to Ford, EcoSport will have “two fast-charging USB ports to ensure owners’ devices are always juiced. Plus, there’s a 12-volt power outlet. An available 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console and another 12-volt outlet allow rear-seat passengers to stay plugged in”. \nThe 2018 Ford EcoSport will have an 8” touchscreen, Sync 3 and offer premium audio. The Titanium level package will include a B&O PLAY audio system, features 10 speakers, including B&O PLAY-branded tweeters and woofers in the front doors and a subwoofer in back. \nDrivers will have their choice of two different engines. There is a 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost® or 2.0-liter four-cylinder. Both have automatic transmissions. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder is 4WD. \nMany have wondered why Ford has waited so long to bring the EcoSport to the U.S., especially because it has existed for at least a decade, elsewhere. Perhaps they waited to see how well the Encore would do. Pricing and mileage ratings were not released. It is expected that the 2018 EcoSport will be Ford’s only tiny SUV for North America.",

      "text": "Competes with: Chevrolet Trax, Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Nissan Juke \nLooks like: A baby Ford Escape \nDrivetrain: Turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder or 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine; front- or all-wheel drive; six-speed automatic transmission \nHits dealerships: Early 2018 \nMore 2016 L.A. Auto Show Coverage \nSUVs continue to dominate the market in all shapes and sizes, and Ford is expanding its lineup of offerings with the 2018 EcoSport, which is making its North American debut at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show . The smallest SUV that Ford has in its global showroom, the EcoSport has been on sale for almost a decade in other parts of the world, mostly developing markets such as Brazil, India and Eastern Europe. Now the company will be importing the subcompact SUV from a plant in Chennai, India. It will slot below the Escape and Edge, and compete with diminutive offerings such as the Honda HR-V, Chevrolet Trax, Mazda CX-3 and Nissan Juke. Exterior \nThe resemblance to the rest of Ford's lineup is clear — the EcoSport features the same front-end shapes and style as the bigger Escape and Edge, with the trapezoidal grille that adorns just about everything else in the Ford lineup from the Focus to the Mustang. The rest of the EcoSport, from the A-pillar back, looks like a traditional \"one box\" design, with an upswept beltline and blacked-out wraparound rear glass that looks a lot like a Buick Encore. \nFour trim choices will be available: S, SE, SES and Titanium, with the SES designated as the \"sporty\" trim with unique styling elements. All models will feature a swing gate instead of a traditional upward opening hatch, hinged on the left side to allow for easier curb loading. Ten exterior color choices will be available. Interior \nInside, the EcoSport features a unique floating display panel front and center to house the 8-inch touchscreen that uses Ford's latest Sync 3 multimedia system, standard on the Titanium models. Lesser trims get either a 4-inch or 6-inch screen mounted in the same location with Sync 3 an option. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also will be offered, as will the FordPass app that allows connection and management of the car's systems via a smartphone. Audio supplier Harman has teamed up with B&O to offer B&O Play, standard on the Titanium model, a 675-watt premium audio system featuring 10 speakers, including a subwoofer. \nThe interior is also designed for versatility, with as many as 30 cubbies, hooks and storage bins throughout the cabin. The second-row seats fold and stow for increased cargo room, and combine with a false floor board in the cargo area to create a flat area for larger items. \nThe SES trim also features some special interior appointments, with sport seats and unique copper colored trim pieces to spice things up. The top trims feature two USB ports low in the console for charging personal electronics along with a 12-volt socket. Optional is a 110-volt household outlet, plus a second 12-volt socket for the backseat. Under the Hood \nTwo engine choices will be available. First is a turbocharged three-cylinder EcoBoost engine like the one found in the Ford Focus and Fiesta, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission; it sends power to the front wheels only. The optional engine is a larger non-turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that will include all-wheel drive as standard. The 2.0-liter will be standard equipment on the SES model, in keeping with that trim's sportier demeanor, but the top Titanium can be had in either three-cylinder or four-cylinder guise. Ford did not provide horsepower or fuel economy ratings for the powertrains, and likely will not until closer to the car's on-sale date, more than a year away. \nDetroit Bureau Chief Aaron Bragman grew up in the Detroit area, comes from an automotive family and is based in Ann Arbor, Mich.

      "text": "Andrew Ganz \nIt may be new to the American market for the 2018 model year, but the Ford EcoSport is actually a global market crossover finally being sold here on Ford's home turf. \nThe EcoSport nameplate has been around since the early 2000s, when it debuted as a Brazilian pint-size crossover. But the version headed to the United States is based on a model assembled in about half a dozen plants and sold in virtually every market worldwide. \nThat said, the EcoSport you'll soon be able to buy in Chicago isn't quite the same as the one in Chennai. Interestingly, the U.S. is one of the last places to be offered the EcoSport as it has been on sale in certain markets since 2013. \nMORE: Read our 2018 Ford EcoSport preview \nDesigned to square off against rivals like the Mazda CX-3 and the Chevrolet Trax, the EcoSport is a small five-seat crossover with limited cargo space and a tight second row of seats. But its pint-size dimensions make it decidedly city-oriented here. Instead of a liftgate like its rivals, the EcoSport features a swing-out tailgate. In some markets, that tailgate has a spare tire festooned to it, but the American EcoSport does without a spare. That's not necessarily unusual; most rivals do without a fifth wheel and tire as well. \nGlobal market EcoSports come in at around 167 inches from head to toe, making them quite a bit smaller than the brand's Escape. For comparison, the Escape is about a foot longer, with most of that space dedicated to the rear seat and the cargo area. \nThe EcoSport is based on the Ford Fiesta's platform, which should give it nimble handling. Ford hasn't yet detailed full specifications for the American market EcoSport, but we can expect to see a choice between 1.0-liter turbocharged 3-cylinder and 2.0-liter naturally-aspirated 4-cylinder power. Only the 4-cylinder model will be offered with all-wheel drive. Both engines are mated exclusively to 6-speed automatic transmissions. \nThe 2018 EcoSport will be offered in four trim levels—S, SE, SES, and Titanium. The SES model includes a specially-tuned sport suspension and copper-tinted interior and exterior accents, but it is offered only with the 2.0-liter engine and all-wheel drive. \nOn the tech front, the EcoSport packs a lot for a small vehicle. An 8.0-inch touchscreen shows off Ford's updated Sync 3 system and both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A 10-speaker B&O Play audio system will be included on the Titanium, too.",

Click here to submit a Letter to the Editor , and we may publish it in print. \nLOS ANGELES -- Ford Motor Co. is retooling one of its best-selling light trucks overseas to overcome a late entry in one of the U.S. auto industry's hottest segments -- subcompact crossovers. \nThe North American version of the EcoSport that Ford introduced late Monday, decked out with unique exterior trim, connectivity and a new engine, suspension and interior, is an attempt to cash in on the public’s insatiable appetite for smaller crossovers and light trucks. \nThe EcoSport was introduced in 2003 in South America. Last year, Ford said it sold just over 250,000 EcoSports globally in 140 countries, and it has delivered 1.7 million worldwide since its introduction. \nThe latest EcoSport will be available in U.S. showrooms in early 2018. It is the first of four all-new SUV or crossover nameplates the automaker plans to add to its Ford and Lincoln brands in the next few years as utilities drive the industry to near-record sales. \nThe EcoSport will debut in a competitive segment that includes the Jeep Renegade, Honda H-RV, Subaru Crosstrek, Chevrolet Trax and Buick Encore. Toyota, Hyundai and Kia are also prepping entries in the segment. \nWhile U.S. light-vehicle demand has slipped 0.3 percent this year from 2015's record levels, the subcompact crossover market is on fire -- surging 32 percent to nearly 300,000 vehicles. \nAnalysts say Ford’s experience with light trucks such as the Edge, Escape and Explorer should help it in a U.S. segment that it’s never before entered. \n“Ford understands utility vehicles more than most other manufacturers,” said Stephanie Brinley, senior analyst with forecasting firm IHS Markit. “It certainly looks like it should be a home run product.” \nFord did not release volume targets, but Brinley forecasts the automaker will sell 60,000 EcoSports in the U.S. annually. The five-seat vehicle will be imported to the U.S. from Ford’s plant in Chennai, India. \n“We believe this is the right vehicle for the time we’re currently living in,” said Michael O’Brien, Ford’s SUV group marketing manager. “We think the time is right for EcoSport.” \nFord expects the subcompact crossover market will double in size by the end of the decade. The EcoSport should find fans among millennials and empty-nest baby boomers for its compact size and generous utility space, Ford is betting. \nThe U.S. version will be unique. \nCompared to overseas models, the North American EcoSport has a new front end, instrument panel, center console, powertrains and suspension. It will be 9 inches shorter than the compact Ford Escape. \n“We gave our designers the task of delivering a vehicle that had some attitude, had some ruggedness, but also demonstrated the agility and nimbleness that customers in this space desire,” O’Brien said. \nDepending on trim level, the instrument panel features either a 4, 6 or 8-inch touchscreen. It’s the first Ford vehicle to debut what’s known as a “floating display,” where the screen is tilted above the console for easier access. \nEcoSport will feature Harman’s B&O Play sound system as optional equipment depending on trim level. \n“There’s three things our SUV customers want: performance, capability and technology,” said Eric Loeffler, the EcoSport’s chief engineer. “It’s a unique challenge to get all that into such a small package.” \nThe EcoSport will come standard with a front-wheel drive, 1-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost engine. A 2-liter, four-cylinder engine with four-wheel drive will be optional. \nBoth engine options come with a six-speed automatic transmission. \nIt will feature four trim levels -- S, SE, SES and Titanium. \nFord did not disclose fuel economy ratings or horsepower figures for the baby crossover.

      "text": "Ford EcoSport [US] ( 2018 ) Ford EcoSport [US] \nFord introduced the all-new Ford EcoSport for North America for those who want space-saving convenience and SUV capability. \nThe Ford EcoSport - a fun, capable, connected compact SUV - stars in the world's first-ever vehicle reveal on Snapchat, kicking off a Hollywood pop-up event open to the public. \nThe interactive event showcases how EcoSport is a perfect companion for those who believe in going small and living big. \n\"More people are choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff,\" said Chantel Lenard, ‎executive director, Ford U.S. marketing. \"EcoSport fits perfectly into this growing lifestyle. It's our smallest SUV, packed with features and personality.\" \nFun sound, color and style \nFord EcoSport's available premium B&O PLAY audio system brings your music to life. HARMAN acoustic engineers spent hundreds of hours perfecting the in-vehicle music experience. \nThe Ford-exclusive B&O PLAY audio system, standard on EcoSport Titanium, features 10 speakers, including B&O PLAY-branded tweeters and woofers in the front doors and a subwoofer in back. The 675-watt system unlocks the power of your favorite music and transforms every drive into a \"living big\" experience. \nFord EcoSport also features available HD Radio technology, SiriusXM® satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals. \nCustomers looking to stand apart from the crowd will find plenty of ways to personalize their EcoSport. Along with 10 exterior color choices, there are seven ambient lighting options and four trim level offerings - S, SE, SES and Titanium. All series feature a swing-gate-style tailgate. 2018 Ford EcoSport [US] \nThe personality-packed SES series makes the biggest splash. It features Intelligent 4WD, sport-tuned suspension and steering, and unique styling cues inside and out - including bold copper accents for the interior and sport seats. \nConnected technology \nFord EcoSport makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family with SYNC® 3, Ford's communications and entertainment system. Faster, more intuitive and easier to use, the system provides more conversational voice recognition and enhanced response to driver commands. Optimized for hands-free use, SYNC 3 for EcoSport is coupled with a touch screen similar to a smartphone or tablet. The 8-inch screen gives front-row occupants easy access to operate available Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ commands, and B&O PLAY audio settings. \nDrivers also have the ability to start, lock, unlock and locate their vehicle from almost anywhere using available SYNC Connect with FordPass®. The mobile app lets owners view vehicle information, such as the fuel level and odometer reading, when not in the vehicle. \nFord EcoSport features two fast-charging USB ports to ensure owners' devices are always juiced. Plus, there's a 12-volt power outlet. An available 110-volt outlet positioned behind the center console and another 12-volt outlet allow rear-seat passengers to stay plugged in, too. \nCapable, powerful and sporty \nEquipped with either the award-winning, 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost® or 2.0-liter four-cylinder, EcoSport provides power and control. Drivers opting for the 2.0-liter engine get Ford's Intelligent 4WD standard. Both come with six-speed automatic transmissions. \nAs many as 30 stowage pockets, bins, hooks make efficient use of every interior inch. A cargo management system at the rear features a movable floor board and fold-away second-row seats to provide a flat area for moving furniture and other larger items. \nEcoSport consumer experience in Hollywood \nLocated at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, the Ford EcoSport Go Small, Live Big experience is open to the public Tuesday and Wednesday from 2 to 10 p.m. Registration and tickets are managed by FordPresents.com. \nThe Ford EcoSport event consumer experiences include: Small stage, big entertainment: A sound and light environment showcases the EcoSport's available B&O PLAY audio system, ambient lighting and LED display. Special musical performances include Chromeo (DJ set), Echosmith, Phillip Phillips, Atlas Genius and Chord Overstreet - plus a popular DJ for the big reveal Small bites, big flavor: Downtown L.A.'s super-trendy Smorgasburg hosts local food vendors. Mama Musubi, Donut Friend, Goa Taco and Amazebowls serve up bite-sized food, while Paloma's Paletas and Wanderlust Creamery are on hand with food carts Small footprint, big life: Two tiny homes from 84LUMBER - a cabin and a beach cottage - are on display. Both are less than 200 square feet and inspired by EcoSport's personality and spirit of adventure. These custom art installations by L.A.-based Onch Movement and \"The Most Famous Artist\" Matty Mo encourage stylish, simple living. After the event, Ford and 84LUMBER are donating one of the homes in partnership with the Ron Finley Project - a south Los Angeles nonprofit dedicated to promoting healthy communities Small animals, big joy: Los Angeles Wildlife Learning Center experts teach you about the group's tiny rescue animals, including owls, chinchillas, foxes, sugar gliders, prairie dogs, bunnies and hedgehogs Small beach, big oasis: Paying homage to Venice Beach, surf culture comes alive with real sand and Surfset Fitness, surf-inspired exercise equipment and group fitness classes via the world's first total body surf trainer designed to mimic the instability of a surfboard on water. Nail artist group Cutepolish features the hottest nail art designs, do-it-yourself nail techniques and trendy polish styles \nFord EcoSport visitors also can share their experiences on social media platforms. Collect and share unique Snapchat geo-filters, an all-new Snapchat innovation exclusive to Ford's EcoSport consumer experience. An overall Snapchat geo-filter allows attendees to post unique Go Small, Live Big content. \nThe all-new Ford EcoSport starts arriving in dealerships in the US in early 2018.",

It will also be launched in the US, finally. \nFirst launched in India back in 2013, the EcoSport compact soon became Ford India’s best-seller. Even after more than 3 years, the car is still the best-selling Ford in India. Today, Ford gave their EcoSport a mid-life facelift. \nOn the outside, the new EcoSport gets a revised front, thanks to new headlight cluster (with projector headlamps and LED DRLs), reprofiled bumper, foglights, grille and a skid plate. Rear too gets revised taillight and new bumper. Overall, the new EcoSport looks more attractive and stylish than before. Equipped with either an award-winning, 1.0-liter three-cylinder turbocharged EcoBoost® engine or 2.0-liter four-cylinder with Intelligent 4WD, all-new Ford EcoSport provides power and control. \nOn the inside, 2017 Ford EcoSport comes with a new dashboard design whose highlight is the infotainment system in the center with large 8 inch touchscreen infotainment system. This is a much needed updated since the current EcoSport comes with a tiny screen in the name of infotainment system. \nThe infotainment system adopts Ford’s new SYNC3 operating system to offer seamless connectivity with your smartphone. It also gets navigations, parking sensor, rear parking camera, advanced audio system with 10 speaker Bang & Olufsen system that delivers 675 watts of power. Ford EcoSport SES features unique interior styling cues such as bold copper accents on the instrument and door panels along with sport seats. \nPowering the new Ford EcoSport will be the same set of engines which are seen on offer currently. These are 1.5 liter petrol Ti-VCT generating 110 PS and 140 Nm, a 1.5 liter TDCi diesel engine generating 100 PS and 205 Nm, and top of the line 1.0 liter EcoBosst generating 125 PS and 170 Nm. Transmission options on offer will be 5 MT and 6 AT. \nA truly global car, Ford EcoSport is on sale in more than 100 countries across the globe. This not only includes developing markets like India, Brazil, but also includes developed markets like European countries, Australia, etc. The one major market where it was not being sold was the US. But with the new EcoSport facelift, that too is going to change. Yes. Ford EcoSport will finally be sold in the US. \nNews Release",

      "text": "2018 Ford EcoSport Review: First Impressions \nBy Aaron Bragman \n2018 Ford EcoSport Cars.com photo by Evan Sears \nCARS.COM — The big news in SUVs these days is actually pretty small. After years of wondering when Ford would join the subcompact SUV fray in the U.S. with its EcoSport global subcompact utility vehicle, we now have our answer courtesy the 2 016  : early 2018. That's when this newly refreshed cute SUV arrives on our shores. \n2018 Ford EcoSport Cars.com photo by Evan Sears \nAnd it really is cute. It's got the Ford family front end, but it's on a scale not normally seen from the automaker. Standing next to the EcoSport, you realize just how tiny it is on the outside, with its low beltline and big windows helping to create some interesting proportions. You can see why it's been one of Ford's best sellers globally, especially in developing countries with tight urban environments. It's not going to be difficult to park this thing anywhere in a big city. \n2018 Ford EcoSport Cars.com photo by Evan Sears \nIt's fitting that the model on display is painted a kind of Tardis blue — just like Dr. Who's mode of transportation, it certainly feels bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. The front seats have plenty of room, with ample legroom and headroom, and excellent outward visibility. Width is a little on the narrow side, but this is a subcompact SUV made primarily for foreign markets where lane widths aren't as ample as they are here. The backseat is comfortable as well, but the Titanium trim's moonroof eats into headroom a tad. Legroom is tight in back unless front seat occupants sacrifice a little of theirs to allow the backseaters some comfort. \n2018 Ford EcoSport Cars.com photo by Evan Sears \nMaterial quality in the EcoSport is typically Ford, with soft-touch materials, slick switchgear and bright LEDs to give a surprisingly upscale appearance to the Titanium; we'll see how well the base S trim stacks up when it's launched, however. The 8-inch touchscreen has Ford's excellent Sync 3 system, which continues to impress with its ease of use and clarity of information. It's a nice interior for sure, certainly a step up from a Chevrolet Trax or Honda HR-V and even nicer in some ways than the Buick Encore . \n2018 Ford EcoSport Cars.com photo by Evan Sears \nThe cargo area is versatile as well, with a decent amount of space behind the rear seats for a few parcels. Drop the rear seats and you can fit some larger items in the cargo area &mdash; enough for most people's daily use &mdash; but stuffing a 60-inch flatscreen TV in there might stretch the EcoSport's utility. The side-opening swing gate isn't really much of a benefit, especially if you're in a congested urban environment, where people will park inches from your rear bumper. A more conventional hatchback tailgate might have been a better idea. \nOverall, the new EcoSport should find some willing buyers when it hits showrooms more than a year from now. The turbocharged 1.0-liter engine is a fantastic little motor in the Fiesta and Focus , and if the so-equipped EcoSport is as much fun to drive as those models, it should be a winner for Ford in the U.S. \nDetroit Bureau Chief Aaron Bragman grew up in the Detroit area, comes from an automotive family and is based in Ann Arbor, Mich.
