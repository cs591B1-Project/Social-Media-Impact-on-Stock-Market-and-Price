      "text": "The Grand Tour , a car-themed series that was revived by Amazon after hosts Jeremy Clarkson , Richard Hammond , and James May departed their immensely popular BBC show Top Gear , has officially become the “biggest show premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video,” the company announced yesterday.\nWhile Amazon did not provide viewership stats, it said that The Grand Tour has supplanted The Man In The High Castle — a series about what the world might be like if World War II had turned out differently — as its biggest-ever debut. Amazon also said that new Prime memberships were at an all-time high on Friday, when the show premiered, and that The Grand Tour was receiving unprecedented critical acclaim, including a 4.9 rating on Amazon by more than 15,000 customers.\n“The chemistry between Jeremy, Richard, and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining,” said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. “Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way.”\nAt the same time that it trumpeted the premiere of The Grand Tour , which the company reportedly outbid both Netflix and Hulu in order to secure, reports circulated that Amazon was making a stated push for live sports programming. Amazon has been in touch with the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Football League (NFL), and soccer, lacrosse, and surfing leagues about airing live events, according to The Wall Street Journal .\nTo distribute such programming, Amazon is weighing the idea of creating an exclusive premium sports package that could be part of its Prime offering, according to the Journal . Amazon is also reportedly pursuing a skinny bundle of live television channels — and any future sports programming could live on that service as well.\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.\n",

      "text": "WILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) — About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear.\nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.\nThe carrier’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots’ concerns with their union.\nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they’ve been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that’s due under their contract.\n© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. The Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. The pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. The airline's president, John Starkovich , said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. A spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. Neither Amazon nor DHL responded immediately to requests for comment. Wilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. Most Popular",

      "text": "2016 State of The Cloud \nThe week before Amazon Web Services kicks off its annual re:Invent user conference the company has cut prices of its two biggest products: virtual machines and object storage. \nThe moves come as some analysts have noted that cloud price cuts have slowed in recent years. Price cuts are not dying though, as AWS’s moves from the past few weeks show. \nOn Nov. 14 AWS announced between 5% and 10% reductions in the cost of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) , it’s core virtual machine IaaS product, effective Dec. 1. \nThis week, the company announced between 20% and 28% reductions in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), also effective Dec. 1. Before the EC2 price reduction this month, that service’s price had not been reduced since January 2016 . \nJust a few years ago price cuts were a regular occurrence in the cloud. Amazon, Microsoft and Google sometimes responded to one another’s price cuts within hours of each other. \nIn somewhat of an ironic twist, just hours before Amazon announced its latest EC2 price cut, analysts at Deutsche Bank Equity Research published a primer on AWS Cloud Pricing, outlining how the number of price cuts has declined markedly in the past two years. The slowing of price cuts, DB says, could be contributing to healthy margins for cloud vendors. “Unit pricing is declining steadily, but the margin profiles of at least AWS and Azure are improving given a combination of strong volume growth and internal cost efficiencies,” the analysts note. DB notes that Azure, AWS and Google all are experiencing strong growth despite the slowdown in price cuts. “Bottom line, the relatively rational pricing behavior of AWS supports our confidence in (the cloud computing) mega-trend and the margin improvement trajectories at all three cloud vendors,” DB notes. \nSo will cloud price cuts continue? AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr noted in a recent blog post that: “Our engineering investments, coupled with our scale and our time-tested ability to manage our capacity, allow us to identify and pass on the cost savings to you.” \nAs for Microsoft, Executive VP Scott Guthrie recently said , “For the most part, we (Azure and AWS) aren’t competing on price. It’s typically we’re competing more in value, I would say at this point. Which is a difference versus, say, two or three years ago, where I think it was more about cost per VM (virtual machine) or cost per storage.” \nThat doesn’t mean price cuts will stop, but it also doesn't seem we’re in the middle of a price war in the cloud analogous to mid 2014.

      "text": "Amazon Still Negotiating For Sports Streaming Rights   Dominik Bosnjak \nAmong other things, an Amazon Prime membership grants you to access Amazon Prime Video , the video-streaming component of Amazon’s versatile subscription package which is also available as a standalone service. The Seattle-based company has recently been investing a lot of resources into making this video service both different and better than its competitors like Netflix, HBO GO, and Hulu. Amazon’s strategy can be broken up into two parts. One, Amazon Prime Video allows rentals and purchases of certain video content, something most other video streaming services don’t offer. Two, Amazon is spending a lot of money to bring more exclusive content to Amazon Prime Video. While this strategy is also employed by its competitors, the tech giant recently secured exclusive rights to some huge hits like Jeremy Clarkson’s The Grand Tour. \nHowever, Amazon is not only looking to offer video content that’s exclusive but also highly varied. This is why the company recently held talks with numerous basketball, soccer, baseball, auto racing, golf, and rugby organizations, with the NBA and MLB included. Two months later, the Seattle-based tech giant reportedly held another round of negotiations related to acquiring streaming rights to as many different sports as possible. The Wall Street Journal reports that sources close to the company are claiming Amazon once again approached the National Basketball Association, National Football League, and the Major League Baseball in an effort to acquire enough sports rights to create an attractive, premium sports package for Amazon Prime members. In addition to these major US sports organizations, Amazon allegedly also held talks with some soccer, surfing, and lacrosse leagues. \nNot surprisingly, Amazon isn’t the only major player in the industry pursuing new sports streaming rights, as The Wall Street Journal’s sources are claiming that the company is not only competing with social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, but also other streaming providers such as BamTech. Furthermore, Amazon allegedly held talks with some TV networks over acquiring their sports rights which they currently aren’t using. More specifically, the company approached Univision Communications, owners of rights to the Mexican soccer league Liga MX, and inquired about the possibility of Univision producing and selling all Liga MX games which it usually doesn’t air. Other parties contacted by Amazon include ESPN, Disney, and ONE World Sports. All in all, while NBA, NFL, and MLB rights seem like a stretch, it appears that Amazon may still be offering some kind of a premium sports package to Prime Subscribers in the near future.

      "text": "Deal: Amazon Echo Dot 3-Pack for $129 – 11/22/16   Alexander Maxham \nAmazon has been pushing the Echo Dot quite a bit since it was launched a few months ago. It’s the only Alexa-powered product that is bundled with other products to get your smart home started. Amazon has bundled it with things like the TP-Link Smart Plug, Bose SoundTouch 10 and more. The reason why Amazon bundled these together is because Alexa can control these things. Making them great products to pair together. The Amazon Echo Dot is normally $49.99 by itself, and they have been running a special on the 6-pack (essentially giving you one for free), but now they are running a special on a pack of three Echo Dots. \nNow the way you get this discount on a three-pack of Echo Dots is by adding three Echo Dots to your cart. Then at checkout, you’ll need to use the code DOT3PACK and you’ll see $20 taken off of the total. That should bring the total down to about $129.97. Of course there is free shipping, and it is included with Amazon Prime so you can get it shipped before Thanksgiving, if you buy it today. The Amazon Echo Dot is a great little piece of kit, and can be connected to any other speaker for even better sound.",

      "text": "  9:43pm GMT Pilots strike at cargo airline serving Amazon, DHL as holidays near By Nick Carey | CHICAGO \nCHICAGO Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retail giant Amazon ( AMZN.O ) and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear. \nSome 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG ( DPWGn.DE ). \nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc ( ATSG.O ), has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, but then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said. \n\"Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,\" said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamster Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. \"But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.\" \nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle what it called an \"illegal work stoppage\" including seeking a court order to get the pilots back to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labour agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. \nABX is notifying customers so they can make alternative arrangements. \nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year. \nAmazon said it has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) and FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ), giving it sufficient alternatives to ABX. \n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email. \nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States. \n\"Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are continuing to monitor the situation.\" \n(Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)  ",

      "text": "CHICAGO Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retail giant Amazon and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear.\nSome 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG.\nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, but then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said.\n\"Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,\" said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamster Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. \"But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.\"\nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle what it called an \"illegal work stoppage\" including seeking a court order to get the pilots back to work.\n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement.\nABX is notifying customers so they can make alternative arrangements.\nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year.\nAmazon said it has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, giving it sufficient alternatives to ABX.\n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email.\nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States.\n\"Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are continuing to monitor the situation.\"\n(Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

      "text": "Employment and Internship Opportunities Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nA DHL spokeswoman said \"deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today\" because of the strike, and DHL is watching the situation. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment. \nBetween them, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65 percent of Air Transport Service's revenue in the third quarter. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday while the broader markets closed higher. Air Transport shares have gained 86 percent in the past 12 months.  ",

I don’t have any kids but I am sure you know what I mean. @DannyAllenUK: That intro sequence for @thegrandtour has to be one of the most emotion/beautiful and expensive sequences I’ve ever seen on a TV show. @TransAmPatrick: I’m crying. Why am I crying? What’s going on here? I’m in a glass case of emotion! #TheGrandTour @BTMcLeod: Started the first episode of @thegrandtour and I can’t remember the last time I was this happy to see 3 middle aged dudes. @Tom__Berry: I’m only 3 minutes in and I can already tell that @thegrandtour is the best thing on TV this year. \nFurther episodes will be released weekly over the next 11 weeks for Prime members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, and the show will premiere worldwide for Amazon customers in over 200 countries and territories in December. \nIn addition to the unprecedented customer response, The Grand Tour has received outstanding critical acclaim from media around the world: “A brilliant beautiful spectacle.” Guardian “Between the gear head banter and intoxicating visuals, The Grand Tour makes for a sweet escape from the real world we all live in.” New York Post “The trio’s chemistry remains as brilliant as ever.” The Independent “Fans are over the moon.” Mail Online “The Grand Tour is stunningly beautiful.” The London Evening Standard “The Grand Tour is this year’s most eagerly-anticipated TV show. And, judging by the reaction to its Thursday debut, it’s fair to say that The Grand Tour is a critical and commercial success. Together, both viewers and reviewers flooded social media after the first episode aired on Amazon Prime, and they were unified in their praise.” Daily Mirror “They’ve sort of somehow come up with the world’s first scripted comedy factual show, and it works perfectly.” Digital Spy “Critics and fans welcome Jeremy Clarkson and co back with open arms.” Newsweek \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May have been filming the first season of The Grand Tour in far-flung locations across the globe. The studio portion of the show takes place in a travelling tent in locations ranging from Johannesburg to California, Scotland to Rotterdam, Lapland to Nashville, Whitby in North Yorkshire to Stuttgart and the final stop in Dubai. The first episode kicked off in California, when Jeremy, Richard and James took their famous studio tent to Dry Rabbit Lake.

      "text": "Pilots strike at cargo airline serving Amazon, DHL as holidays near Reuters \nBy Nick Carey \nCHICAGO (Reuters) - Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retail giant Amazon and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear. \nSome 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG. \nPilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, but then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said. \n\"Our pilots are striking so that we can have the status quo of our contract restored, and we would like that to be in the next minute so we can return to serving our customers,\" said Tim Jewell, a pilot and secretary treasurer of Teamster Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots. \"But if the company chooses not to do that our members are prepared to continue striking.\" \nAir Transport Services Group said in a statement that ABX was taking multiple steps to tackle what it called an \"illegal work stoppage\" including seeking a court order to get the pilots back to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. \nABX is notifying customers so they can make alternative arrangements. \nThe strike comes just ahead of Cyber Monday, which is the biggest day of the year for internet shopping and is expected to break records this year. \nAmazon said it has contracts with the major U.S. package delivery companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, giving it sufficient alternatives to ABX. \n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said in an email. \nDHL, however, said the strike had affected deliveries of goods into the United States. \n\"Due to a work stoppage affecting our airline partners, inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are continuing to monitor the situation.\" \n(Additional reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler) Related Links",

      "text": "If recent job postings are any indication, Amazon has some fairly ambitious goals to shake up the live ticketing business. As spotted by Recode , the Washington-based online retailer is recruiting new hires for its Amazon Tickets division, which launched in the U.K. last year, and sells tickets to concerts and theater performances.\nOne posting, for head of operations, a new role based in London, has been active since June, as has been an opening for head of music. But more interesting are the recently posted gigs for Amazon’s Seattle headquarters, including at least three key business development managers. All three (one is for theater, the other music, and the third is general) specifically mention expansion of the company’s ticketing business in their job descriptions.\n\"The purpose of the role is to help the Tickets team grow its business relationships in the entertainment industry to expand tickets selection across existing and new categories and territories by working with ticket rights-holders to reach agreements on distribution for sale to end customers,\" the posting reads.\nRead more: Amazon Launches On-Demand Music Streaming Service in U.K., Germany\nOther current openings in the Amazon Tickets department include a business intelligence engineer, who will be in charge of developing and supporting analytics, and a software development engineer to help build a \"new consumer facing web application and numerous backend services to support the Tickets business.\"\nSeveral of the postings have been updated in the last day, which could explain why some of the bolder language described in the Recode report has disappeared, or is simply harder to find. For example, a listing for a web development engineer found on LinkedIn says their vision \"goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience\" and that the \"ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.\"\nThe listing for a similar job on Amazon’s own job site omits talk of disruption and the perceived lack of innovation in the ticketing market, instead saying that \"as we grow our team to support our rapid expansion we are looking for talented individuals to join us in delighting customers and having some fun along the way.\"\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\nRead more: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Extends Olive Branch to Donald Trump\nIf part of Amazon’s \"rapid expansion\" of ticketing includes the U.S., it will face a market already dominated by Ticketmaster and its parent, Live Nation. Ticketmaster operates in more than a dozen countries and, in 2015 alone, moved more than 530 million tickets to fans.\nAmazon shares are up nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, currently trading at $786. Year-to-date, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has gained 16.75 percent.",

Play Friday. Photo: Grant Gunderson \nI encourage you to #OptOutside on Black Friday to avoid the crowds who will be piling into stores all day long—and because you have the day off to play. But I also know this week is a great time to save money on outdoor gifts, so I’ve gone through Amazon and tracked some of the deals that are already posted. Note: Some of these deals change daily, but others will stick around or come back. POC Fornix Ski Helmet (Starting at $50) Photo: POC \nPOC used aramid fibers to make this helmet light but strong. It’s a great all-around lid that can be used inbounds or in the backcountry. RTIC 30-Ounce Tumbler ($12) Photo: RTIC \nThis double-walled insulated stainless-steel mug is the perfect stocking stuffer. It keeps coffee hot in the morning and beer cold at night. Thule 91725 Flat Top Ski Carrier ($120) Photo: Thule \nWinter finally arrived in the United States, so when you’re ready to head to the hill, use this system to carry up to six pairs of skis. The carriers fit on most factory bars and have oversized unlock buttons that are easy to use with gloves. Yakima DoubleDown 4-Bike Hitch Mount Rack ($160) Photo: Yakima \nYou never have to worry about accidentally ripping bikes off the top of your car if you go with a hitch-mount rack. This one from Yakima holds four bikes and comes with a built-in bottle opener.",

      "text": "Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping Posted: Updated: \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

Online retail giant Amazon scored its first ever Golden Globe nominations -- a breakthrough in its bid to catch up with streaming pioneer Netflix. AFP PHOTO / LEON NEAL (Photo credit should read LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images) \nIs this what happiness feels like? \nI think so. \nAmazon has a new service called Amazon Prime Now. It’s a new delivery platform for daily use products, think toothpaste, toilet paper, groceries and now booze. \nAmazon will deliver booze within one hour to your house for an additional fee of $8…but if you can wait 2 hours, the fee is free. This of course, is in addition to your Amazon Prime account, which is $99 a year. \nSo far their are 20 cities with booze delivery service, but with Cincinnati and Columbus being recently added, Cleveland shouldn’t be far off!",

(Photo: Elizabeth Weise) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWILMINGTON, Ohio — Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nA DHL spokeswoman said \"deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today\" because of the strike, and DHL is watching the situation. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment. \nBetween them, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65% of Air Transport Service's revenue in the third quarter. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30% in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4% to $16.44 on Tuesday while the broader markets closed higher. Air Transport shares have gained 86% in the past 12 months. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Flickr/Leonid Mamchenkov \nA lot of salespeople rely on cold email to find prospects and sell their product.\nBut when it's not done the right way, cold emails could quickly become spam — or worse, turn into public humiliation.\nTake, for example, this email Amazon CTO Werner Vogels got recently. \nThe email, which Vogels shared on Twitter last week , shows a salesperson named John Gabriango trying to sell a cloud product by asking if Amazon has made the transition to cloud technology yet.\nVogels is widely recognized as one of the fathers of Amazon Web Services, Amazon's massive cloud service that's been taking the computer industry by storm. This year alone, AWS is expected to generate over $10 billion in revenue.\nVogel's response to the email pitch was perfect:\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/799266204229701632\nDear John, I know your targeting algorithm was cheap and thus not perfect, but I suggest to ask your money back from however sold it to you! pic.twitter.com/IYkiIqeAhM \nFor what it's worth, Gabriango likely used an automation tool that sent out the same email to groups of people, so you can't totally blame him for the mishap.\nBut as CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal pointed out in his newsletter Tuesday, it's a good reminder that most cold emails are terrible and could significantly improve with just a little more effort.\nIn fact, Sanwal made this point in a blog post last year, pointing out 94% of the cold emails he received were awful. Through his own analysis of 147 cold emails he received, Anand wrote the \"overwhelming majority\" of them used some automated template software, while more than 75% of them didn't seem to know his business at all.\nIf you need help writing your cold emails, here are 9 different ways to do it .\nNOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home \n",

      "text": "Amazon CTO Werner Vogels Flickr/Leonid Mamchenkov \nA lot of salespeople rely on cold email to find prospects and sell their product. \nBut when it's not done the right way, cold emails could quickly become spam — or worse, turn into public humiliation. \nTake, for example, this email Amazon CTO Werner Vogels got recently. \nThe email, which Vogels shared on Twitter last week , shows a salesperson named John Gabriango trying to sell a cloud product by asking if Amazon has made the transition to cloud technology yet. \nVogels is widely recognized as one of the fathers of Amazon Web Services, Amazon's massive cloud service that's been taking the computer industry by storm. This year alone, AWS is expected to generate over $10 billion in revenue. \nVogel's response to the email pitch was perfect: \nDear John, I know your targeting algorithm was cheap and thus not perfect, but I suggest to ask your money back from however sold it to you! pic.twitter.com/IYkiIqeAhM — Werner Vogels (@Werner) November 17, 2016 \nFor what it's worth, Gabriango likely used an automation tool that sent out the same email to groups of people, so you can't totally blame him for the mishap. \nBut as CB Insights CEO Anand Sanwal pointed out in his newsletter Tuesday, it's a good reminder that most cold emails are terrible and could significantly improve with just a little more effort. \nIn fact, Sanwal made this point in a blog post last year, pointing out 94% of the cold emails he received were awful. Through his own analysis of 147 cold emails he received, Anand wrote the \"overwhelming majority\" of them used some automated template software, while more than 75% of them didn't seem to know his business at all. \nIf you need help writing your cold emails, here are 9 different ways to do it .

      "text": "SEATTLE — Pilots with a cargo airline that flies routes for customers including Amazon.com went on strike Tuesday, a decision that could create hiccups for the Seattle e-commerce giant during the critical holiday shopping season.\nSome 250 pilots employed by ABX Air aren't flying their scheduled routes as they fight what they say are stressful working conditions and intentional understaffing, especially during the fourth quarter's shopping frenzy.\nABX Air signed a deal with Lehigh Valley International Airport last year to fly cargo jets into the Lehigh Valley, where the online retail giant operates two fulfillment centers. \nA statement by the striking pilots, who are members of Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, says the interruption could \"have a significant impact\" on deliveries by ABX Air customers, including Amazon. The pilots portray Amazon as a \"major\" customer of the air freighter, adding that Amazon customers will see \"delays and disruptions.\"\nIn March, Amazon inked a deal a deal with ABX Air's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, to lease 20 airplanes in a dedicated air-cargo network connecting Amazon's far-flung warehouses. ATSG is already flying 14 of those planes, or 35 flights a day, for Amazon, according to the pilots. The strike also affects DHL, for which ABX makes 45 flights a day.\nAmazon downplayed the potential impact of the walk-out.\n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.\nThe strike comes at a time when Amazon has aggressively sought to turn the page on the logistics woes that befell its operations in past holiday seasons. Higher-than-anticipated demand last year resulted forced the company to scramble in order to deliver packages to customers' doorsteps.\nSince then, Amazon has invested billions in building new warehouses and changed the fee structure for its fulfillment service for independent merchants in order to avoid similar troubles this time around.\nAmazon has also invested heavily in creating an air force that would allow it to move items more quickly, especially for members of its Prime loyalty program, who pay $99 a year in exchange for guaranteed fast shipping and other perks.\nIn addition to the 20 planes Amazon has agreed to lease from ATSG, the \"Prime Air\" fleet is expected to also lease 20 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings.\nWilmington, Ohio-based ABX Air says it will seek a court order on Tuesday to enjoin the pilots to go back to work, even as it continues the talks with the union.\n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under the terms of our current labor agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in an emailed statement.\nHowever, customers are being notified of temporary interruptions in flight operations so they can adjust their shipping networks, Starkovich said.\nThe pilots say that their conflict with ABX Air's management stems from the firm's alleged refusal to recall pilots who were furloughed when DHL shuttered its North American hub in Wilmington in 2008.\nThe Morning Call contributed to this story.",

      "text": "\nSEATTLE — Pilots with a cargo airline that flies routes for customers including Amazon.com went on strike Tuesday, a decision that could create hiccups for the Seattle e-commerce giant during the critical holiday shopping season.\nSome 250 pilots employed by ABX Air aren’t flying their scheduled routes as they fight what they say are stressful working conditions and intentional understaffing, especially during the fourth quarter’s shopping frenzy.\nA statement by the striking pilots, who are members of Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, says the interruption could “have a significant impact” on deliveries by ABX Air customers, including Amazon. The pilots portray Amazon as a “major” customer of the air freighter, adding that Amazon customers will see “delays and disruptions.”\nIn March, Amazon inked a deal with ABX Air’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group, to lease 20 airplanes in a dedicated air-cargo network connecting Amazon’s warehouses. ATSG is already flying 14 of those planes, or 35 flights a day, for Amazon, according to the pilots. The strike also affects DHL, for which ABX makes 45 flights a day.\nAmazon downplayed the potential impact of the walk-out.\n“We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.\nThe strike comes at a time when Amazon has aggressively sought to turn the page on the logistics woes that befell its operations in past holiday seasons. Higher-than-anticipated demand last year resulted forced the company to scramble in order to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps.\nSince then, Amazon has invested billions in building new warehouses and changed the fee structure for its fulfillment service for independent merchants in order to avoid similar troubles this time around.\nAmazon has also invested heavily in creating an air force that would allow it to move items more quickly, especially for members of its Prime loyalty program, who pay $99 a year in exchange for guaranteed fast shipping and other perks.\nIn addition to the 20 planes Amazon has agreed to lease from ATSG, the “Prime Air” fleet is expected to also lease 20 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings.\nWilmington, Ohio-based ABX Air said it will seek a court order to enjoin the pilots to go back to work, even as it continues the talks with the union.\n“We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under the terms of our current labor agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in an emailed statement.\nCustomers are being notified of interruptions in flight operations so they can adjust their shipping networks, Starkovich said.\nThe pilots said that their conflict with ABX Air’s management stems from the firm’s alleged refusal to recall pilots who were furloughed when DHL shuttered its North American hub in Wilmington in 2008.\n",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

Twitter for one wants to live stream events alongside the NBA and MLS . It’s already won a bid to stream Thursday night NFL games and even had the chance to show Wimbledon matches through the platform this past summer. Now Amazon wants in on the action, as it has been reported by The Verge via The Wall Street Journal that the entertainment service company is in talks with the NFL, NBA, MLB and MLS for the possibility of integrating live sports under its Prime services. \nThe deal could reel in new customers with a sports package that costs $99 USD per year. But it isn’t just mainstream sports that Amazon is interested in, they also want to extend services to the World Surf League, Indian Premier League for cricket, Liga MX, and the Kontinental Hockey League. \nWhat are your thoughts, would you switch to Amazon Prime for all your live sports coverage?",

ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nA DHL spokeswoman said \"deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today\" because of the strike, and DHL is watching the situation. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment. \nBetween them, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65 percent of Air Transport Service's revenue in the third quarter. \nWilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday while the broader markets closed higher. Air Transport shares have gained 86 percent in the past 12 months.   declared, \"I don't   \n    of \"Crooked    ",

      "title": "Pilot strike threatens some of Amazon's Prime Air cargo routes",
      "text": "SEATTLE -- Pilots with a cargo airline that flies routes for customers including Amazon.com went on strike Tuesday, a decision that could create hiccups for the Seattle e-commerce giant during the critical holiday shopping season.\nSome 250 pilots employed by ABX Air aren't flying their scheduled routes as they fight what they say are stressful working conditions and intentional understaffing, especially during the fourth quarter's shopping frenzy.\nA statement by the striking pilots, who are members of Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, says the interruption could \"have a significant impact\" on deliveries by ABX Air customers, including Amazon. The pilots portray Amazon as a \"major\" customer of the air freighter, adding that Amazon customers will see \"delays and disruptions.\"\nIn March, Amazon inked a deal a deal with ABX Air's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, to lease 20 airplanes in a dedicated air-cargo network connecting Amazon's far-flung warehouses. ATSG is already flying 14 of those planes, or 35 flights a day, for Amazon, according to the pilots. The strike also affects DHL, for which ABX makes 45 flights a day.\nAmazon downplayed the potential impact of the walk-out.\n\"We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,\" spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said.\nThe strike comes at a time when Amazon has aggressively sought to turn the page on the logistics woes that befell its operations in past holiday seasons. Higher-than-anticipated demand last year resulted forced the company to scramble in order to deliver packages to customers' doorsteps.\nSince then, Amazon has invested billions in building new warehouses and changed the fee structure for its fulfillment service for independent merchants in order to avoid similar troubles this time around.\nAmazon has also invested heavily in creating an air force that would allow it to move items more quickly, especially for members of its Prime loyalty program, who pay $99 a year in exchange for guaranteed fast shipping and other perks.\nIn addition to the 20 planes Amazon has agreed to lease from ATSG, the \"Prime Air\" fleet is expected to also lease 20 jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings.\nWilmington, Ohio-based ABX Air says it will seek a court order on Tuesday to enjoin the pilots to go back to work, even as it continues the talks with the union.\n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under the terms of our current labor agreements,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in an emailed statement.\nHowever, customers are being notified of temporary interruptions in flight operations so they can adjust their shipping networks, Starkovich said.\nThe pilots say that their conflict with ABX Air's management stems from the firm's alleged refusal to recall pilots who were furloughed when DHL shuttered its North American hub in Wilmington in 2008.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nShare Comment",

      "text": "  11:34 AM EST Watch Out, Ticketmaster: Amazon Wants To Disrupt The Entire Ticket Industry \nAmazon.com, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) has big plans to totally change the event ticketing industry, and stalwarts like Ticketmaster could soon find themselves in a very vulnerable position. \nAmazon is looking to hire a number of people to expand its recently-launched U.K. ticket service into other markets in Europe, Asia, and probably into the United States as well. From Recode: \nThe hiring efforts are part of a new initiative to “position Amazon Tickets as the world’s premier destination for purchasing tickets,” according to one posting. The job listings also hint at plans to integrate ticket sales into the Prime membership program with something Amazon is calling Prime Tickets, the details of which were not laid out. \nPrime Tickets, now that could be a real game changer. Consumers have long been unsatisfied with the archaic nature of buying event tickets, along with the exorbitant fees charged by brokers. Amazon wants to change all that and more, according to its job listings: \n“[O]ur vision goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show,” one posting reads. “The ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.” \nAMZN’s entry into international ticker markets should prove much easier than in the U.S., where major venues, artists, and professional sports leagues often have exclusive contracts with Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation. Convincing promoters and leagues to change their practices could be difficult, the industry, which hasn’t changed in several decades is definitely ripe for an overhaul. \nAnd who better than Amazon to do it? \nAmazon shares rose $8.73 (+1.12%) to $788.73 in Tuesday morning trading. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 16.75%, more than doubling the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content.

      "text": "Neato’s Botvac Connected Can Be Controlled With Amazon’s Alexa  10 PST \nAmazon’s Alexa voice assistant platform kind of came in under the radar. Amazon’s track record for their products seem a bit like a mixed bag, where some things work surprisingly well, like the Kindle Fire tablets, and some things fall flat on their faces, like the Fire Phone. With Alexa, which debuted on the Amazon Echo, it fell into the former camp. \nAlexa has been steadily gaining traction and recently it seems that it has managed to find its way into the Neato Botvac Connected robot vacuum cleaner. If you own the Botvac Connected, what this means is that you’ll be able to use Alexa to command the device. Some examples include asking it to start cleaning, and also asking it to pause/resume cleaning, which will come in handy if you’re talking to someone on the phone and the Botvac is a bit too loud. \nOf course you will need a device that has Alexa on it, such as the Amazon Echo, Amazon Tap, or the Echo Dot. However if don’t own any of those devices or even the Botvac Connected for that matter, not to worry as Neato has announced a bundle in which customers can purchase the Botvac Connect and get a free Echo Dot thrown in, as long as it is purchased via Amazon’s website where it is priced at around $750. \nFiled in Gadgets > Home .

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "Nov 22, 2016 6:05 PM (Image: Amazon) Share Tweet \nRecode is reporting that Amazon might soon be taking a run at breaking Ticketmaster’s quasi-monopolistic hold on the American concert ticket market, with the online retail giant posting job openings for its Amazon Tickets program at its Seattle home base. Amazon Tickets —which distinguishes itself from competitors like Ticketmaster by including all of its fees in the initial upfront price, and by allowing people to use their Amazon accounts to pay for them—launched in the U.K. last year. \nIf it does want to take on Ticketmaster stateside, Amazon has a tough road ahead of it: Despite recent setbacks , and a public perception that hovers somewhere in between highway robbery and mud, the ticketing giant still has a heavy hand on the American concert market. Most of the country’s major venues are either owned by the company through LiveNation, or have exclusive deals in place with it. \nA posting for one of the job descriptions—the stated goals of which are to extend Amazon Tickets into Europe and Asia—said that the company’s goal is to “disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show. The ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.” \n ",

      "text": "Read Article \nWILMINGTON, Ohio — Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. \nThe Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, the union says. \nThe pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. \nThe airline’s president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. \nA spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. \nA DHL spokeswoman said “deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today” because of the strike, and DHL is watching the situation. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment. \nBetween them, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65 percent of Air Transport Service’s revenue in the third quarter. \nThe company’s shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday.

The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. \nThe company's shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday while the broader markets closed higher.

      "text": "If you’re eager to dump $3,100 into a gaming laptop sporting the latest hardware, look no further than the Asus Republic of Gamers G701VI laptop. The company first revealed this mobile powerhouse earlier this month, packed with a GeForce GTX 1080 graphics chip and overclocked DDR4 system memory. Now the unit is finally up for grabs on Amazon , and currently the listing shows that only eight six units are in stock.\nHere are the specs in a pretty table:\nModel number: G701VI-XB72K Screen size: 17.3 inches Screen resolution: 1,920 x 1,080, 120Hz refresh rate G-Sync support: Yes Processor: Quad-core Intel Core i7-6820K (unlocked) System memory: 32GB DDR4 at 2,400MHz Graphics chip: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Graphics memory: 8GB GDDR5 Storage: 512GB NVMe PCIe SSD Size: 12.2 x 16.9 x 1.3 inches Weight: 7.9 pounds Wireless connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2)\nBluetooth 4.1 Ports: 3x USB 3.0 Type-A\n1x USB 3.1 Type-C\n1x Thunderbolt 3\n1x Ethernet\n1x HDMI 2.0\n1x Mini DisplayPort Battery: 6-cell Li-ion, 93 watt-hours Price: $3,100 The processor used in this PC gaming beast stems from Intel’s sixth-generation “Skylake” family and sells for $378 on its own. Released in the third quarter of 2015, this chip consists of four cores with a base clock speed of 2.70GHz and a maximum turbo speed of 3.60GHz. It relies on 8MB of on-board cache, and includes an integrated HD Graphics 530 component with a base clock of 350MHz and a maximum clock speed of 1,050Mhz.\nAs for the discreet GTX 1080 graphics chip, that on its own costs a meaty $600, thus between the processor and graphics chip, customers start out with a combined cost of $978. The system memory isn’t quite that expensive (which can be manually upgraded to 64GB), but customers will likely see a good deal of the remaining cost in the storage and the display, the latter of which surprisingly only supports a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 despite the hefty graphics processor powering the panel.\nMore: Asus crams two GTX 1080 graphics chips into new GX800 laptop for PC gamers\nHowever, what’s great to see is the growing adoption of Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 Type-C connectivity. Those ports can be used to connect the company’s latest external graphics card station should G701VI laptop owners need even more graphical power for their PC games outside the supplied GTX 1080 graphics chip.\n“An anti-ghosting keyboard with 30-key rollover technology ensures multi-keystroke in-game commands are correctly logged even when gamers hit several keys simultaneously. In addition, a built-in ESS DAC and amplifier provide richer, more detailed in-game audio, strong bass and less distortion,” the company said earlier this month .\nIn the time it took to write this report, Amazon sold two units, leaving the current stock residing at a mere six units. That said, if Amazon Prime customers order right now, they can get this beefy PC gaming laptop in just two days!\nAsus crams two GTX 1080 graphics chips into new GX800 laptop for PC gamers Asus’ powerful new gaming laptop has the muscle for virtual reality Falcon Northwest TLX, DRX laptops now sport GeForce GTX 10 Series graphics chips",

      "text": "Given how much BBC’s Top Gear was loved by both car and non-car enthusiasts due to the easy-to-understand and humorous nature of the show, safe to say that many had pretty high expectations when the show’s presenters left to form a new show at Amazon called “The Grand Tour” . Early reviews of the first episode were positively stellar and according to a press release by Amazon , it seems to have successfully broken viewership records on Prime Video, a record that was previously held by another Amazon Original show, The Man in the High Castle. The show holds a 9.6/10 on IMDB based on over 10,000 votes; 4.9 out of 5 stars on Amazon as rated by over 15,000 customers; and has also received a 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes.\nAccording to Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos, “The guys are back, doing what they do best – the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining. Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.”\nIt is actually impressive that the show is doing so well considering that it is only available to Prime members. However there are plans to make it available globally come December , so it will be interesting to see what those numbers will be like then, but for now it’s starting to look like Amazon’s reported investment of $250 million was worth it.\nFiled in",

      "text": "14 hours 14 minutes ago 41 View Comments Chris Grayling says Britain must be 'much more careful' before approving 'unfettered use' of drones Tells aviation industry that he is 'less enthusiastic' about unmanned aircraft than his predecessors at Department for Transport Deals a major blow to online retailers including Amazon, which had been given green light to test drones in Britain earlier this year \nBy Matt Dathan, Political Correspondent For Mailonline \nPublished: 05:58 EST, 22 November 2016 | Updated: 06:18 EST, 22 November 2016 \nThe future of the 'delivery drones' is in doubt after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling voiced concerns over the danger they pose \nThe future of the 'delivery drones' is in doubt after Transport Secretary Chris Grayling voiced concerns over the danger they pose. \nHe said Britain must be 'much more careful' before giving the green light for 'unfettered use' of the unmanned aircraft in the skies over the UK. \nIt deals a major blow to online retailers, including Amazon, which was given special authorisation by the Department for Transport to test drones in Britain earlier this year. \nMr Grayling, who was appointed Transport Secretary in July, acknowledged the shift in his department's approach to delivery drones, telling aviation industry leaders yesterday that he has 'less enthusiasm for a completely liberal market on unmanned aircraft and drones' than his predecessors. \nBut he insisted drones have a crucial role in play in the public sector - such as assessing infrastructure and monitoring Britain's coastline. \nCivil Aviation Authority regulations say drones must not be flown higher than 400ft and those with cameras cannot fly within 164ft of people, vehicle or buildings. \nBritain has seen a sharp increase in the number of drones reported to have flown near passenger jets in the last couple of years. \nThe UK Airprox Board has already received reports of 56 incidents this year - nearly double the 29 recorded in the whole of 2015. The previous year saw just 6 reported. \nEarlier this year a drone triggered a major safety scare after flying within a few metres of a passenger jet landing at Heathrow Airport. \nBritain has seen a sharp increase in the number of drones reported to have flown near passenger jets in the last couple of years \nThe UK Airprox Board has already received reports of 56 incidents this year - nearly double the 29 recorded in the whole of 2015. The previous year saw just 6 reported \nThe pilot said the drone was just six metres above and 23 metres to the left when it passed the aircraft and told authorities it was not possible to take avoiding action. \nMr Grayling told the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London yesterday that unmanned drones must be 'handled with great care', the Times reported. THEY CAN FLY 50MPH AT 6,000FT \nHigh-end drones can fly up to and beyond 6,000ft, travel up to 50mph and stay in the air for 25 minutes. \nThey cost between £25 and £20,000, with electrical store Maplin alone reporting sales of more than 15,000 drones in the UK last year. \nLast year Domino's Pizza posted a video of a drone delivering a pizza, and online store Amazon has looked into using the technology to speed up deliveries. They are also used by broadcasters such as the BBC for filming. \nThe US Air Force collected so much data from drones during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it employed 65,000 people just to process the information, while police in Texas use drones than can carry small weapons, including tasers. \nHe said: 'I think perhaps I have got a little less enthusiasm for a completely liberal market on unmanned aircraft and drones around the country than one or two of my predecessors. \n'They have an important role to play in our future, for example, assessing infrastructure and monitoring our coast. I think we have got to be much more careful before we start to see unfettered use of unmanned vehicles across our society.' \nHe added: 'I want to support the industry and work to develop products that will make a real difference. But we will do this very carefully. We are already getting safety incidents around airports and I don't want them to become a real ongoing problem.' \nMr Grayling also said Brexit would benefit the aviation industry. He said: 'I think the prospects for UK airports are extremely bright; in fact I think they're actually brighter as a result of the exit vote.' \nMr Grayling added: 'Other countries want to do business with us; they want to do business with British airlines and airports too. That's not going to change when leave the European Union.'",

      "text": "Amazon says Grand Tour's launch was unprecedented success for Prime It will not release viewing figures - but rivals BBC and ITV do for hit shows Debut show starring Clarkson, May and Hammond earns rave reviews \nBy Martin Robinson, Uk Chief Reporter For Mailonline \nPublished: 05:32 EST, 22 November 2016 | Updated: 06:18 EST, 22 November 2016 \nAmazon has hailed The Grand Tour as its biggest TV success after saying it has broken viewing records - but they won't say how many watched people it. \nFormer Top Gear stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May's new show launched with rave reviews on Friday. \nAmazon Prime says its first episode has become the subscription service's biggest premiere, beating previous number one show on the service, 2015's The Man In The High Castle. But it would not tell MailOnline how many tuned in, saying 'it never gives out specific figures'. Broadcasters including the BBC and ITV release their viewing figures for hit show. \nBig hit: Former Top Gear stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May's new show launched with rave reviews on Friday. \nPictured: Clarkson, Hammond and May tear up a freeway in the American desert during the opening scenes of the Grand Tour - but Amazon today refused to say how many watched \nMany fans declared that the Grand Tour was better than Top Gear, which has floundered without the team \nA statement from the company said that 'millions of Prime members' streamed the premiere episode over the weekend in the UK, US, Germany, Austria and Japan. \nThe site said that 'total new Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days', aside from its Prime Day event on the day it became available to viewers. \nThe Grand Tour's first episode, which saw Clarkson, Hammond and May head to a desert in California to entertain a crowd in their travelling tent and test drive three hybrid hypercars, became available to stream on Friday. \nIt also included the coarse language and politically incorrect jokes that their fans love. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos said: 'The guys are back, doing what they do best - the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining. \n'Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.' \nThe ex-Top Gear stars' move from the BBC to Amazon last year came after Clarkson's contract was not renewed due to a 'fracas' with a show producer. \nPictured: The trio speed in front of 150 other cars worth millions towards a crowd of fans in their Mustangs during the dramatic opening of the debut episode \nResponse: Jeremy Clarkson said the team were delighted and relieved with the positive reviews about the first episode \nThe BBC's review sparked these tweets, accusing them of 'crybaby journalism' and being 'full of bitterness' \nFans were sent into meltodown on Friday when the show was released. \nArdent car enthusiasts loved it. Viewers loved it. Even naysaying social media fans loved it. RAVE REVIEWS FOR THE GRAND TOUR (APART FROM THE BBC'S ONE) \nBBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz, pictured, said it was 'uncomfortably hubristic' - others were more enthusiastic \nThe Grand Tour's debut episode received rave reviews when it premiered on Amazon Prime Video - but was likened to the presenters' former show Top Gear. \nThe Mail's Jim Shelley called it 'Clarkson's revenge' and said the friends were 'bigger, better, and more badly behaved than ever' \nThis Morning presenter Phillip Schofield tweeted: 'Watching right now!! So long in the delivery but SO worth it! There's money dripping from the screen & the boys are having a ball!!' \nThe Sun's Bizarre editor Dan Wootton, who said he is no motoring enthusiast, described it as 'one of the most exhilarating TV series ever'. \nHe added: 'Being sacked from the BBC was the greatest thing that ever happened to Clarkson and co - and the world of cars on TV.' \nThe paper's TV editor Andy Halls tweeted: 'Bravo @JeremyClarkson and co. @thegrandtour is an absolute triumph. Dripping with extravagance and wouldn't have expected anything less.' \nThe Telegraph's Ed Power said the show 'announced itself in spectacular fashion' but added that it was 'an awful lot' like Top Gear. \n'Squint and you might have been watching a certain popular BBC motoring franchise, though you wonder what all the newbies attracted by the hype will have made of three middle-aged men chugging around a test circuit,' he added. \nDaily Express TV reporter Neela Debnath said the first episode resembled a 'Hollywood blockbuster' and said it was 'basically like Top Gear on steroids'. \nBBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz, pictured, said it was 'uncomfortably hubristic'. \nBut only one organisation in Britain, it seems, did not fall for the spectacular charms of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May's The Grand Tour – their former employers, the BBC. \nThe corporation was accused of being po-faced, as it singled out the trio's new, big budget Amazon show for criticism. \nWhilst fans were awash with praise for the first show in the £120million 12-part series, the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz called it 'uncomfortably hubristic', before comparing it to a middle-aged sitcom and suggesting a rift between the stars. \nThe opening sequence saw Clarkson, 56, leave a London office under storm clouds and take a black cab trip while listening to radio reports of his demise. \nHe was then shown boarding a plane to Los Angeles to join his sidekicks, before they drove in convoy with I Can See Clearly Now playing in the background. \nIt was a joke – referencing Clarkson's sacking from Top Gear after he gave producer Oisin Tymon a bloody lip in a bust-up in March last year – which apparently did not sit well with BBC executives. \nIn his review, Gompertz wrote of one scene: 'They look out of their car windows and smile a cheesy smile at each other. We know what's coming next. \n'Whatever the device, an amusing comeuppance is seconds away. We know the drill. \n'Except we don't. Because the payoff never comes. The cheesy smiles are not a set up to a joke, but a precursor to them taking to the stage in the manner of rock stars on tour. A huge crowd of cheering fans has amassed at their feet. There is no irony. It feels uncomfortably hubristic.' \nWriting about a so-called rift between Clarkson and May, he adds: 'May seems more out of sorts. Clarkson has repeatedly said during his round of interviews to promote the programme how much he hates his co-presenters. The screen chemistry between him and May suggests there's a ring of truth about Clarkson's claim, which is not much fun to watch'. \nThe Grand Tour stars have refused to be drawn on the claims, but Clarkson retweeted a message from his PR guru, Gary Farrow, who posted a link to the review and wrote: 'Who are you'.",

      "text": "Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping Posted: Updated: Amazon packages / courtesy of MGN Online \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - Pilots for a cargo airline that carries packages for Amazon and DHL went on strike Tuesday, potentially causing delivery delays just as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. The airline, ABX Air, said it would seek a court order to end the strike by about 250 pilots. The Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike had caused 75 flights to be canceled. ABX operates 35 daily flights for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, according to the union. The pilots allege that ABX is understaffed and forces them to work on days off without giving them the compensatory time off that they are owed under their contract. The airline's president, John Starkovich, said the strike is illegal and that the dispute should be settled through arbitration. A spokesman for ABX parent company Air Transport Services Group Inc. said the company would not comment on the impact of the strike. A DHL spokeswoman said \"deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today\" because of the strike, and DHL is watching the situation. Amazon did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Between them, DHL and Amazon accounted for 65 percent of Air Transport Service's revenue in the third quarter. Wilmington-based Air Transport Services earned $22 million in the first nine months of this year, down from $26.5 million in the same period of 2015. The company's labor costs have increased 30 percent in that time, according to a regulatory filing. The company's shares fell 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $16.44 on Tuesday while the broader markets closed higher. Air Transport shares have gained 86 percent in the past 12 months.

Brick and mortar stores are already packed to the brim with inventory in anticipation of the craziness that will strike as soon as the doors open the day after Thanksgiving. \nBut if you don't want to deal with crowds, lines, and cutthroat customers, you can still save a ton of money with online deals from Amazon. The internet's largest retailer can be patronized from your couch, and most of the time, the prices are even better than what you would find in stores. What's more, Amazon's sales go on for a full week, so we'll list all of their best tech-related deals below.",

Those two traits make a recent Wall Street Journal report about plans for a sports package aimed at Prime subs particularly intriguing. \nHowever, regardless of how innovative and bold Amazon's effort proves to be, its success depends on deals with major sports leagues that have already licensed much of their best content to TV networks. As a result, the service may simply be another tool to keep Prime subs happy than a major threat to pay-TV -- at least in the U.S....596 more words left in this article.

      "text": "'The Grand Tour' is Already Amazon's Biggest Original Series Amazon still won't reveal its ratings, however. By Tufayel Ahmed On 11/22/16 at 1:22 PM Jeremy Clarkson and Showrunners Brainstorm Name of Amazon Car Show \nAmazon is claiming an early victory lap for its newly launched car show The Grand Tour . \nThe Jeremy Clarkson-fronted program has overtaken sci-fi drama The Man in the High Castle to become the e-tailer’s most-watched launch show in history—but it still isn’t revealing the exact figures. Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> \nThe premiere episode—released last Friday—was apparently viewed millions of times across the U.S., U.K, Germany, Austria and Japan in its first weekend of availability. “Viewership has even exceeded that of the previous number-one show, The Man in the High Castle ,” Amazon’s statement read. \nAmazon, as with other streaming services Netflix and Hulu, does not reveal its precise viewing figures, so exactly how many “millions” watched the episode is not yet clear. \nIn an interview with Newsweek last month, Jay Marine, vice-president of Amazon Prime Video EU, did divulge some numbers: the trailer for the show had, he said, notched up 12 million views across Amazon’s various social-media platforms. If that is any indication of The Grand Tour ’s streaming numbers over the weekend, it would put the series on par with the ratings for Clarkson and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May’s series for the BBC, Top Gear . \n“The guys are back, doing what they do best—the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard and James is what makes The Grand Tour so entertaining,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO. \n“Their creativity, along with the amazing production quality and 4K HDR streaming, has Prime members responding in a big way. Kudos and congrats to the whole team.” \nCritics and fans were equally impressed by the first outing of The Grand Tour , with reviews for the first episode praising the trio’s chemistry and the program’s cinematic feel.",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc.’s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season.\nPilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon’s two airline partners.\nThe pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc. ATSG, -1.44% , which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +0.69% , was hired by Amazon AMZN, +0.68% to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies.\nBut the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management. In a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nDonald Trump calls for day-one executive actions, outlines first 100 days.\nMost students don’t know when news is fake, Stanford study finds.\nMore from MarketWatch An Illustrated History of Thanksgiving Stuffing Opinion Journal: Trump’s Ho-Hum Transition A Reporter's View From the Trump Tower Lobby",

      "text": "If recent job postings are any indication, Amazon has some fairly ambitious goals to shake up the live ticketing business. As spotted by Recode, the Washington-based online retailer is recruiting new hires for its Amazon Tickets division, which launched in the U.K. last year, and sells tickets to concerts and theater performances.\nOne posting, for head of operations, a new role based in London, has been active since June, as has been an opening for head of music. But more interesting are the recently posted gigs for Amazon's Seattle headquarters, including at least three key business development managers. All three (one is for theater, the other music, and the third is general) specifically mention expansion of the company's ticketing business in their job descriptions.\n\"The purpose of the role is to help the Tickets team grow its business relationships in the entertainment industry to expand tickets selection across existing and new categories and territories by working with ticket rights-holders to reach agreements on distribution for sale to end customers,\" the posting reads.\nOther current openings in the Amazon Tickets department include a business intelligence engineer, who will be in charge of developing and supporting analytics, and a software development engineer to help build a \"new consumer facing web application and numerous backend services to support the Tickets business.\"\nSeveral of the postings have been updated in the last day, which could explain why some of the bolder language described in the Recode report has disappeared, or is simply harder to find. For example, a listing for a web development engineer found on LinkedIn says their vision \"goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience\" and that the \"ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.\"\nThe listing for a similar job on Amazon's own job site omits talk of disruption and the perceived lack of innovation in the ticketing market, instead saying that \"as we grow our team to support our rapid expansion we are looking for talented individuals to join us in delighting customers and having some fun along the way.\"\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\nIf part of Amazon's \"rapid expansion\" of ticketing includes the U.S., it will face a market already dominated by Ticketmaster and its parent, Live Nation. Ticketmaster operates in more than a dozen countries and, in 2015 alone, moved more than 530 million tickets to fans.\nAmazon shares are up nearly 1 percent on Tuesday, currently trading at $786. Year-to-date, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has gained 16.75 percent.",
