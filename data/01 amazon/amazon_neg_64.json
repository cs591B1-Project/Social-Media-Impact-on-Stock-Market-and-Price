On a side note, first part of next year they will probably announce a special edition with all the characters etc for both the PS4 and Xbox one. Naming it differently and it doesn't breach their street fight 5 is a Sony exclusive. I thought it had been definitively stated that the game wasn't coming to Xbox? Which I think is a shame, given the way these exclusive deals restrict options for gamers. blanka On a happy side note, looks like we will see Marvel vs capcom 4 in 2017. (Going to be more the marvel cinema universe). Really? Great. I have fond memories of 1 and 2 (3 was ok, but not up there with the first two for me).",

      "text": "Amazon Working On Premium Echo Speaker With Touchscreen To ‘Fend Off Competition from Google and Apple’ Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 29, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nAmazon currently dominates the smart speaker system with its Echo smart speaker, but the company is not sitting on its laurels. Bloomberg reports that Amazon is working a premium version of its Echo speaker that will come with a seven-inch touchscreen. The e-commerce giant is taking this move to “fend off competition from Google and Apple.” \nNone of Amazon’s current Alexa-powered Echo offerings come with a built-in touchscreen. The touchscreen on the premium speaker will make it easier to view information like weather, calendar appointments, and news. \nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. \nThe speaker will be larger than Echo and will tilt upwards so that the screen will be visible when the device is kept on a table. The high-grade speakers will also be a step up from the speaker that Amazon currently uses in its Echo devices. Amazon is expected to unveil its latest Echo offering in the first quarter of 2017. The device will be running a lighter and modified version of Amazon’s Fire OS. It will likely come with features like the ability to pin notes and photos on the touchscreen. \nWhile Apple has not released a product like Alexa, the company is reportedly working on an Echo-like smart home device that recently entered into prototype testing phase.",

      "text": " This may be last minute, but I think we’ve found the Cyber Monday deal of the day over at Amazon. The <a href=\"/tag/onhub\"><strong>ASUS OnHub</strong></a>, Google’s Nexus-like take on a WiFi router that likely helped birth the idea behind Google WiFi, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asus-Onhub-Dual-band-wireless-AC1900-router/dp/B017C0HZEO/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1480396047&sr=1-2&keywords=onhub\" target=\"_blank\">can be yours for just $89.99</a>. That’s $110 off.\nWhat is OnHub? It really is like the Nexus of routers in that Google created this smart WiFi platform, but had other people build the hardware. In this case, it was ASUS, but TP-Link also created one for Google. These routers are controlled via app, are dead simple in terms of control and setup, offer help and solutions when thinks get wonky with your internet, get smarter with automatic software updates, can automate parts of your home through IFTTT, and will work with Google WiFi units to turn your home into the ultimate mesh WiFi network. <span id=\"more-194163\"></span>\nIf you are in need of a modern router that will get better through software updates and by being expandable with Google WiFi, this is a great deal. In fact, this should almost be your Google WiFi network starting point, since at $90, it’s cheaper than a single Google WiFi unit ($129). OnHub routers can also act as WiFi points to create a Google WiFi-like mesh network (by December 9, Google says). The full details on that can be found <a href=\"https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/7168220\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\nYou better hurry.\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Asus-Onhub-Dual-band-wireless-AC1900-router/dp/B017C0HZEO/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1480396047&sr=1-2&keywords=onhub\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Link</a>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Cheers Marco!</em></h6> </div>",

      "text": "Nobody, including e-commerce giant Amazon and its often eccentric Lab126 engineers and developers, expected the Echo smart speaker to catch on. Certainly not as fast as it did, and on such a large scale that it reportedly sold over 5 million units since 2014, prompting several low-cost spin-offs , and let’s face it, a Google-made copycat .\nWithout a doubt, the voice-controlled home automation hub owes much of its mainstream commercial success to the built-in Alexa personal assistant, which is now also available as standard on an all-new Fire TV Stick , select Fire tablets , and third-party TCL Xess “kitchen accessory.” \nIt should come as no surprise therefore that Amazon wants to further boost Alexa’s reach, especially to fend off Google Assistant and Siri’s imminent expansion , with a “premium Echo-like speaker with a screen” rumored for an announcement “as soon as the first quarter of 2017.”\nWait, isn’t an “Echo-like” speaker with a “touchscreen measuring about seven inches” basically a tablet? It sure sounds that way, particularly if it’s to run an “optimized version of Fire OS”, aka Amazon’s homebrewed Android fork.\nThe main difference between this upcoming screen-sporting “speaker” and current 7, 8 or 10-inch Fires will probably be the former’s support for “high-quality audio at all volume levels”, and of course, a resulting price tag significantly surpassing the standard Echo’s $180 MSRP. Sounds like a slightly harder sell, but we’re definitely intrigued.\nThe post ‘Premium Echo-like’ Amazon speaker expected as early as Q1 2017 with 7-inch touchscreen appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Amazon is still riding high on the success of its Echo speakers , and there's only one place to go now that it has a low-cost option like the Echo Dot : to the high end. Accordingly, Bloomberg sources hear that Amazon is working on a \"premium\" Echo-style speaker whose centerpiece would be a roughly 7-inch touchscreen. The visuals would give you a clearer look at your calendar, the weather and other data where Alexa's voice can't provide a perfect description. It would sound better, too with \"high-grade\" speakers that sound good regardless of volume levels.\nIf this sounds a bit like a tablet with speakers, you wouldn't be far off the mark. The insiders claim that this speaker would run an \"optimized\" variant of Fire OS, the Android spinoff that you see on Fire tablets and the Fire TV . That would give you the ability to display info unrelated to your voice commands, such as an in-testing feature that would let you pin photos and other items to the home screen. It's not certain that this has any relation to \" Knight ,\" the Alexa-guided kitchen device rumored back in May, although there are at least some superficial connections.\nThere's no mention of pricing (besides more than the $180 standard Echo). If the scoop is accurate, however, Amazon could ship the speaker as early as the first quarter of 2017. That sounds like odd timing, but the internet retailer does have an incentive to move quickly. Google Home undercuts the standard Echo's price, so there's a strong incentive to offer something beyond what Google can offer. And remember, there are rumors of an Apple smart speaker in the works -- Amazon might not want to be caught without an answer to whatever is cooking in Cupertino.",

      "text": "52 shares \nAmazon is looking to cash in on the surprising success of its Echo digital home assistant as the company is reportedly building a premieum new model of the device that will come in larger size and feature a touchscreen, Bloomberg reports . \nAccording to two undisclosed sources “familiar with the matter,” the upcoming supersized Echo will abandon its standard cylindrical body for a new upwards-tilted shape, specifically designed to accomodate the 7-inch display. \nThe sources further said that implementing touchscreen interface to the smart speaker will make it easier for owners to access content like weather forecasts, calendar appointments and news. \nWith Google and Apple in the race, the competition in the home assistant market is quickly heating up. Google recently released its own Google Home smart speaker and Apple is said to be working on a similar device that will be powered by Siri. It’ll be interesting to see whether Amazon can fend off the competition with the larger-sized Echo. \nDetails about the release of the pimped-up smart speaker are scarce, but Amazon could announce the device as early as the first quarter of 2017.",

      "text": "on Tuesday November 29, 2016 @09:00AM from the change-in-plans dept. Amazon's Echo speakers have garnered a lot of interest over the past few months. Many people believe that they like Amazon Echo because of how easy it's to operate -- there is no display, you talk with Alexa, Amazon's digital assistant, which is reasonably good at understanding your queries. But in what seems like a deviation from the idea that made Echos so popular, Amazon is reportedly working on an Echo-like speaker, only this time it is more premium and has a 7-inch display , too. From a report on Bloomberg: The new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon's existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company's voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. The latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said.",

To each their own. \nMarket Snapshot \nThe Trump effect died down yesterday, with U.S. stocks falling off all-time highs. Meanwhile, Italy faces an upcoming vote on whether to leave the EU, which could push as many as eight of its banks to default Shares of Time Inc. , publisher of Time , People and Fortune , rallied 15.7% after rejecting a takeover offer valuing the company at $1.78 billion Two Companies are Better Than One \n…At least for Samsung shareholders . Amidst the Samsung Galaxy and washing machine recalls, investors haven’t exactly been thrilled with the South Korean firm’s explosive (in a bad way) performance. So yesterday, activist hedge fund Elliott Management took charge, calling for Samsung to split into two companies, buy back more shares, increase its dividends, list shares overseas and appoint more board members. Sounds simple enough. The proposal is currently under review , but Samsung has already increased its annual dividend by 36%. As for the other recommendations, the ball’s in your court, Samsung.\nNice Move \n…AT&T (+0.84%) just pulled a fast one on cord-cutters. No bluff—the telecom giant is officially launching DirecTV Now this Wednesday. What’s that? A new streaming service aimed at turning DirecTV’s lagging growth around. You’re probably familiar with the recent trend of cutting cable TV in favor of cheaper streaming services (we see you, Netflix and HBO), aka cord-cutting. AT&T’s solution? Identify the channels that cord-cutters still miss after ditching cable, and build a new streaming package around them—and at multiple price points to boot. The cherry on top: no credit check, no long-term contracts, no box installations. Now we’ll see if it works.\nTouchdown! \n…The first scheduled commercial flights from the U.S. to Havana in over half a century landed yesterday. Just days after the death of Fidel Castro , American Airlines (-0.68%) and JetBlue (-2.18%) touched down in the Cuban capital yesterday, with other airlines set to follow suit this week. Despite all the hubbub, demand for plane tickets to Cuba has been pretty underwhelming, although Delta (-1.52%) has reported that bookings have been “in line with expectations.” The recent flights continue America’s warming relationship with Cuba, as airlines landed in other Cuban cities earlier this year and Carnival (-0.93%) launched a cruise to the island. Now airlines are just hoping that president-elect Trump won’t “ terminate the deal ,” as he has indicated he might.\nPenalty \n…Boeing loses some yardage. For over a decade , U.S.-based aerospace giant Boeing (-0.18%) has been fighting to receive government subsidies to help pay for the production of its commercial planes. And how’s that going? As of yesterday, not great: according to the latest ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO), the answer is a hard no. More specifically, the WTO told Boeing it can’t use government handouts to help build its new 777X jet. What’s the reasoning? Basically, Boeing was benefiting from a tax cut that forced it to source materials locally, disrupting trade. But if we know Boeing (and we think we do), this fight ain’t over.\nOther Stories \nA prominent Silicon Valley investment banker is suing Theranos Sling TV is launching a cloud DVR next month Insurer Allstate to buy SquareTrade for $1.4 billion Ransomware attack hit San Francisco train system Economic Calendar \nMonday: Government T-Bill Auctions Tuesday: Tiffany Earnings; U.S. Q3 GDP (2nd Estimate); Consumer Confidence; Case-Shiller Home Price Index Wednesday: Royal Bank of Canada, American Eagle, Box Earnings; Private Employment Report; Pending Home Sales; Beige Book; Personal Income and Outlays Thursday: Kroger, Dollar General, Ulta Salon, Smith & Wesson Earnings; Motor Vehicle Sales; Weekly Jobless Claims; PMI Manufacturing Index; ISM Manufacturing Index; Construction Spending Friday: Big Lots Earnings; November Jobs Report Amazon Gets Ready for the Holidays \nYou’ve heard of Amazon, right? While you were still deep in a restful post-Thanksgiving food coma, Amazon was hurriedly gearing up for the holiday season. To handle the increased demand, Amazon has to hire and train tens of thousands of seasonal workers very quickly. Most conventional warehouse jobs take up to six weeks to train new hires. But not Amazon—just like its Prime service, the company aims to deliver its new hires to the warehouse floor in just two days . Here’s how:\nAmazon added 26 new warehouses this year, with each coming chock-full of robots. Yep, robots. The robots walk new hires through the steps of each process and help automate almost everything. The robots also store all necessary numbers so workers don’t have to. For example, before UPS added new technology, some of its warehouse employees had to memorize more than 120 zip codes. If the robots are any indication, this is a seriously big deal: Amazon plans to add 120,000 workers at its U.S. warehouses—increasing its workforce by nearly 40%. What’s the need for all the new workers? It’s partly because Amazon only retained 14% of its seasonal hires last year. But the company also expects holiday sales this year to increase to over $45 billion, a 27% increase from last year. Get your resume ready. Interview Question of the Day \nHow can companies reduce internal and external business risk? ( Answer )\nBusiness Person of the Day \nAfter 18 months, Frank Cooper is leaving his position as chief marketing and chief creative officer at Buzzfeed. Cooper was a driving force behind the company’s big (and successful) bet on sponsored content. Oddly enough, his departure follows Comcast recently doubling its investment in Buzzfeed.\nFood for Thought \nEver heard of a company buying out another only for its employees? It’s a thing. One of YouTube’s most popular stars, Casey Neistat, has sold his startup (social media app Beme) for around $25 million to news giant CNN. What did CNN do with Beme? Immediately shut it down . CNN wasn’t after Berne—it was after the core team that made Beme revolutionary, with hopes of attracting Neistat’s youthful YouTube audience—an audience that thinks news outlets, like CNN, are broken.\nThis embed is invalid\n\nShare This\n",

According to two undisclosed sources “familiar with the matter,” the upcoming supersized Echo will abandon its standard cylindrical body for a new upwards-tilted shape, specifically designed to accomodate the 7-inch display.

Both sale prices match what the company offered as part of its Black Friday sales. \nCyber Monday is a big sales day for Amazon. Last year, shoppers ordered more than 54 million items — 629 per second — on the Monday after Thanksgiving. \nAmazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year, will get early access to Lightning Deals. There will also be specific deals for shoppers using Alexa, the voice assistant in Echo. \nHere’s a look on what will be on sale Monday : 50-inch 1080p LED TV for $145 50-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $249.99 Amazon Voyage for $169.99 Amazon Fire TV for $74.99 Sonos PLAY: 1 compact wireless speaker for $149 Nest Cam indoor security camera for $163.98 Up to 50% off select Nerf, Playskool and Play-Doh toys Blendtec Total blender for $239.99 Up to 50% off select Callaway Golf sets ",

And anyone who buys a phone or TV before January 5 will be entitled to a free subscription to the new DirectTV Now service – the length of which is dependent on the product purchased. \nThe list of available products includes the Le S3 or Le Pro3 (which we recently reviewed ) handsets and the line of Super4 TVs – so, you know, no bikes are cars yet. 0",

      "text": "Amazon planning premium Alexa speaker with large screen - report  39   Amazon is developing a premium Echo -like speaker with a screen, a sign the world’s largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple, Bloomberg says. \nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced. \nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said. \nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon’s new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment. \nSo-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon’s hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014. Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating U.S. sales of more than 5 million units since 2014. Related links:",

      "text": "Amazon’s current lineup of Alexa-enabled products. (Amazon Photo) Amazon is working on a new Alexa-powered device with a 7-inch touchscreen and high-end speakers, designed to sit on a counter and tilt upward for easy viewing and use, according to a report by Bloomberg News this morning , citing two people familiar with the matter.\nThe device could be announced as early as the first quarter of next year, according to the report. It would capitalize on the surprise success of Amazon’s Echo smart speakers, potentially keeping the Seattle-based company ahead of Apple, Google, Microsoft and other rivals in the effort to bring voice-activated intelligent assistants into the home.\nWe’ve contacted Amazon for comment on the Bloomberg story. The report is by Mark Gurman, a technology journalist with a reputation for accurate consumer electronics scoops. Citing one source, Gurman reports that high-grade speakers in the new product “will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices.”\nThe company doesn’t disclose its Echo sales figures, but a recent report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that the retail giant has sold 5.1 million of the smart speakers in the U.S. since it debuted two years ago. The company said the best-selling item on Amazon.com on Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday was its Echo Dot smart speaker, which was available for $39.99 as part of Amazon’s Cyber Monday deals.\nA variety of third-party hardware makers are also building Alexa-enabled devices, including smart touchscreen intercom maker Nucleus, in which Amazon led a $5.6 million investment earlier this year .",

And earlier this year, our sister site Laptop Mag reported on the rash of fake USB Type-C cables and how to buy a safe one .\nAccording to Bloomberg , negotiations with Major League Baseball and the National Football League came to a standstill because of worries about fake products on Amazon. \n\nNow Amazon is finally getting ready to banish counterfeit goods from its stores, according to Bloomberg. The online retailer will reportedly have teams in the United States and Europe building a registry of products from major brands.\nMORE: Is Amazon Prime Worth It? Here's the 15 Top Perks \nThese teams will be in charge of enlisting brands to sign up for the registry, regardless of whether or not those groups sell on Amazon's website.\nThe idea is that anyone selling those brands' goods will have to prove to Amazon that they have permission to sell them. Amazon has reportedly been testing this with Nike and select other labels, but plans to increase this practice dramatically in 2017.\nLast week, CNET reported on a separate Amazon initiative called Brand Central that protects merchants and buyers from fake products, but details were scarce.\nAmazon told Bloomberg it \"has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,\" but it sounds like we'll have to wait until next year to see what comes of that policy. \nSee Also : 15 Cheap Tech Products That Make Life Easier \nWhat Is Amazon Student?

This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced. \nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said. \nALSO READ: Amazon gets real about fakes \nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon’s new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment. \nSo-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon’s hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014. Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating US sales of more than 5 million units since 2014. \nAmazon’s planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speaker and Apple Inc.’s interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant. \nThe new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon’s Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box. The gadget will still respond to verbal commands and spoken questions, just like current Alexa devices. Amazon is also testing a feature that allows users to pin items such as photos on their speaker’s screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door, one of the people said. \nAmazon plans to keep selling the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers that are typically stationed in living rooms and bedrooms, one of the people said. The current speakers cost $50, $130 and $180, respectively, while the model with a screen will likely be priced higher, the other person said. \nSome reviewers panned the current Echo for poor audio quality, which is partly due to Amazon designing it to sound better at moderate volume levels, according to one of the people. The new speaker will play high-quality audio at all volume levels, this person said. At least one prototype version of the device places the speakers below and behind the screen, they added. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon’s Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tablet-like computer screen known internally as “Knight.” Bloomberg",

      "text": "print Left to right: The Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon Tap, and Amazon Echo. Business Insider \nAmazon is working on “a premium Echo-like speaker” with a touchscreen display measuring roughly seven inches, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman . \nThe report says the new Echo speaker will work with Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant — much like the current Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, and Tap speakers — but that the new 7-inch touchscreen could be used for quicker access to personal info, like weather forecasts and calendar appointments. \nIt all sounds like a fusion of the Echo and the popular Fire tablets the ecommerce giant sells today. It shouldn’t be surprising, then, to hear that the new device will reportedly use an “optimized version” of Fire OS, Amazon's operating system for those tablets. \nAmazon released a software update that brought Alexa to newer Fire tablets in late October, though it’s not yet clear if interacting with Alexa on this new speaker will work in a similar fashion. \nBloomberg says the device will “tilt upwards” — which’d theoretically make it easier to touch on, say, a counter or nightstand — and that it will use higher quality speakers than the current Echo, which is often criticized for its lacking audio quality (relative to other $180 speakers, at least). \nAmazon The report says this new device will cost more than the top-end Echo, though. It’s said to be announced in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in May that Amazon was working on a “tablet-like” computer featuring Alexa, codenamed “Knight,” which would be used to add a visual aspect to Alexa’s audio smarts . \nThe report comes just a few weeks after Google released its own Echo competitor, the Google Home . Earlier this year, both The Information and Bloomberg reported that Apple is working on an Echo-esque smart home device as well. The Echo itself has been one of Amazon's few runaway hits in the hardware business. \nAll of this suggests that the digital assistant race isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Though we’ve found the actual smarts of these AI helpers to be lacking , it seems clear that the major players in tech are pinning much of their hopes to them, and the Internet of Things, for the future. \nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

      "text": "Are you aching for just a bit more...everything on your Amazon Echo? Improvements and additions might come soon, as Bloomberg reports the company is working on a premium variant of the Echo smart speaker — one that will have a 7-inch screen.\nAccording to the report , which cites two people familiar with the matter, the new Echo will be a radical departure from the current, simple cylindrical design.\nSEE ALSO: Amazon's Echo and Echo Dot are now on sale\nIn addition to the 7-inch screen, the new Echo will have much-improved speakers. And the gadget will tilt upwards so that you can easily access it while standing. Details at this point are vague, but in terms of design, we're imagining something akin to a Fire tablet on a stand or a smaller Surface Studio .\nThe new Echo will run on a modified version of Fire OS, the Android-based operating system that powers Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets. And, just like other products in the Echo family, it will respond to voice commands courtesy of Amazon's smart digital assistant, Alexa.\nA similar device, nicknamed \"Knight,\" was mentioned in a Wall Street Journa l report in May 2016, but far fewer details were known then.\nThis new Echo could be launched as soon as the first quarter of 2017. The report does not metion an exact price, but says that it will likely be pricier than the current Amazon Echo, which costs $180.\nBONUS: This homemade crane lifting a 3-year-old is the definition of DIY engineering",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 29th, 2016 \nAmazon is in homes a few different ways. They’ve got Fire tablets and Fire TV sticks, Dash Buttons for true one-click ordering, and, lately, the Echo line of devices to give you a virtual assistant in your home. \nWhat’s the next step? How about a bit of convergence? Bloomberg is reporting that Amazon has an Echo device in the works which would have a 7-inch touchscreen. \nOur first hope is that this could be an Echo/Fire hybrid tablet which can sit in your home ready to accept commands (and using the screen to show more detailed information), and act as a Fire tablet when you leave the house. \nAmazon would have to deal with an identity crisis issue if that’s the case, of course, as the Echo line aims to step out of the way and help you complete tasks and live your life through voice commands, while the Fire line is more for entertainment. There’s something to be said about product identity retention, but one Echo to rule them all sounds like more fun (and a more interesting marketing angle, which for Amazon would be more dollars). \nBeyond a display, Amazon’s goal for the new device is to equip it with higher quality speakers, as the current devices have speakers whose quality degrades at higher volumes. Here, the speaker would be able to deliver high-quality audio at all volumes. \nThis could make it a nice one-stop shop for home entertainment users who want to get rid of some of their dedicated speaker setups. If true, it’s said Amazon is targeting a Q1 2017 launch.",

REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino 15/15 By Stephen Eisenhammer | NOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil \nNOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon. \nAn agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there. \nHe walked away rather than watch it burn. \nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot. \nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para. \nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognised by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows. \n\"The loggers are better equipped than we are,\" said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. \"Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.\" \nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming. \nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again. \nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades. \nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down. \nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year. \nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear. \nA 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n\"We haven’t even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60). \nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. \nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies. \n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said. \nNEW STRATEGY \nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate. \nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. \nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. \n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change. \nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. \nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. \nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. \nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. \nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalised. \nPIONEERS \nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. \nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. \nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. \nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process. \nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. \n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\" \nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering. \nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighbouring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\" \nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy. \nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. \nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle. \nNO JOBS \nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. \nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. \nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence. \nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. \n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\" \nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labour, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. \nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber. \n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\" \nClick on reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay \n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray) Next In Environment Giant arch slides over Chernobyl site to block radiation for a century \nCHERNOBYL, Ukraine In the middle of a vast exclusion zone in northern Ukraine, the world's largest land-based moving structure has been slid over the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site to prevent deadly radiation spewing from the stricken reactor for the next 100 years.

Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n\"We haven’t even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60). \nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. \nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies. \n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said. \nNEW STRATEGY \nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate. \nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. \nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. \n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change. \nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. \nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. \nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. \nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. \nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalised. \nPIONEERS \nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. \nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. \nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. \nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process. \nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. \n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\" \nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering. \nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighbouring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\" \nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy. \nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. \nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle. \nNO JOBS \nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. \nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. \nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence. \nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. \n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\" \nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labour, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. \nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber. \n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\" \nClick on http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay \n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray)",

      "text": "Amazon may be adding to its Echo family very soon. A report from Bloomberg suggests the online retailer is working on a new Alexa-based speaker device with a seven-inch touchscreen, which would make it the first Alexa device with a screen. Currently Amazon's $180 Echo, $130 Tap, and $50 Dot are cylindrical devices, some with speakers and some without, that all contain the company's digital assistant.\nFurther Reading One year after Alexa: Amazon’s Echo has found a small but smart niche According to the report, the new device will have a touchscreen that can be tilted upward so it's more easily visible when sitting on a counter or table. The screen will make it more convenient for users to access information like weather reports, calendar events, and news. All of that information can currently be accessed by voice-commanding Alexa to read it out, but the screen would give that information a visual component. It's also reported that the new device will have even better speakers than the current Echo, which would likely make it a better music playback device.\nIn addition to using Alexa to control the new device, users will be able to interact with the screen almost like a tablet. Bloomberg reports the device will run \"an optimized version of Fire OS,\" which is the operating system used in Amazon's tablets. Amazon is also testing a feature that would let users \"pin\" items to the device's screen, similar to how you could use a magnet to place something on a refrigerator door. This feature sounds similar to the messaging features on Triby , one of the first third-party devices to incorporate Alexa. That device uses a small, e-ink display to show messages sent between family members as well as date and weather information.\nThe report suggests that Amazon could release this new Alexa-enabled device in early 2017. This is undoubtably a way to keep ahead of the competition: Google just released its Home device with its Assistant built in, and there are reports that Apple is working on an Echo-like device powered by Siri. Amazon's Echo has carved out its own corner of the home thanks to the fact that using Alexa voice controls is very easy when you're doing a million things around the house. Its native features are useful, although Amazon could stand to improve its Alexa mobile app since that is the only real interface that Echo, Tap, and Dot have. That could change now with reports of this new device, but it's uncertain what users would like to use more—the physical touchscreen or the voice-controlled Alexa—and how well those two methods will coexist in one device.",

      "text": "\n“Needless flash over function” — Consumer Reports’ review of Tesla’s new Model X SUV. Clearly, Consumer Reports isn’t a big fan of the SUV’s wing-like doors . To each their own. \nMarket Snapshot \nThe Trump effect died down yesterday, with U.S. stocks falling off all-time highs. Meanwhile, Italy faces an upcoming vote on whether to leave the EU, which could push as many as eight of its banks to default Shares of Time Inc. , publisher of Time , People and Fortune , rallied 15.7% after rejecting a takeover offer valuing the company at $1.78 billion Two Companies are Better Than One \n…At least for Samsung shareholders . Amidst the Samsung Galaxy and washing machine recalls, investors haven’t exactly been thrilled with the South Korean firm’s explosive (in a bad way) performance. So yesterday, activist hedge fund Elliott Management took charge, calling for Samsung to split into two companies, buy back more shares, increase its dividends, list shares overseas and appoint more board members. Sounds simple enough. The proposal is currently under review , but Samsung has already increased its annual dividend by 36%. As for the other recommendations, the ball’s in your court, Samsung.\nNice Move \n…AT&T (+0.84%) just pulled a fast one on cord-cutters. No bluff—the telecom giant is officially launching DirecTV Now this Wednesday. What’s that? A new streaming service aimed at turning DirecTV’s lagging growth around. You’re probably familiar with the recent trend of cutting cable TV in favor of cheaper streaming services (we see you, Netflix and HBO), aka cord-cutting. AT&T’s solution? Identify the channels that cord-cutters still miss after ditching cable, and build a new streaming package around them—and at multiple price points to boot. The cherry on top: no credit check, no long-term contracts, no box installations. Now we’ll see if it works.\nTouchdown! \n…The first scheduled commercial flights from the U.S. to Havana in over half a century landed yesterday. Just days after the death of Fidel Castro , American Airlines (-0.68%) and JetBlue (-2.18%) touched down in the Cuban capital yesterday, with other airlines set to follow suit this week. Despite all the hubbub, demand for plane tickets to Cuba has been pretty underwhelming, although Delta (-1.52%) has reported that bookings have been “in line with expectations.” The recent flights continue America’s warming relationship with Cuba, as airlines landed in other Cuban cities earlier this year and Carnival (-0.93%) launched a cruise to the island. Now airlines are just hoping that president-elect Trump won’t “ terminate the deal ,” as he has indicated he might.\nPenalty \n…Boeing loses some yardage. For over a decade , U.S.-based aerospace giant Boeing (-0.18%) has been fighting to receive government subsidies to help pay for the production of its commercial planes. And how’s that going? As of yesterday, not great: according to the latest ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO), the answer is a hard no. More specifically, the WTO told Boeing it can’t use government handouts to help build its new 777X jet. What’s the reasoning? Basically, Boeing was benefiting from a tax cut that forced it to source materials locally, disrupting trade. But if we know Boeing (and we think we do), this fight ain’t over.\nOther Stories \nA prominent Silicon Valley investment banker is suing Theranos Sling TV is launching a cloud DVR next month Insurer Allstate to buy SquareTrade for $1.4 billion Ransomware attack hit San Francisco train system Economic Calendar \nMonday: Government T-Bill Auctions Tuesday: Tiffany Earnings; U.S. Q3 GDP (2nd Estimate); Consumer Confidence; Case-Shiller Home Price Index Wednesday: Royal Bank of Canada, American Eagle, Box Earnings; Private Employment Report; Pending Home Sales; Beige Book; Personal Income and Outlays Thursday: Kroger, Dollar General, Ulta Salon, Smith & Wesson Earnings; Motor Vehicle Sales; Weekly Jobless Claims; PMI Manufacturing Index; ISM Manufacturing Index; Construction Spending Friday: Big Lots Earnings; November Jobs Report Amazon Gets Ready for the Holidays \nYou’ve heard of Amazon, right? While you were still deep in a restful post-Thanksgiving food coma, Amazon was hurriedly gearing up for the holiday season. To handle the increased demand, Amazon has to hire and train tens of thousands of seasonal workers very quickly. Most conventional warehouse jobs take up to six weeks to train new hires. But not Amazon—just like its Prime service, the company aims to deliver its new hires to the warehouse floor in just two days . Here’s how:\nAmazon added 26 new warehouses this year, with each coming chock-full of robots. Yep, robots. The robots walk new hires through the steps of each process and help automate almost everything. The robots also store all necessary numbers so workers don’t have to. For example, before UPS added new technology, some of its warehouse employees had to memorize more than 120 zip codes. If the robots are any indication, this is a seriously big deal: Amazon plans to add 120,000 workers at its U.S. warehouses—increasing its workforce by nearly 40%. What’s the need for all the new workers? It’s partly because Amazon only retained 14% of its seasonal hires last year. But the company also expects holiday sales this year to increase to over $45 billion, a 27% increase from last year. Get your resume ready. Interview Question of the Day \nHow can companies reduce internal and external business risk? ( Answer )\nBusiness Person of the Day \nAfter 18 months, Frank Cooper is leaving his position as chief marketing and chief creative officer at Buzzfeed. Cooper was a driving force behind the company’s big (and successful) bet on sponsored content. Oddly enough, his departure follows Comcast recently doubling its investment in Buzzfeed.\nFood for Thought \nEver heard of a company buying out another only for its employees? It’s a thing. One of YouTube’s most popular stars, Casey Neistat, has sold his startup (social media app Beme) for around $25 million to news giant CNN. What did CNN do with Beme? Immediately shut it down . CNN wasn’t after Berne—it was after the core team that made Beme revolutionary, with hopes of attracting Neistat’s youthful YouTube audience—an audience that thinks news outlets, like CNN, are broken.\n\n\n",

      "text": "svenska AT&T Expands Service Offerings on Amazon Web Services Enterprise Application Providers Infor and Pegasystems Become Part of the AT&T NetBond® Ecosystem via AWS Direct Connect Bundle Program News provided by Nov 29, 2016, 10:30 ET Share this article DALLAS , Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AT&T today announced that it is integrating AT&T NetBond® with the AWS Direct Connect (DX) bundle to offer highly secure access to Infor and Pegasystems, two leading application and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers. The SaaS architecture enhanced by the AT&T NetBond AWS DX bundle is part of a set of advanced hybrid reference architectures that simplify network management and boost performance. This helps AWS SaaS partners quickly and easily move customers to the cloud in a scalable and highly secure manner using the AT&T MPLS network. AT&T NetBond creates a highly secure connection to AWS SaaS providers using a customer's AT&T Virtual Private Network. This allows users to bypass the public internet, enhancing reliability and performance. \"We help businesses get added value out of the cloud and software services they already use through our leading network. It's the foundation for all of our integrated cloud solutions,\" says Mo Katibeh , senior vice president, Advanced Solutions, AT&T Business Solutions. \"As a result, the network's performance and scale provides highly-secure access to key, cloud-based applications from nearly anywhere and at any time.\" As part of the AWS Direct Connect program, AWS Partner Network (APN) and SaaS technology Partners Infor and Pegasystems will become a part of the AT&T NetBond ecosystem. AT&T NetBond is now active in seven domestic and global AWS Direct Connect regions including: Northern CA, Northern VA, Oregon , Ireland , Frankfurt , Singapore , and Sydney. \"AT&T NetBond provides a fast and reliable connection to the Infor Cloud environment,\" said Brian Rose , senior vice president, Infor Labs. \"AT&T NetBond lets us integrate seamlessly and securely with our customers' networks. Further, it simplifies network management for an optimized customer experience.\" \"AWS-powered Pega® Cloud enables enterprises to provide their customers with exceptional experiences at every stage of the buying cycle – from marketing to sales to customer service,\" said Mike Pyle , senior vice president, engineering and product development, Pegasystems. \"AWS' integration with AT&T NetBond gives these businesses a new path to connect to our customer engagement software in a highly-secure and reliable way.\" Benefits of NetBond: Simplicity: Works with existing AT&T Virtual Private Network to connect directly to leading cloud providers. No additional equipment or access lines required. Security: Isolates traffic to avoid public internet security risks. Cost Savings: Controls costs by adjusting cloud and network resources on demand.

      "text": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 15:09 UTC An Amazon.com Inc. employee was injured when he leaped off a building at the company's Seattle headquarters in what police characterized as a suicide attempt. The man, who wasn't identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a person familiar with the matter. The man survived the fall from Amazon's 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. The man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn't improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon's headquarters. \"Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"He's receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.\" In the e-mail, the man expressed criticism of how the company handled his transfer request, and he hinted that he might harm himself, according to the person. Suicide was the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2013, with 41,149 people taking their own lives that year, for a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The online retailer has taken steps to soften its image as a difficult employer since a New York Times story last year portrayed the company as a bruising workplace where employees were encouraged to take advantage of one another to get ahead. Amazon disputed the characterization of the company.",

      "text": "  Amazon Could Soon Reinvent the Smart Speaker With a Next-Generation Echo With LCD by Bryan M. Wolfe November 29, 2016 \nApple is largely expected to unveil a Siri-enabled smart speaker in the new year. To preempt this strike, Amazon is expected to launch a premium version of its popular Amazon Echo early in 2017, according to Bloomberg . \nCurrent Echo model \nThe premium Echo device is expected to feature a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, “a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter.” \nThe current Amazon Echo is typically used in living rooms and bedrooms. The new device may be marketed as a kitchen-based device. \nAmazon’s new device is scheduled to be announced during the first quarter of 2017. Thereafter, the company plans to continue selling its current lineup of Alexa-based devices, including the Dot, Tap, and first-generation Echo. These are priced at $50, $130, and $180, respectively. The new model will likely be priced higher. \n\nTriby \nIt will be interesting to see what Amazon has cooked up for Echo in 2017. Based on the Bloomberg report, it looks like the second-generation Echo is going to look a lot like the Triby Smart Speaker , which already integrates with Amazon Alexa. Whether this is a good thing remains to be seen. View Comments",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nMs. Smith (not her real name) is a freelance writer and programmer with a special and somewhat personal interest in IT privacy and security issues. Amazon employee jumped from building after sending email to co-workers and CEO An Amazon employee sent an email note to co-workers and CEO Jeff Bezos before jumping from the building in what appears to be an attempted suicide. Network World | Nov 29, 2016 7:03 AM PT Email   IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nAn Amazon employee sent out an email to “hundreds” of his co-workers and even Amazon top dog CEO Jeff Bezos. Then he went to the roof of the building and jumped in what appears to be an attempted suicide. \nA spokesperson for the Seattle Fire Department told SeattlePI that a man did jump from the “rooftop at an Amazon building at Ninth Avenue North and Thomas Street.” Google \nAmazon Apollo Building as seen via Google Maps. \nAlthough the man leaped off the 12-story Apollo building, Seattle Fire said he jumped from the pedestal section – about four stories up – and “fell only about 20 feet to a balcony below.” \nAfter being taken to Harborview Medical Center, his injuries were described as “non-life-threatening.” \nSome people get depressed around the holidays, but Bloomberg’s report noted that the man had requested a transfer to a different department. He was instead “placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved.” \nThe suicidal man’s email was critical of Amazon; he criticized how Amazon handled his transfer request and even “hinted that he might harm himself.” \nAmazon released the following statement: “Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover. He’s receiving some of the best care possible, and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nIn August 2015, The New York Times called Amazon a “bruising workplace” and described the dog-eat-dog world of working for the online retailer. Bezos denied that Amazon was a “soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard.” \nBezos claimed The Times article didn’t “describe the Amazon I know or the caring Amazonians I work with every day.” He encouraged employees to report any workplace abuse to HR or to email him directly. \n“I strongly believe that anyone working in a company that really is like the one described in the NYT would be crazy to stay. I know I would leave such a company,” Bezos said. \nYet the fallout was dramatic as worker after worker came forward to share their experiences of working at Amazon. Some made it sound like working at the company was like working for the devil in hell. Jay Carney, Amazon’s senior vice president for global affairs, also disputed The Times report . \nAmazon did make some changes, such as offering 20 weeks of paid leave for new moms, offering six weeks leave for new parents, changing its employee review process and recently rolling out a 30-hour workweek pilot program . \nWhen announcing the pilot program during an online recruitment seminar, Amazon claimed , “These part-time employees will still receive the same benefits as those employees scheduled for 40 hours per week. While the part-time employees’ projects will be carefully managed to align with schedules, they will share the same objective of all of our teams: to build great things on behalf of our customers.” \nAlthough it remains to be seen what the man’s email actually said, it seems that despite the changes, at least one Amazon worker still believes working at Amazon is enough of a soul-crushing experience that he attempted to end it all.

      "text": "Amazon reportedly removes ‘offensive’ Allah doormat after social media criticism   15:37 Get short URL © Mike Segar / Reuters Amazon online retailer appears to have removed a doormat product from its website after criticism on social media that the mat with the word ‘Allah’ offends Muslims. A petition urging a boycott was subsequently launched online. \nComments on social media suggest that advertisements with pictures of doormats with Islamic symbols have been up on Amazon at least since June. One of them alleged that “Allah Islam Symbols Doormat and Dog Mat” could be bought for $17.44. \nPeople have been expressing their shock that the word ‘Allah’– the Arabic word for ‘God’– was written in Islamic calligraphy on a mat used for wiping feet. The online discussion, with people calling it “shameful” and “disrespectful,” has been reportedly going on since June, with people complaining that the retailer is ignoring their comments. These mats are extremely offensive to Muslims & out of order. @amazon @AmazonHelp please remove these from your site immediately. pic.twitter.com/b1syDWPDVC — Mariam Khan (@mariamkhan29) 28 ноября 2016 г. \nThe story took a new course after the product was noticed earlier this month by Mariam Khan, a city councilor from Birmingham, UK. On Monday, she addressed Amazon on Twitter, complaining that the mats were “extremely offensive to Muslims.” \n“Amazon, please remove these from your site immediately,” she wrote as well as making a post on Facebook on the issue. \n“I explained the situation – asked them to check the items themselves and the representative I spoke to said they are really sorry about having these items for sale and offending their fellow Muslim brothers and sisters and will remove the items as they don't want to disrespect any religion.” \nShe also attached a letter from an Amazon representative, in which the company apologized to her, saying that they “never intended to hurt anyone’s religious beliefs.” Read more Apple sues over counterfeit products sold on Amazon \n“Please be assured that all the items related to these doormats will be removed very soon. Amazon wants our customers to experience positive support and feedback.” \nThe advertisement can no longer be seen on the website , according to people on social media. They shared links to the offensive product, which are now blocked. \nEven though the product was removed from the website, people expressed their anger under Khan’s post. \n“Disgraceful and shameful. We should stop using Amazon immediately. Islamophobia should not be allowed we don't insult others so please don't insult the Muslims,” one man wrote. \nOne more person suggested banning Amazon and “stop them trading.” \n“Disrespectful. Disgusting and a syndrome of hate. The matter needs to be seriously noticed and brought to the notice of the faith leaders of different religious groups. Such acts promote the environment of intolerance and give birth to hurt sentiments,” added another person. \nOne man said that if Amazon removed the offensive product, then it is the seller who is to blame. “Not sure how Amazon works but since multi millions of items are sold… daily I doubt they’d have verified the item and approved it for sale had they known what it actually was or even seen it…” he added. \nAn online petition has been launched urging a boycott of Amazon. It states that: “Muslims all over the world are mortified by products displayed on the Amazon platform containing the Arabic word for God (Allah) printed on door mats and other products available for sale.” \nMeanwhile, the online retailer sells other products with Islamic symbols such as the crescent and star. There is also a doormat with Christian symbols, such as the cross and the one with a Star of David . \nAccording to Amazon’s policy , among the products it prohibits the selling of are those “that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views.”",

      "title": "Amazon developing a premium Alexa-powered speaker with a 7-inch screen",
      "text": "\nAmazon’s Alexa-enabled speakers have turned out to be quite successful. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners , Amazon has sold more than five million units since the initial launch two years ago. But the best is yet to come.\nIn hopes of capitalizing on the success of the devices, the company is now taking the next step in the development of its popular speakers. According to a report from Bloomberg , Amazon will soon — reportedly in Q1 2017 — announce a new Alexa-powered device that will offer better sound quality, and more importantly, feature a 7-inch touch screen.\nThe screen should significantly enhance the user experience as it will allow for quick access to information like the weather, calendar appointments, news, and other similar functions. It will be tilted upwards, so you’ll be able to see it when the device is positioned on a table or the kitchen counter.\nSee also: Third party speakers may help Google Home take on Amazon Echo September 30, 2016 The device will obviously still respond to your voice commands and will be able to tell you what time it is, what the weather is like, and even help you out when preparing lunch or dinner , just like the current Alexa-powered lineup consisting of the Echo Dot, Tap , and Echo, which retail for $49.99, $129.99, and $179.99 respectively.\nThe pricing of Amazon’s upcoming device is yet to be known, but it’s safe to say that due to the addition of a screen it will be the company’s most expensive Alexa product yet.\nOver a month ago, Google announced the Assistant-powered Home device , which goes head to head with Amazon’s Alexa speakers. In addition, Apple is supposedly also looking to enter the market sometime next year. The online retail giant clearly hopes it will be able to fend off increasing competition with a new premium device that will offer additional functionality thanks to the integrated screen.\nWhat are your thoughts? Does the addition of a screen make a voice-controlled speaker more appealing to you?",

The man, who wasn't identified by authorities, sent an e-mail visible to hundreds of co-workers, including Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, before the incident occurred, according to a report on Bloomberg. The man survived the fall from Amazon's 12-story Apollo building at about 8:45 a.m. local time Monday and was taken to a Seattle hospital, police said. The man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn't improved , said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. More than 20,000 people work in multiple buildings at Amazon's headquarters.",

      "text": "Lack of fuel, guns hits Brazil's Amazon guardians Reuters News Share Tweet \nBy Stephen Eisenhammer \nNOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil (Reuters) - The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon. \nAn agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there. \nHe walked away rather than watch it burn. \nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot. \nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para. \nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognized by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows. \n\"The loggers are better equipped than we are,\" said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. \"Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.\" \nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming. \nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again. \nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades. \nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down. \nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year. \nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear. \nA 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n\"We haven’t even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60). \nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. \nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies. \n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said. \nNEW STRATEGY \nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate. \nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. \nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. \n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change. \nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. \nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. \nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. \nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. \nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalized. \nPIONEERS \nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. \nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. \nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. \nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process. \nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. \n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\" \nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering. \nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighboring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\" \nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy. \nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. \nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle. \nNO JOBS \nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. \nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. \nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence. \nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. \n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\" \nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labor, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. \nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber. \n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\" \nClick on http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay \n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray)",

      "text": "By Stephen Eisenhammer NOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil (Reuters) - The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon.\nAn agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there.\nHe walked away rather than watch it burn.\nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot.\nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para.\nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognised by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows.\n\"The loggers are better equipped than we are,\" said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. \"Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.\"\nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming.\nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again.\nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades.\nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down.\nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year.\nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear.\nA 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel.\n\"We haven’t even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60).\nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival.\nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies.\n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said.\nNEW STRATEGY\nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate.\nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany.\nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed.\n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change.\nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective.\nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012.\nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming.\nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles.\nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say.\nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalised.\nPIONEERS\nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy.\nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast.\nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch.\nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s.\nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process.\nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier.\n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\"\nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering.\nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighbouring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\"\nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy.\nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth.\nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle.\nNO JOBS\nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft.\nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged.\nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence.\nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by.\n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\"\nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labour, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop.\nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber.\n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\"\nClick on http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay\n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray)",

      "text": "  11:00 AM EST Liquidware Labs Announces Full Support for Amazon WorkSpaces with Leading Workspace Environment Management Suite \nAmazon WorkSpaces customers now have access to award-winning assessment, user experience metrics, user environment management and application layering solutions \n  \nLiquidware Labs, a leading provider of desktop transformation solutions for virtual, physical, and cloud-based desktops, today announced that the company’s Workspace Environment Management suite, known as Liquidware Labs Essentials, now fully supports Amazon WorkSpaces. \nLiquidware Labs has partnered with Amazon WorkSpaces (AWS) to offer Liquidware Labs Essentials, including its Stratusphere solutions, ProfileUnity and FlexApp, to organizations that can benefit from the company’s Workspace Environment Management offerings. The Liquidware Labs products for Amazon Workspaces are available on the AWS Marketplace or by downloading at http://www.liquidwarelabs.com . \nAWS provides a powerful global infrastructure fabric upon which desktops can be rapidly provisioned and sized, based not only on initial design, but more importantly, as the environment grows and changes over time. This ease and flexibility – combined with the enhanced security the AWS cloud offers – makes cloud desktops an increasingly attractive option for many large organizations. Cloud-based desktops can be rapidly provisioned for peak usages times, to establish consistent user experience after mergers or acquisitions or to support remote workers more effectively. \nLiquidware Labs solutions will be highlighted in a presentation to be given at re:Invent that will be co-presented by Nick Frank, Practice Lead at AHEAD, a Liquidware Labs channel partner. \n“Liquidware Labs has been an AHEAD partner for six years in the on-premises VDI space. As our End-User Computing team has expanded its focus into the public cloud space with Amazon WorkSpaces, we needed solutions that can scale and support a hybrid cloud architecture,” says Nick Frank, Practice Lead for Mobility and End User Computing at AHEAD. “We wanted to present a perspective to help our customers understand why you need best-of-breed solutions when moving desktops to the cloud and how to accomplish that successfully.” \nFor more information and to register for this re:Invent session, follow this link. ENT201 - Deploying Amazon WorkSpaces at Enterprise Scale to Deliver a New Desktop Experience \nAWS Solutions are increasingly an option for many types of organizations looking for a more streamlined approach to scaling their virtual desktops. \n“In September, we integrated the AWS WorkSpaces offering into our learning process. To better understand how our students used the newly introduced platform, we looked to Liquidware Labs to help us. Being able to use both Stratusphere and ProfileUnity allowed us to provide better support to our students and allowed us to maintain our ‘student first’ focus,” said Greg M. Smith, Associate VP, Enterprise Operations, University of Maryland University College. \nLiquidware Labs Essentials adds the following capabilities to Amazon WorkSpaces: Assess current physical or virtual desktops for Amazon WorkSpaces readiness with Liquidware Labs Stratusphere FIT. The solution provides joint customers with in depth usage metrics including GPU demand, application usage, storage sizing, and more for decision support when choosing the right Amazon WorkSpaces level. Gain knowledge of existing desktop environment usage which can be leveraged for desktop image design and application delivery strategies in the new Amazon WorkSpaces desktops. Migrate users to Amazon WorkSpaces and manage with User Environment Management (UEM) with Liquidware Labs ProfileUnity. Harvest and move user profiles and data and be prepared for Amazon WorkSpaces upgrades to future OS versions such as Windows 10/Server 2016. Leverage robust UEM features that go beyond Microsoft Active Directory and Group Policies. Layer applications for Amazon WorkSpaces environments without modifying base images with Liquidware Labs FlexApp. Application layering enables easy application delivery per user, group, or context aware setting. FlexApp applications co-exist easily with Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM) applications. Monitor User Experience and Optimize Amazon WorkSpaces. Identify desktop performance bottlenecks with Liquidware Labs Stratusphere UX. Ensure that Amazon and Internet provider service level agreements are being met. Troubleshoot desktop performance issues including excessive login delays, boot storms, and identify IOPS bottlenecks. Gain decision support of desktop performance when needs change to right-size your Amazon WorkSpaces subscription level. \n“Liquidware Labs is a pioneer in the Workspace Environment Management space in the virtual desktop market and has helped many Citrix and VMware customers achieve success when rolling out both on premises virtual desktops and cloud-based desktops, said Mark Bowker, Senior Analyst, Enterprise Strategies Group. “It is exciting to see them fully embrace and extend their innovative products’ support for Amazon Workspaces. When Liquidware Labs user experience, user environment management and layering solutions are leveraged in Amazon Workspaces environment, customers gain a very mature and comprehensive desktop DaaS offering.” \nIn addition to Amazon WorkSpaces, Liquidware Labs solutions support any Windows desktop including virtual, physical or cloud-based environments. The solutions also support Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop, VMware Horizon running on premises or in any cloud such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Therefore, organizations do not need to choose among platforms – virtual or physical – they can use Liquidware Labs solutions for all of their desktops in their environment. \n“We see a future where on-premises desktops will be consistently paired with cloud-based desktops,” said Tyler Rohrer, who spearheads alliances for Liquidware Labs and manages the Amazon relationship. “When extending our solutions to Amazon WorkSpaces, as well as all desktops in their environment, organizations can enter a new era of simplicity, scalability and control over provisioning and managing their Windows desktops.” \nFor more information on the complementary nature of the Liquidware Labs Workspace Solutions Stack for Amazon WorkSpaces, please visit the Liquidware Labs website at: http://www.liquidwarelabs.com/solutions/solutions-cloud/amazon-workspaces \nAbout Liquidware Labs Liquidware Labs™ provides industry leading platform-agnostic desktop solutions for hybrid Windows desktop environments including Citrix® XenApp/XenDesktop, VMware Horizon View®, and physical Microsoft® Windows PCs.

      "text": "LeEco Smartphones And TVs Land On Amazon, Best Buy, And Target   07:59 PST \nLeEco made a pretty big deal of its U.S. launch as it showcased a variety of products ranging from smart TVs to a prototype of an electric car . It’s already selling some of those products directly to customers through its online store but now it’s expanding them to major retailers. LeEco has confirmed that its smart TVs and smartphones will be available for purchase from Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting next month. \nLeEco has been pushing its products in the United States by offering flash sales through its LeMall online store. The idea was to mark down the prices significantly in a bid to bring in more customers. \nThe company now wants to make its products available to more retailers. With Amazon, it gets the largest online retailer in the world and with Best Buy and Target it gets two of the largest brick-and-mortar retail chains in the country. \nLeEco will continue to provide incentives to customers who purchase products through LeMall by offering them rebates. All customers who purchase a new phone or TV from LeEco before January 5th will also receive a free subscription to AT&T’s new DirecTV Now streaming service. \nLeEco products will be available from the aforementioned retailers starting December 1st. \nFiled in Web .

      "text": "Job searches for digital native giants Amazon, Facebook and Google trump long-standing favorites, including Nike.\nThat’s according to the report “The War For Talent 2016: Organizing For Success in the Digital Age,” produced by L2 Inc.\nAs marketers transform their organizations for the digital age, building a skilled workforce can be an uphill battle. Brands must compete with major technology companies, agencies, and each other to recruit and retain top digital talent.\nHalf of marketers do 75% or more of digital work in-house. \nWhile priorities multiply, vast digital skills gaps prevail. Over half of client-side marketers say their organizations have talent gaps in areas including e-commerce, technology, and user experience. And only 3% believe technologies are aligned across organizations. Marketers today are tasked with preparing their organizations for the biggest shift (such as analog to digital) in the consumer and retail world in the last 50 years. \nThere has been an explosion in the number of individuals at large consumer enterprises with “digital” or “e-commerce” in their titles. The number of Chief Digital Officers rose 237% in just one year, from 965 in 2015 to 3,255 in 2016.\nIn the last year, Procter & Gamble is up 19%, L’Oréal is up 58% and Unilever is up a staggering 70%. This demonstrates the reach of “digital” beyond marketing, e-commerce, and communications to effectively every function. There has also been an increasing number of individuals with “omnichannel” in their titles. In the last year, L’Oréal and Estée Lauder have both added nine omnichannel titles to their roster and Unilever has added 10 — up from just two in 2015.\nAccording to the study, \"the winners will be those brands that build out content ecosystems with the sophistication and agility necessary to leverage targeting and personalization technology.”\n“Amazon masters this — sending out highly targeted emails at incredible scale — a content model just not feasible with the current structure of most organizations,” says Ariel Meranus, an L2 research associate. \nIt’s clear that brand, specifically a reputation as a tech innovator, makes a company attractive to top tech talent.\n“It’s no surprise that top digital talent finds these companies attractive. They have revolutionized the workplace environment — Google, who makes massive investments in human capital (compensation, on-site food, training) has been ranked number one on Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work for” seven times,” Meranus says. \nAs a result, digital talent tends to flow between digitally native technology companies while brands look on from the sidelines.\n“While it is notoriously difficult for brands to recruit from digitally native companies, there has been a pattern of brands successfully doing so by offering positions on the senior leadership team,” Meranus tells Marketing Daily . “The war for talent has re-shaped the allocation of human capital across industry. The quarterback and prom queen of yesterday find themselves sitting alone at the reunion as people line up to get a selfie with the captain of the chess team who started a SAAS firm.\"",

      "text": "Boding well for the broader “smart-speaker” market, Amazon sold 5.1 million Echo devices to U.S. consumers since late 2014, per Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Better yet, awareness of Amazon Echo among U.S. Amazon customers increased dramatically in the past 12 months, the research firm finds.\nCIRP estimates that for U.S. Amazon customers, awareness of Amazon Echo increased to 69% as of September 30 of this year -- up from 20% as of March 31 of 2015.\n“Amazon continues to expand Echo, introducing two new models this year, the Dot and Tap,” Josh Lowitz, cofounder and partner at CIRP, notes in a new report.\n“Amazon also promotes it heavily, with special pricing on multiple Echo device purchases and Echo devices bundled with compatible speakers and home automation devices. Amazon also offers deals available only to Amazon Prime members exclusively through Echo,” it added.\nCustomers use Amazon Echo for various purposes, with one-third using it as an information provider responding to questions, and over 40% as an audio speaker listening to streaming music.\n“Our research shows that more than half of Echo owners use the device as more than a voice-controlled music speaker,” added Lowitz. “Users report asking about weather and news, and increasingly controlling other connected devices.”\nCIRP bases its findings on surveys of 3,500 U.S. subjects who made a purchase at Amazon.com in the period from January of 2015 through September 2016.",

      "text": "Chinese tech company LeEco had its US launch last month , with most of its products available online via its LeMall website . This week, however, you’ll be able to buy them from US-based retailers, including Best Buy, Target, and Amazon.\nTechCrunch reports that LeEco will begin selling its smartphones and televisions via third-party sellers starting December 1st. This includes the $399 LePro 3 smartphone, which received LePositive reviews by Lauren Goode for its looks, speedy software, and competitive pricing. (Note that the products will be sold online only, they’re not yet available in stores.)\nThough LeEco products will be available through those third-party retailers, the company is incentivizing customers to buy directly from LeMall by offering rebate deals ranging from $80 to $200. Buyers are also eligible for a free subscription to DirecTV Now if they buy a TV or phone from LeMall before January 5th.",

Here’s a deal available today you might find interesting. The deal is titled “ up to 40 percent off Irwin hand tools .” But, as per usual, one offers an even greater value: Normally $16, this #1 most popular wire stripper is 49 percent off today (Photo via Amazon) \nThe other bargains aren’t too shabby either. Especially considering that, like the wire stripper, this bar clamp is the most popular of its kind in the Amazon marketplace: Normally $35, this #1 most popular bar clamp is 37 percent off today (Photo via Amazon) \nAnd in pure monetary value, this pliers set is the best deal, at $30 off: Normally $88, this 8-piece pliers set is 35 percent off today (Photo via Amazon)",

      "text": "Amazon may introduce a new Alexa-powered speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen early next year, according to reports from Bloomberg.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET Are you considering giving the Amazon Echo as a gift this holiday season ? You may want to wait as a report suggests that Amazon may be preparing to introduce a new high-end voice-activated speaker with a touch screen early next year.\nThe Seattle-based online retailing giant may be readying the new Echo-like speaker with a touch screen in the first quarter of 2017, according to Bloomberg . Instead of the cylindrical design of the current Echo speakers, which uses the voice-activated Alexa assistant, this new device is expected to have a seven-inch touchscreen that tilts upward so users can see it when it sits on a counter or when they're standing. \nThe new device, which is expected to use the same operating system as the Kindle Fire tablet, is supposed to make it easier to access content, such as recipes, weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, two people familiar with the new product told Bloomberg. \nThe speaker itself will be larger, offering better sound quality than Amazon's current slate of speakers. It's also likely to be more expensive than existing products, which range in price from $50 for the Dot to $180 for the Echo. Amazon did not respond to CNET's inquiries for comment and declined Bloomberg's request for a comment.\nAmazon's Echo has been facing competition from Alphabet's Google Home speaker . And may soon go up against Apple , which is also rumored to be building a home device using its Siri digital assistant. A new touchscreen device could be Amazon's attempt to stay ahead of competition and differentiate itself from the pack.\n ",

      "text": "Did you know that you can hire a company to write glowing recommendations about the products your business sells on Amazon.com, regardless of whether they bought them or not? You can. And, unfortunately, more than a few merchants use this deceitful tactic to bolster their products' ratings.\nNot anymore, says Amazon.\nJust in time for the peak holiday buying season, the online giant announced a change in policy that will limit customers to only five reviews a week for \"non-verified\" purchases - in other words, items that Amazon cannot confirm were purchased on its site or those given to customers at a huge discount in exchange for positive feedback.\nAs reported in the Digital Reader, a group of \"prolific reviewers\" received an email from Amazon telling them that they're welcome to leave as many reviews as they want for products that they actually buy on the site, but would now be limited for all others. The policy doesn't apply to books, music and video.\n\"The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00am UTC through Saturday 11:59pm UTC,\" said spokeswoman Angie Newman via an email to Geekwire. \"We're always innovating on behalf of our customers and shoppers consistently tell us that they value reviews from other shoppers who they know have purchased the product on Amazon.\"\nAmazon says the vast majority of reviews are authentic, but the company admits fake reviews are growing too fast. That's why, according to Geekwire, the company recently filed suit against a bunch of businesses that allegedly sell fake reviews as well as the companies that bought them. In addition to these actions, the company is also now giving more weight and visibility to verified customer reviews with written comments.\n(Amazon.com chief executive Jeffrey P.

      "text": "Lenovo K6 Power launched in India carrying a price tag of Rs. 9,999 Amazon employee jumped from building after emailing CEO Bezos Moto M is set to launch in India soon \nLenovo launches K6 Power smartphone in India, Apple said to be working on 10 prototypes of iPhone 8, Amazon employee jumps off building after emailing the CEO, and more top tech news of the day in your 360 Daily. \nLenovo K6 Power with 4000mAh battery launched in India Lenovo K6 Power smartphone, whose highlight is the 4000mAh battery, was launched in the Indian market at a price of Rs. 9,999. Available exclusively on Flipkart starting 12pm IST on December 6, the Lenovo K6 Power has a 5-inch full-HD screen, 1.4GHz octa-core Snapdragon 430 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB internal storage, 128GB microSD card support, 13-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel front camera, and a fingerprint sensor. \nApple working on more than 10 iPhone 8 models? Apple is reportedly working on over 10 prototypes for iPhone 8 , the model that will be launched in the tenth anniversary year of the launch of the original iPhone. The company is widely expected to unveil at least one variant with OLED screen, but apparently the OLED panel prototype is just one of the prototypes and no decision has been reached yet. Amazon worker jumps off company building after email to CEO An Amazon employee was injured in what seems to be an attempted suicide by leaping off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters. Before jumping, the individual wrote an email to hundreds of colleagues, including CEO Jeff Bezos , complaining about how the company handled a transfer request he had put in. The man survived the fall from the 12-story building and was taken to a Seattle hospital.\nMotorola teases Moto M smartphone’s India launch Lenovo-owned Motorola has teased the launch of the metal-bodied Moto M smartphone in India with a tweet saying “Something different is coming your way.” The smartphone was unveiled in China earlier this month at CNY 1,999 (roughly Rs. 19,700), but the company’s India division has not said anything about the price yet. Moto M has a 5.5-inch full-HD screen, Android 6.0 Marshmallow software, 2.2GHz MediaTek Helio P15 processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB internal storage, up to 128GB microSD card support, 16-megapixel rear camera, 8-megapixel selfie camera, and a 3050mAh battery. \niOS 10.1.1 reportedly causing battery life issues for some iPhone users Apple’s support forum has been flooded with complaints by users writing to the company about their iPhone's battery life since updating the device to iOS 10.1.1 . While some users said that the battery life dies out after reaching 30 percent level, others claim that the entire battery life drains out in around two hours without any active usage. A user who contacted Apple Support said he was informed that the engineering team is working on a fix. \nReliance Jio user base crosses 50 million Reliance Jio’s user base has crossed 50 million in just 83 days. This translates to roughly 1,000 customers per minute (since September 5) and 6 lakh per day.",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Amazon May Launch Alexa Fueled Echo Speaker With 7-inch Touch Display Next Year Amazon took the consumer electronics world by storm two years ago with the debut of its Echo speaker, which is powered by the Alexa intelligent digital assistant. The Alexa/Echo family has since grown to include the pint-sized Echo Dot and the portable Amazon Tap . During that time, Alexa’s skillset has also ballooned to over 5,500 skills .\nAccording to a new report, it looks as though Amazon is ready to take the next step in the evolution of the Echo speaker by adding a large touch screen. The new Echo’s 7-inch display will reportedly be capable of tilting so that it is readable in varied environments, even while sitting on a kitchen countertop. It’s also said that the device will feature vastly superior speakers than those available on the first-generation Echo. \nThe new Echo, which is being developed under the codename “Knight”, is expected to use a modified version of FireOS , which underpins everything from Amazon’s Fire TV streamers to its Fire tablets. The device will of course respond to spoken commands and will allow users to “pin items such as photos on their speaker’s screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door,” according to Mark Gurman. \nAmazon has increasingly come under attack in the home-centric digital assistant market over the past year. The most recent competition has come from none other than Google , which is heavily promoting its Home speaker . Apple is also said to be working on its own home digital assistant companion that would interface with all of your Apple devices and of course leverage the Siri digital assistant. \nThe new touch screen-infused Echo speaker will reportedly be announced during the first quarter of 2017.",

      "text": "If the Top Gear of old was considered to be the best car show... in the world, then we're not quite sure what that makes The Grand Tour – because Jeremy Clarkson and co's new show is seriously popular. The hotly-anticipated series, which finally dropped on November 18, is officially an impressive three times more popular than any other Amazon series before it. According to The Wrap(quoting Symphony Advanced Media, who track this kind of thing), The Grand Tour wiped out The Man in the High Castle's opening figures in the US, after its premiere episode attracted a grand total of 1.95 million viewers in the 18-49 age range – crucial to US advertisers. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it, BBC (is what we imagine Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May would say). Before the trio managed to totally dominate Amazon, the history drama The Man in the High Castle was leading the way, with 637,000 viewers for its season one premiere. Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan's Catastrophe came in behind it, with 274,000 watching its debut episode on Amazon. Kicking off its run in its new online home only a couple of weeks ago, The Grand Tour has been scoring numerous rave reviews. And it's a good job everyone's enjoying the ride so far, as Jezza, the Hamster and Captain Slow have earned a pretty penny from the brand new outing. Or at least, that's what Netflix will have you believe. The Grand Tour is available to stream exclusively on Amazon Prime, with new episodes every Friday. ",

      "text": "  Amazon ,   \nHere's a sign of just how far the tablet market has fallen: Bloomberg reports that what is arguably Amazon's next tablet is not going to be called a tablet: \nAmazon.com Inc. is developing a premium Echo-like speaker with a screen, a sign the world’s largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple Inc. \nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced. \nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said. \nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon’s new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment. \nAside from the quality of the speakers, Bloomberg pretty much described Amazon's current tablets. They got Alexa in a recent update , and while I'm told they don't support all Alexa features they do come close. \nBut not close enough for Amazon, apparently. \nNo, the Seattle retailer also wants the new device to carry the Echo brand and share its focus on voice activation and home automation. The current Fire tablets are more media devices than anything, and the Fire brand limits both how people think of the gadgets as well as how much Amazon can charge for them. Share this:",

      "text": "Amazon is stepping up its fight against counterfeit products sold through the website, Bloomberg said on Tuesday. The report comes in the wake of a lawsuit Apple filed against an accessory-maker earlier this year when the Cupertino-based company claimed a large number of Apple-branded products sold on Amazon were indeed fake.\nBloomberg said on Tuesday that it’s a “major goal” to cut back on counterfeiters in 2017. As it should be; the news outlet describes several instances where businesses get the short end of the stick after Amazon begins selling knock-off products. It’s not good for consumers, either, who think they’re buying quality products from one company — like charging accessories from Apple — but are ultimately buying products created by firms that likely have little or no quality assurance. That can be particularly dangerous if products such as chargers and batteries are involved.\nLast month, Apple said that it bought 100 “Apple” products on Amazon and discovered that 90 percent of them were fake. At the time, Amazon said it has “zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on the site” and that it “[works] closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.”\nThe increase in counterfeit goods has also affected Amazon’s ability to secure business from potential partners. Bloomberg said the online retailer hit a wall to sell sports merchandise from the NFL and MLB because the leagues felt Amazon wasn’t able to verify legitimate products against fakes.\nAmazon plans database to cut down on counterfeiters Amazon’s plan is to create a database of registered retailers, Bloomberg explained, wherein companies will provide proof to Amazon that they have the rights to sell products direct to consumers through the Amazon marketplace. That should start to eliminate companies, like the one selling faux Apple chargers, from listing their wares on the site. That might not be enough.\nThe problem, as described by merchants speaking with Bloomberg , is that once the counterfeiters can be relentless in their ability to quickly re-appear after Amazon shuts them down. One expert suggested that consumers are just as guilty of helping them prosper.\nIndeed, if we as buyers stop buying the cheaper counterfeit goods, we can help drive them out of business. The problem, as was the case with Apple products, is that it’s not always easy to figure out what’s fake and what isn’t.\nLet’s hope Amazon is able to fix that next year.\n\n\nSource : Bloomberg ",

      "text": "\"The loggers are better equipped than we are\" * Photo essay at http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB\nBy Stephen Eisenhammer\nNOVO PROGRESSO, Brazil, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon.\nAn agent of Brazil's environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there.\nHe walked away rather than watch it burn.\nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot.\nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil's vast northern state of Para.\nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognized by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows.\n\"The loggers are better equipped than we are,\" said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. \"Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.\"\nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming.\nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil's 65 percent share of the world's largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again.\nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil's worst recession in decades.\nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down.\nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year.\nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear.\nA 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel.\n\"We haven't even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,\" said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60).\nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival.\nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies.\n\"I only trust around half the people I work with,\" Barroso said.\nSoldiers of military police approach a suspect during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging, conducted by agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino NEW STRATEGY\nBrazil's environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama's ability to operate.\nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany.\nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed.\n\"The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,\" said Everton Lucero, the government's undersecretary for climate change.\nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective.\nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012.\nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming.\nNow, there is a sense that Brazil's target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles.\nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say.\nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalized.\nAn agent of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, intercepts a man driving a truck loaded with tree trunks during an operation to combat illegal mining and logging, in the municipality of Novo Progresso, Para State, northern Brazil. REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino PIONEERS\nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy.\nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast.\nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil's Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch.\nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil's drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s.\nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil's borders. Many also got rich in the process.\nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier.\n\"This was all trees when I arrived,\" he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. \"I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.\"\nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering.\nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighboring Mato Grosso state as \"huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.\"\nNow, it is Brazil's largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world's largest exporter of beef and soy.\nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer's government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth.\nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle.\nNO JOBS\nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft.\nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged.\nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence.\nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by.\n\"There is nothing else,\" said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be \"pushed into crime.\"\nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labor, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop.\nPereira's future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber.\n\"I'll have to let them know,\" he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. \"I hope they understand.\" Click on http://reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay\n(Additional reporting by Ueslei Marcelino in Novo Progresso and Anthony Boadle in Brasilia; Editing by Kieran Murray)",

      "text": "E-Commerce & Online Payment Technologies Overview & Trends \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nAmazon is tightening its grip on the total US retail market with its shoppers now so loyal that they're less inclined to make purchases from competitors at all, according to a report from Feedvisor and Walker Sands. \nThis trend is likely to continue as Amazon adds perks to its Prime membership program, which could encourage more existing Amazon shoppers to join, thereby intensifying their loyalty even further. \nUS Amazon shoppers are much less likely to consider outside options. Amazon customers stay close to home: In fact, 95% of US Amazon customers had made a purchase from the marketplace in the last year as of summer 2016, according to the report. Most notably, this encompasses Amazon's general customer base including Prime and non-Prime members, heightening the threat that the e-commerce giant poses to traditional retailers. \nThey shop other retailers, but less often: Indeed, 61% of Amazon customers have purchased something from a brand or retailer's website like Walmart or Gap in the past year. This isn’t likely enough to make much difference to these retailers, which still rely heavily on brick-and-mortars for revenue. And as Amazon continually pulls shoppers out of stores, it’s likely the e-commerce giant will further drag sales from these websites. Other online marketplaces are far behind: When it comes to online-only marketplaces, Amazon far outstrips competitors. Just 33% of Amazon shoppers had made a purchase on eBay within the past year, and only 3% on Jet.com. \nAmazon should be leveraging its Prime program to boost loyalty even further. Amazon Prime members are fiercely loyal to the company, accounting for nearly 60% of its total GMV in 2015, according to Deutsche Bank, cited by Business Insider. Given the loyalty shown by non-Prime members, marketing the membership program's numerous perks could help Amazon create an entire e-commerce ecosystem that minimizes the need for shoppers to look at other merchants. \nAmazon is continually making Prime more attractive. Most recently, Amazon rolled out its Seller Fulfilled Prime program , which allows third-party merchants to make inventory eligible for Prime two-day shipping without using Fulfillment by Amazon, letting vetted sellers ship items on their own via another carrier (i.e. FedEx, USPS). \nThis program will greatly increase the number of Prime-eligible items for sale, as well as overall Prime sales, especially as Amazon reports that 50% of all sold units come from third-party merchants. As Amazon widens its addressable consumer audience via merchant adoption, we expect to see more customers sign up for Prime and join Amazon's user base, helping the e-commerce giant to increasingly eat away at competitors' market share. \nThe parcel delivery industry — a segment of the shipping sector that deals with the transportation of packages to consumers — is booming thanks to e-commerce growth, and players outside the industry want a piece of the pie. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the future of shipping that looks at efforts by Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart to handle more of their own shipping and concludes that big retailers are well positioned to disrupt the parcel industry. \nHere are some of the key points from the report: Transportation and logistics could be the next billion dollar opportunity for e-commerce companies. The global shipping market, including ocean, air, and truck freight, is a $2.1 trillion market, according to World Bank, Boeing, and Golden Valley Co. There is much at stake for legacy shipping companies, which have seen a boom in parcel delivery as e-commerce spending has risen. Twenty different partners currently share the duties of shipping Amazon's 600 million packages a year, with FedEx, USPS, and UPS moving the most. Amazon, Alibaba, and Walmart have so far focused on building out their last-mile delivery and logistics services but are increasingly going after the middle- and first-mile of the shipping chain. Amazon has already made major moves across each stage of the shipping journey. It launched same-day delivery service, which it handles through its own fleet of carriers, cutting out any third-party shippers. The company also recently began establishing shipping routes between China and North America. Walmart's interest in expanding its transportation and logistics operations is almost purely related to cost-savings. It's begun leasing shipping containers to transport manufactured goods from China and is making greater use of lockers and in-store pickup options to cut down on delivery costs. Alibaba has begun leasing containers on ships, similar to Amazon's Dragon Boat initiative. This means that Alibaba Logistics can now facilitate first-mile shipping for third-party merchants on its marketplace. \nIn full, the report: Sizes the market for the shipping industry. Explains how the industry operates in broad terms. Suggests why major e-commerce retailers should disrupt the space. Outlines the shipping initiatives of Amazon, Walmart, and Alibaba. Concludes how these moves might impact traditional carriers. \nInterested in getting the full report?

      "title": "Getting the Most from Amazon Sponsored Products",
      "text": "November 29, 2016 • Rob Sieracki \nIn “ Are Amazon’s ‘Sponsored Product’ Ads Worth It? ,” my post last month, I addressed the basic workings and worth of Sponsored Products. In this article, I’ll review tips for getting the most from Sponsored Product ads, both for experienced users and first time advertisers. Start with Auto Bidding \nWhen you launch campaigns in Amazon, you have a choice between “Automatic targeting” and “Manual targeting.” Amazon offers “Automatic targeting” and “Manual targeting” for its ad campaigns. Automatic targeting is better, initially, because it is difficult to know what search terms will match your products in Amazon Sponsored Products. \nStart with automatic targeting. Per Amazon’s official notes in Seller Central, when you choose “Automatic targeting” for your campaign, you automatically bid on the top relevant searches based on your product information. With “Manual targeting,” you bid on the keywords you choose. \nAutomatic targeting is better because it is difficult to know what search terms will match your products in Amazon Sponsored Products advertising, even if you have done it for a while. \nOnce you launch automatic-targeting campaigns, you can start analyzing search data, which Amazon will provide. In Amazon’s Campaign Manager, click on your Automatic Bid campaign and you’ll find the “Download Search Term report” in the center of the page, above the bids of your ad groups. \nFrom the Search Term Report page, pull down a report of your search data immediately, or schedule reports to run on a regular basis. On the Search Term Report page, you can manually pull down a report of your search data immediately, or schedule reports. Click image to enlarge. \nMine that data for the search terms that perform well. Filter for the terms that led to product sales. Use that data for “Manual targeting” campaigns, to secure more profitable traffic. Bid Levels \nThere is an indirect benefit to Amazon Sponsored Products that may affect your bidding strategy. \nFor context, consider the big picture. Unlike Google, a company that primarily makes money when ads are clicked, Amazon primarily makes money when products are sold. Until you sell a few items of a new product listing, Amazon does not go out of its way to list your product prominently in search results. That makes sense — for Amazon. When you launch a new product, Amazon does not have a lot of data to go on. Predictable revenue and predictable “profit per pixel” is important to Amazon. \nSponsored Products can jumpstart a new product’s visibility by establishing predictable sell-through rates for your product. \nIf you’re buying traffic with Sponsored Product advertising and, consequently, Amazon shoppers buy your product, Amazon gets data much faster on your product’s sell-through rate. If Amazon is aware that your product sells well once traffic hits your product page, it makes sense for Amazon to trust you with more prominence in its search results. \nThis indirect benefit to Amazon Sponsored Products affects bidding strategy. When you factor in how the ads help your overall Amazon program, you perhaps can afford higher bids when products are new, and float the bids down over time. ‘Peel-and-stick’ Strategy \nNot all search queries you target have the same value to you, even if they are triggered by the same keyword. A peel-and-stick strategy can make the best out of less valuable traffic. \nReview your search queries and remove (or “peel” ) them out of any ad group to put (or “stick”) them in their own ad group. This is true not only for search queries that are clear winners and that sell your products well, but also for underperforming search queries. Put failing or mediocre search queries in more flattering situations, so they profitably add sales to your account. \nTwo primary options accomplish this: (a) Peel and stick to use more appropriate bids; and (b) Peel and stick to use more appropriate product landing pages. \nPeel and stick for bids. Here’s an example that demonstrates appropriate bids for underperforming traffic. \nImagine that you’re bidding on “merino sweater” phrase match in Amazon Sponsored Products. Most of the time the traffic sells through on your product page very well. \nHowever, imagine that Kohl’s, Under Armor, and Banana Republic also sell merino wool sweaters, and your Sponsored Products intercept their traffic at times — but not all that profitably to you. \nImagine that when someone types one of those brand names plus “merino sweater” your Sponsored Product ad shows. Because you offer an attractive product, occasionally you do sell through if someone clicks on your ad. This is true even though searchers clearly started out looking for another brand. You’re making money off this traffic. The opportunity could be significant if properly harnessed. However, the return on ad spend is not enough to justify the ad cost — the numbers on the Search Query Report show this. \nIn this situation, the peel-and-stick strategy offers a solution. Peel the underperforming brand search queries out of that original ad group, and stick them in a new ad group. Bid less on the new keywords than you are in the original ad group, to improve return on ad spend. Use negative keywords in the original ad group to block the brand traffic there, so that only your new ad group will show ads on the brand traffic. \nPeel and stick for landing pages. Continuing the sweater example, imagine still that you’re bidding on “merino sweater” phrase match and, again, most of the traffic is quite profitable. \nThe product you are sending your phrase match “merino sweater” ad to is a gray, crew cut, men’s merino sweater. \nNow imagine that some of the traffic isn’t converting well because very specific adjectives modifying “merino sweater” in the search queries. Here are three examples. “ v-neck merino sweater” “ blue merino sweater” “merino sweater for women “ \nPeel each of these queries out and stick it into a new ad group of its own. Again, use negative keywords in the original ad group to block the unwanted traffic there, so that only your new ad group will show ads on these specific search queries. Reset the page for each product to an appropriate product you sell: a v-neck sweater, a blue sweater, or a women’s sweater. \nIt’s valuable to try landing page variants even if there isn’t a clear mismatch, as in the example above. \nSay that you sell mattresses. If you send all of your Sponsored-Product-mattress traffic that doesn’t specify mattress size to a queen-size mattress landing page, instead try sending to a full-size mattress for a while, to see if that sells better. \nLanding page variants like that can make a difference in conversion rates, thus improving your profitability with the Amazon Sponsored Products program.

The speaker will still host Alexa, the company's digital voice assistant. \nThe idea behind the touchscreen, a first for the Echo line, is to allow users to access news stories or weather reports more easily. The report also says the speaker will be larger and tilt upward for standing users. It's not clear whether there will be an option to tilt the tablet to a desired angle. \nThe high-end version would sit alongside a variety of Alexa-enabled speakers: the standard Echo, a portable Tap where users access Alexa by tapping on the top of the speaker, and the smaller, more affordable Dot, which boasts a smaller, built-in speaker but can plug into devices with more powerful sound. \nThe Echo has kickstarted the market for digital voice assistants, which grows more crowded with competitors including Google Assistant and Apple's Siri. Samsung is reportedly working on its own digital assistant. \nMeanwhile, Amazon faced its first big rival in the home speaker space this year, as Google rolled out Google Home. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly working on its own home speaker that will host Siri.",

      "text": "0 \nEarlier this year, Amazon launched the Echo Dot so that it could offer a low-cost way to get its Alexa voice assistant. Now the company may be planning a premium Echo device at the opposite end of the spectrum. \nAmazon is said to be working on a new Echo speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen. That’s according to Bloomberg , who added that the speaker will be larger and support being tilted upward so that you can more easily see the display while the Echo is on a counter. \nThis new, premium Echo will reportedly also include better speakers for improved audio over the standard Echo. \nFinally, the new Echo is expected to run Amazon’s Android-based Fire OS and include support for pinning things on the device’s screen. \nAmazon is aiming to release its premium Echo in early 2017, says today’s report. There’s no word on how much the device will cost, but the regular Echo is priced at $179.99 , so a premium model with a touchscreen will likely cost a bit more. \nThe Echo was a surprise when Amazon first launched it , but the device seems to be doing relatively well. Now Amazon appears to be filling its Echo family up with devices for every price range, and this new premium Echo would fill out the top end. With an improved speaker and a touchscreen, it sounds like Amazon would want this device to be the center of the kitchen and the family, functioning as a digital assistant that also offers a refrigerator door-like display that you can stick notes, photos, and more to.

      "title": "Amazon’s next Alexa-powered device will reportedly come with a touchscreen",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nSo far, Amazon has released three devices powered by its Alexa service — the Echo, Tap, and Echo Dot. All of these offer the same basic functionality in different form factors, basically functioning as speakers that can also serve as the hub of the user’s smart home. This similarity across devices looks like it won’t last forever, though, as the firm’s next Alexa-powered product could feature a touchscreen, according to a report from Bloomberg . \nThe device’s touchscreen will reportedly measure seven inches and would be powered by a modified version of FireOS, the operating system powering Amazon’s Fire tablets and Fire TV devices. The product would be the largest yet of any of Amazon’s Alexa-powered offerings, and would tilt upward to be easily seen when placed on a kitchen counter. \nMore: Amazon has introduced an Alexa skills marketplace \nKeeping with this kitchen theme, Amazon is said to be working on a feature that would allow users to pin photos to the device’s display, similar to pinning photos on a refrigerator with magnets. Bloomberg’s sources say that the form factor and touchscreen will make it easier to use the device to access information like news, weather forecasts, and calendar appointments. \nDespite the touchscreen, the new device would still have a strong focus on audio, as the Alexa Voice Service is the key to all of Amazon’s smart home products. The product is also rumored to feature high-quality speakers, which would make it a better choice for listening to music than any of the company’s current offerings. \nMore: What can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house \nThis isn’t the first time we’ve heard of such an offering coming from Amazon. Earlier this year, rumors surfaced that the company was working on a product code-named “Knight,” which was said to have a touchscreen. Whether this is that product getting closer to market or a wholly different product isn’t clear. \nAmazon’s newest product could ship as soon as early as 2017, but so far there has been no word on pricing, other than that it will be more expensive than the company’s $180 Echo.

It’s expected to be larger than the current generation Echo speaker.\nA few other key details include the possibility that the new speaker will feature Amazon’s Android-based Fire OS on board and that the touchscreen will allow users to pin items for easier access. The new speaker will also reportedly boast better speakers than what’s in the current Echo, which should improve audio quality.\nThe current Echo is priced at $179.99 from Amazon, but there’s no word on how much the new premium Echo will cost. The report points to a launch some time in “early 2017,” but no exact dates have been pinned down just yet.\nDepending on price, would you consider picking up the new premium Echo?",

As Amazon sells out of their stock these will be fulfilled by 3rd party vendors at a higher cost. I just ordered 2 pairs at this price and at the time I ordered they were still available in sizes 7 - 11. Please note that Crocs does not sell in 1/2 sizes so you'll need to round up to the next closest full size. \n",

Now, Amazon is poised to up its game with a new Alexa-enabled speaker that includes a 7-inch touchscreen, according to a report by Bloomberg .\nThe report, which cites a pair of anonymous sources, claims that Amazon's new hub will feature the sizable display in an effort to make things like calendar management and browsing weather forecasts easier. This would obviously be a shift in Amazon's Alexa strategy, which up until now has been solely focused on voice control and conversational dialogue. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nSamsung has started to turn the Galaxy Note 5 into the Note 7 Leak reveals another key Galaxy S8 feature that has never been seen before on an iPhone There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it ",

      "text": "\nWhen China-based LeEco announced it was going to start selling its smartphones in the US earlier this fall, it made the decision to go with the “flash sale” business plan. It only let people purchase its products in the space of a few hours. Apparently that plan didn’t work well so LeEco is now ditching the flash sale for a more traditional online US retail business model.\nSee also: LeEco Le Pro3 review 5 days ago Starting today, the company’s LeMall.com web store is now open permanently in the US. Furthermore, it will sell the LeEco Le S3 and Le Pro3 smartphones and smart TVs at Amazon, Target and Best Buy starting on Thursday, December 1. This is definitely a switch for the business and it may show that it realizes that sales tactics that may work in China don’t necessarily work the same in the US.\nThis news comes as the company is also dealing with reports that its financial status is not quite on solid ground, although it did report recently that it raised $600 million in new financing. The company is one of several China-based smartphone makers that are trying to break through into the US market in 2017. Having its products sold 24 hours a day at big retail chains certainly won’t hurt, but it still remains to be seen if LeEco will stand out from this already crowded field.",

      "text": "Checkout by Amazon Is Going Away, Welcome Pay With Amazon Amazon is discontinuing a major feature and replacing it with something new and innovative. Co-founder and CEO, Ignite Visibility @ johnelincoln WRITE A COMMENT \nHave you heard that Checkout by Amazon (CBA) is going away? \nIf not, and you're relying on CBA for payments, then you're going to need to make some changes. \nFortunately, Amazon has given you plenty of advance notice about the upcoming change. You'll have more than enough opportunity to prepare your site so that you can still receive payments with Amazon. \nHere's what you need to know about Amazon discontinuing CBA. Important Dates \nOn April 1, 2017, customers on your website will no longer be able to use CBA to pay for products or services. \nIf you currently use CBA on your site, you have until August 1, 2017 to ship any orders paid for with the service. \nCustomers have until December 31, 2017 to ask for refunds from vendors who use CBA. After that, requests for refunds will no longer be honored. \nOn January 1, 2018, Amazon will stop supporting CBA completely. Pay With Amazon \nJust because Amazon is scrapping CBA, that doesn't mean the company is getting out of the payment processing business completely. Amazon is effectively replacing CBA with a new service called Pay with Amazon . \nAt this point, Amazon is encouraging sellers who use CBA to migrate to the new service. If you're one of the merchants who needs to migrate, the company promises to support you every step of the way. \nIf you're a \"bottom line\" type and you'd like to know what the new service will cost you, it's a processing fee of 2.9% of the total purchase price plus an authorization fee of 30 cents. You'll also have to pay taxes where applicable. \nThat's only for domestic purchases, though. The cross-border processing fee is 3.9%. \nBasically, a $10 order from a U.S. citizen will cost you 59 cents. The same order from a Canadian citizen will cost you 69 cents. Benefits of Pay With Amazon \nSo what are the benefits of Amazon's new payment service? There are several of them. \nFor starters, you get inline address and payment widgets that keep focus on your website. If you've worked with other payment processors in the past, you might have noticed that some of them do a poor job of keeping the customer on your site. Pay with Amazon is a cut above those other options. \nAlso, Pay with Amazon handles recurring payment options. So if you're selling a service online that requires monthly renewals, Amazon will handle the monthly payment processing for you so you can focus on more important things. \nPay with Amazon is also optimized for mobile sites. That's a must-have in this day and age. \nFinally, Amazon's new service also supports payment for digital products. That means if you're selling a non-physical item that doesn't require shipping, like Software-as-a-Service , you can offer your customers a Pay with Amazon option. Implementing Pay With Amazon \nSo what do you have to do to implement Pay with Amazon on your website? That depends on your platform. \nPay with Amazon supports the following hosted platforms: Shopify 3dcart Lemonstand \nIf you're not using one of the hosted platforms listed above, you can still use Pay with Amazon on your website. Amazon offers a button generator that you can use to create a \"Pay with Amazon\" button . Then, you can just add that button code to your website on the checkout page. \nIf you require something more sophisticated (i.e., you need to use the Pay with Amazon API features), you should take a look at the Pay with Amazon integration guide. \nThe bottom line: Amazon will accommodate you no matter how your site is set up. You just might need to enlist the aid of some professional developers to make it happen. The Important Part: Getting Paid \nSo how do you get paid once you've made the switch to Pay with Amazon? \nFor starters, money will still go to the bank account that you've set up with Seller Central . So you don't have to worry about configuring a new bank account or entering the specifics of the same bank account all over again. \nTypically, you'll receive your first payment about two weeks after you set up your Pay with Amazon account. After that, you should see money go into your account on a daily basis. \nOf course, the caveat there is that Amazon holds back some money on reserve. That's just in case customers request a refund. Amazon also uses some of the reserve to handle A-to-z Guarantee claims. \nIf you've been using CBA, then you're probably already familiar with the concept of a reserve. Rest assured you'll get that reserve money back after you've made the switch to Pay with Amazon. \nYou won't get it back quickly, though. Amazon will hold on to it for 90 days just in case any loose ends need to be tied up. After that time, your CBA reserve money will be refunded to you. A Key Difference \nWhile CBA handled order management, Pay with Amazon is focused on payment processing . That means you won't be able to manage orders with the new service. \nPay with Amazon keeps track of what you charged a customer (including shipping and handling). However, the service doesn't provide order details, such as shipping subtotals and sales tax. You also won't see reports about how many items a customer purchased. \nBasically, you need to think about Pay with Amazon as a tool that streamlines how you collect money and not a tool that handles your entire order process. FAQ - A Few More Things You Might Want To Know \nWhat follows are some frequently asked questions about the Pay with Amazon service. Do I Have to Create a New Account? \nYes, your CBA account won't automatically become a Pay with Amazon Account. You can sign up for Pay with Amazon by going to the Amazon Payments page and clicking on the \"For Merchants\" button. Will Pay With Amazon Calculate Sales Tax? \nNo, Pay With Amazon doesn't calculate sales tax. That's just one way that the new service is different from CBA. \nIf you need to calculate sales tax, you'll have to find a separate tool to do that. Will Amazon Tell My Customers About the New Service? \nNo, Amazon has no plans at this time to notify your customers that CBA will soon end. Amazon also won't notify your customers about the Pay with Amazon service. How Long Does It Take to Integrate Pay with Amazon? \nThe answer is an all-too-familiar one: it depends. \nIf you need a sophisticated integration that requires API, it will take longer (and probably cost more) than more simplistic integration options. \nOn the other hand, if you're on a hosted platform, such as Shopify, then integration should be a snap because many of those e-commerce sites natively support Pay with Amazon. Will There Be a Change to How My 1099-K Form Is Calculated? \nNo, the change in payment processing doesn't affect how your 1099 income is calculated. \nAlso, if you've agreed to receive your 1099 form electronically, you'll still receive it that way when you switch to Pay with Amazon. Does My CBA Balance Transfer to Pay With Amazon? \nNo, balances don't transfer between the two accounts. Instead, your existing CBA balance will be deposited into your bank account of choice 90 days after you close out the account. How Do I View CBA Reports After I've Switched to Pay With Amazon? \nYou'll still access your CBA account via Seller Central as long as it remains open. It's a great idea to download all your reports as you move away from CBA permanently so that you have hard copies of your final transactions. How Do I View My Pay With Amazon Reports? \nYou'll also see your Pay with Amazon reports in Seller Central. Can I Use the Same Email Address? \nYes, you can use the same email address to sign up for Pay with Amazon that you used to sign up for CBA. Will I Receive a New Merchant ID? \nIf you use the same registration information for Pay with Amazon that you used for CBA, then your merchant ID will stay the same. Your keys for authentication will also remain the same. What Happens to My CBA Account After I Sign up for Pay With Amazon? \nYou can manually close your CBA account by contacting Amazon's support team. Alternatively, you can leave your account open and it will be automatically closed later when Amazon terminates the service. Can I Continue to Use CBA After I Sign Up With Amazon? \nYou're allowed to close out your outstanding CBA orders and manage refunds associated with the account. Once you've completed those orders, you're free to close the CBA account. What's the Timeline for Chargebacks Under the Pay with Amazon Program? \nYou have five days to respond to A-to-z Guarantee claims and 11 days to respond to chargebacks. Can I Still Use My Old CBA Button? \nNo. Amazon wants you to use the new Pay with Amazon buttons. Remember, your CBA button will no longer work after April 1, 2017.  ",
