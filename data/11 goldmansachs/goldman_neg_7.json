      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is planning to name investor and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary, opting for an industry insider with no government experience to helm the agency in charge of the nation's finances, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMnuchin (pronounced mah-NEW-chin) joined Trump's whirlwind campaign in May as finance chairman, despite the fact that he had never worked in politics and that he had donated to Democrats in the past. He quickly earned Trump's trust as he worked closely with the Republican National Committee to raise substantial amounts of money in a short period. On policy issues, he was instrumental in crafting the details of Trump's proposal to overhaul the tax code.\n\"He's an expert on finance issues,\" said Stephen Moore, who worked with Mnuchin as an adviser to the president-elect on the campaign trail. \"He clearly, like Donald Trump, understands that the number one goal for this administration is going to be to grow the economy and get jobs.\"\nThe president-elect scored an early victory Tuesday night when air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier announced that it would reverse plans to move one of its factories from Indiana to Mexico. The company, which is owned by United Technologies, said about 1,000 U.S. jobs would be preserved.\nTrump's tough talk on trade during his campaign helped cement his populist appeal. But Trump - a real estate developer famous for his flashy style - appears to be staffing his Cabinet with advisers who also have amassed extraordinary wealth. Trump is expected to nominate industrialist billionaire Wilbur Ross to lead the Commerce Department, and Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos was named as Trump's pick for education secretary last week.\nMnuchin made his fortune on Wall Street, first at the storied New York investment bank Goldman Sachs and then as the head of his own private-equity fund. His close ties to an industry he would be in charge of regulating have the potential to complicate his confirmation and could undermine Trump's populist message.\nWith Treasury candidate Mnuchin come possible conﬂicts Ylan Q. Mui and Renae Merle A leading candidate to be President-elect Donald Trump 's treasury secretary was deeply involved in running a bank that has received $900 million in federal bailout money and that has been accused of discrimination - examples of the potentially thorny conflicts of interest that could plague Trump's...\nA leading candidate to be President-elect Donald Trump 's treasury secretary was deeply involved in running a bank that has received $900 million in federal bailout money and that has been accused of discrimination - examples of the potentially thorny conflicts of interest that could plague Trump's...\n(Ylan Q. Mui and Renae Merle) While on the stump, the president-elect frequently lambasted big banks - Goldman Sachs in particular - and advocated the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall legislation that once separated retail and investment banks. In addition, Mnuchin was deeply involved in running a bank that had been at the heart of the subprime housing bust, eventually selling it for billions of dollars in profit.\n\"So much for draining the swamp,\" said Adam Hodge, communications director for the Democratic National Committee. \"Trump is already heading into office as the most corrupt, conflicted and unpopular president-elect in history, and now he's breaking his signature promise to the voters who elected him.\"\nAs treasury secretary, one of Mnuchin's top priorities probably would be shepherding Trump's tax plan through Congress. Trump has advocated cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and streamlining individual tax rates into three brackets. Although Republican lawmakers have expressed enthusiasm for reform, there remains substantial debate over how to tackle corporate profits overseas, among other issues. In addition, key GOP senators are advocating for a more bipartisan approach that probably would require complex negotiations with Democrats.\nTrump selects Chao for transportation secretary, Rep. Price to head HHS Tribune news services Reaching deep into conservative territory, President-elect Donald Trump chose Georgia Rep.

Tom Price to oversee the nation's health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce \"Obamacare\" critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare. Trump selected another veteran Republican, Elaine...\n(Tribune news services) \"I think he's extremely knowledgeable about taxes,\" Moore said. But, he added, \"most members of Congress don't know who he is.\"\nIn news interviews, Mnuchin has said he was not previously close to Trump, but the two move in the same circles of big-money financiers, willing to take big risks in the face of improbable odds. Trump's campaign was just the latest big bet in Mnuchin's varied career in the upper echelons of finance, which has stretched from New York to Hollywood.\nWorking at Goldman Sachs was a family affair for Mnuchin. Before he worked at the Wall Street giant, his father, Robert Mnuchin, spent more than 33 years at the bank. His brother, Alan, was a Goldman Sachs vice president.\nMnuchin spent 17 years at the bank, rising from its savings-and-loan business to mortgage-backed bond trading before becoming the bank's chief information officer in 1999. Mnuchin is a \"very smart guy,\" Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said this month.\n\"He was a very senior guy at a very young age at Goldman Sachs,\" he said.\nBlankfein said that Mnuchin reported to him when he ran the fixed-income division but that they haven't spoken much in recent years. \"I'm sure he stayed just as smart as he was when he was at Goldman,\" he said.\nAfter leaving the bank, Mnuchin worked for famed billionaire investor George Soros - a well-known Democratic donor. He then founded his own private-equity fund, Dune Capital Management. Among its most notable investments was the purchase of IndyMac from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.\nDune led the consortium of investors who bought the failed subprime lender for about $1.6 billion, and Mnuchin oversaw the rebuilding of its business as chairman of the renamed OneWest. (A member of Trump's economic advisory team, John Paulson, was also part of the investor group.)\nUnder Mnuchin, the bank more than doubled its branches and increased its assets. But it also faced criticism from advocacy groups who complained about aggressive foreclosure tactics. At one point, activists marched to Mnuchin's home in the Bel Air area of Los Angeles to protest its treatment of customers.\nAs treasury secretary, Mnuchin would be responsible for the Trump administration's response to the aftermath of the housing bust. A crisis-era program that helps homeowners refinance their mortgages, for example, is not scheduled to end until next year. He also would head the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees some of the country's largest financial institutions.\n\"Putting a Wall Street CEO in charge of his administration's oversight of Wall Street is dangerous and even more proof that Donald Trump is only interested in protecting corporations at the expense of working families,\" said Jessica Mackler, head of American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic political action committee.\nIn 2014, OneWest was sold to financial services firm CIT Group for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin is on CIT's board of directors but is not involved in day-to-day operations. He owns about $100 million in company stock, according to compensation research firm Equilar.\nAfter moving to California with the purchase of IndyMac, Mnuchin also became involved in financing Hollywood films. Dune Capital invested in several blockbusters, including \"American Sniper,\" \"Gravity,\" \"Avatar\" and \"Life of Pi.\"\nThe Washington Post's Renae Merle contributed to this report.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Real Estate Steven Mnuchin Donald Trump Democratic Party John Paulson United Technologies Corporation Lloyd Blankfein",

      "title": "&apos;Populist&apos; Trump fills Cabinet with billionaires and Wall Street tycoons",
      "text": "Donald Trump has named Steve Mnuchin — a Goldman Sachs alum and hedge fund manager — to be his secretary of the Treasury, in keeping with his repeated promise to take on Wall Street and the powers-that-be on behalf of the little guy.\nSo can we stop pretending that Trump's campaign \"populism\" was anything other than just one more con?\nIt isn't just the next Treasury secretary. Recently on CNBC, Mnuchin outlined his people-centered plan for the country's economy.\n\"Our number one priority is tax reform,\" he said. \"We think by cutting corporate taxes we'll create huge economic growth and we'll have huge personal income so the revenues will be offset on the other side.\"\nAt last, a Republican administration that believes in the wonder-working power of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy! If only George W. Bush had known about that, we would have had spectacular growth through the 2000s and the Great Recession never would have happened. Oh wait — this is exactly the economic program Bush pursued, to such disastrous effect.\nWhen will white working-class Trump voters see the scam? Paul Waldman While we're still analyzing the election results and debating the importance of different factors to the final outcome, everyone agrees that white working-class voters played a key part in Donald Trump 's victory, in some cases by switching their votes and in some cases by turning out when they...\nWhile we're still analyzing the election results and debating the importance of different factors to the final outcome, everyone agrees that white working-class voters played a key part in Donald Trump 's victory, in some cases by switching their votes and in some cases by turning out when they...\n(Paul Waldman) In fact, Mnuchin has a direct connection to the recession: while it was unfolding, he and other investors bought IndyMac, a purveyor of the kind of shaky mortgages that fed the crisis. After foreclosing on thousands of homeowners, Mnuchin and his partners sold the company and made billions. As Ben Walsh describes it in Huffington Post:\n\"Steven Mnuchin's takeover of IndyMac is a story about everything Americans have come to hate about how the financial crisis was allowed to unfold ― ordinary people panicking, savvy investors pouncing, a government guarantee that saved a bank but didn't even try to keep people in their homes, a clever rebranding, rampant foreclosures, billions of dollars in profits.\"\nMnuchin is just one appointment, though, right? Well, Trump also just announced that his Secretary of Commerce will be Wilbur Ross, a billionaire private equity investor. And his Secretary of Education will be Betsy DeVos, a billionaire opponent of public schools. And his Transportation Secretary will be Elaine Chao, who served in the administrations of both George Bushes and is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Before entering politics she was a banker, and according to Politico, \"She made at least $1,074,826 from serving on boards of directors in 2015, according to public records.\" Trump is also reportedly considering Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn to be his budget director. \"It's the most conservative [Cabinet] since Reagan,\" says one supply-sider, and that may be an understatement.\nYou may remember Trump's closing ad of the campaign, in which he said, \"Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people\" over images of Wall Street, piles of money, financiers like George Soros , and other symbols of established power and wealth. \"It's a global power structure,\" he went on, \"that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\"\nDemocrats, don't fall for Trump's infrastructure promises Ronald A. Klain As the White House official responsible for overseeing implementation of President Barack Obama 's massive infrastructure initiative, the 2009 Recovery Act, I've got a simple message for Democrats who are embracing President-elect Donald Trump 's infrastructure plan: Don't do it. It's a trap. Backing...\nAs the White House official responsible for overseeing implementation of President Barack Obama 's massive infrastructure initiative, the 2009 Recovery Act, I've got a simple message for Democrats who are embracing President-elect Donald Trump 's infrastructure plan: Don't do it. It's a trap. Backing...\n(Ronald A. Klain) So in order to take on that global power structure, Trump is hiring a bunch of billionaires and Wall Street tycoons, cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy, scaling back regulatory oversight of Wall Street, and offering an infrastructure plan that consists mostly of tax breaks to corporations to encourage them to build projects that they'll then charge the public tolls in order to use.\nYet the myth of Trump the populist persists. Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to Trump and perhaps the party's foremost advocate of trickle-down economics, recently proclaimed, \"Just as Reagan converted the GOP into a conservative party, Trump has converted the GOP into a populist working-class party.\" His trips to the Rust Belt with Trump, Moore testified, made him realize just how much help the working class needs. And he intends to help Trump deliver that help - in the form, of course, of tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. What a heartwarming tale.\nRepublicans have always struggled with a quandary presented by their economic ideology, which is that it's difficult to get majority support for a set of policies intended to shower benefits on a small portion of the population. When they argue about it explicitly they use a kind of rhetorical redirection, claiming that cutting rich people's taxes isn't really about rich people at all, but is actually intended to help the middle class and even the poor. The rich themselves are merely a vehicle to accomplish this noble end, unselfishly accepting the government's largesse on behalf of their lessers.\nNeedless to say, there are only so many people you can persuade with that argument. So in order to compensate, Republicans have complemented their economic case with a menu of social issues with which they can demonize their opponents. Those Democrats hate America, Republicans would say, they're weak, they don't love God the way you do, they want to take your guns, they want to force your kids to get gay abortions. Often enough, it worked.\nDonald Trump's Cabinet could be wealthiest in modern history Jim Tankersley, Ana Swanson When George W. Bush assembled his first cabinet in 2001, news reports dubbed them a team of millionaires, and government watchdogs questioned whether they were out of touch with most Americans' problems.

Bush assembled his first cabinet in 2001, news reports dubbed them a team of millionaires, and government watchdogs questioned whether they were out of touch with most Americans' problems. Combined, that group had an inflation-adjusted net worth of about $250 million - which is roughly...\n(Jim Tankersley, Ana Swanson) Trump said most of those things in the 2016 campaign, but you could tell that he was just going through the motions, ticking off the boxes to reassure ideological conservatives that they didn't have anything to worry about. The true beating heart of his appeal was a slightly different kind of culture war, one based on rage and resentment at cultural change and the declining status of working class white men. With his attacks on immigrants, racial minorities, and an \"establishment\" of Washington politicians and economic powers-that-be, Trump convinced them that it was finally their turn: their turn to say whatever they want, their turn to have their interests put first, their turn to see their communities revived and their pride restored.\nBut now, Trump is filling up his administration with, guess what, Washington politicians and representatives of the economic powers-that-be, whose top priorities are tax cuts, deregulation, and destroying the safety net, including the privatization of Medicare. The idea that they'll be laboring to serve the interests of the working class is a joke. Yet it's a joke people somehow keep telling with a straight face.\nWashington Post\nPaul Waldman is a contributor to The Plum Line blog, and a senior writer at The American Prospect.\nCaption Trump picks retired Gen.

      "text": "By Tomi Kilgore, MarketWatch\nGoldman's stock has added 284 points to the Dow's 838-point gain since the election\nShares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled back Friday from a nine-year high, but were still by far the biggest beneficiary of the Trump rally within the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nThe bank/broker's stock (GS) dropped 1.4%, to pace the Dow decliners Friday, but it has still soared 22.8% since Donald Trump became President-elect (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-stocks-keep-climbing-as-data-oil-price-surge-boosts-rates-2016-11-30). It had closed Thursday at the highest level since Dec. 3, 2007, which was months before (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jp-morgan-to-buy-bear-stearns-for-2-a-share)the start of the financial crisis.\nThe next biggest Dow winner was fellow financial heavyweight J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), whose shares have run up 16.5% since the election.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/3iaIANHm8Sh)\nWhat makes a Republican sweep of the White House and Congress so attractive for bank investors is that Trump and his pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have expressed interest in rolling back the Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted after the financial crisis to stop banks from using clients deposits to back bets made for the bank's own trading accounts. Basically, Wall Street loves a looser regulatory environment.\nSee also: Trump Treasury pick Mnuchin could profit from bill to reduce bank supervision (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-treasury-pick-mnuchin-could-profit-from-bill-to-reduce-bank-supervision-2016-12-02).\nTreasury yields have climbed sharply, on the belief that Trump's promises to boost infrastructure spending could boost economic growth, lift inflation, and increase the supply of Treasurys by growing the government debt. And rising longer-term interest rates can goose bank profits by increasing what they earn by funding longer-term loans with shorter-term borrowings.\n\"These could drive higher loan growth and net interest margin, lower expenses, and reduction in capital; to a lesser extent, potential for some increase in fee income,\" analyst Vivek Juneja at J.P. Morgan wrote in a recent note to clients. \"All our banks should benefit from these changes.\"\nAnd as MarketWatch columnist Brett Arends has pointed out (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/when-will-trump-voters-realize-theyve-been-had-2016-12-02), four of the people named to Trump's inner circle have ties with Goldman.\nGoldman's stock price gain of $41.44 since the election added about 284 points to the Dow, which would account for about 34% of the Dow's 838-point gain. Add in J.P. Morgan's stock price gain of $11.57 -- worth about 79 Dow points -- and the two banks have accounted for 43% of the Dow's gain.\nAmong other bank sector heavyweights, shares of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) have rocketed 24.9% since the election, compared with the SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund's (XLF)13.3% rally. Elsewhere, shares of Morgan Stanley (MS) have shot up 22.7%, of Wells Fargo & Co. have climbed 17.7% and of Citigroup Inc. have rallied 12.2%.\nDon't miss: Bank of America's stock rally is far from over, analysts say (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-americas-stock-rally-is-far-from-over-analysts-say-2016-11-29).\nElsewhere in the Dow, the third biggest postelection winner was UnitedHealth Group Inc. shares (UNH), which have run up 12.5%, followed by Caterpillar Inc.'s stock (CAT), up 22.4%.\nThe biggest Dow loser was Visa Inc.'s stock (V), which has shed 8.6%. Coca-Cola Co.'s stock (KO) has lost 5.9% since the election and Procter & Gamble Co. shares (PG) have slid 5.8%.\n-Tomi Kilgore; 1710ET\n ",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo 1MDB scandal: Singapore to ban former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner\n\nSingapore plans to ban former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner from its securities industry for 10 years as it investigates the 1MDB Malaysian investment fund scandal.\nLeissner, who left Goldman Sachs in February, was sanctioned because he issued an unauthorised reference letter on behalf of Low Taek Jho, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement on Friday.\nMalaysian financier Low has been linked to alleged attempt to syphon billions from the development fund. He has denied the allegations.\nIn the letter, Leissner falsely claimed that Goldman performed due diligence tests on Low.\n\"These statements were untrue and were made by Leissner without Goldman Sachs' knowledge or consent,\" the MAS statement said.\nThe 1MDB scandal has been described as one of the largest in financial history. Billions were allegedly siphoned from the fund into personal bank accounts, including some belonging to Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the Malaysian authorities.\nGoldman made around $600 million in fees in 2012 and 2013 selling a total of $6.5 billion in bonds for 1MDB, its most lucrative deals anywhere in the world at that time.\nLeissner, Goldman's key Southeast Asia deal-maker, was placed on leave by the bank and has since left it.\nThe letter cited in the MAS announcement was written by Leissner to help Low open an account in a Luxembourg bank. The account is not believed to have been opened. Low opened hundreds of bank accounts around the world, including Switzerland and Singapore, where he funnelled money taken from 1MDB, according to US, Swiss and Singaporean investigators.\n\"Today's announcement refers to a matter we discovered in January of this year and identified as a clear violation of the firm's standards,\" Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg. \n\"At that time we promptly took steps to separate Leissner from the firm and reported the matter to regulatory authorities in several jurisdictions, including Singapore. We continue to cooperate with the MAS.\"\nLeissner has previously denied any wrongdoing. A lawyer for Leissner said his client had not been aware of any planned regulatory action by Singapore against him, the Wall Street Journal reported. Leissner has now been invited by Singapore authorities to respond and looks forward to doing so, the lawyer added.\nRelated Articles \n1MDB scandal: Malaysian state fund confirms it has defaulted on $1.75bn bond 1MDB: Anger grows at Najib Razak as Malaysia's opposition unites behind Mahathir Mohamad Leonardo DiCaprio's charity urged to repay donations linked to 1MDB Malaysian fund scandal 1MDB scandal: Singapore to ban former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner",

      "text": "Swamp or no swamp, Goldman swims on The investment bank’s network reaches the White House, again Consider just this very partial list: Henry Fowler, Robert Rubin, and Hank Paulson, former US Treasury secretaries. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Mario Draghi, European Central Bank president. Malcolm Turnbull, prime minister of Australia. Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve bank. Romano Prodi, former Italian prime minister. Josh Bolten, former White House chief of staff. Robert Zoellick, former president of the World Bank. \nBefore or after these men had their turn with the levers of power, they worked for Goldman Sachs . No other company can boast such an alumni network with anywhere near this level of influence on world affairs. It seems the pattern will be not be broken under a Trump administration. The president-elect has tapped Steven Mnuchin , a former partner at the investment bank, to be his Treasury secretary. \nPut aside, for a moment, the political implications of Mr Trump’s choice . There are good reasons why Goldman has the network it does, and there are reasons to be glad a Goldmanite will be in the cabinet. It is very hard to succeed at Goldman. Those who do tend to be hard working and competent, and to have a good understanding of financial markets. \nMORE:",

But on Wall Street, Cohn’s presence in the gold-accented lobby represented something much bigger: One of the world’s most important banks is making its way back into Washington’s inner circle.\nPopular Searches Bank of America Corporation BAC\n▼ 21.23 -0.27 -1.26% Credit Suisse Group AG CSGKF\n▼ 13.44 -0.23 -1.68% Amazon.com Inc AMZN\n▼ 740.34 -3.31 -0.45% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT\n▲ 70.88 +0.21 +0.30% After years on the sideline, Goldman Sachs, and the rest of the Wall Street elite, is poised to come roaring back.\nTrump has already picked several Goldman Sachs alums for several key positions. Steven Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of the bank, is slated to be the next Treasury Secretary and Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, worked on mergers and acquisition deals for Goldman Sachs. Hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci began his career at the New York bank and has emerged as one of Trump’s closest advisers on his presidential transition. According to Politico, Cohn, a 26-year veteran of the Goldman Sachs, is being considered for a position heading the Office of Management and Budget.\nGoldman Sachs’ sometimes controversial relationship with Washington goes back decades. One of its founders, Henry Goldman , advised on the creation of the Federal Reserve. President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose Goldman CEO Sidney Weinberg to serve on the War Production Board during World War II. And more recently, President Bill Clinton named former Goldman co-chairman Robert Rubin to head the Treasury Department. George W. Bush picked Henry Paulson, another Goldman alum for the same job.\nEach in turn filled the government ranks with so many more former Goldman executives that the bank eventually earned the nickname “Government Sachs.”\n“The Goldman organization has always been able to make sure they are close to power, they are very good at cultivating and maintaining relationships,” said Christopher Whalen, head of research for Kroll Bond Rating Agency.\nTrump’s elevation of so many Goldman alums may signal a wider shift in Wall Street’s public standing, which has been battered since the 2008 financial crisis, industry analysts say. Even Trump played to public distrust, releasing a television ad that flashed an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein as the Republican candidate warned of a “global power structure” that was robbing American workers.\nThe public’s resentment towards Goldman Sachs was so deep that Blankfein initially demurred when asked who he would vote for. “I don’t want to help or hurt anybody by giving them my endorsement,” Blankfein, who has previously supported Hillary Clinton, told CNBC.\nWall Street insiders widely expected to be largely left on the sidelines if Hillary Clinton had won the White House. They felt Clinton would have found it difficult to resist pressure by progressives in the Democratic Party that she be tough on Wall Street.\n© Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images Goldman Sachs president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn arrives for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday. But the tone has shifted since Trump’s election. “After Nov. 8, you could say the financial crisis was over,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst and managing director with global boutique brokerage firm CLSA. “It was a pivot from rebuilding the banking industry to using banks to better facilitate better economic growth.”\nThat has some progressive groups crying foul. “These guys are galactic deal-makers, transaction merchants, not people who face the extraordinary littleness of life,” said Bart Naylor of Public Citizen. “They also know each other, attend each others’ weddings, buy each others Hamptons’ mansions … When it comes to financial policy, they know about spreads and liquidity, but not about what you can’t buy with food stamps or changes in bus schedules.”\nGoldman Sachs is no stranger to such talk. The bank has been best known as a secretive, Wall Street dealmaker with the ear of the White House. It helps big institutions and billionaires bet on the markets and large corporations raise money, but until recently had little interaction with average investors — clients must have at least $10 million for its wealth-management services.\nBut in recent years it has tried to soften its image. It has launched programs to help women entrepreneurs, produced regular podcasts, and earlier this year offered a high-yield online savings accounts for those with as little as $1.\nIf Trump taps Cohn, currently the bank’s president, for a position in his administration, it would send Goldman scrambling to find a replacement. Cohn, who has been at the bank since 1990, has been widely viewed as heir apparent, poised to become CEO when Blankfein retired.\n“Throughout its 147-year history, Goldman Sachs has encouraged its employees to give back to the community while they are working here and after they leave,” said Jake Siewert, communications director at Goldman. “We are proud that many have gone on to serve their country and their communities after they have left.”\nGo to MSN Home",

But on Wall Street, Cohn’s presence in the gold-accented lobby represented something much bigger: One of the world’s most important banks is making its way back into Washington’s inner circle.\nAfter years on the sideline, Goldman Sachs, and the rest of the Wall Street elite, is poised to come roaring back.\nTrump has already picked several Goldman Sachs alums for several key positions. Steven Mnuchin, a 17-year veteran of the bank, is slated to be the next Treasury Secretary and Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, worked on mergers and acquisition deals for Goldman Sachs. Hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci began his career at the New York bank and has emerged as one of Trump’s closest advisers on his presidential transition. According to Politico, Cohn, a 26-year veteran of the Goldman Sachs, is being considered for a position heading the Office of Management and Budget.\nGoldman Sachs’ sometimes controversial relationship with Washington goes back decades. One of its founders, Henry Goldman , advised on the creation of the Federal Reserve. President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose Goldman CEO Sidney Weinberg to serve on the War Production Board during World War II. And more recently, President Bill Clinton named former Goldman co-chairman Robert Rubin to head the Treasury Department. George W. Bush picked Henry Paulson, another Goldman alum for the same job.\nEach in turn filled the government ranks with so many more former Goldman executives that the bank eventually earned the nickname “Government Sachs.”\n“The Goldman organization has always been able to make sure they are close to power, they are very good at cultivating and maintaining relationships,” said Christopher Whalen, head of research for Kroll Bond Rating Agency.\nTrump’s elevation of so many Goldman alums may signal a wider shift in Wall Street’s public standing, which has been battered since the 2008 financial crisis, industry analysts say. Even Trump played to public distrust, releasing a television ad that flashed an image of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein as the Republican candidate warned of a “global power structure” that was robbing American workers.\nThe public’s resentment towards Goldman Sachs was so deep that Blankfein initially demurred when asked who he would vote for. “I don’t want to help or hurt anybody by giving them my endorsement,” Blankfein, who has previously supported Hillary Clinton, told CNBC.\nWall Street insiders widely expected to be largely left on the sidelines if Hillary Clinton had won the White House. They felt Clinton would have found it difficult to resist pressure by progressives in the Democratic Party that she be tough on Wall Street.\n© Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images Goldman Sachs president and chief operating officer Gary Cohn arrives for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York on Thursday. But the tone has shifted since Trump’s election. “After Nov. 8, you could say the financial crisis was over,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst and managing director with global boutique brokerage firm CLSA. “It was a pivot from rebuilding the banking industry to using banks to better facilitate better economic growth.”\nThat has some progressive groups crying foul. “These guys are galactic deal-makers, transaction merchants, not people who face the extraordinary littleness of life,” said Bart Naylor of Public Citizen. “They also know each other, attend each others’ weddings, buy each others Hamptons’ mansions … When it comes to financial policy, they know about spreads and liquidity, but not about what you can’t buy with food stamps or changes in bus schedules.”\nGoldman Sachs is no stranger to such talk. The bank has been best known as a secretive, Wall Street dealmaker with the ear of the White House. It helps big institutions and billionaires bet on the markets and large corporations raise money, but until recently had little interaction with average investors — clients must have at least $10 million for its wealth-management services.\nBut in recent years it has tried to soften its image. It has launched programs to help women entrepreneurs, produced regular podcasts, and earlier this year offered a high-yield online savings accounts for those with as little as $1.\nIf Trump taps Cohn, currently the bank’s president, for a position in his administration, it would send Goldman scrambling to find a replacement. Cohn, who has been at the bank since 1990, has been widely viewed as heir apparent, poised to become CEO when Blankfein retired.\n“Throughout its 147-year history, Goldman Sachs has encouraged its employees to give back to the community while they are working here and after they leave,” said Jake Siewert, communications director at Goldman. “We are proud that many have gone on to serve their country and their communities after they have left.”\nGo to MSN Home",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs: 2017 Will Turn Bearish On “Trump Fear”",
      "text": "  07:58 AM EST Goldman Sachs: 2017 Will Turn Bearish On “Trump Fear” \nFrom Tyler Durden : Having been on the fence about an upside case for the S&P for the greater part of 2016, Goldman’s chief equity strategist David Kostin finally threw in the towel earlier this week. \nThat was when, as we reported, Goldman raised its S&P price target from 2,100 (as of year end 2016) to 2,400 for mid-year 2017 on what it calls “Trump Hope” (as apparently does everyone else, see “ The World Has Changed” – Average S&P Target Before Trump: 2,087; After Trump: 2,425 “), which it then sees dipping to 2,300 by year-end 2017 on “Trump Fear.” \nHaving explained what “Trump Hope” means before, here is a quick recap of what “Fear”, according to Goldman Sachs whose former partner Steve Mnuchin will be running the US Treasury, looks like: by mid-2017 inflation will reach the Fed’s 2% target, labor costs will be accelerating at an even faster pace, and policy rates will be 100 bp higher than today. Rising inflation and bond yields typically lead to a falling P/E multiple. Congressional deficit hawks may constrain Mr. Trump’s tax reform plans and the EPS boost investors expect may not materialize . Potential tariffs and uncertainty around other policy positions may raise the equity risk premium and lead to lower stock valuations in 2H. \nAnd here are the details, where as Goldman politely puts it, is where the “devil is to be found.” \nFirst , as Goldman warns, while investors have been focusing on the prospect of a lower statutory corporate tax rate, the firm’s US economist Alec Phillips notes that it will likely come with provisions that will offset much of the benefit of a lower rate. For instance, under the House Republican plan, several corporate tax incentives, such as the interest expense deduction, would be repealed. Furthermore, the plan proposes a redefinition of foreign and domestic income based on where sales, rather than production, occurs. Furthermore, under Mr. Trump’s plan, the deficit as a percentage of GDP would jump from 3.2% in 2016 to 5.0% in 2017 and 6.1% in 2018. The annual deficit will rise from a projected $590 billion in 2016 to $960 billion in 2017 and $1.2 trillion in 2018. Our US economics team has a more restrained baseline forecast that projects the deficit as a percentage of GDP will be 3.4% in 2017 and 4.0% in 2018 while the deficit will total $650 billion in 2017 and $800 billion in 2018. \nSecond , another key risk of President-elect Trump’s proposed economic policies is higher inflation. Realized measures of inflation have steadily risen in recent months. Core CPI now stands at 2.2% while core PCE, the Fed’s preferred inflation metric, has risen to 1.7% from 1.3% last year (see Exhibit 24). At the same time, reduced labor market slack has supported wage growth and our GS Wage Tracker stands at 2.6%, its highest level post-crisis (see Exhibit 25). \nThird , the bond market has started to price in a macroeconomic landscape of higher inflation and interest rates. Ten-year forward inflation expectations rose by 20 bps to 1.9% in just two weeks following the election (see Exhibit 26). Higher expected inflation has pushed 10-year nominal interest rates to 2.3%, an increase of 50 bp in just a few weeks. Looking forward, Goldman’s Economics team and the market expect bond yields will rise in 2017. Additionally, Goldman expects the short end and long end of the yield curve will rise faster than currently priced by the market (see Exhibit 27). In other words, the Fed is now behind the curve, pardon the pun. \nFourth , with the 10Y yield coming just shy of 2.50% on Thursday, financial conditions as dictated by the bond market are tight enough to start pressuring stocks. Recall that as Goldman also explained last week, “a rise in US bond yields above 2.75% would create a more serious problem for equity markets: at that point we would expect the correlation between bonds and equities to be more positive – i.e., any further rises in yields from there would be a negative for stock returns.” \n\nFifth , as inflation expectations and yields rise, Goldman expects higher realized inflation and interest rates will restrict any S&P 500 valuation expansion during 2H 2017. The S&P 500 forward P/E has already increased by 71% since September 2011, growth surpassed only by the 1987 cycle (112%) and the Tech Bubble (115%). Historical P/E expansion cycles are usually accompanied by falling interest rates and falling inflation while Goldman now projects both bond yields and inflation will rise during the next several years (see Exhibit 28). Although the S&P 500 trades at roughly fair value relative to history given core CPI of 2.2%, higher inflation is typically associated with a lower forward P/E multiple (see Exhibit 29). \nSixth , higher bond yields are usually associated with a lower forward P/E multiple. Since 1976, the average forward P/E multiple when the 10-year US Treasury ranges between 2% and 3% is 14.2x. However, the S&P 500 currently trades at 17.1x forward bottom-up consensus EPS and we expect some downside risk to the multiple as bond yields continue to rise during 2017. \nSeventh, and last , despite Goldman’s recent bout of euphoric optimism, predicated only by the outcome of a presidential election which, as Goldman itself said, is very much unclear, the firm clearly admits that, and we quote, “S&P 500 valuation is stretched relative to history on nearly every fundamental metric. At the aggregate level, the S&P 500 index trades at the 85th percentile of historical valuation relative to the past 40 years. For portfolio managers, the more important fact is that the median S&P 500 company trades at the 98th percentile of historical valuation (see Exhibit 33).” \n… So you’re saying there is a 2% chance? \nJoking aside, one quick look at the table below shows that the market would be the most overvalued ever if it wasn’t for just one metric: Free Cash Flow Yield. Well, don’t look for cash flows to go up once interest rates start rising, as they are doing right now. \nAnd yet, despite all of the above, Goldman is telling its clients to buy all those stocks which Goldman’s prop traders (because as we now know, despite Volcker, Goldman has been quietly cultivating an army of prop traders just for this purpose ) are actively dumping.To wit: \nWe expect the 10-year US Treasury yield will end 2017 at 2.75% and the yield gap will narrow to 285 bp. The resulting earnings yield would equal 5.6%. Applying a P/E of 18x to our 2018E adjusted EPS estimate of $129 implies a S&P 500 index level of roughly 2300. \nIn retrospect, there is a reason why Goldman calls its clients “muppets.” \nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( NYSE:SPY ) closed at $219.68 per share on Friday, up $0.11 (+0.05%). Year-to-date, the largest ETF tied to the S&P 500 index has gained 7.75%. \n  ZeroHedge   Related Stocks:",

      "text": "Tell your story. Twitter \nYour resume was strong enough to get you to the interview – now it’s time to bring it to life. Avoid walking through every bullet point, but instead, turn your experiences into a compelling story that reflects who you are, what you have done and how you have made an impact . Craft a clear and concise message that demonstrates you have the skills, judgment and drive to do the job. \nInterviewers are looking for a pattern of behavior, given that can serve as a strong indicator of how you will perform. So, to support your narrative, provide specific examples from your past. Share an experience that demonstrates how you’ve overcome adversity or a challenge and what you learned from the process. Before the interview, think about your strengths and weaknesses and understand how they relate to this opportunity. Of course, don’t forget the interview is not only about highlighting your individual capabilities, but also proving you’re a team-player who works well with others. Do your research. Reuters \n“Winging it” is not an effective strategy to land your next job. There’s information everywhere, go and get it (corporate websites, annual reports, press coverage, social media, people in your network who work at the company). Know the company that you’re interviewing with – what’s their business, how do they speak about their culture, what are recent initiatives they’ve undertaken. Beyond the company, also understand the industry – how it’s doing, what are the trends, challenges and opportunities and how are competitors performing. \nBe ready to answer the question – “ why do you want to work here ” – and offer a response that’s more thought out than “ it seems like a great place to work .” Show you understand the bigger picture and what’s happening in the macro environment and demonstrate your appreciation of the organization’s culture. And lastly, describe both your qualifications and your passion for doing this job at this company. Ask questions, and listen. Wikimedia Commons \nAn interview should not be a one-way conversation, it should be an exchange . Ask thoughtful questions that show you’re prepared and looking to learn more about the company, the team and the role. By asking questions along the way and helping drive the conversation, you’re more likely to make a connection with the interviewer and leave a positive impression. And, after you’ve asked a question, be sure to listen. It’s tempting to start thinking about what you’re going to say next, but stay focused. You stand to learn a lot by listening to your interviewer’s insights and experiences. Be authentic. Flickr / Nan Palmero \nOne of the most important things you can do is to be yourself . Sometimes, candidates can sound overly rehearsed or act in a certain way because they think that’s what the interviewer wants. Remember, the interview process should help you determine whether your values align with the company’s values , and so if you feel the need to put on an “interview persona”, that may be a sign it’s not the right match. \nIf you’re interviewing for a job that is new and different from what you’ve previously done – embrace those differences rather than try to convince the interviewer you’re an expert in something you’re not. Companies value varied backgrounds and experiences because that’s what enables them to expand their expertise and create new solutions. Don’t forget the basics. Reuters/Cheryl Ravelo \nIn a competitive environment, being smart and having a strong resume may not always be enough. So, what else counts? Sometimes, it’s the “little things” that can differentiate you . Companies are looking to hire people who will thrive in their corporate culture, and so showing that you are a thoughtful, collaborative and collegial person can be just as important as demonstrating your technical skills. \nAn interview is about more than just giving answers to questions – it’s also about the impression that you make. Here are some of the “little things” that matter: • Arrive on time • Be friendly to everyone you meet • Know the dress code • Pay attention to your body language • Send a thank you email or note \nIn the end, remember that an interview is just a conversation (an important one, of course). While preparation and good presentation are key contributors to your success, it’s really about having an exchange and determining whether it’s a good fit for both you and the company. Get to know your interviewers, and help them get to know you by telling your story and sharing what you hope the next chapter will be. ",

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher About an hour ago \nThe collapse of a Goldman Sachs junior at 2.30am shows banks have yet to solve their overwork problem.  en/267307/teen-hedge-fund-manager-jacob-wohl-stirs-controversy-rbs-to-ax-investment-bankers/ \nIn theory, banks are reformed employers. – Since the death of intern Moritz Erhardt in 2013, most have imposed limitations on junior bankers’ working hours and tried to make the job of analysts less arduous. In reality, the hours in banking can still be grueling. \nThe very recent collapse of a junior Goldman Sachs banker at 2.30am shows just how grueling. Reuters reports that a Goldman junior came into the office despite being unwell in order to work on a live deal. At 2.30am he “broke down” and a doctor was called. Goldman is reportedly asking its staff to take their own health more seriously as a result. \nIt’s unlikely that Goldman’s entreaty will make much difference. A famous study by Alexandra Michel, an ex-investment banking associate-turned assistant professor of management and organisation at the University of California, found that young bankers abuse their bodies as they become socialized into working hard and compete against others and themselves . – Extreme working goes deeper than a simple edict from the bank ordering juniors to stop. The latest case of analyst overwork also illustrates the limitations of banks’ existing attempts to cut working hours : they don’t apply when a deal is live and by placing restrictions on working hours at weekends they encourage longer hours midweek. Interestingly, the junior in question was based in Frankfurt: as we’ve said before, it’s not just analysts and associates in New York and London who drive themselves into the ground. \nSeparately, while banks like Deutsche warn of miserable cash bonuses for managing directors this year, senior staff at U.S. investment banks in the City of London are in luck. The Financial Times points out that they could get 17% more cash this year thanks to the depreciation of sterling against the dollar. Unfortunately, bonus pools are likely to be down around 15% anyway, so at best they’ll probably be flat. Meanwhile: \nDeutsche is cutting 3,400 clients from its equities sales and trading division with immediate effect . (WSJ) \nBarclays is closing down the energy desk within its macro trading division and will be redeploying those resources elsewhere. (Reuters) \nMembers of Trump’s team are growing concerned that the administration is attracting too many Goldman Sachs alumni, but joining Trump would have advantages of Gary Cohn: he’d be able to sell his Goldman Sachs shares without a big tax bill, saving himself $12m. ( Bloomberg) \nSteve Schwarzman, will chair the Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. Jamie Dimon and Laurence Fink will also sit on the panel. ( Bloomberg) \nHedge fund chases individual who made a ‘defamatory’ comment on Dealbreaker.

(WSJ) \nHead of the banking and capital markets division at PWC says some banks need to increase cost cutting targets tenfold if they want to be viable. (Financial News) \nMcKinsey & Co says asset managers’ profits will fall by a third. (Financial Times) \nInside the Bank of England ‘governor’s quarters’: ‘an area known as the parlours, which is attended by doormen in pink tailcoats and top hats;’ where Mervyn King coolly dispatched Bob Diamond as CEO of Barclays.

      "text": "From a new Goldman Sachs research note:\nOur current projection, which assumes that the policies that Congress routinely extends will continue to be extended and that a moderately-sized tax cut will be enacted, has the deficit crossing the $1 trillion mark by 2020, or just under 5% of GDP. As shown in Exhibit 1, adding the full estimated cost of the House Republican tax proposal instead of the partial cost we assume in our forecast would take the deficit closer to $1.2 trillion by 2020, or just under 6% of GDP. Substituting Mr. Trump’s tax proposal would raise the deficit further, to around $1.5 trillion by 2020. In dollar terms this would be greater than the largest deficit on record, reached in 2009 ($1.4 trillion), though at just over 7% of GDP it would be less as a share of the economy.\nI think it should be intellectually difficult to have complained about the large deficits during President Obama’s first term — when tax revenues were collapsing and automatic stabilizer spending was surging due to the Great Recession — and then hand-wave away the above charts and projections. Also, these trillion-dollar deficits would come during an expansion and right into the teeth of higher entitlement spending. Again, here is how the American fiscal situation has evolved since the early 1980s when the large Reagan tax cuts were passed:\nAs economist Larry Summers notes in the Financial Times :\nToday’s budget situation is much more worrisome. The baseline involves much higher levels of debt and deficits. Then the economy was suffering from a deep recession; now it approaches full employment. If extreme tax cuts are legislated in the next months, uncertainty about the federal budget and about further tax adjustments is likely to rise.\nLearn more: \nWhat to do about the 50-something factory worker who loses their job?

The Wall Street analyst giant recently downgraded 3M from neutral to sell, and assigned a price target of $159, representing roughly 8% downside from the current price. You don't see outright sell recommendations from top analyst firms every day. So what's the deal with 3M, and should investors in the company be worried?\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "HSBC started coverage of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) Monday, Citigroup upgraded its outlook for the mining sector, including Rio Tinto ( RIO ) and BHP Billiton ( BHP ), while Needham upgraded shares of recent IPO Quantenna ( QTNA ).\nGoldman, Morgan Stanley Shares of the highest-profile investment banks have been surging since Donald Trump's victory on expectations of increased M&A activity, corporate tax cuts and robust capital markets activity helped along by the prospect of lower capital gains taxes.\nStill, HSBC sees further upside for Goldman Sachs, which it started with a buy rating and 250 price target. HSBC sees less upside for Morgan Stanley, which it gave a hold rating and 42 target.\nShares of Goldman rose 2.3% to 228.55 on the stock market today . Morgan Stanley shares rose 0.6% to 42.09.\nMining Citigroup upgraded its outlook for the metals and mining sector from bearish to bullish, though adding that it sees the extent of some commodity prices increases as \"a fluke,\" with gains in coking coal and iron ore in that category.\n\"A stronger cyclical U.S. backdrop, coupled with improved supply and demand fundamentals could keep industrial commodity prices buoyant in our view,\" Citi analysts wrote.\nAlong with that brighter view, Citi lifted its ratings on diversified mining giants BHP to buy from sell and Rio Tinto to neutral from sell.\nBHP shares advanced 1.9% to 38.73. Rio Tinto added 1.2% to 39.49.\nQuantenna Needham upgraded shares of the Wi-Fi chipset maker to strong buy from buy, giving it a 25 target and touting Quantenna as its top pick for 2017.\nNeedham said the recent pullback in the shares don't reflect fundamentals, citing \"long-lived design wins with some of the world's largest service providers\" that will result in robust revenue growth and operating leverage.\nShares of Quantenna shot up 15.7% to 19.47.\nIBD'S TAKE: With Quantenna shares surging on Needham's table-pounding recommendation, keep in mind that successfully trading IPOs requires different technical analysis than more seasoned stocks. In particular, it may make sense to buy after shorter consolidations. Read this Investor's Corner for a primer.",

      "text": "By Jessica Galang Canadian Startup News December 6, 2016 As Hubba raises Series B led by Goldman Sachs, founder Ben Zifkin confident company will IPO by 2020 \nSince Toronto-based Hubba founder Ben Zifkin launched his company in 2012, the plan has always been to IPO in 2020. In fact, he specifically came back to Toronto after spending four years in London, calling the lack of a strong IPO story in Toronto “embarrassing.” \n“I came back here specifically to build a large, global institutional tech company,” said Zifkin. To support his vision, Zifkin funded the startup out of his own pocket thanks to the acquisition of his prior company. Hubba would go on to raise a $3.1 million seed round in 2014, followed by an $11 million Series A in October 2015. \nNow, Hubba is announcing another investment that Zifkin said will light the fuse towards its ambitious IPO plans. The company has raised its Series B in a round led by Goldman Sachs’ VC Fund. Zifkin said that what makes this round especially noteworthy is the fact that it’s the first Canadian company to receive an investment from this fund, and the 12th company overall. The fund has invested in companies like Facebook, Spotify, and Pinterest in the past. \n“It’s the opposite of a lean startup — this isn’t like ‘let’s build a speedboat, put more horsepower on it, and get more and more.’ We’re going to build a fucking supertanker.” \nZifkin declined to confirm the amount that Goldman Sachs invested in the company (similarly, when Financeit raised funding from Goldman Sachs’ merchant banking division, they also declined to share how much they raised). However, in January, Zifkin told The Wall Street Journal that it was on its way to raising $45 million this year. \n“They’re connected with every major retailer and every single brand. Everybody uses Goldman Sachs, and they’ve got connections to everybody, both in different industries and geographically,” said Zifkin. \nThe company plans to use the funding to develop more features within the platform, and expand beyond Canadian borders into markets like the UK, which Zifkin said has a strong retail culture that’s been especially active within Hubba. Currently, Hubba has about 50 people on its team, and has 40,000 companies signed on to the platform. Zifkin said that in the last 16 weeks, 100,000 retailers and brands have connected through Hubba. \nZifkin credits Hubba’s ability to attract the attention of Goldman Sachs to his calculated, long-term approach to building Hubba, which Zifkin thinks can take over its market in a few ways. \nPut simply, Hubba’s platform provides one destination for brands, distributors, vendors, and retailers to manage and share all information related to a product, including descriptions, photos, customer reviews from mediums like YouTube, and marketing assets. For brand managers working with retailers distributing their products, it can be difficult to keep up with several retailers expecting different file types in different formats; Hubba, then, can act like a Dropbox where all information is available in one place. \nIt’s this aspect of the product that Zifkin initially focused on in order to attract users to the platform, rather than building one fully-defined product and expecting companies to sign up. \n“We said, ‘we may take a year or two just to focus on acquisition.’ I don’t care what they do at Hubba, I don’t care if they come back, but I just wanna get them in. Let’s see if we can get them in and we’ll optimize that,” said Zifkin. \n“It’s the opposite of a lean startup — this isn’t like ‘let’s build a speedboat, put more horsepower on it, and get more and more.’ We’re going to build a fucking supertanker, and it’s going to take a little bit longer, but once we get out of the harbour, it will be unstoppable.” \nAfter building a platform that contains countless data about products from brands, Hubba leveraged that to become more a social network through its Hubba Discovery Network. In the past, it was difficult for small, independent brands (which Zifkin calls ‘craft’ brands) to get on the radar of large retailers. He gives the example of a company called The Bear and The Rat,which makes dog ice cream . The Bear and The Rat had trouble getting the attention of PetSmart, which is dominated by large players like Purina and Iams that have entire teams dedicated to working with PetSmart. \nThrough Hubba’s network, Zifkin could promise that thousands of retailers could look at The Bear and The Rat’s products every week, and companies like them coan pay to show up on sponsored search results to become more discoverable. \n“All of a sudden, they [small companies] are on par [with large companies], and the PetSmart buyer, who may know five brands in their category, has access to thousands of amazing brands they never had access to before,” said Zifkin. Because it’s now easier — and cheaper — to start a company now than ever before, Zifkin predicts that this problem of retailers looking for access to more exclusive, craft brands will only increase as data in the commerce world becomes more decentralized. \n“Our job is to help you figure out how you’re going through the business. What’s your next best option: go connect with these five influencers, because we have all the data with us,” said Zifkin. “Connect with these five retailers because these are the best retailers that will want to carry your stuff. Go read these five articles because we think you’ll get smarter about your industry. So we work with these folks to help them get better at business.” \nWhile Zifkin has ambitious plans, he’s adamant that Hubba’s headquarters will always remain Canada, and is committed to giving back to the Toronto community by supporting initiatives like t he Venture Out conference and Ladies Learning Code . \nBut Zifkin said that these commitments aren’t totally altruistic; namedropping other Toronto-based companies like Wave, LEAGUE, and 500px, Zifkin said that the need for talent will only increase and it benefits everyone to open up the talent pool. \n“If we want to have a thriving ecosystem, there needs to be as many multi-billion dollar companies that are out of Toronto. We can talk about immigration, we can talk about this Waterloo Region corridor we have, the lifestyle; none of it matters if we don’t have winning companies based in Toronto,” said Zifkin. \n“I also know that having more women and having more people in our talent pool is going to benefit me. We do things like Upside Foundation because it’s important and that’s the right thing to do. Things like VentureOut will make the ecosystem better. I don’t think anyone owes it to anyone, but it’s important to do if we want to have the soil to build massive global companies.” \nZifkin expects to raise another large funding round over the next 18-24 months, before launching into the IPO category, but is excited to see how the Toronto ecosystem grows over the next few years. He calls the city “the worst kept-secret” in the world; while Silicon Valley investors years ago wouldn’t even take a call from a Toronto-based company, they’re now flying in to see what the hype is about. \n“With Goldman Sachs moving up here, which generally invests in later-stage companies, eyeing this ecosystem and actually making investments in the ecosystem, that to me is the-game changer,” said Zifkin. “It’s only because of companies like Shopify, Freshbooks, Hootsuite that it’s not crazy foreign that Canada can be an interesting destination.” BetaKit's SaaS coverage is brought to you by SAAS NORTH, happening Nov 30-Dec 1.

      "text": "Photo: Bloomberg News The firms file proposals typically voted on by shareholders asking banks to report pay disparities. \nA trio of activist investors is targeting big U.S. financial institutions in 2017, demanding they disclose compensation data for men and women, and publish statistics about the race and gender of their employees. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. are among the companies in the sights of Arjuna Capital, Trillium Asset Management and Pax World Management, which say a diverse workforce produces better results. Though the investors are relatively small, each managing a few billion dollars, they have succeeded in pushing technology goliaths such as Apple Inc. and Intel Corp. to divulge information about pay gaps. \nBoston-based Arjuna has filed proposals, typically voted on by shareholders at annual meetings, asking Bank of America, Wells Fargo, American Express Co. and Citigroup to report disparities in pay for male and female employees. It plans to file a similar proposal at JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Tuesday, said Natasha Lamb, Arjuna’s director of equity research and shareholder engagement. \nIn the 2016 proxy season, Lamb filed proposals at nine technology companies, including Apple and Intel, asking them to disclose their gender pay gaps. Seven agreed to make their gaps public and take steps to close them. \n“Given the financial benefits of diverse leadership teams, the female talent gap is simply bad for business,” Lamb said in an e-mail Monday. “Moving women up the ladder is critical, and companies can start by addressing structural barriers, including the gender pay gap.” Under-represented \nAs in technology, women lag men in finance leadership positions and pay. Women compose 49% of the workforce at the roughly 20 U.S. banks that have at least $25 billion in capital, but account for only about 21.5% of board members and just 19.7% of executives, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A 2016 Glassdoor survey found a 6.4% gender pay gap in the financial industry, one of the highest. \nPax World Management, which is based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and oversees about $4 billion, filed five resolutions on gender pay equity this fall, including one at Goldman Sachs and one at Bank of New York Mellon Corp., which was co-filed with Arjuna. Pax said it’s in talks with both companies. \nWhile only a tiny proportion of shareholder proposals actually go to a vote, and fewer pass, the activists said they aim to draw attention to the issue and get companies to engage with them. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, investors need to hold a stake of $2,000 in a company for a minimum of a year before they can file a proposal. \nTrillium Capital has filed resolutions seeking disclosure of data about race and gender at more than half a dozen financial companies, including T. Rowe Price, First Republic Bank, Travelers Cos., Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Aflac Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp. Demonstrating progress \nTrillium withdrew a proposal filed with Visa Inc. this year after the company agreed to release data on race and gender it reports to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \nTrillium focused on financial companies because they aren’t transparent about diversity, said Brianna Murphy, who’s in charge of shareholder advocacy at the investor. \n“We need companies to demonstrate progress using metrics,” Murphy said. Firms should disclose the wage gap, leave policies and working hours in addition to the EEOC data, she said. \nThe focus on diversity has sharpened under President Barack Obama, who has proposed adding compensation data to statistics that companies must report annually to the EEOC about race and gender at each level of leadership. But even with President-elect Donald Trump’s opposition to “political correctness,” companies aren’t likely to abandon efforts at diversity because research has shown that diverse groups make better decisions and diverse companies get better returns, activists said. \nMixed-gender investment teams also consistently outperform male-only managers, according to a Morningstar Inc. study published last year. \n“Companies thoroughly understand the business case,” said Heather Smith, lead sustainability research analyst at Pax, which manages the Global Women’s Index Fund, a selection of companies with strong female representation that outperformed its benchmark for the year ended Oct. 31. “I don’t see the topic going away any time soon.” Topic American Express Co.

      "text": "David McNew/Getty Images \nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, thinks there is good news coming in 2017, but investors shouldn't be complacent.\nKostin and his team project that the S&P 500 will rise to 2,400 next year, though a late sell-off will bring the index down to 2,300 by year-end. Still, even that latter figure is a nearly 100 points above where the index stands today.\nThis solid outlook, however, does come with some caveats. As part of a note detailing their 2017 projections, Kostin and company pointed out three things that scare them and could weigh down markets.\nThe three fears are:\n\"Rising budget deficit limits tax reform\": Trump has long been an advocate of corporate and personal tax reform . His pick for Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said that corporate tax reform is priority number one. While the plan is sure to get pushback from Democrats, many deficit-focused Republicans may not be willing to slash rates down as low as Trump wants for fear of losing too much revenue. In fact, Goldman projects that a full implementation of Trump's pan would cause the deficit to balloon to $1.2 trillion in 2018. Concern over the debt may prevent the full impact of tax reform from getting to corporations.\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images \"Rising inflation prompts the Fed to tighten steadily\": With core PCE inflation just above 1.7%, it appears that inflationary pressures are nearing the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%. Even market-based measures of expected inflation have rebounded, as noted by Kostin. Thus, given the possibility of Trump's stimulus in an already tight labor market and trade restrictions, inflation could push above the Fed's goal. While Chair Janet Yellen has said she is willing to let inflation run hot, the Fed could see these inflationary pressures as worrying and raise rates faster than the market expects.\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images \"Bond yields continue to rise\":  The carnage in the bond market has gotten gnarly since the election of Trump, with US Treasury yields hitting multi-year highs across the maturity spectrum. A continued sell-off would indicate the market sees a higher chance of rising interest rates and increased borrowing costs for companies.\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images While these aren't necessarily the base case for Kostin, it's always good to keep an eye on what could go wrong in order to avoid pitfalls.\nNOW WATCH: In the 1970s the CIA created a spy drone the size of a dragonfly \n",

      "text": "print \nDavid McNew/Getty Images \nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, thinks there is good news coming in 2017, but investors shouldn't be complacent. \nKostin and his team project that the S&P 500 will rise to 2,400 next year, though a late sell-off will bring the index down to 2,300 by year-end. Still, even that latter figure is a nearly 100 points above where the index stands today. \nThis solid outlook, however, does come with some caveats. As part of a note detailing their 2017 projections, Kostin and company pointed out three things that scare them and could weigh down markets. \nThe three fears are: \"Rising budget deficit limits tax reform\": Trump has long been an advocate of corporate and personal tax reform . His pick for Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said that corporate tax reform is priority number one. While the plan is sure to get pushback from Democrats, many deficit-focused Republicans may not be willing to slash rates down as low as Trump wants for fear of losing too much revenue. In fact, Goldman projects that a full implementation of Trump's pan would cause the deficit to balloon to $1.2 trillion in 2018. Concern over the debt may prevent the full impact of tax reform from getting to corporations. Goldman Sachs \"Rising inflation prompts the Fed to tighten steadily\": With core PCE inflation just above 1.7%, it appears that inflationary pressures are nearing the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%. Even market-based measures of expected inflation have rebounded, as noted by Kostin. Thus, given the possibility of Trump's stimulus in an already tight labor market and trade restrictions, inflation could push above the Fed's goal. While Chair Janet Yellen has said she is willing to let inflation run hot, the Fed could see these inflationary pressures as worrying and raise rates faster than the market expects. Goldman Sachs \"Bond yields continue to rise\": The carnage in the bond market has gotten gnarly since the election of Trump, with US Treasury yields hitting multi-year highs across the maturity spectrum. A continued sell-off would indicate the market sees a higher chance of rising interest rates and increased borrowing costs for companies. Goldman Sachs \nWhile these aren't necessarily the base case for Kostin, it's always good to keep an eye on what could go wrong in order to avoid pitfalls.",

      "text": "A Goldman Sachs MD quit for the industry of the future  en/267380/machine-learning-conference-banking/ Why work in finance when you could be learning to replicate the brain? \nIf you’re a managing director at Goldman Sachs with a reasonable chance of making partner, why would you leave? Most people in finance would be intensely thrilled to get a sniff at a Goldman partnership. Unless, of course, something even better was on offer. \nFor David Ha, former co-head of Japanese rates trading at Goldman Sachs, and a managing director at 32, the better alternative was a residency at Google Brain, Google’s 12 month programme in California to jump-start careers in machine learning. \nHa declined to speak to us for this article, but his public profile shows him leaving Goldman Sachs after eight years in May 2016 and joining Google a month later. Colleagues say he quit. Ha was doing ok at Goldman: he was promoted to MD after six years with the firm and was then made co-head of Japanese rates trading a little while later. If he’d hung around, he might have made partner circa 2020. \nInstead, Ha joins the ranks of ex-banking types building new careers in technology. In doing so, he could be strengthening his finance career for the future. One day, machine learning is expected to be integral to trading in hedge funds and banks. This week’s NIPS machine learning conference in Barcelona has attracted recruiters from the likes of Citadel and AHL. \nGoogle Brain’s residency is notoriously difficult to get onto: thousands of top PhDs globally apply for around 25 places each year. So, how did a Goldman rates trader in Japan make the cut? \nIt helps that Ha has a Masters in Mathematics. It helps too that while he was at Goldman he ran a machine learning blog and was active on Github – where Google often approaches promising machine learning talent. \nDoes Goldman need to add Google Brain to the list of hedge funds and private equity funds trying to poach its front office hires? Not necessarily. Pay for the residency is thought to be around $100k, and although Google Brain is open to participants with ‘diverse backgrounds,’ insiders say there aren’t any other ex-Goldmanites there. \nLong-term though, machine learning is likely to become more attractive to anyone in finance with a quantitative bent. “Finance is of miniscule importance in the grand scheme of things,” says one Brain resident. “There are far more interesting problems that can be solved with machine learning, from healthcare, to drug discovery, automated driving, robotics, and energy, \n“The roles of doctors, lawyers, flow traders, middle management, accountants, economists, may be redefined or augmented with machine learning algorithms,” he adds. “A single professional worker in five years may have the productivity output of an entire team at present.”",

Morgan Stanley’s Betsy Graseck and team recommend buying any weakness. They explain why:\nGetty Images After the recent 3 standard deviation move in the large cap bank stocks, some investors are asking why not step to the sidelines. We do expect the stocks to pull back a bit in early 2017 as rates settle down and Congress debates which tax breaks to eliminate in order to lower corporate and personal tax rates and what infrastructure proposals to run with. But we would use those pullbacks to add to exposures as we see a higher probability of the bull case unfolding than the bear case during 2017…\nOur price targets, using our base case 2018e EPS and target P/E of ~12x, imply 14% upside for our 8 Overweight-rated stocks and median upside of 6% for the group. Using our bull case 2018e EPS with no increase in multiples from the base case, we see upside of 41% for our Overweight-rated stocks and median upside of 30% for the group. We believe large cap banks are Attractive in our base case, especially considering our strategist’s call for only a modest 4% increase in the S&P 500 in 2017. Optionality is to the upside even if only half of our bull case plays out by 2018…\nTop Picks. Citi and Synchrony Financial ( SYF ) on stronger capital return. Bank of America on higher rates and lower expenses. Goldman Sachs on rising market volatility and improving VAR productivity. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo on stronger loan growth and expense management. Capital One Financial ( COF ) and Discover Financial Services ( DFS ) on rising consumer leverage and higher capital return.\nShares of Citigroup have risen 0.9% to $57.81 at 1:57 p.m. today, while Synchrony Financial has advanced 0.9% to $35.42, Bank of America has rallied 0.7% to $22.00, Goldman Sachs has gained 0.8% to $230.32, JPMorgan Chase has ticked down 0.1% to $83.17, Wells Fargo has climbed 1.5% to $55.14, Capital One Financial has edged up 0.5% to $87.10, and Discover Financial Services has risen 0.9% to $68.07.",

      "text": "SOURCE True Activist TAGS Donald Trump Steven Mnuchin After the 2008 campaign, many Americans were full of “hope” as then-President-Elect Barack Obama was set to bring much-needed “change” following the Bush years. However, warning signs flared as Obama set about arming his cabinet picks, filled with the very same Wall Street insiders and corrupt political figures that he had railed against in the campaign. At the time, many of his supporters made excuses for these choices, saying that Obama had to work within the system to change it and that these appointments were “compromises.” However, it was actually the massive bank Citigroup that had hand-picked Obama’s cabinet. Upon assuming the office of President, Obama did anything but deliver on his lofty promises of “hope” and “change,” particularly his promise to reign in Wall Street and stop government corruption in its tracks.\nSix years later, history seems to be repeating itself. Donald Trump, thrust into office by promising “ to drain the swamp ” of Washington corruption and give voice to the struggles of everyday Americans, is filling his cabinet with insiders who represent everything Trump claimed to have stood against. One of Trump’s most recent picks, the soon-to-be Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, epitomizes this dichotomy. Mnuchin, like his father before him, worked for Goldman Sachs for nearly twenty years before leaving to manage a hedge fund. While managing the hedge fund, he began to preside over banks which aggressively foreclosed on homes following the 2008 crisis while also practicing racial discrimination . One of the banks that Mnuchin oversaw during this time was OneWest bank, which has foreclosed on the properties of 36,000 homeowners . Many of these former homeowners helped vote Trump into the White House, but Mnuchin’s appointment has made some of them deeply regret their decision to vote.\nNow Mnuchin, who has called his close Wall Street ties a point of personal pride, will preside over the US Treasury Department, giving him considerable control over the US and even global economy. Like nearly every other Treasury Secretary of the last several decades, Mnuchin is set to use his position to further Wall Street interests on the national and international stage. Sadly, their interests almost always run counter to those of the average US citizen and certainly counter to many of those who elected Trump into office. It seems that these Americans, not unlike many Obama supporters in 2008, were swindled. Trump’s campaign rhetoric frequently targeted Goldman Sachs, yet now a particularly unsavory Goldman Sachs veteran will run the US treasury. It seems that history may be doomed to repeat itself once again as Trump is set to fill “the swamp” rather than drain it.\n ",

      "text": "\n* Financials lead; Goldman Sachs hits 9-year high \n* Amazon, big tech names also shine \n* Health sector lags as insurers stumble \n* Indexes up: Dow 0.24 pct, S&P 0.58 pct, Nasdaq 1.01 pct (Updates with close of U.S. markets) \nBy Lewis Krauskopf \nDec 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrials setting fresh record highs, as services sector data gave further evidence of strength in the domestic economy. \nU.S. services sector activity hit a one-year high in November, with a surge in production boosting hiring, following on the heels of Friday's employment report that showed strong job gains last month. \nU.S. stocks have climbed since the Nov. 8 election, fueled by expectations of significant economic stimulus and cuts in corporate taxes and regulations under President-elect Donald Trump. \n\"A lot of people were negative going into the election, or cautious, so now they're scrambling year-end to own stocks,\" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio. \nLancz said U.S. investors on Monday also were encouraged by strength in European equities following Italy's political referendum. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was set to resign after suffering a resounding defeat over constitutional reform. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.82 points, or 0.24 percent, to 19,216.24, the S&P 500 gained 12.76 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,204.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53.24 points, or 1.01 percent, to 5,308.89. \nThe Dow, which closed at a record and minted a new intraday peak, has topped the other major indexes since the election, as investors have rotated into the financial and industrial sectors. \nFinancials gained 1.2 percent on Monday and were the best-performing major S&P sector. Goldman Sachs shares rose 2.3 percent after HSBC initiated coverage with a \"buy\" rating. \nMonday's economic data reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve is primed to raise interest rates next week, benefiting banks. \n\"We have a situation where the Fed is probably going to raise rates next week and this time raising rates is being viewed as a positive, mainly because of its impact on the financial stocks, which are all doing quite well today,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \nBig tech names also lifted the S&P 500 and helped the Nasdaq outperform on Monday. Amazon.com rose 2.6 percent as it said it opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters. \nHealth insurers Aetna and Humana fell 3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, as a trial over their proposed merger kicked off. The health sector fell 0.2 percent and was the worst-performing group. \nAbout 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 232 new highs and 29 new lows.

When he left in 2002, he had a $46 million stake in the company. \nHe then worked for George Soros — another target Trump went after on the campaign trail. \nMnuchin has said he wants to roll back parts of Dodd-Frank — which put more regulations on Wall Street in hopes of avoiding another financial crash. \nSo, Wall Street guy. Hedge fund guy. Does that make for a good treasury secretary? \nWell, both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush tapped Goldman execs to lead the Treasury Department, so it's not unprecedented. \nBut Trump also made it a point during his campaign to rail against both Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton for supposedly being too cozy with Goldman.

      "text": "  08 48 AM IST Goldman Sachs slashes India’s growth estimates amid demonetisation Goldman Sachs cut their estimates for inflation-adjusted output for Q4, citing a sharper-than-initially-estimated fall in consumer sentiment and industrial production   Just two weeks ago, the Goldman economists cut their 2017 GDP-growth projection by 1 percentage point to 6.8%, citing the potential for business disruptions in light of the liquidity shortage. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint \nLondon: The cash crunch is taking a bite off Indian growth. \nGoldman Sachs took another axe to its growth forecasts for India on Tuesday, as the tremors from the government’s shocking move to ban high-value banknotes reverberate across financial markets and the real economy. \nEconomists at the US-based bank, led by Nupur Gupta, cut their estimates for inflation-adjusted output for the fourth quarter of 2016, citing a sharper-than-initially-estimated fall in consumer sentiment and industrial production amid the demonetisation drive. \nThey now reckon Asia’s third-largest economy will expand by a paltry 4.0% in the quarter, compared with a median estimate of 6.5% from a Bloomberg survey of 12 economists published in late-November. The latter projection, though higher than Goldman’s, is also notably weaker than a previous 7.8% estimate. \nGoldman on Tuesday also further downgraded its outlook for the 2017 fiscal year, estimating the economy will expand by 6.3% year-on-year, compared with a Bloomberg median estimate of 7.3%. Just two weeks ago, the Goldman economists cut their 2017 GDP-growth projection by 1 percentage point to 6.8%, citing the potential for business disruptions in light of the liquidity shortage. \nThe economists’ bearish lurch this week reflects the fact that soft data and anecdotal evidence suggest the cash shortage is beginning to take a toll, a challenge that will weigh on the Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday when it meets to decide its crunch-fighting strategy. The economists explain their downward revisions in a research note on Tuesday: \n“Given a limited quantity of new currency notes, the first few weeks since the currency reform have seen a shortage of cash, and consequently a significant reduction in consumption activity given that nearly 80% of overall consumption takes place in cash. Some of the impact is being mitigated by the substitution of cash with credit cards or electronic wallet payments, or with informal credit, but it is clear that the shortage of cash is having a significant impact on near-term activity.” \nIndia remains a heavily cash-based economy, meaning government reforms pose a headwind for growth. The bank noted that the country’s currency-to-GDP ratio is nearly 5 percentage points higher than the emerging market average, citing Haver Analytics Inc. On this basis, they conclude that some 60% of transactions in the real economy are now imperiled by a shortage of cash that will shave 80 basis points off real GDP growth in the 2017 fiscal year. They add that growth could fall lower than this base assumption if the cash crunch doesn’t improve notably by mid-February. \nThe Nikkei India Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index — the first economic indicator given since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 8 November announcement about high-value notes — saw a sharp decline in November, landing at 49.1 from 54.4 the previous month, the lowest level since March 2014 and highlighting the scale of the broad-based demand shock. \nWhile the demonetisation drive will crimp output in the near-term, its corresponding boost to government revenues and bank liquidity in the coming years will fuel growth in the medium-term, the Goldman analysts conclude.

      "text": "by Paul Clarke 48 minutes ago \nYann Samuelides, the Goldman Sachs partner who retired from its FICC team earlier this year, has now resurfaced at Goldman-backed insurer.  en/244706/yann-samuelides-leave-goldman-sachs/ \nYann Samuelides, the Goldman Sachs partner who retired earlier this year at the tender age of 41, has resurfaced at Rothsay Life – the UK insurer formerly owned by…Goldman Sachs. \nSamuelides joined Rothesay Life as head of asset and liability management in November, according to both filings on the Financial Conduct Authority register and his own public profile. He was previously head of fixed income, currency and commodities trading strategy at Goldman Sachs in London, but retired in May. Goldman Sachs partners ‘retired’ en masse earlier this year to make way for the bi-annual promotion process for the new round of partners announced in November. \nSamuelides joined Goldman Sachs as a vice president in 2004 from Credit Agricole when he was 29. By the time he was 32 he made it to managing director and was promoted to partner in 2012. He has a PhD in applied mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique and started out at BNP Paribas in 2001. \nRothesay Life is a UK insurer set up by Goldman Sachs which specialises in bulk annuity buy outs of large corporate pension funds. Goldman is still an investor in the firm, along with Blackstone and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, but sold its majority stake in the firm in 2013. This year, Rothesay secured a £6bn deal to take on the pension liabilities of Dutch in insurer Aegon, which was one of a number of large deals across the sector as insurance firms start to offload parts of their businesses as they adapt to Solvency II capital rules. \nSamuelides professional achievements are significant, but his inevitably brings up a high-profile story surrounding allegations of how he courted his wife. In 2010, he was embroiled in a media storm after it was reported that he spent £500k to persuade his partner, Alazbeta Homolkova to come and live with him . She was reportedly working as an escort girl at the time and was married to 67-year-old retired businessman, Denis Morley, who alleged that Samuelides offered Homolkova to leave her husband.",

      "text": "The indexes rallied in the stock market today following Sunday's constitutional referendum in Italy. Voters rejected Prime Minster Matteo Renzi's proposals, and the PM announced he was stepping down following the defeat.\nThe Nasdaq jumped 1%, the S&P 500 moved up 0.7%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%. The blue chip index reached a record high today.\nAlong with financials, Nike ( NKE ) and McDonald's ( MCD ) led the way on the Dow Jones industrial average after upgrades propelled the stocks higher. Analysts at HSBC raised Nike from hold to buy. Meanwhile, Nomura raised McDonald's from neutral to buy. Shares were up 3.4% and 0.9%, respectively.\nAmong leading growth stocks , regional banks were the best performers of the day. Bank of the Ozarks ( OZRK ) and SVB Financial ( SIVB ) were up 3% and 2%.\nGoldman Sachs Initiated At Buy; Arista Networks Downgraded HSBC Holdings ( HSBC ), the investment bank, initiated research coverage on two financial heavyweights: Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ). Goldman was initiated with a buy rating with a 250 per share price target, while Morgan Stanley started with a hold rating. Goldman shares rose 2%, while Morgan Stanley tacked on 1.5% in early trading. Financials have enjoyed a solid run since the U.S. election as rising interest rates and potential deregulation generated substantial fund managers' interest. Goldman shares are up 28% since early November.\nArista Networks ( ANET ) was cut to equal-weight from overweight by Morgan Stanley. The cloud networking provider edged up 0.1% and is up about 5% from its 87.72 flat base entry. The company has two quarters of accelerating quarterly earnings growth and a 98 EPS Rating.\nGoldman Sachs downgraded Marvell Technology ( MRVL ) to sell from neutral. Goldman believes the company's growth catalysts are already priced-in to the stock price. Their price target has been trimmed to 12 from 14 per share. The stock has now retraced the bulk of its upside reaction from last month's quarterly earnings release. Shares briefly turned positive after being down as much as 3%.\nOil Rallies Off Lows; PMI Out Oil prices reached a new 52-week high today and were up 0.7% extending the winning streak to four days. The U.S. dollar traded lower after initially surging following Italy's referendum results.\nThe Markit Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 54.6, just shy of the prior 54.8 reading.\nThe Institute for Supply Management reported its November services purchasing managers index at 57.2, topping expectations for 55.5 and also exceeding every estimate in the range.",

      "text": "Yu Yongfu CC Bynd \nAlibaba Pictures Group is making what it calls a “comprehensive organization and business model upgrade” that it hopes will morph it into a “content-based Goldman Sachs-type organization” that looks to be “hard-nosed” rather than “an adventurer.” In step with the newly stated goals, the film and TV division of Jack Ma ’s Chinese online giant has appointed fast-rising tech exec Yu Yongfu as CEO and shuffled Zhang Qiang and Zhang Wei from the respective posts of CEO and President to a shared Co-President role. Alibaba Pictures Senior Executive Detained By Chinese Authorities \nYu, who joined Alibaba in 2014 and is also Chairman of the Board of Alibaba Pictures, wrote to employees today explaining the company’s aim which “is not to become a film and television production company in the traditional sense. … The future is so bright, but reality is tough,” he added in an email distributed to the press. \nPredicting contraction in the Chinese market, Yu wrote: “The domestic film and television industry, following three years of savage growth, is entering a phase-out and upgrade cycle. A great number of film and television production companies will be opting out or will be edged out of the market next year. … It is both a challenge for film and TV adventurers and an opportunity for entrepreneurs. … The market needs a hard-nosed film and television production company instead of an adventurer with tremendously abundant resources. We need to devote concrete and thorough efforts to developing the larger and stronger business.” \nOne effort will be to “flatten the business operation and upgrade the organization towards partnership in terms of form and mentality, and aim to become a competitive platform appealing to talents,” Yu said. \nIn its short existence, Alibaba Pictures has become a major player in China and is expanding its reach globally. Last week, it made a strategic investment in Hehe Pictures Corporation, which was itself an investor of the country’s biggest film of all time , The Mermaid . It also owns online movie-ticketing platform Tao Piaopiao and has made a steady series of investments in films from Paramount including Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 and Star Trek Beyond . In October, it took a minority equity stake in Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners to co-produce and finance films for global and Chinese audiences and more recently joined forces with Harry Potter producer David Heyman on Warriors , a live-action film based on the hit series of young-adult novels.
