      "text": "In a keynote address to the APEC CEO Summit in Lima on Saturday, Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, challenged the world to connect all people to the internet and reap the economic benefits of doing so. With the speech titled “The Connectivity Revolution,” Zuckerberg said that, as an engineer, his mindset was to view any system in the world, whether hardware and software, healthcare and education systems, or even governments, Xinhua reported.\n“With the accelerating progress in science and technology, our generation has the potential to do even more great things that at any other time in history,” he said. As an example, Zuckerberg looked at education. “For the last century, education has worked in more or less the same way. Students sitting in a classroom, with a teacher, learning the same material, in the same way, at more or less the same pace,” he laid out.\n“Today, we know that personalized learning is way better. If you can give teachers the tools and software to help students learn in the way that suits them best…results show students can learn as much as 50 percent more each year and that can compound.” According to Zuckerberg, schools that integrate such personalised learning feel like start-ups and that more of the education system should work like this.\nTo tap into this, Facebook created a dedicated engineering team to create personalised learning that teachers could use for free. In the first year, 20 schools signed up to Facebook’s programme. The second year, 100 schools signed up and many hundreds are expected to do so in the third year, Zuckerberg pointed out. He added that Facebook intended to spread this program around the world, clearly providing an opportunity for APEC countries.\nIANS \nThe post Mark Zuckerberg challenges APEC countries to connect everyone with Internet for economic gains appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "By Ryan Nicodemus · Follow: Facebook , Twitter , Instagram \nOh—hello there! Welcome to our minimalist home. Well, really I’m the minimalist—my partner, Mariah, is not—but it’s still our minimalist home, right? And by the way, it’s more of a loft than a traditional home. Anyway, follow me this way, please. \nFrom the front door, we walk through a short hallway and into the kitchen: \nBecause the loft is all one open space, you can turn around and see our livingroom, as well as our favorite feature—that view! (Our cat seems to like it, too.) \nAll right, let’s head upstairs to the bedroom: \nTurn the corner, pass the bathroom, and here’s our bedroom (not pictured, behind the wall: closet, laundry): \nAt the foot of our bed, you’ll find a simple writing desk with a view: \nAnd finally, here’s a view of our livingroom from our bedroom. Yes, we have two couches, and yes, they get used frequently for weekly game nights: \nThat’s all for now. Next month we’ll feature a minimalist home tour of Joshua’s house, so make sure you subscribe to The Minimalists via email . In the meantime, search the #MinimalistHomeTour tag on Instagram for more photos of our homes. \nWatch our new documentary: Minimalism . SHARE",

      "text": "As shared By Natasha Akpoti on Facebook. Read below: \n‘Queen needs your help!!! \nLast night I, like many were disturbed about the news of a young lad burnt to death for attempting to steal garri. The images haunted my sleep. Not only because of the gruesome murder of a human being bitten hard by poverty, but because of those human beings that carried the act and worse off, those who stood by capturing his death with their phones. \nThis morning on my to the Singaporean embassy in Lagos, I saw besides the gates of Eko hotel, a lady laying on the floor and everyone (black and white) walked past her like she didn’t exist . I picked up my phone and took this picture (below) with the hope that I could share a lesson of poverty with you all. \nAt the embassy, I couldn’t get her image off my head. I felt even ashamed to have taken only the picture without stopping to hear her story. \nImmediately I stepped out of the embassy, I drove right back to her. Woke her up and this is what she said in fluent English. My name is Queen Okoye. I am 31 years old and a graduate of YabaTech. I am from Orsu LGA in Imo state (she paused to spell Orsu for me). Her father is Mr. Basil a Okoye. Mother is late. She lived with her boyfriend whilst in school. Their relationship fell apart and he kicked her out of his apartment. She has lived on the streets for years because her sister (married with children ) refused to assist her. \nI asked if she was on drugs and alcohol, but she said no. I noticed she smiled a little too much but always added “I am happy a beautiful lady like you acknowledged me. People walk by me everyday like I don’t exist “. This broke my heart. \nSo I asked permission to take a picture and share her story with you good people. She asked ” will they help or laugh at me. People call me crazy” . I told her the God that made me see her will make others connect to her. \nI also asked if she had any message for you all . She looked at me and said ” tell them I need help to get out of the streets. It all started like a joke and now I can’t believe how low I have fallen. I might need some counseling and medical attention because being out here changes one drastically. I need a place to sleep and a job to fend for myself . Please ” \nBeloved Nigerians, in our heart lies the power to do good and evil. I understand hunger’s pain. I know exactly the danger poverty sting’s delves to ones psych. At this trying times, let’s be sure to Chanel our frustration to the right persons and not the vulnerable like us. \nToday, I had an option to be like everyone and walk past Queen but I decided to be better. Everyone of us can attempt a little kindness and love to each homeless person; or anyone about to be lynched by a crowd. A little effort goes a long way. \nQueen stays in front of Eko hotel’s fence. She is waiting for someone to read this and reach out to her. So if you work in Lagos state welfare department or know any agency in charge of women, pls get to Queen. Let’s all share a little kindness because it would all come back to us. \nQueen needs you’",

      "text": "Every free speech right you have is now in grave danger. \nIf this doesn’t make your blood boil I don’t know what will. This past weekend was like a blow to the gut when I was alerted the deed was done. \nObama handed over control of the Internet to foreign globalists. Just freely gave it away like candy. His sinister plans are still being unleashed on the American people and must be stopped. \nRelinquishing control of the Internet, putting it into foreign hands is like giving globalists a free pass to censor and terrorize America. If we do not stop this (and there is still time) you can kiss goodbye freedom of speech over the Internet. That is why I must ask you to do something and time is of the essence. \nWe must FAX BLAST every single Senator and Member of the House - all 535 of them directly into their offices! It is up to us to put the fear of God in them. If they expect us to pucker up and kiss our Internet freedom goodbye, they can pucker up and kiss their cushy jobs goodbye. \nIf we do not act together, you know those Facebook rants over corrupt government or about Obama or Hillary? Your jokes, musings and pontifications to friends? All will be censored. \nIf their globalist friends don’t like them you can bet your booty they will be barred. And you will be blacklisted because they know your email address. \nThey are watching like shadowy figures in the night, lurking on the Internet, waiting, watching, ready to steal away your freedom of speech. What will be next? \nSpeak out against Obama or Hillary and you will be arrested – or worse. This is their attempt to silence anyone who opposes them or speaks out against them. \nIf you think you have a First Amendment right to free speech, think again. Since the Internet is no longer in the hands of the U.S. all bets are off. \nBut there IS still hope. We can stop this train wreck. You must FAX BLAST all 535 members of Congress right away! \nIt sends terrifying chills through me to think that some obscure foreign entity feeding off Obama and Hillary’s agenda like a vulture on a rotting carcass, will hold the power to withhold news and information or censor it to allow only what they see fit. These dangerous globalists will be tracking our every email, blog or social media post. \nAnd what will come through your feeds? Only what these dark and insidious forces want you to see. \nThis is tyranny. We will be living under the cloak of globalism – unless we stop them now. \nWe have to blast the bloody hell out of every Congressman and woman. We must let our voices be heard loud and clear. We must tell them: \nMake no mistake that we will not allow you to bludgeon our rights, shred our freedom of speech or be subjected to the horrors of communism, socialism and censorship. Stop Obama from handing over our Internet freedom NOW. If you do not, we will be coming for you. \nLook folks, we have direct access not just to the offices of these Senators and Representatives but to their home fax numbers, too . Please, help us now. \nTogether let’s blast the living daylights out of them with a SAVE OUR INTERNET FREEDOM FAX! \nYou may already know that Obama, Hillary and the rest of the flaming liberals in DC are doing everything they can to sensor the conservative media. On the table right now: any news media outlet with even the most miniscule foreign ownership will be banned from reporting on our elections or talking about candidates by name. \nThat’s like sewing their mouths shut permanently. \nWe have known for a long time they are after FOX News, The Wall Street Journal, and other conservative media news outlets. \nTheir agenda is clear – and so is ours friends. We know what we have to do, let’s do it. \nThe signs are all there, the writing on the wall clear as day. Do this today or be prepared to suffocate under the terror of foreign globalists, socialists and communists dictating what we can or can’t do.",

      "text": "Fake Company, Facebook, to Battle Fake News? By David \n‘Facebook is taking steps to counteract “fake news” but in many ways Facebook is a fake company. \nWe wrote about it here, quoting an article entitled, “Behind Facebook—A New World Order Agenda?” \nFacebook’s first round of venture capital funding ($US500,000) came from former Paypal CEO Peter Thiel. Author of anti-multicultural tome ‘The Diversity Myth’, he is also on the board of radical conservative group VanguardPAC. \nThe second round of funding into Facebook ($US12.7 million) came from venture capital firm Accel Partners. Its manager James Breyer was formerly chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, and served on the board with Gilman Louie, CEO of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm established by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1999. One of the company’s key areas of expertise are in “data mining technologies”.’",

      "title": "When the Gods Just Don’t Care",
      "text": "November 20, 2016 by John Beckett Leave a Comment \nYou’ve probably seen the Facebook meme that says “Jesus loves you. Odin wants you to grow the hell up.” I think that’s a little harsh. We all have limits, and we all have times when we just can’t handle one more thing. There are times when we hope – and sometimes when we expect – Gods who we know and serve to help us out, to make it better, or at least to reassure us that it will all work out in the end. \nSometimes They do that. And sometimes the Gods just don’t care. \nLet me start with two disclaimers. First, there are many Gods, and some of them are Gods of caring and compassion – Quan Yin comes to mind. They always care, and they remind us that we should too. And second, if you think I’m telling people with post-election stress to suck it up, go re-read my last two weeks of posts, especially this one . This post is more general than that, although it can be relevant to dealing with the aftermath of the election for some of us. \nThis is about what happens when a God or Gods asks or demands that you do something that seems impossible, impractical, or so unpleasant you absolutely do not want to do it. When you say “I really can’t do that” and They respond “just do it.” \nPerhaps this is a deity who’s new to you and you’re still negotiating the structure of your relationship. Or perhaps it’s someone with whom you have a long, respectful, reciprocal relationship. You’ve poured offerings and sung hymns to Them. You’ve adopted Their values and you do your best to exemplify Their virtues. You’ve been Their hands and done Their work in this world. Maybe you’ve even experienced the ecstasy of Their intimate presence. \nAnd now They want this ? They want an offering that would be a significant sacrifice. They want a commitment that would reorder your life. Or, in my current situation, they have a deadline that while not impossible is extremely tight and is forcing me to move forward before I’m fully prepared. \nWhat do you do when the Gods just don’t care? \nWe have sovereignty even before the Gods . The answer is not unreflective submission. The Gods are mighty beings, but we are responsible for our own lives. The Gods have agency and will – They do what They do, for Their own reasons. Some times – most times – it’s in our best interests to participate in Their work. But They do not always have our best interests at heart, and we have the right and the ability to say no. \nSometimes this has repercussions, particularly if you’ve already made open-ended promises. Most times, though, They’ll move on and find someone else who will do it… and you may not hear from Them again. But not always… \nI desperately wanted to be a priest of the Morrigan, but I could not give what She asked, so I told her no. She was absent from my life for months, then She came back with something else She wanted me to do. I still cannot be her priest, but the relationship has been restarted under terms I am happy to fulfill. \nSometimes I think They ask for what They want even though They know They’re not going to get it. I don’t think Zeus really expects anyone to sacrifice bulls to Him, but He’d still like to have them. \nIf you cannot do what They ask, then offer what you can do. But once you make a commitment, keep your word, no matter what. \nMaybe it really is that important . Look at things from Their area of responsibility. Look at things through Their values and virtues. Look at things from a very long-term perspective. There are things more important than your comfort and convenience. There are things more important than your personal safety. \nIn my own situation, I’m reminded of a quote from General George Patton: “A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.” Substitute “aggressively and diligently” for “violently” since I’m not engaging in actual warfare. I trust there’s a good reason why this thing needs to be done now rather than, say, next Spring – even if I can’t see that reason. Sometimes you have to dive in, get started, and figure it out as you go. \nI don’t buy the argument “the Gods are testing us.” If They ask for something, then it’s safe to assume They want it, even if They expect us to refuse. The only persons (and the Gods are persons, even though they’re not people) who “test” their friends and allies are the insecure, and the Gods do not suffer from insecurity. \nNow, there are plenty of stories of Gods who walked among mortals to test their hospitality, as Zeus and Odin were (and perhaps, still are) known to do. But seeing if people are living virtuously is a very different thing from tempting them to do something they shouldn’t. Tempters are a feature of a different religion… \nThey’re not sending us on impossible missions. If They ask you to do something, They think you can do it or They’d find someone else to ask. Now, maybe They’re wrong – They’re not infallible. But it’s far more likely They understand your situation and capabilities more clearly than you do. What you call impossible would often better be described as difficult and improbable, but doable with wisdom and determination. \nExcept when They do. Commanding an army means putting people in harm’s way. Attack a fortified position and you know some of your soldiers are going to die. Hopefully not many of them, or you’ll lose the war from attrition. But if you have to storm the beaches of Normandy in order to retake France from the Nazis, then that’s what you do. \nWhat will you die for, figuratively if not literally? If this isn’t worth dying for, then re-read the first point, exercise your sovereignty, and say no. \nBut perhaps this is too important to yield. Perhaps it means the world to you, or to someone who is dear to you. Perhaps the price of peace is your soul. \nAnd perhaps, even though the situation seems impossible, the wind’s on our side and that’s all we need. \nCourage is not having no fear. Courage is recognizing your fears and then doing the right thing anyway. Or the hard thing. Or the thing that takes more time than I’ve got to do it right now. \nThe Gods are not our servants, but neither are They our masters. Sometimes They care deeply about us and sometimes They don’t… or at least, that’s how it appears to us. They have many virtues – transparency is rarely one of them. But my experience with the Gods has been overwhelmingly positive. They have shown Themselves to be honorable and trustworthy, so when They seem to not care, I trust there’s something They see that I don’t, and I do my best to do it anyway. Stay in touch!

(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) \n(NEWSER) – A woman who gave birth to her own grandson and a couple who found each other again 65 years later make this week's list of uplifting stories: Their Parents Made Them Split 65 Years Ago. Now, a Wedding : Think it's not possible to feel like a teenager again when you reach your 80s? It's entirely possible, according to an English couple told to break off their engagement 65 years ago—and who finally got to tie the knot. The couple met and fell in love in art school, but their pairing back then was not to be. A sculpture brought them back together. Family Dog Comes to Rescue of Boy Trapped in Tumbling Dryer : When an Irish family's dog, Teddy, started \"barking like mad and running backwards and forwards to the tumble dryer,\" they knew something wasn't right. The mother of a 5-year-old boy rushed to the dryer to find an alarming sight—but the story could have had a much worse ending without the heroic dog. Sometimes That Stranded Biker on Roadside Is Springsteen : A group from the Freehold American Legion in New Jersey was riding after a Veterans Day event Friday when Dan Barkalow says he saw a stranded motorcyclist up ahead. \"Bikers gotta stick together,\" Barkalow said. \"I stopped to see if he needed help, and it was Bruce.\" As in, the Bruce. What happened next is very cool. Woman Gives Birth to Her Own Grandson : Megan Barker gave birth to a 7-pound, 7-ounce baby boy Oct. 22—but he's not her son, he's her grandson. The story starts with some bad news and a \"totally weird\" offer, but it has a very happy ending. Grandma With Wrong Number Makes Thanksgiving Miracle : Phoenix resident Jamal Hinton, 17, got a text from an unknown number inviting him to Thanksgiving dinner. The texter identified herself as \"your grandma,\" but Jamal wanted a photo \"to make sure.\" They exchanged selfies, which cleared things up pretty quickly. The rest of the conversation is a must-read. \nClick for more uplifting news . \nNewser is a USA TODAY content partner providing general news, commentary and coverage from around the Web.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nFollow TIS on Twitter: @Truth_is_Scary & Like TIS of Facebook- facebook.com/TruthisScary\nThe Free Thought Project .\nA now-notorious list of ostensibly “fake” news sites — created by a liberal professor, seemingly out of thin air — spread like wildfire online in the past two days and was eagerly reprinted by corporate media presstitutes hoping to vindicate their own failed reporting on the 2016 election.\nBut branding perfectly legitimate outlets with the same scarlet letter as those devoid of integrity deemed the professor’s list a spurious attempt to defame alternative and independent media — anyone dissenting from the left’s mainstream narrative — as a whole.\nThis is, in no uncertain terms, a hit list — or, at least, a laughable attempt — and it fits conveniently into the establishment’s burgeoning war on independent media disguised as a battle against fake news .\nWhen corporate media outlets from the Independent and Business Insider , to the Los Angeles Times and NYMag scrambled over one another to reprint this irresponsibly contrived hit list, they proved yet again a lack of journalistic integrity — the same issue that originally caused regular subscribers to abandon them in the first place.\nIndeed, in this otherwise unknown professor’s foray into the world of journalism, a glaring mistake was made — the only mainstream outlets making the list were those who had heralded Bernie Sanders as the best candidate for the White House.\nSuch an obvious attempt to control thought could only be conjured in a totalitarian regime.\nIn fact, failing to place the exact corporate media organizations on the list, who for nearly a year praised fealty only to Hillary Clinton — and for decades have foisted on the public countless mendacious whoppers — constitutes a comedic lack of honesty. So, to bring that irony front and center, it’s imperative to examine some mainstream lies — most of which had appalling consequences — including the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the United States and around the world.\n1. George W. Bush’s Weapons of Mass Destruction\nPresident George W. Bush decided to unleash the full force of the U.S. military upon the world in a new policy of war writ large disguised as a war on terrorism following the attacks of September 11, 2001. First arbitrarily designating Afghanistan as its primary victim due to the supposed identities of the attackers, Bush then chose Iraq to feel the wrath, and set out to invade the country following dubious claims Saddam Hussein harbored destructive chemical and biological weapons and was actively seeking far stronger munitions.\n“Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised,” the president asserted in a public address on March 17, 2003. “This regime has already used weapons of mass destruction against Iraq’s neighbors and against Iraq’s people.”\nBush’s assertions were questioned by not only human rights experts, but by U.N. weapons inspectors and countless others — so shortly after the U.S. invaded the sovereign nation, the New York Times took up the slack to fill in the appropriate casus belli .\nJudith Miller notoriously reported on a source she described only as an Iraqi scientist who had seen several extensive caches of such weapons stored somewhere in the country. American weapons experts, she claimed, “said the scientist told them that President Saddam Hussein’s government had destroyed some stockpiles of deadly agents as early as the mid-1990’s, transferred others to Syria, and had recently focused its efforts instead on research and development projects that are virtually impervious to detection by international inspectors, and even American forces on the ground combing through Iraq’s giant weapons plants.”\nIn hindsight, Miller’s problematic report turned out to be horrendously flawed , and the Times spent months attempting to backtrack , but the damage — fomenting widescale public support for a war no one wanted the military to undertake — had been done. Years later in 2014, the Times — after much internal strife — again took up Miller’s case, in a series reporting catastrophic injuries U.S. military personnel suffered in handling chemical weapons in Iraq. But that report, and the parroting of it by multiple other mainstream mainstays, failed to fully disclose Hussein had been oblivious to the stockpiles presence — something the CIA had clearly stated in a report .\n2. Gulf of Tonkin Incident\nOften, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.\nOn August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post , echoed this claim.\nBut it wasn’t true. At all. In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.\nIn 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House. But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.\nTom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”\nIf due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.\n3. Suppression of brutality perpetrated in Bahrain during the Arab Spring\nCNN sent reporter Amber Lyon and a crew to U.S. ally Bahrain for a documentary about technology’s role in the 2011 people’s uprising known as the Arab Spring, ultimately titled “iRevolution: Online Warriors of the Arab Spring” — but what they encountered instead bore the hallmarks of a repressive and violent regime, and its attempt to filter and censor the truth. Lyon and the other CNN reporters went to great lengths to speak with sources participating in the massive uprising — one the Bahraini government wished to quash at all costs.\n“By the time the CNN crew arrived,” the Guardian reported , “many of the sources who had agreed to speak to them were either in hiding or had disappeared. Regime opponents whom they interviewed suffered recriminations, as did ordinary citizens who worked with them as fixers. Leading human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was charged with crimes shortly after speaking to the CNN team. A doctor who gave the crew a tour of his village and arranged meetings with government opponents, Saeed Ayyad, had his house burned to the ground shortly after. Their local fixer was fired ten days after working with them.”\nEven the CNN crew experienced the wrath of the regime, upon showing up to interview one source, the Guardian continued, “‘20 heavily-armed men’, whose faces were ‘covered with black ski masks’, ‘jumped from military vehicles’, and then ‘pointed machine guns at’ the journalists, forcing them to the ground. The regime’s security forces seized their cameras and deleted their photos and video footage, and then detained and interrogated them for the next six hours.”\nAfter returning to the U.S., Lyon felt it her duty to expose the abuse being perpetrated by the government of an ally nation — but CNN International didn’t agree. CNN U.S. eventually aired the one-hour documentary. Once. CNN International never did — worse, the organization gave Lyon the cold shoulder, ignoring her repeated requests to return to Bahrain, which would have put CNN ahead of the game in reporting government brutality. Its failure to air the documentary and refusal to provide justification for doing so angered seasoned CNN and other mainstream established journalists across the board.\nLyon met with CNN International president Tony Maddox twice — he first promised to investigate why the documentary wasn’t aired, and then turned against her, warning the journalist not to discuss the matter publicly. Bahraini officials contacted CNN International repeatedly complaining about Lyon’s continued reporting on what she’d witnessed. Intimidation continued until she was eventually laid off, putatively for an unrelated matter.\nAttempting to save face, CNN International rebuffed the Guardian ’s account and interview with Lyon — but the effort was an impotent justification for the obvious failure of integrity.\nBut threats for Lyon to remain silent followed her off the job, and when she persisted in exposing the Bahraini regime, as well as the suppression by CNN , the outlet sent a stern warning to halt. Lyon, however, said she had never signed a non-disclosure agreement and would not be pressured into their lies — ultimately walking away reputation in hand — something that could not be said for CNN .\nRead More HERE",

      "text": "Jordan Spieth wins Australian Open again, another harbinger of the year ahead? By Facebook Getty Images \nJordan Spieth poses with the Stonehaven trophy after winning the 2016 Australian Open in Sydney, Australia. (Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images) This was where it began for Jordan Spieth, Sydney, Australia, liftoff for his rapid ascent to the pinnacle of golf, an ideal platform from which to issue a timely reminder that he doesn’t intend to surrender the stage. Two years ago, Spieth, 16 months removed from his maiden victory in professional golf, went to Sydney and won the Australian Open. What followed was one of the great seasons in golf history. This time, six months removed from his last win, now fifth in the World Ranking, he returned to Sydney and won the Australian Open for a second time with the kind of clutch performance on which his reputation was built. As if to underscore the message, it was a 9-iron shot that set up the victory, seven months after a 9-iron shot splashed down in Rae’s Creek, the start of a calamitous collapse that cost him a second straight green jacket . Spieth beat two Australians, Cameron Smith and Ash Hall, on the first playoff hole, the par-4 18th at Royal Sydney Golf Club, with a tee shot down the middle, a 9-iron to 15 feet, and a holed birdie putt. “I’ve been in a bit of a stall hitting the shots when they mattered,” Speith said. “To hit those two shots in there right where I wanted to hit them and then to make the putt with it, is really big going forward and it’s something I can draw on all next year.” There was a time, not long ago, when it might have been expected, but this was not one of those times, given how his round had been going. Spieth, who began the final round trailing Geoff Ogilvy by two, was four behind through eight holes. Ogilvy, a former U.S. Open champion attempting to win his national championship for a second time, stumbled on the back nine and was done in by a bogey at 15 and a double bogey at 16. RELATED: How to get your A-game back, by Jordan Spieth Spieth, meanwhile, played his final seven holes in three under, and made birdie on 16 and two par saves, one with a long-range putt on 17, to get into the playoff. He followed up with a perfect playoff hole, including the tournament-winning putt. \"I knew he’d make that,\" Hall said. A year ago at this event, Spieth finished tied for second behind winner Matt Jones when he was unable to hole a birdie putt to tie at 18. “I had a chance last year on 18 and didn't hit a great putt, and this time I had that same chance with a very similar putt in the playoff and capitalized,” he said. “So I drew back a little on that and said, ‘This is our time to close this one out.’” Whether it’s a harbinger, as his victory Down Under in 2014 was, who knows? But, as Spieth has demonstrated in the past, winning begets winning.",

      "text": "print \nThe Facebook Account Kit team. Left to right: Emilia Dallman Howley, Product Designer, Shivani Mohan, Research Manager, Raman Hansi, UX Researcher, Amee Kamdar, Product Manager, Ravit Cohen, Product Designer, Pat Lai, Product Marketing Manager, Olga Kuznetsova, Software Engineering Manager (on the screen) Matt Weinberger/Business Insider \nIt's not everyday that Facebook shows off new products by the flicker of candlelight. \nBut for the team of a dozen Facebook employees traveling the world, adapting to unpredictable situations and local customs was inevitable. \nOver the course of several weeks, the 12 Facebook employees toured Brazil, India and Germany on a quest to help Facebook forge stronger ties with international app developers and to expand Facebook's reach overseas — a vital effort as Facebook's growth in the US reaches its limit. \nWhen the team met with a group of German developers at a Berlin coffee shop one evening, the plan was to have a series of 2-minute \"speed dating\" chats between Facebook staffers and local developers. The team had printed screenshots of the first version of a new product aimed at overseas app developers. \nBut the big reveal was sullied by coffee shop lighting so dim, nobody could actually see anything. The Facebook team had to run out to the store so they could do their first demonstration by candlelight. \nFacebook Director of Product Management Deborah Liu Facebook VP of Platform Deb Liu \nLuckily, the public debut of the product's final version several months later went more smoothly. \nAt Facebook's F8 conference in April, Director of Product Management Deborah Liu officially unveiled the product of the group's worldwide travels, dubbed Account Kit . \nAs soon as it was announced, the Facebook team started to see their e-mails and Messenger accounts light up with praise from the developers they had met with in their travels, and more besides. It looked like Account Kit was a hit. \n\"That was just a really exciting moment,\" says Facebook Research Manager Shivani Mohan, a member of the travelling team. \"We worked so hard.\" Crying babies \nAccount Kit lets app developers choose to sign up new users without forcing those users to create new accounts and passwords. It gives them the option of letting their users sign up with a phone number, rather than a Facebook account. \nIt's an extension of Facebook Login, the company's existing universal login system in which a person can use their Facebook credentials to start using third-party apps. \nBut Account Kit takes it one step further. Users don't even need a Facebook account anymore, and can simply use a mobile phone number as a universal log in. That makes it easier for users and for developers in certain countries where people often have mobile phones but not necessarily Facebook accounts. \nAnd as the \" next billion \" internet users come online, making things \"convenient and easy\" is very important, says Mohan. \nAnother Facebook traveler, Product Manager Amee Kamdar, talked to one developer who told her \"he would rather sit next to a crying baby on a plane than remember another username and password.\" \n\nFacebook Account Kit in action Facebook \nYour mission, should you choose to accept it... \nInstead of just doing focus groups and one-on-one sessions, the Account Kit team brought along designers and programmers, too. \nAs the Facebook customers and developers they talked to gave feedback on how this should all work, the designers and programmers were able to mock up new ideas on the spot, rather than send it back to Menlo Park and wait for a turnaround. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Stephen Lam / Reuters \nWhat seems straightforward — a simple way for developers to use a phone number with Facebook Login, with a pin number as a password — actually has a bunch of moving parts, as Facebook Product Designer Ravit Cohen explains. \nThe danger is giving developers \"too much freedom,\" Cohen says: The goal is to keep the experience of using Facebook Login consistent enough across apps that users don't get confused as to how to use it, while also giving developers enough options and controls to make it a seamless part of their app. Two big things \nThe knowledge the team gathered on the trips resulted in a product that Facebook hopes will give it a leg up as it courts new users overseas. But it's not the only thing Facebook team took away from the experience. \nFirst, was a renewed understanding of just how important Facebook is to these developers all over the world. Big companies and small entrepreneurs alike who build apps rely on the social network to work with their customers, and the Account Kit team found themselves with a certain weight of responsibility to do right by all of them. \n\"There's a trust we'll do the right thing for them,\" says Product Marketing Manager Pat Lai. \nThe second big thing is that, as you may have noticed by now, the Account Kit team's leadership is comprised of all women — a relative rarity anywhere in Silicon Valley, let alone at the male-dominated Facebook . \nIt was the first time in that situation for the whole team, and Product Designer Emilia Dallman Howley says that they all benefitted from the support as they undertook their global journeys. \n\"It's a really, really refreshing change,\" says Howley.",

      "text": "When Nabanita De scrolled through her Facebook feed recently, she felt afraid. There were so many posts with competing information and accusations about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton that she didn't know how to begin deciphering the fearmongering from the reality.\nThe social media site has faced criticism since the presidential election for its role in disseminating fake and misleading stories that are indistinguishable from real news. Because Facebook's algorithm is designed to determine what its individual users want to see, people often see only that which validates their existing beliefs regardless of whether the information is true.\nSo when De, an international second-year master's student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, attended a hackathon at Princeton University this week where the goal was to develop a technology project in 36 hours, she suggested to her three teammates that they build an algorithm to authenticate what is real and what is fake on Facebook.\nAnd they were able to do it.\nThe four students — De, with Purdue University freshman Anant Goel and sophomores Mark Craft and Qinglin Chen from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign — built a Chrome browser extension that tags links in Facebook feeds as verified or not verified by taking into account factors such as the source's credibility and cross-checking the content with other news stories. Where a post appears to be false, the plug-in will provide a summary of more credible information on the topic online. A small blue box in the upper right-hand corner of the screen says either \"verified\" or \"not verified.\"\nFacebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me' Caitlin Dewey What do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they're all make-believe — and invented by the same man.\nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years....\nWhat do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they're all make-believe — and invented by the same man.\nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years....\n(Caitlin Dewey) They've called it FiB.\nSince the students developed it in only 1 1/2 days (and have classes and schoolwork to worry about), they've released it as an \"open-source project,\" asking anyone with development experience to help improve it. The plugin is available for download to the public, but the demand was so great that their limited operation couldn't handle it.\nIdeally, Goel said, Facebook would team up with a third-party developer such as FiB so that the company could control all news feed data but let the developers verify it so Facebook couldn't be accused of \"hidden agendas or biases.\"\nThe sponsors of the hackathon included Facebook and other major technology companies, but neither Facebook nor Google has contacted the students about FiB. Both companies have said this week that they will take steps to address the spread of fake news.\nThis year's presidential election has shown how the lines have blurred between fact and lies, with people profiting from the spread of fake news. More than 100 news sites that made up pro-Trump content have been traced to Macedonia, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation. The Washington Post interviewed Paul Horner, a prolific fake-news creator, who said: \"I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don't fact-check anything — they'll post everything, believe anything.\"\nFacebook's Zuckerberg says fake news didn't drive election Sarah Frier Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\n(Sarah Frier) Melissa Zimdars, a communications professor at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts, said she's seen a similar problem with students who cite questionable sources. So she created a list of fake, misleading or satirical sites as a reference, not as a direct response to the postelection fake news debate but to encourage students to be more media-literate by checking what they read against other sources.\nThe list, which she has continued to add to since she made it public earlier this week, has gone viral. She included tips for analyzing news sources:\n\"Watch out if known/reputable news sites are not also reporting on the story. Sometimes lack of coverage is the result of corporate media bias and other factors, but there should typically be more than one source reporting on a topic or event.\n\"If the story makes you REALLY ANGRY it's probably a good idea to keep reading about the topic via other sources to make sure the story you read wasn't purposefully trying to make you angry (with potentially misleading or false information) in order to generate shares and ad revenue.\"\nZimdars said people have grown so distrustful of institutional media that they turn to alternative sources. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that only 18 percent of people have a lot of trust in national news organizations; nearly 75 percent said news organizations are biased.\nIt doesn't help, Zimdars said, that news media, to be profitable, rely on \"click-bait\" headlines that are sometimes indistinguishable from the fake stories.\nPaul Mihailidis, who teaches media literacy at Emerson College in Boston had a different take.\n\"I don't think a lot of people didn't know; I think they didn't care. They saw it as a way to advocate,\" Mihailidis said. \"The more they could spread rumors, or could advocate for their value system or candidate, that took precedent over them not knowing. A large portion of them didn't stop to critique the information. One of the things that has happened is people are scrolling though [Facebook] and the notion of deep reading is being replaced by deep monitoring. They see a catchy headline, and the default is to share.\"\nAnd the way people consume news, by a flick of the thumb on a smartphone, means they are less likely to cross-check what they're reading against other sources.\nThat's where the plugin tool presents a simple solution.\n\"A few days back, I read an article telling people they can drill a jack in the iPhone7 and have an earphone plug, and people started doing it and ruining their phones,\" De said. \"We know we can search on Google and research it, but if you have five minutes and you're just scrolling through Facebook, you don't have time to go verify it.\"\nPrivacy Policy   Donald Trump Purdue University Princeton University",

      "text": "Image source: Facebook.\nBoth Messenger and WhatsApp have over 1 billion users, but they don't generate any revenue for Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) . On Facebook's third-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg laid out the road map for how Facebook monetizes its products. More importantly, he told analysts where each product is on that map.\nFacebook stock came under pressure after CFO Dave Wehner told analysts he expects ad revenue growth to slow while expenses climb next year. With the company running out of space to squeeze in ads on its flagship platform, investors are hoping the huge user bases of Messenger and WhatsApp produce some meaningful revenue in the near future.\nThe three phases of product monetization More From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "text": "Tweet \nFacebook has many problems , but the most recent and prominent of them has been the issue of fake news. So serious is the problem, that some have blamed fake news stories on Facebook as being the reason Donald Trump is now president elect . \nMark Zuckerberg has made it fairly clear he doesn't subscribe to this particular idea, but he is certainly aware that fake news is a problem. Under pressure to do something about it -- bearing in mind that for a worrying percentage of people, Facebook is their only source of news -- Zuckerberg wants to not only make it clear that \"we take misinformation seriously\", but also that there are plans to tackle the problem. But they're not very good. \nHaving previously indicated that he was unconcerned with the issue of misinformation online, the Facebook CEO has since had something of a change of tune. He is now willing to acknowledge that there is something of a problem and is keen to be seen to be doing something about it. But it is, of course \"complex, both technically and philosophically\" (his words). \nYou'd be right to see this as something of a cop out. \nYou'd be equally justified in seeing Zuckerberg saying, \"we do not want to be arbiters of truth ourselves, but instead rely on our community and trusted third parties\" as something of a cop out. \nThis last statement can be taken in a number of ways. The first is that it is passing the buck. Why should Facebook be responsible for fact-checking everything that's posted on the social network? But equally, should it be left to a team of neighbourhood watchers with nothing better to do to do the job instead? And trusted third parties? How can we be sure of impartiality? \nThis questions crop up before we even consider the concept of what truth actually is . In some instances, the truth is clear -- a square has right angles at each corner. But when it comes to the reporting of a political situation, a war, or just about anything else deemed newsworthy, things start to get a little murky. Without editorializing, it is damn near impossible to report any given event in a way that will be seen as presenting the complete truth by everyone who reads it. A story that said \"Donald Trump is black\" would, of course, be easy to disprove, but this is often not the case. \nWith the US election, the fake news problem has focused mainly on the views of the right and the left, but things are rarely that binary. A rightwing newspaper might be ridiculed by a leftwing reader for writing utter nonsense, but does that mean that everything in said paper is untrue? And, of course, vice versa for a rightwing reader of a leftwing paper. \nThe problem is extremely complicated and highly nuanced. Despite this, Mark Zuckerberg has taken to Facebook to outline what he wants to do. His post is a little light on details, but it does set out a few areas that will be the focus of projects to weed out fake news: \n- Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. \n- Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. \n- Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. \n- Warnings. We are exploring labelling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. \n- Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. \n- Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. \n- Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. \nThere remain many problems here. Any system of news flagging that relies on input from the community is clearly going to be open to abuse. It’s naïve to think otherwise. Making it easier to report problems as fake only exacerbates the problem. Using third party fact-checkers might seem like a good idea -- and it gets Facebook off the hook a little -- but this will introduce a further element of distrust. Are the third parties on Facebook's payroll? Have they been selected because they hold a certain ideology? Will fact checker that hold extremist views be ignored or embraced? \nWarning labels will have little to no effect on the spread of fake news. It ignores a very important factor: the stupidity and laziness of many people. Even if a story has a 'fake' label slapped on it, it is safe to assume that many people will not see it. They may ignore it. They may believe the label is wrong. They may believe the story has been labelled as part of a conspiracy. Stories that are labelled as fake will still be shared, they will still spread. How will this metric be factored in. \nWhat about the issue of satirical stories? There are numerous high-profile news satire sites who deal in fake news -- that's why they exist. Sure, it might be easy to whitelist the big names, but this could then be unfair to newcomers and smaller players. Again the stupidity of readers comes into play here. An intelligent reader will consume a piece of satire and appreciate it for what it is. A less intelligent reader might read it and accept it as truth. There are very few -- through a combination of stupidity and laziness -- who would bother to check the veracity of the story if they were in doubt. \nFacebook talks about interfering with the ad revenue of sites delivery fake news. This presents a problem for satirical and humorous sites too. It also means Facebook runs the risk of, essentially, placing editor of the news. As the company has said time and time again that it is not media company it needs to be very careful not to be seen acting like one -- and this is exactly what it going to happen when it starts tinkering even further with the presentation of news. \nThe truth is, after all, something of a rainbow. Or, to use a famous quote: this is my truth, tell me yours.",

      "text": "Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election By Barbara Ortutay AP Technology Writer Updated: 11/15/2016 08:02:05 AM EST Click photo to enlarge FILE - In this Tuesday, April 12, 2016, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference, in San Francisco. In an interview Thursday, Nov. 10, 2016, with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said the idea that Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is a \"crazy idea.\" (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) « 1 » \nNEW YORK (AP) — Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the idea that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the U.S. election is \"crazy.\" \nStill, the majority of Americans (six in 10) say they get at least some news from social media , mostly Facebook, according to the Pew Research Center. While a lot of this news comes from established outlets — whether CNN or BuzzFeed News, misinformation spreads on Facebook just as information does, shared by users, recommended by software and amplified by both. \nSources of spurious information have ranged from news articles produced by \"content farms\" for the sole purpose of getting clicks, to \"hyperpartisan\" sites from both sides of the political spectrum, churning out stories that are misleading at best. \nCase in point: \"FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE\" — a fabricated headline from a fake news site called the Denver Guardian, was shared thousands of times in the days leading up to the election. \nIs it possible that voters were swayed for or against a candidate, much like those same people might buy a product after seeing an ad on Facebook? \nZuckerberg says voters deserve more credit. \nDuring an interview Thursday with \"The Facebook Effect\" author David Kirkpatrick, Zuckerberg said idea that people voted the way they did because of bogus information on Facebook shows a \"profound lack of empathy\" for supporters of Donald Trump. Advertisement \n\"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,\" he said. \nGiven the acerbic political contest from which the country just emerged, when countless longtime friends, even family, were unfriended, many are left to wonder if there would be an alternative American history being written today if it were not for Facebook, Twitter and the like. \nThis, after all, was the first truly social media election, playing out on Twitter and Facebook as much or more than it did on major networks, in living rooms and around watercoolers. \nBut isn't social media just a reflection of our world as it exists? Has Facebook become an easy scapegoat when the answer is far more complex? \nWhile Pew found that many believe political discussions on social media to be \"uniquely angry and disrespectful,\" a comparable number have the same impression of face-to-face conversations when it comes to Democrats, the GOP, or another party. \nFILTER BUBBLE? \nWhen it comes to Facebook users, Zuckerberg said almost everyone has friends on the \"other side.\" Even if 90 percent of your friends are Democrats, for example, 10 percent will be Republican. Still, that's not a very big number, and the idea of a \"filter bubble\" — that social media allows people to surround themselves only with the people and ideas with whom they agree, has been a hot topic this election cycle. \n\"By far the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn't there, that you don't have friends who support the other candidate or that are of another religion,\" Zuckerberg said. \"But it's that you just don't click on it. You actually tune it out when you see it. I don't know what to do about that.\" \nA DIFFICULT LINE \nFacebook has long denied that it's a publisher or a media company, or that it acts remotely like either. Its cheery slogan — to make the world more \"open and connected\" — seemingly invites a broad range of viewpoints, diverse, lively discussion and the free flow of information, rather than censorship. \nBut it could also make clamping down on fake news difficult. At a time when everyone seems entitled, not just to their own opinions, but to their own facts, one person's misleading headline might be another person's heartfelt truth. \n\"We take misinformation on Facebook very seriously,\" Adam Mosseri, the executive in charge of Facebook's news feed, said in a statement to the tech blog TechCrunch this week. \"We value authentic communication, and hear consistently from those who use Facebook that they prefer not to see misinformation.\" \nFacebook acknowledges that it has more work to do, and it seems to be putting a lot of faith in the power of data, artificial intelligence and algorithms as the solution. \nOver the summer, Facebook fired the small group of journalists in charge of its \"trending\" items and replaced them with an algorithm. The catalyst appeared to be a report in a tech blog, based on an anonymous source, that the editors routinely suppressed conservative viewpoints. \nSubsequently, fake stories ahead of the election began to trend.

      "text": "In the wake of the surprising-to-many election of Donald Trump, Facebook has emerged in some circles as scapegoat of choice. A chorus of voices, saying that false news stories shared on the platform helped sway the election, are calling on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take drastic action to control what's shared on the site. And he's responding with some concrete pledges .\nThe unfolding public relations headache presents several competing imperatives. Facebook broadly prefers to be seen as a neutral platform for social sharing. The shift towards editorial oversight involves serious technical challenges , as well as some uncomfortable regulatory implications .\nBut Facebook faces a third conundrum--getting rid of fake news might actually hurt its ad revenue. Interacting with news that confirms pre-existing beliefs triggers positive emotional responses in users and drives huge user engagement . News is a major part of what people interact with Facebook, and whether a piece of content is true or not has no clear correlation to how many clicks it generates.\nAs media expert Clay Shirky put it to The Guardian , \"We love bedtime stories.\" Even, perhaps especially, when they're fairy tales.\nFiltering fake news would also have second-order effects that could not only reduce daily engagement, but drive users away from Facebook altogether, at least as a news source. While Trump supporters have been particularly skeptical of large news organizations and traditional fact checking, more than half of Clinton backers feel the same way . We're a nation in the late stages of democracy , with a populace deeply distrustful of any and all authority and expertise. Social media's dominance is both a cause and effect of that. We spend time on Facebook because we think our friends are better sources of information than pinhead professors or noodling newspaper editors.\nIf Facebook were to be perceived as having become just another top-down entity telling people what to believe, it would endanger a core element of its appeal. There would be a significant opening for a competing social-news platform that positioned itself as more open and unfiltered.\nThat said, there are counterpoint business arguments in favor of filtering fake news. Facebook has avoided many of the concerns about trolling and harassment that have been such a drag on Twitter's prospects , in part because of evolving features that allow users to filter and report content and tailor their ad preferences. However, toxicity fueled by partisan fake news could eventually generate headwinds for Facebook similar to Twitter’s woes.\nIn a piece today from NPR, more than 150 respondents to an unscientific survey described reducing their Facebook use because of the intensity of the election environment. One, a Mormon supporter of independent conservative candidate Evan McMullen, described himself becoming \"a meaner, more cynical person\" thanks to Facebook, and limiting himself to an hour a week on the site. That's a lot less than the nearly hour per day Facebook now gets from its average user.\nOf course, activists and pundits will protest that this is about more than business, that the fate of American political discourse is at stake. Maybe regulators will eventually agree, and start treating Facebook as a publisher (which would present a different set of huge business challenges). But those hoping Facebook cleans up its act do themselves no favors by pretending the bottom line here isn’t denominated, in large part, in dollars.",

      "text": "Want 20% more battery life on your Android device? Delete the Facebook app Want 20% more battery life on your Android device? Delete the Facebook app Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Apps - Apps + Nearly three and a half years ago, we told you that the Facebook app was responsible for battery drain issues on iOS devices . Last year, Facebook admitted this and said that an updated version of the app would help limit the problem. But today, it seems as though Android users are having the most difficult time dealing with the battery issues that go hand-in-hand with having the Facebook app installed on a device. Tech World Zone recently tested the Facebook app on a Nexus 6P using Metal. The latter is an app that is a wrapper for Facebook. The results of the test showed that for an entire week, removing the Facebook app left the phone with 20% more battery life each day. In addition to fixing the battery drain issue, deleting the app could also improve the performance of an Android phone.While Android's own battery stats don't show anything untoward about the amount of power used to run the Facebook app, the app does continue to run in the background even if the phone it is installed on is offline. Apparently, this is done to enable Facebook to open quickly on demand, and to provide notifications.While Facebook has issued a statement, it seems to discuss the performance issues of Android phones and tablets with the app installed. You'll notice that the following quote from the company doesn't mention the battery life issue. \"We have heard reports of a few people encountering speed issues coming from our Android application. We are investigating this and will update you as often as possible. We are focused on keeping on enhancing these issues.\"-Facebook spokesman If you must have your Facebook access and a long battery life, you can always delete the app and open the Facebook mobile site using the browser on your device.",

Let us explain.  //usat.ly/2fIcyLQ   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Why Brady waited 16 years to play in hometown Steven Ruiz , USATODAY 12:52 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 \nFor the first time in his 16-year NFL career, Tom Brady will play a game in his hometown (very close to it, at least), as the New England Patriots take on the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday. \nWith the NFL scheduling process designed to pit every NFL team against one another at least once every four years, it took some seriously bad luck to delay Brady's homecoming for so long. And if Brady is looking for anyone to blame for extending his wait, he can look at the Carolina Panthers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Bernard Pollard. Here's why… \nThe NFL added the Jaguars and Panthers in 1995, which created a league with three divisions per conference with five teams in each division. That required some changes to the scheduling formula when pitting two divisions against one another in a given season. So when, say, the NFC East was matched up with the AFC East in a season, the Patriots would play only four of the five NFC East teams. That formula was used through the 2001 season, Brady's first year starting for New England. \nIn that 2001 season, the AFC East was matched up with the NFC West, but the one West team the Patriots did not play just happened to be the 49ers. \nWhen the Texans were added in 2002, the NFL realigned to the current divisional set-up, where every team plays at least once in a four-year span. Brady's first game agaisnt the 49ers came finally in 2005, but the game was in New England. \nIn 2008, the Patriots played the 49ers in San Francisco but Brady was lost for the season in Week 1 after Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard barreled into his knee, resulting in a torn ACL for the defending MVP. Matt Cassel started the game in San Francisco and led the Pats to a 30-21 lead. \nFast-forward eight years, and the 49ers will once again host the Patriots. Brady is healthy and will start in front of his hometown fans against his hometown team. It's a game 16 years in the making. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fIcyLQ Most Popular",

      "title": "Trump's CIA Pick Pompeo Promises to Roll Back Iran Nuclear Deal",
      "text": "Kansas Congressman Mike Pompeo. Photo: Facebook.\nJNS.org – President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday his selection of Kansas Republican Congressman Mike Pompeo as his nominee for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser.\nPompeo, 52, a three-term congressman who graduated first in his class at West Point Military Academy, has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama’s landmark nuclear deal with Iran. “I look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism,” Pompeo wrote on Twitter Thursday.\nPompeo had also previously said that the nuclear agreement is “empowering an Iranian regime that is intent on destroying America.”\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition called Pompeo’s selection a “wonderful choice.”\n“Throughout his years of public service, Rep. Pompeo has been a friend of American Jews and a true friend of Israel,” RJC head Matt Brooks said in a statement Friday. “His staunch opposition to the Iran nuclear deal shows he takes our interests to heart and we are proud to support him.”\nMeanwhile, Trump also announced Friday the appointment of Flynn as national security adviser.\nFlynn, 57, who previously served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 2012-2014, was an early backer of Trump’s candidacy. He has been outspoken critic of the Obama Administration’s campaign against terrorism, saying in a recently published book that the U.S. is losing a “world war” against radical Islam due to “political correctness.”\nWhile Flynn has been a supporter of Trump’s goal of improving ties with Israel, he sparked controversy last summer for an antisemitic tweet aimed at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn wrote that “the corrupt Democratic machine will do and say anything” to get Clinton elected, responding to accusations by Clinton that Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).\n“This is a new low,” he said on Twitter, while also retweeting a message that read: “Not anymore, Jews. Not anymore.” Flynn later apologized for the retweet, saying that it was a “mistake.”",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Is Getting Rid of Fake News Bad for Facebook’s Business? \nIn the wake of the surprising-to-many election of Donald Trump, Facebook has emerged in some circles as scapegoat of choice. A chorus of voices, saying that false news stories shared on the platform helped sway the election, are calling on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take drastic action to control what’s shared on the site. And he’s responding with some concrete pledges . \nThe unfolding public relations headache presents several competing imperatives. Facebook broadly prefers to be seen as a neutral platform for social sharing. The shift towards editorial oversight involves serious technical challenges , as well as some uncomfortable regulatory implications . \nBut Facebook faces a third conundrum—getting rid of fake news might actually hurt its ad revenue. Interacting with news that confirms pre-existing beliefs triggers positive emotional responses in users and drives huge user engagement . News is a major part of what people interact with Facebook, and whether a piece of content is true or not has no clear correlation to how many clicks it generates. \nAs media expert Clay Shirky put it to The Guardian , “We love bedtime stories.” Even, perhaps especially, when they’re fairy tales. \nFiltering fake news would also have second-order effects that could not only reduce daily engagement, but drive users away from Facebook altogether, at least as a news source. While Trump supporters have been particularly skeptical of large news organizations and traditional fact checking, more than half of Clinton backers feel the same way . We’re a nation in the late stages of democracy , with a populace deeply distrustful of any and all authority and expertise. Social media’s dominance is both a cause and effect of that. We spend time on Facebook because we think our friends are better sources of information than pinhead professors or noodling newspaper editors. \nIf Facebook were to be perceived as having become just another top-down entity telling people what to believe, it would endanger a core element of its appeal. There would be a significant opening for a competing social-news platform that positioned itself as more open and unfiltered. \nThat said, there are counterpoint business arguments in favor of filtering fake news. Facebook has avoided many of the concerns about trolling and harassment that have been such a drag on Twitter’s prospects , in part because of evolving features that allow users to filter and report content and tailor their ad preferences. However, toxicity fueled by partisan fake news could eventually generate headwinds for Facebook similar to Twitter’s woes. \nIn a piece today from NPR, more than 150 respondents to an unscientific survey described reducing their Facebook use because of the intensity of the election environment. One, a Mormon supporter of independent conservative candidate Evan McMullen, described himself becoming “a meaner, more cynical person” thanks to Facebook, and limiting himself to an hour a week on the site. That’s a lot less than the nearly hour per day Facebook now gets from its average user. \nOf course, activists and pundits will protest that this is about more than business, that the fate of American political discourse is at stake. Maybe regulators will eventually agree, and start treating Facebook as a publisher (which would present a different set of huge business challenges). But those hoping Facebook cleans up its act do themselves no favors by pretending the bottom line here isn’t denominated, in large part, in dollars.",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nby Claire Bernish\nReports about Facebook’s and Google’s nascent battle against purported “fake news” must be considered in solemn gravity — not because there are bogus articles circulating — but because, in actuality, it constitutes a war on legitimate, factual information and dissenting opinion.\nCertainly, many of us grumble when an article about aliens invading New York City passes through our newsfeeds only to be taken seriously — but the so-called “problem” of “fake” news Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg is referring to isn’t targeting such vapid content.\nWhat Facebook will target, however, should concern all of us.\nAfter the absurdity that was the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton supporters and establishment Democrats excoriated Zuckerberg for dereliction of duty in failing to remove sham news articles and sites from his wildly popular platform — because, in their eyes, this putative “fake” news literally swung the election toward Donald Trump.\nBut this seemingly hapless campaign of finger-pointing — the Clinton camp also railed against FBI Director James Comey, among many others, in their search to blame anyone but themselves — has nothing at all to do with inane articles of no worth.\nRather, the new war on “fake” news is simply a poorly-disguised attempt to quash legitimate information unfavorable to the liberal establishment’s agenda — for good.\nThis perilous course of blanketing, State-sponsored censorship marks what might be the most overarching effort to kill dissenting opinion in decades — perhaps approaching or exceeding the height of the Red Scare and McCarthyism.\nHere’s why:\nMark Zuckerberg, a known proponent of establishment narrative and supporter of liberal goals, originally responded to this criticism somewhat rationally, saying the actual percentage of imposter news items is so miniscule, it could not possibly have affected the outcome of the election. He’s right. Or at least, he was.\n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,” the Facebook head wrote in a post to his site on Saturday. “The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nAfter the failed Clinton campaign turned and targeted Zuckerberg and Facebook with its bitter wrath of loss, he abruptly switched his tune — and a plan is now underway for how to “cope” with this “fake” news [non] “problem.”\nIt’s imperative to consider several points concerning Facebook’s burgeoning war — with over one billion users worldwide, no staff would be large enough to combat reports of fraudulent news that will undoubtedly be rolling in soon.\nSo, the plan? Artificial intelligence — a self-teaching algorithm to identify and remove the supposedly counterfeit news items, and likely relegate the source as a Scarlet Letter verboten site. But an issue of grave concern has already arisen before the war on fake news even gets off the ground.\nBusiness Insider boasted in a headline “It took only 36 hours for these students to solve Facebook’s fake-news problem” — but there’s a serious problem. Their algorithm failed . Miserably.\nIn fact, one of the two items touted by Business Insider as proof of the success of the spurious news-slaying algorithm can be proven factually true — nearly verbatim — on the government’s own website.\nAccording to Business Insider , the four students from various top universities participated in a recent hack-a-thon at Princeton University — which Facebook co-sponsored . In a mere 36 hours, they created an extension for the Chrome browser to ostensibly identify and parse out whether suspicious items constitute legitimate, truthful news, called “ FiB: Stop living a lie .”\n“It classifies every post, be it pictures (Twitter snapshots), adult content pictures, fake links, malware links, fake news links as verified or non-verified using artificial intelligence,” one of the students told the outlet.\n“For links, we take into account the website’s reputation, also query it against malware and phishing websites database and also take the content, search it on Google/Bing, retrieve searches with high confidence and summarize that link and show to the user. For pictures like Twitter snapshots, we convert the image to text, use the usernames mentioned in the tweet, to get all tweets of the user and check if current tweet was ever posted by the user.”\nAppearing smug in the article’s lead picture, Nabanita De, a second-year master’s student in computer science student at UMass Amherst; Anant Goel a freshmen in Purdue University; Mark Craft, a sophomore at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Catherine Craft, a sophomore also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, all believe they’ve discovered the quick fix to Zuckerberg’s [now] problem.\nAs an example, the extension identified and marked an article “not verified”; but the article, a report touting findings from the National Cancer Institute which appeared on the government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse site — “Marijuana Kills Cancer Cells, Admits the U.S. National Cancer Institute” — isn’t fake at all.\nFrom the government’s site , with emphasis added:\n“NIH-funded and other researchers are continuing to explore the possible uses of THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids for medical treatment.\n“For instance, recent animal studies have shown that marijuana extracts may help kill certain cancer cells and reduce the size of others. Evidence from one cell culture study suggests that purified extracts from whole-plant marijuana can slow the growth of cancer cells from one of the most serious types of brain tumors. Research in mice showed that treatment with purified extracts of THC and CBD , when used with radiation, increased the cancer-killing effects of the radiation.”\nimage: http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fb-fake.jpg\nImage: FiB\nBeyond this one example, and much further to the point, the Democratic establishment is leading the call to abolish “fake” news — a blaring alarm bell for anyone paying attention this election cycle.\nA trove of published leaked emails and documents by Wikileaks concerning the Democratic National Committee, campaign chair John Podesta, and Hillary Clinton, proved a staggering degree of corruption and collusion undertaken for years by establishment insiders and corporate media, which, for all intents and purposes, amounted to an attempt to throw the election in their favor.\nAs the campaign came under heavy fire from all sides, Clintonites were quick to shift blame and try to discredit the mountainous evidence of wrongdoing — first by blaming Wikileaks for trying to throw the election, then by claiming the information being published was fake.\nExcept it wasn’t .\nFor nearly the entire duration of its existence, Wikileaks has offered a prize of several hundred thousand dollars for anyone who can prove even a single document it published isn’t authentic . And that bounty, though challenged from time to time, remains unclaimed.\nAnd now the outgoing Democratic party wants to initiate a war on fake news? Nothing to see here, folks.\n“Everyone has the right to say what they want, have access to sites that they want, share what they want,” Obama and Democrat Party insider , Teddy Goff, told Politico — which, incidentally, starred in several damning emails for colluding with the Clinton campaign. “But a publisher with a record of making stuff up is not likely to rank that highly on Google, and the equivalent ought to be the case on Facebook. […]\n“Two, three weeks ago, many of us are beginning to talk about what a big problem this is, both from the campaign and from the administration, and just sort of broader Obama orbit, and are talking about, this is one of the things we would like to take on post-election. This is something we were very aware of, saw zero percent chance Facebook was going to be compliant or work with us during the election, but wanted to take on post-election.”\nRecall the aforementioned and justifiable doubt Zuckerberg originally expressed about the nonexistent “problem” of “fake” news — and consider Goff told Politico these ostensibly false news items posted to Facebook painted ‘Clinton as corrupt, criminal or otherwise beyond the political pale.’\nIn fact, evidence of corruption, media collusion, and highly questionable, if not explicitly criminal, activity now mar Hillary Clinton’s legacy as Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee — not because of bogus reporting. There was no need for fake items, and — although a few websites certainly blew points out of proportion — the emails, themselves damned Clinton’s campaign.\nThus, the liberal establishment’s war on fake news — for which the head of the largest social media platform has now been roped in — amounts to little more than a witch hunt to silence truthful, but damaging, information.\nInformation vital to the American public, imperative for making informed choices, and indispensable if this nation is still to be characterized as maintaining even a shred of freedom.\nEmploying failed algorithms — or even people — is a hopelessly flawed solution to a problem that simply doesn’t exist. And what will result is a war on alternative, independent media and opposing thought — in all forms.\nConsidering the insidious, wholly one-sided nature of this plan, it would be errant not to draw parallels to a new McCarthyism.\nIndeed, independent media websites likely did help turn the election away from Hillary Clinton — not by posting inane, false garbage, or slanted reporting — but by having the integrity to post the truth about her dealings behind the scenes.\nAnd, where corporate media failed in journalistic integrity and due diligence, alternative sources — led by Wikileaks — excelled…\n[more…]\nSteve Says…\nWhy are people still using facebook. It’s well known to spy on its users, store personal and statistical information, censor posts, manipulate what users see and cannot see and be part of the whole problem of mass surveillance.\nPhilosophers stone – selected views from the boat http://philosophers-stone.co.uk",

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) — A very powerful storm is bringing the first winter weather of the season to the northeast.\nAlong with snow and sleet there have been wind gusts close to 50 mph along with temperature drops of 30 degrees or more recorded in just a few hours. The cold front that brought that change there did move through our area early Sunday.\nAlthough it did not give the region a significant temperature drop, it did change our wind direction just enough to allow for some very dry air to start moving into the area. This, combined with a clear sky and a light breeze, will let the temperatures really drop after sunset Sunday evening.\nBy Monday morning, the entire area will be below 60 degrees with some areas inland dropping into the lower 50s.\nThe chill Monday morning will be brief as the clear skies and dry air will allow for plenty of sunshine and a quick warm up Monday morning. By noon Monday, the entire area should see temperatures into the 70s.\nAfter Monday, the wind shifts just enough to allow for moisture to return from the Atlantic, which will limit how low our temperatures can go at night. Lows will remain above 60 degrees for the remainder of the week.\n",

Post to Facebook RedZone host takes shot at Kaepernick for not voting That was unexpected.  //usat.ly/2gbsK6V   RedZone host takes shot at Kaepernick for not voting Andrew Joseph 6:31 p.m. EST November 20, 2016 \nColin Kaepernick put himself under increased scrutiny when he revealed that he didn't vote in the presidential election. Stephen A. Smith went as far as to call Kaepernick a \"flaming hypocrite\" for not voting despite leading an influential movement of anthem protests across sports. \nNFL RedZone host Scott Hanson found his own opportunity to throw shade at Kaepernick. \nDuring Sunday's RedZone broadcast, Hanson said that Kaepernick was not \"weighed down at all by that 'I Voted' sticker\" while calling the quarterback's first-down scramble. \nThe timing stands out as this was Kaepernick's second game since the election, but Hanson went with the jab anyway. \nHanson would later tweet to clarify his comment.

Post to Facebook Steph Curry visits young fan battling cancer on off day Very cool moment.  //usat.ly/2gbhiIs   Steph Curry visits young fan battling cancer on off day Andrew Joseph 5:57   \nScreenshot (Photo: Twitter) \nSteph Curry spent his off day in Indianapolis visiting one of his biggest fans at the hospital. \nBrody Stephens is just 7 years old, and he is battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Stephens was first diagnosed with cancer as a one-year-old. He was playing competitive basketball on a travel team when his cancer returned in December of 2015. \nThe game wasn't even two minutes in and Brody was asking to come out. \n\"He said, 'Dad, I just can't,'\" Stephens said. \"That's when I knew.\" \nRound 2 of the Stephens' family nightmare was back. \nIt's been seven months since that game. A Steph Curry pillowcase and blanket drape Brody's hospital bed at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health. His new, size 2Y Curry shoes, Golden State Warriors blue with yellow accents, sit unworn in a box. \nCurry heard of Brody's story and visited him in the hospital on Sunday. The two exchanged autographed jerseys.",

Rebecca Lurye rlurye@islandpacket.com Island Packet & Beaufort Gazette reporters Erin Heffernan (pictured) and Rebecca Lurye give weather updates through Facebook Live. Bluffton Mayor Lisa Sulka discusses weather updates through Facebook Live the morning of Oct. 8, 2016. Locals, both those who evacuated and those who stayed behind, connected through Facebook in the hours and days following Hurricane Matthew. This is a sample from a post on The Island Packet’s Facebook page the morning of Oct. 8, 2016. 1 of 9 Order Reprint of this Story \nAbout this series: In the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew’s destruction in Beaufort County, The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette asked local leaders and others to weigh in on what went well and what could have gone better. Lessons emerged that may better prepare us for when the next hurricane hits. \nOct. 8, 2016, 6:55 a.m. \n“So let me tell you what’s going on…” \nBluffton Mayor Lisa Sulka, her hair drenched, looks back at the screen as she gives her update. In the predawn hours, only darkness is visible behind her. \nMore than three days had passed since Gov. Nikki Haley ordered an evacuation of coastal counties in advance of the hurricane. Thousands packed up what they could and left the region, not certain when they would be able to return — or in what shape their home would be when they did. \nAfter a sleepless night for many, especially those who stayed behind, Hurricane Matthew finally passed Beaufort County’s coast en route to Myrtle Beach. \nBut how did the Lowcountry fare? \n“We have made it through the night,” Sulka says during her Facebook Live broadcast, “but we have no idea what is outside of Buckwalter Place. ...If you’re in town, stay in your house.” \nShe was one of the first voices heard after the worst of Hurricane Matthew wreaked havoc on the South Carolina coast. And she shared her words in real time, easily accessible to anyone with a Facebook account. \nWithin seconds came instant feedback from those watching: \n“Thank you, Lisa. We so appreciate your updates.” \n“Thanks Lisa! Be safe out there.” \n“Thanks for your updates - you’re the best!” \nIn all, the video has been seen 30,000 times — easily more views compared to Bluffton’s entire population. \nBeaufort County is no stranger to hurricanes or evacuations. But this time, we had a new tool at our disposal: social media. \nLive updates \nWithin hours, as the first images of damage in the Lowcountry emerged, social media became the hub for those desperate for information. At the touch of a button, those who evacuated could reach out and communicate with people still in the closed-off county — complete strangers in most cases — to see how things were back home. \nOn a single day, Oct. 8, the day Matthew did its worst on the Lowcountry, the Facebook following of The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette grew by more than 5,000 as people not only searched for the latest information, but also for those still in the area who could tell them how their home held up.",

Get Them on LinkedIn They don't even need to create an account to get started--but it could pay off big time down the road. Executive editor, TheMid.com , and founder, ProGhostwriters.com @ BillMurphyJr WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nIf you're a parent, you want your kids to be successful , and chances are are you wonder (or worry) what they're doing online. Maybe you aren't sure you even know all the social media platforms they use. \nSo, some good news. A study by the Pew Research Center (pdf) found that the five most popular social media platforms used by American teenagers are the old standbys: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and GooglePlus. \nBut next, there's some bad news: LinkedIn isn't on the list . W hile many of us have a love-hate relationship with LinkedIn, it's still by far the #1 professional networking site . \nAnd that means that if your kids start using it at a younger age, even just casually, they can get some great benefits out of it. \nBonus content: For more on how to raise successful kids, you can read my free e-book, How to Raise Successful Kids: Advice From a Stanford Dean, a Navy SEAL Commander, and Mark Zuckerberg's Dad . \nI'm not suggesting 5-year-olds should be creating LinkedIn profiles, of course. But if you have kids who are old enough to be thinking seriously about what they want to do \"when they grow up,\" here are some things they should do at least occasionally on LinkedIn. 1. Find virtual mentors. \nThis is the easiest, and perhaps most important thing to do. Long before kids begin truly thinking about their professional careers, they can start looking in detail at the paths other successful people followed. \nIf they want to be entrepreneurs, they can study the profiles of successful entrepreneurs. If they want to go into medicine or science, they can study the profiles of successful doctors and scientists. If they want to go into media, or architecture, or sports marketing, or politics, or almost any field, they can find virtual role models. \nThey'll be surprised at how much information they can find about the schools these people attended, the activities they were involved with, the relationships they developed, and the job paths they followed. And that can give them some smart ideas about where they should start. 2. Develop real-time critical reading skills. \nLinkedIn might be the \"professional\" social network, but people still behave on it the way they do on other social media. Namely, they often try to paint an unrealistic, overly positive image of themselves. \nIt makes sense, I suppose, since people are using the site to find job opportunities and business deals, and to impress other people. So they inflate their accomplishments--and skip over the 18 months they were unemployed, for example. \nAll of which makes this another good learning opportunity for young people. Don't just take at face value that an interesting virtual role model is being 100 percent truthful about his or her background. Think through whether the timelines make sense, and do a little Internet sleuthing to verify and fill in the gaps. The experience alone is worth it. 3. Create an account. \nThe first two suggestions don't require actually creating an account. However, it's likely a good idea for most young people to create one, even if they only fill in bare bones information. \nGranted, nobody knows whether LinkedIn will still be a dominant platform in a decade or so, but people have been incorrectly predicting its demise for a long time. But without an account, there's no way for people to reach them (obviously), or for them to make contact with the virtual role models they identify. (More on that in a minute.) \nSo why not get that vanity URL, at least? For what it's worth, I had https://www.linkedin.com/in/billmurphyjr for a couple of years before I actually used my account for anything. (Which reminds me, my profile needs a good updating.) 4. Ask questions. \nFinding virtual role models is great, but of course young people can take things farther than just reading profiles, and actually reach out to the people they find interesting. \nYou can and should guide them on how to do this: Be polite and concise, ask specific questions that won't take too long to answer, and be sure to follow up and express their thanks. They'll find that people are more willing to respond than they might expect. Plus, they have an advantage: There's nothing more flattering than a young person suggesting that he or she views you as a role model. It's a cold, hard person who doesn't offer at least a cursory reply. \nMoreover, since we know that there actually are a lot of cold, hard people in the world, reaching out on LinkedIn gives your kids an opportunity to learn another important lesson. Namely, if you want to succeed in just about anything, you must be willing to try 10, 20, or 100 times or more before you get the response you want. Like this column?

      "text": "David Iliff via Wikimedia Commons // CC BY-SA 3.0 Like us on Facebook \nAs part of The Telegraph ’s ongoing 360-degree video series, you can now take a tour of one of the oldest library systems in Europe. The halls of Oxford’s Bodleian Libraries are stunning and full of glorious biblio-history, but they also have another notable draw: They happen to be where the library scenes in the Harry Potter films were shot. \nThe reading room known as Duke Humfrey’s Library served as the Hogwarts library for the movies.

      "text": "YouTube Like us on Facebook \nSylvester Stallone wasn’t born a leading man. Complications at birth left the son of a hairdresser with nerve damage that slurred his speech and curled his lips into a permanent snarl. His childhood wasn’t easy. His parents fought constantly, and he and his brother slipped in and out of foster care. By high school, they’d moved back in with their mother in Philadelphia, but Stallone’s emotional problems followed him. He struggled academically and was expelled from multiple schools. The arts became his refuge. He spent his free time painting and writing poetry, but his real dream was the silver screen. By the time he was 18, he knew he wanted to act. \nStallone studied drama at the American College of Switzerland and then at the University of Miami, but then abandoned school to pursue a career in New York City. By his mid-twenties, he was getting by on odd jobs like cleaning lion cages and ushering at movie theaters. The bit parts he did manage to land were few and far between. Once, when funds were short, he took a role in an adult film to keep from living in a bus station. When Stallone landed bigger parts, it was because his drooping, stone-chiseled face made him the perfect heavy (Subway Thug No. 1. wasn’t an uncommon credit). By 1975, the 29-year-old actor was desperate for something bigger, so his agent sent him to the L.A. offices of Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, two producers who had a standing deal with United Artists. \nThe meeting didn’t go as planned. When Winkler and Chartoff met Stallone, they didn’t see a movie star. Dejected, Stallone had his hand on the doorknob when he turned and made one last pitch. “You know,” he said, “I also write.” \nThe script Stallone turned in was an underdog tale, the story of Rocky, a streetwise palooka who gets an unlikely opportunity to fight the heavyweight champion of the world. But the story of how the film itself got made is even more improbable. \nEarlier that same year, a boxer named Chuck Wepner had silenced the world. Pitted 40:1 against the heavily favored Muhammad Ali, Wepner landed a blow that knocked Ali down. Though Ali ultimately knocked out Wepner in the 15th round, Stallone was riveted by those moments in which it seemed like Wepner stood a chance. When he sat down to write a screenplay, it took him just three days to dash it off. \nStallone centered his story around Rocky Balboa, a club boxer plucked from obscurity and eager to go the distance. But Rocky would have the odds stacked against him. Even his trainer, a salty old cynic named Mickey, would write him off—until a once-in-a-lifetime chance to fight against brash champion (and Ali stand-in) Apollo Creed arises. \nTo ground his story, Stallone drummed up a love interest for Rocky: Adrian, a shy pet store employee. The unlikely romance allowed the film to become as much a character study as a genre slugfest. But when Stallone’s wife, Sasha, read an early draft, she pushed him to sand down his hero’s rough edges even more. In the rewrites, Rocky, who had started out as a violent thug, emerged as a gentle and deceptively wise soul who, in the actor’s words, “was good-natured, even though nature had never been good to him.” \nImpressed by the story’s heart, Winkler and Chartoff agreed to produce the film with United Artists, which gave them creative freedom for any picture budgeted under $1.5 million. But the studio balked. A boxing picture and all its trappings—extras, location, and arena shooting—just couldn’t be made for so little money. And with a nobody in the lead role, the flick seemed doomed to box office failure. Chartoff and Winkler countered by offering to make the movie for less than a million, promising to cover any overages out of pocket, and the producers sent the studio a print of Stallone’s recent independent film, The Lords of Flatbush , to seal the deal. With no one in the screening room to recognize him, the executives assumed handsome costar Perry King was the young nobody who had written the script. \nFine, they said. Go make your boxing movie. \nThe small budget meant that the production team had to get creative. Interiors were shot in L.A., since a full 28-day shoot in Philadelphia was too pricey. Instead, the team spent less than a week on location, quietly shooting exteriors using a nonunion crew. Driving around in a nondescript van, director John Avildsen would spot an interesting locale—a portside ship, a food market—and usher Stallone out to jog, sometimes for miles, while he rolled film. It wasn’t long before the actor gave up smoking. \nThe slim budget was evident everywhere. Stallone’s wardrobe was plucked from his own closet. His wife worked as the set photographer. But it was more than that— the movie’s finances also meant that the director had to be choosy about how many shots to film. A crucial scene where Rocky confesses his fears about the fight to Adrian (played by Talia Shire) was almost cut before Stallone begged the producers to give him just one take. The scene became the film’s emotional spine. \nWhen the director proposed shooting a date between Rocky and Adrian at an ice rink, the producers laughed. A rink full of extras, combined with the costs of filming all the takes, seemed risky. But when Stallone convinced them of the scene’s worth, they wrote around it. In the movie, Rocky pays off a manager to let the duo skate in an empty rink. The result was easier to shoot and made for a beautiful metaphor: a clumsy dance between two misfits, each holding the other up. \nBut improvisation wasn’t always an option. For Rocky’s climactic bout with Creed, Stallone and actor Carl Weathers rehearsed five hours a day for a week. Though both were incredible physical specimens, neither had ever boxed and their earliest attempts were exhausting. (Ironically, only Burt Young, cast as Rocky’s sad-sack pal Paulie, had any actual ring experience: He was 14–0 as a pro.) When the director saw their first sparring efforts, he told Stallone to go home and write out the beats. Stallone returned with 14 pages of lefts, rights, counters, and hooks, all delivered using camera-friendly gloves too small to be legal in a real prizefight. As they practiced, Avildsen circled them with an 8mm camera, recording them to point out their weaknesses. He even zoomed in on Stallone’s waistline to remind him he needed to shape up. \nStudying all that footage paid off. The fight was shot in front of 4,000 restless extras, corralled with the promise of a free chicken dinner. In the original ending, Rocky walks off with Adrian backstage. But composer Bill Conti’s score was so soaring that the director decided to reshoot the finale, despite having run out of funds. The producers paid for the overage themselves, allowing for the unforgettable final scene: Rocky in the ring, with Adrian fighting through the crowd to reach him, her hat pulled off by a crew member using fishing wire. The image freezes with Rocky embracing her— stopping at what Stallone later called the pinnacle of Rocky’s life. It was the perfect crescendo to an emotional journey—not only for Rocky, but for his alter ego. \nThe parallels between the actor’s story and Rocky’s were not lost on United Artists’ marketing strategist, Gabe Sumner. A clever publicist, Sumner knew he had quite the task in front of him: selling an old-fashioned boxing movie starring a nobody. Rocky ’s competition at the box office didn’t make it any easier. Late 1976 was filled with blockbusters, and Stallone’s hero had to battle with King Kong , a new Dirty Harry sequel, and Carrie for ticket sales. \nTo compete, Sumner turned up the volume on Stallone’s shaggy-dog story. He sold the narrative about Stallone, a self-made actor-writer who had scraped and clawed his way to the top, as irresistibly American. And he bent the facts a little, too. In Sumner’s version, studio execs offered Stallone hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep the script if they could cast a bankable movie star in the role. The impoverished actor, despite having a pregnant wife and just $106 in the bank, stood his ground. He hitchhiked to auditions. He had to sell his dog. But Stallone wasn’t a sellout, and this was his one chance to break through. The truth, Sumner later admitted, was that the studio had never met Stallone. None of it mattered, though—this was Madison Avenue mythmaking at its best. \nThe marketing strategy struck a chord. The actor’s tale so perfectly mirrored his onscreen role that the film received significant attention from both the media and audiences. And as word of mouth spread, Rocky became the highest-grossing picture of 1976, earning more than $117 million at the box office (the average ticket price at the time was just over $2). Audiences were equally captivated by the soundtrack. “Gonna Fly Now,” Conti’s trumpet-heavy theme, which accompanied Rocky’s training montage, moved more than 500,000 units. \nThough some critics, including The New York Times’ reviewer, panned the flick for its sentimentality, most media embraced it. \" Rocky KOs Hollywood,\" crowed a Newsweek cover. The Academy agreed. At the 1977 Academy Awards, Rocky became the first sports film to win Best Picture, beating out heavy hitters Network , All the President’s Men , and Taxi Driver . Frank Capra and Charlie Chaplin wrote Stallone congratulatory letters. He became a bona fide movie star, anointed by two Hollywood legends who had built their careers making heroes of the common man. \nToday, Rocky's boxing trunks hang in the Smithsonian. Wedding ceremonies have been held at his statue near Philadelphia’s Museum of Art. Fans still run up the adjacent steps, mimicking his sprint to glory. As for Stallone, he was inducted into the Boxing Hall of Fame in 2011, making him the only actor ever to receive the honor. In his vision of a gentle slugger searching for an opportunity to shine despite the longest odds, Stallone crafted a story that continues to resonate with millions of moviegoers: It’s the American dream played out at 24 frames per second. \nWhen Sumner’s publicity exaggerations were discovered in 2006, few seemed to care. Perhaps that’s because as a character, Rocky did more than go toe-to-toe with Apollo Creed. At a time when Taxi Driver ’s sociopathic antihero Travis Bickle preyed on audience fears and Network played to the bleak pessimism of a struggling nation, Rocky reminded the country what it means to hope. As Sylvester Stallone once said, “If I say it, you won’t believe it. But when Rocky said it, it was the truth.” More from mental_floss...",

Recent Articles & Blogs by Dave Begel \"unSilent Night\" a tempting and heart-warming holiday treat at Next Act \n  \nSometimes hokey, predictable and heart-warming story is just what the doctor ordered for a spirit worn out by conflict and controversy and that's just what you get with \"unSilent Night\" the locally written play that is running at Next Act Theatre. Rep's \"The Foreigner\" is a Milwaukee institution that resonates clearly today \nPublished Nov. 19, 2016 \nOther cities have plays and playwrights they call their own, and if Milwaukee has one, it could well be \"The Foreigner\" by Larry Shue. The play had its world premiere 33 years ago at The Rep and is being staged again for the first time since 2003. The triumph of evil results from good people doing nothing \nPublished Nov. 17, 2016 \nLike many Americans, the past week for me has been one of trying to figure out just what to do about Donald Trump being elected. I know there is a huge cry for unity, but Trump doesn't deserve my unity. He deserves my fight, and that's what I'm going to do. Actor McLellan bides her time to create more magic on Milwaukee stages \nPublished Nov. 15, 2016 \nOne of the greatest joys of being a theater critic is the memory bank that finds spots for moments that are chiseled in stone. Marti Gobel in \"No Child\" is one of my moments. And Mary C. McLellan in \"The Nightmare Room\" is one of my moments. Shame on us liberal elites for missing all the signs \nPublished Nov. 9, 2016 \nShame. On. Me. Me and my friends never, ever, thought they could pull this off. We were smarter and righter and more compassionate and more sensitive and we cared more and we knew how to do all this stuff and they ... well, they didn't. Theatre Red partnership with WLC produces a road map for success \nPublished Nov. 8, 2016 \nFor small, young theater companies, the struggle of getting a production up and running is almost immeasurable. It's a daunting task - and not for the faint of heart. Theatre Red's collaboration with WLC, however, is a road map on how to make it easier. Irving Berlin touches the American soul in Rep's spectacular \"I Love a Piano\" \nPublished Nov. 7, 2016 \nIrving Berlin captured the soul of America with his music and the Stackner Cabaret opened a show Sunday night that pays tribute to his over 1,500 songs and his miraculous touch for capturing moments in the history of America. It's a spellbinding show. Theatre Red lights up the stage with female pirate tale \"Bonny Anne Bonny\" \nPublished Nov. 5, 2016 \nHaving just killed her traitorous husband, Anne Bonny stands over his body, staring at what she has wrought.\"If you had fought like a man,\" she snarls, \"you wouldn't have died like a dog.\" That's the essence of \"Bonny Anne Bonny,\" staged by Theatre Red. Sexual power battles captivate in Off the Wall's \"Venus in Fur\" \nPublished Nov. 4, 2016 \nDavid Ives' play \"Venus in Fur,\" which opened at Off the Wall Theater Thursday night and runs through Nov. 13, is about sexual power politics and a special desire, if not under the elms, then at least under the klieg lights. Whether it's Clinton or Trump, America is in for a rocky ride \nPublished Nov. 3, 2016 \nI'm stoked and stocked for Tuesday night and beyond. I'm excited about the end of this endless election. And I've got all the supplies I need for the Donald Trump presidency: antacids, sleeping pills and my own personal copy of the Constitution. Everything New",

The Facebook sign and logo is seen in Menlo Park, California on November 4, 2016. Photo by Josh Edelson/ AFP \nLONDON, United Kingdom – Facebook will open a new London headquarters next year and create another 500 jobs, the leading social network said on Monday, November 21, despite uncertainty over Brexit. \nThe group said the move will take its UK workforce to 1,500 staff, adding that Britain \"remains one of the best places to be a tech company\", amid ongoing jitters over the nation's looming exit from the European Union. \nThe news comes one week after US tech giant Google confirmed it would expand its vast London campus in a move that could bring 3,000 more jobs. \nThe Facebook announcement will be confirmed later at the annual meeting of top business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry, which is the country's top employers' organization. \n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" said Nicola Mendelsohn, the company's vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n\"We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1500 people,\" she added in a statement. \n\"Many of those new roles will be high skilled engineering jobs as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US.\" \nA spokeswoman added that the new office is currently under construction in the bohemian central district of Fitzrovia. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the news from the US giant. \n\"Facebook's decision to expand in London is further evidence that London’s strength as a tech hub keeps on growing,\" Khan said. \n\"It follows news that London remains the best city in Europe for digital startups. \n\"The capital's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.\" \nLast Tuesday, Google revealed it will add a new office building to a complex currently under development behind London's King's Cross train station. \nAn estimated 3,000 jobs will be created by the move. A total of 7,000 Google staff will eventually be working at the hub, which is set to open in 2018. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL? Happy",

      "text": "04:01 PM, November 21, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 04:03 PM, November 21, 2016 Facebook to open new London HQ, create 500 jobs 0 Viber Copy this link Facebook says a new London headquarters will take its British workforce to 1,500 staff, adding that Britain \"remains one of the best places to be a tech company\". Photo: AFP AFP, London \nFacebook will open a new London headquarters next year and create another 500 jobs, the leading social network said Monday, despite uncertainty over Brexit. The group said the move will take its UK workforce to 1,500 staff, adding that Britain \"remains one of the best places to be a tech company\", amid ongoing jitters over the nation's looming exit from the European Union. The news comes one week after US tech giant Google confirmed it would expand its vast London campus in a move that could bring 3,000 more jobs. The Facebook announcement will be confirmed later at the annual meeting of top business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry, which is the country's top employers' organisation. \"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" said Nicola Mendelsohn, the company's vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \"We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1500 people,\" she added in a statement. \"Many of those new roles will be high skilled engineering jobs as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US.\" A spokeswoman added that the new office is currently under construction in the bohemian central district of Fitzrovia. London Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the news from the US giant. \"Facebook's decision to expand in London is further evidence that London’s strength as a tech hub keeps on growing,\" Khan said. \"It follows news that London remains the best city in Europe for digital startups. \"The capital's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.\" Last Tuesday, Google revealed it will add a new office building to a complex currently under development behind London's King's Cross train station. An estimated 3,000 jobs will be created by the move. A total of 7,000 Google staff will eventually be working at the hub, which is set to open in 2018. \n ",

      "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/afumedia \nKudzu root may be Traditional Chinese Medicine’s best-kept secret. This plant from the pea family is also known as Japanese arrowroot for its thickening powers. What isn’t so heavily broadcast is its calming effect, which provides powerful natural anxiety relief — so powerful, in fact, that some kudzu-lovers are starting to nickname it a natural Xanax. \nTricia Williams, executive chef and founder of Food Matters NYC , is bringing kudzu out of the shadows and taking full advantage of all of its properties with her Xanax Pudding. \n“It has a really calming effect on the body,” she says. “We have a couple of typical female New York clients, like working, crazy, all over the place, who kind of deal with anxiety at night and have a harder time mind-quieting and relaxing, and when we give them Xanax Pudding, as one of my clients has named it, they find it really helps them to calm down.” \nKudzu doesn’t just bring about natural anxiety relief, however. Traditional medicine, going back 2,000 years, uses it as a cold treatment and to stabilize blood sugar and blood pressure. It is rich in flavonoids, and can help treat indigestion, and anecdotal evidence — and a recent study — have even shown that kudzu can help treat recovering alcoholics . \nUnlike many pharmaceuticals, kudzu is not addictive and can be safely used every day. \n“Our approach as a company and my approach personally is always to seek out what could be found in nature and that is organic and less stressful and taxing on the body than going straight to medication,” explains Williams. And pudding is just a more fun way of consuming this healthful, helpful herb. \nWilliams has several different kudzu root pudding recipes that she changes up depending on the season. Since kudzu has no flavor of its own, you can mix it with pretty much any ingredients you like and come up with a delicious pudding — berries, for example, or her son’s favorite, apple. \nThe only thing she shies away from is chocolate, which contains caffeine and thus can negate some of the calming effects of the root. \n“Right now, my favorite way is to mix it with coconut milk and some fall spices like cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, that kind of thing,” says Williams. \nAccording to Williams, the pudding can help bring about natural anxiety relief in just one hour.

REUTERS/Stefanie Loos/File Photo \nLONDON (Reuters) - Facebook said it would expand its UK presence by 50 percent in 2017, joining U.S. technology peer Google in boosting investment in Britain despite the uncertainty sparked by the vote to leave the European Union. \nSocial network firm Facebook said it would hire 500 new staff, adding to the 1,000 people it already employs in Britain, as it gears up to open a new headquarters in London next year. \nBefore the Brexit referendum in June, pro-Remain campaigners had warned that international companies could seek to reduce their presence in Britain as withdrawing from the EU would make it a less attractive place to invest. \nBut Facebook said on Monday that was not the case. \n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" Europe, Middle East and Africa vice-president Nicola Mendelsohn will say at a conference run by the CBI, an employers group, later on Monday. \nFacebook's expansion comes after Google, owned by parent company Alphabet Inc, said earlier in November that it would invest in thousands of extra engineers as part of its move to a new London building. \nBritain is also benefiting from the growth of online retailer Amazon, which expects to create 3,500 UK jobs in 2016, including at its head office, research and development centres, customer service centres and distribution depots. \nIt plans a further 2,300 at three new distribution centres in 2017. \nFacebook said many of its new jobs would be in the high-skilled engineering sector. \n(Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton) BRIEF-Fajarbaru Builder says associate nominated to acquire property Reuters - 12 minutes ago Nov 21 (Reuters) - Fajarbaru Builder Group Bhd : * Associate of co nominated by one of 320-Q's shareholders, beulah land international to acquire property from Celtic Club Inc * Contract for total cash ... … More » One of Britain’s biggest unions is ratcheting up its war on Uber Business Insider - 19 minutes ago Thomson Reuters A photo illustration shows the Uber … Continued The post One of Britain’s biggest unions is ratcheting up its war on Uber appeared first on Business Insider. … More » Mitie warns again on profits, to pull out of home healthcare market Reuters - 24 minutes ago The provider of pest control to property cleaning, security and healthcare services reported a 39 percent fall in operating profits to 35.4 million pounds ($43.7 million) for the six months ended Sept. 30 and said it expected underlying earnings for … More » Alibaba Cloud stretches global reach with four new facilities Reuters - 26 minutes ago Alibaba Cloud plans to open four new data facilities outside China, the cloud unit of Alibaba Holdings Ltd said on Monday, as it seeks to grab global market share from leading players Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft.

Published:November 21, 2016 4:53 pm Facebook is set to open its new headquarters in London. (File Photo) \nSocial media giant Facebook on Monday announced that it will open its new London headquarters next year and create another 500 jobs in the UK, doubling its presence in the country despite uncertainty over Brexit. The expansion plan by the California-based technology firm was announced a week after US tech giant Google said it would expand its vast London campus in a move that could bring 3,000 more jobs for Brexit-hit Britain. Facebook firm will hire 500 additional employees, including engineers, marketers, project managers and sales staff as part of its plan to expand its UK presence. \nWatch What Else Is Making \n“The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company,” said Facebook’s London-based executive, Nicola Mendelsohn. The firm’s new headquarters will be in Fitzrovia in central London at a site that is currently undergoing redevelopment. The majority of the new staff will be based there. Mendelsohn officially announced the expansion plan at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference in London. “Many of those new jobs will be high-skilled engineering posts as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside the US,” said Mendelsohn, who is vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Facebook. \nEngineers at Facebook’s London office are continuing the development of Workplace, a platform devised to improve communications between workers within a business, launched last month. London mayor Sadiq Khan said: “Facebook’s decision to expand in London is further evidence that London’s strength as a tech hub keeps on growing.” \n“The capital’s vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook’s continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.” Best of Express ",

      "text": "London: Facebook will open a new London headquarters next year and create another 500 jobs, the leading social network said Monday, despite uncertainty over Brexit.\nThe group said the move will take its UK workforce to 1,500 staff, adding that Britain \"remains one of the best places to be a tech company\", amid ongoing jitters over the nation's looming exit from the European Union.\nThe news comes one week after US tech giant Google confirmed it would expand its vast London campus in a move that could bring 3,000 more jobs.\nThe Facebook announcement will be confirmed later at the annual meeting of top business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry, which is the country's top employers' organisation.\n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" said Nicola Mendelsohn, the company's vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n\"We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1500 people,\" she added in a statement.\n\"Many of those new roles will be high skilled engineering jobs as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US.\"\nA spokeswoman added that the new office is currently under construction in the bohemian central district of Fitzrovia.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the news from the US giant.\n\"Facebook's decision to expand in London is further evidence that London's strength as a tech hub keeps on growing,\" Khan said.\n\"It follows news that London remains the best city in Europe for digital startups.\n\"The capital's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.\"\nLast Tuesday, Google revealed it will add a new office building to a complex currently under development behind London's King's Cross train station.\nAn estimated 3,000 jobs will be created by the move. A total of 7,000 Google staff will eventually be working at the hub, which is set to open in 2018.",

      "text": "FYI In touching Facebook post, Kerala bank employee thanks villagers for cooperation on demonetisation A South Indian Bank employee from Kerala, Ramdas Kadavallur, wrote a heartfelt Facebook post and thanked villagers for the tremendous cooperation offered in tackling the demonetisation crisis. Long queue in front of South Indian Bank branch in Kizhisseri town of Kerala's Malappuram district. Photo: Facebook\\RamdasKadavallur \nSince prime minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on November 8, millions across the country have been rushing to the banks to exchange old notes and deposit money. Bank employees are doing their best to help customers, and while a section of people are whining about the inconveniences the demonetisation drive has caused, many people are doing their bit to make things better. For instance , chaiwalas and paanwalas went cashless, rocking demonetisation with e-banking , in Bengaluru and Delhi, bank had mobile ATMs to help people , and a church in Kerala even opened its collection box to help people with no money . \nNow, a similar story has come from Kerala's Malappuram district. Ramdas Kadavallur, a South Indian Bank employee at Kizhisseri branch in the district wrote a heartwarming Facebook post and thanked the villagers for the kind of support and cooperation they showed in tackling the massive rush the demonetisation drive led to. \nHere's a close translation of what Ramdas wrote in Malayalam: \n\"I have to thank the villagers the most. \nIn my ten years of service, the last few days have been the most taxing. There were so many people at the bank, standing in queues with notes in their hands. Among them were the ill, elderly, exhausted, those who had to attend to people in hospitals, farmers...and these people form the queue as early as 5 AM. Each day, I cut through them to get to my seat. \nIn Malappuram district's Kizhisseri village, other than the co-operative banks, most of the people depend on the bank I'm working with - South Indian Bank. Many of our customers are farmers, small-business owners and those who are working abroad. The sudden demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes and lack of enough cash stored in denominations of Rs 100 affected majority of them. Since there are only less number of banks in a 7-km-radius, people from eight to ten nearby villages depend on my bank too. Photo courtesy: Facebook (Ramdas Kadavallur) \nI don't know how to express my gratitude to all these villagers. There have been many instances during my tenure when I could see how humane people are, but the last few days, I experienced humanity the most. \nYoung men who volunteered to help bank employees pacify frantic crowds, villagers who ensured we ate properly since we were working overtime, people who curbed their impatience and exhaustion from standing in queues for hours and understood problems the staff members were facing...saying \"thank you\" to all these people would become quite formal, it would be more apt to say \"heartfelt love to all\". Photo courtesy: Facebook (Ramdas Kadavallur) \nHelping others when they need it the most is something that gives immense satisfaction; yet I am sad I couldn't everyone's demands. However, I'm glad to know that they have no complaints when it comes to the way bank employees dealth with them and how transparent the processes were. \nWhatever be the conflicting views on the Central government's decision to demonetise these notes, as a bank employee, these views will not affect my duties and responsibilities. Each day begins and ends with listening to many struggles, sorrows and apprehensions of various people. Compared to that, my problems are so irrelevant. Photo courtesy: Facebook (Ramdas Kadavallur) Photo courtesy: Facebook (Ramdas Kadavallur) \nThere is one other set of people I need to thank. Perhaps those who were more tensed than me. It is only on the pay scale that they are junior subordinates to me, otherwise they are my friends. By the time they finish counting all the notes we got in a day and tallying them, clock would have struck midnight. \nIt is their sacrifice and hardwork that is getting all of us, including me, the kind of love, affection and support we are getting from this Kizhisseri village. \nToday, I love my job more than ever.\" \nRamdas, possibly the manager of the branch, did not forget to tag his subordinates Sharafudheen Chenganakattil, Riya Francis, Sony Rose and Joseph Poulose in the post. \nHere's his full Facebook post for those who can read Malayalam: For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.

      "text": "Facebook to open new London HQ, create 500 new UK jobs Photo: Reuters \nFacebook will open a new London headquarters next year and create another 500 jobs, the leading social network said Monday, despite uncertainty over Brexit. \nThe group said the move will take its UK workforce to 1,500 staff, adding that Britain \"remains one of the best places to be a tech company\", amid ongoing jitters over the nation's looming exit from the European Union. \nThe news comes one week after US tech giant Google confirmed it would expand its vast London campus in a move that could bring 3,000 more jobs. \nThe Facebook announcement will be confirmed later at the annual meeting of top business lobby group the Confederation of British Industry, which is the country's top employers' organisation. \n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" said Nicola Mendelsohn, the company's vice president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. \n\"We came to London in 2007 with just a handful of people, by the end of next year we will have opened a new HQ and plan to employ 1500 people,\" she added in a statement. \n\"Many of those new roles will be high skilled engineering jobs as the UK is home to our largest engineering base outside of the US. \n\" A spokeswoman added that the new office is currently under construction in the bohemian central district of Fitzrovia. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the news from the US giant. \n\"Facebook's decision to expand in London is further evidence that London's strength as a tech hub keeps on growing,\" Khan said. \n\"It follows news that London remains the best city in Europe for digital startups. \n\"The capital's vibrant tech scene is the envy of Europe and Facebook's continuing commitment is another sign that London is open to talent, innovation and entrepreneurship from all four corners of the world.\" \nLast Tuesday, Google revealed it will add a new office building to a complex currently under development behind London's King's Cross train station. \nAn estimated 3,000 jobs will be created by the move. A total of 7,000 Google staff will eventually be working at the hub, which is set to open in 2018. No comments yet.Be the first to post comment. Tech Deals ",

      "text": "The results showed that the treatment group reported significantly higher “life satisfaction” and more positive emotions after staying away from Facebook. A remarkable paper claims that staying off Facebook for a week could make you happier: The Facebook Experiment, by Morten Tromholt of Denmark. What makes this study so interesting is that it was a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and so was able, at least in theory, to determine whether quitting Facebook actually causes changes in well-being. Previously, there has been lots of research reporting correlations between social network use and happiness, but correlation isn’t causation. Tromholt recruited (via Facebook, of course) 1,095 Danish participants, who were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. The ‘treatment group’ were instructed not to use Facebook for one week, and were recommended to uninstall the Facebook app from their phones if they had it. At the end of the study, 87 per cent of the treatment group reported having successfully avoided Facebook the whole week. Meanwhile, the ‘control group’ were told to continue using the site normally.\nThe results showed that the treatment group reported significantly higher “life satisfaction” and more positive emotions vs the control group (p < 0.001 in both cases). These effects were relatively small, however, for instance, the group difference in life satisfaction was 0.37 on a scale that ranged from 1-10. Tromholt concludes, “People’s emotional life improves significantly when they quit Facebook for one week. Millions of hours are spent on Facebook each day. We are surely better connected now than ever before, but is this new connectedness doing any good to our well-being? According to the present study, the answer is no.” This is a nice little study, but in my mind it doesn’t prove all that much. The trial wasn’t blinded — i.e. the participants of necessity knew which group they were in and the outcome measures were all purely subjective, self-report questionnaires. Bearing in mind that those who volunteered for the study probably wanted to cut down on their Facebook use to some extent (otherwise why enroll?), it’s not hard to imagine that the ‘treatment’ group expected to feel better upon quitting and, hence, did so (the placebo effect) or at least reported doing so (demand effect). It’s also worth noting that one week is not very long — we really want to know the effects of quitting social media over months or years.\n—Source:www.blogs.discovermagazine.com",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nIn my mind, two things definitely don’t go together: ancient China and Mickey Mouse. For artist Lizabeth Eva Rossof , this is not the case. The San Francisco-based artist has replicated the Terracotta Warriors and given them the heads of American cartoon characters. \nFor those of you who may not have paid attention in world history class, here’s a bit of a debrief. \nOver 2,000 years ago in China, tomb workers built a life-sized army out of clay, depicting the armies of the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. They created thousands of warriors, sculpted in immaculate detail for their emperor’s tomb to keep him company on his post-death joyride. The Terracotta Warriors were discovered recently (relatively speaking) by farmers in 1974. Th eir excavation is regarded as one of the greatest discoveries of the 20 th century. The Terracotta Warriors are now one of the top tourist attractions in China and a UNESCO world cultural heritage site. \nClearly Rossof saw an opportunity to shake up folks’ brains by doing a face swap with the old and the new. According to Beautiful/Decay , Rosssof’s work “explores the concerns of American media’s global influence and China’s industry of counterfeiting the copyrighted properties held by said media.” \nMade of terracotta clay just like the originals, these pop culture warriors stand only 18 inches tall. I can’t see them winning any battles, but they’re great for starting conversation. \nRossof’s warriors are available for purchase. Visit her website for the details. \nImages below from Designer Daily . About the author \nI’m a South Carolinian who ended up in Australia. I’m a leather-wearing vegetarian, and I like to read poetry written by people I know. @Nemiwai Like (0) Videos from Lost At E Minor TV Connect with us",

      "text": "Doug Kass shares his views every day on RealMoneyPro. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings.\nEmbracing the Contrary\nOriginally published Nov. 17 at 7:47 a.m. EDT\nTwo days ago, my opening missive discussed the importance of contrary thinking . Let's begin this morning by considering and examining some possible contraries--some that I embrace, some that I don't embrace--and how markets may be impacted. Many of these contraries are obviously emanating from political uncertainties.\nSome of the following outliers and non-consensus developments should be used as food for thought:\nInterest Rates: Back in July, I called for a Generational Bottom in Bond Yields . I received a consistent Bronx cheer from the stands for this forecast, as many that previously had seen a spike in rates over the last few years now saw rates low forever. At that time back in early July, the 10-year U.S. note yield bottomed at 1.32%. This week the 10-year U.S. note yield hit 2.30% and, after an increase in yields of 100 basis points, the consensus is firmly now in the higher interest rate camp. (As an example, some vocal observers such as Mark Grant, who had been looking for a 1% 10-year yield weeks ago, is now assuming rates will climb higher). Should the new Trump administration's promised goal of more rapid economic growth be delayed or fail, rates will head right back down and yield spreads would flatten anew. (This morning the 10-year note yield is slightly below 2.2%, down by two basis points). Note: I believe that, at least over the short term, a long trade in bonds might be ahead. Sector Strength : Lower rates would have broad sector implications. As an example, everyone's new favorite--bank stocks--would turn back down after a rip-roaring post-election move. Industrial stocks also would fall back to earth. The Economy : How about the impact on the consumer of a $1 trillion bond market loss in the last month? Or an adverse impact of climbing rates on the refinancing market? How about the Trump transition? Again, should this transition be less smooth or meet opposition, any assumed economic benefits also would be delayed. So, what if the economy slows down further in the months ahead and we have seen a top in yields for months to come? What if it becomes clearer that the consensus 2017 S&P earnings forecast is way too optimistic for what would be the fifth year in a row? Secular Growth Threats : Neither the Democrats nor Republicans are addressing the intermediate-term structural issues that are a threat to growth and create disruptions in the jobs market. Maybe the Republican policy implemented provides only a temporary relief to longer-term problems and the markets could see right through this, and falter. The Trump Presidency (Part One): Suppose as the economy is weakening, growth-encouraging policy and tax policies are slow to be introduced? At best there will be a hiatus, as implementation of these policies becomes a late 2017/early 2018 event. The Trump Presidency (Part Two): Is a brief presidential honeymoon ahead? Though a minority, some critics are more concerned with a disorganized Trump administration, characterized by authoritarian impulses, cronyism and incompetence. After all, the office's power is immense and the president is the most powerful person in the world. For now there is some expected in-fighting within the Republican Party. As yet there have been no roadblocks placed by the Democratic Party (even opposition to Steve Bannon has been limited) amid an incoherent process, but this, too, could change more quickly as the Democrats conceivably could get their act together. The Trump Presidency (Part Three): Suppose Trump's tax cuts, if implemented, are a failure and don't trickle down, but, once again trickle up? Suppose his policy does Make America Great Again, but is restricted to the One Percenters? Then what happens to Trump's popularity when the middle class he wants to be elevated is demoted and not restored, again? The Trump Presidency (Part Four): Finally, in a broader sense, there is still a legitimate question about Trump leadership and his ability to govern coherently. The President-elect's ability to govern is totally untested--even his defendants recognize it requires a leap of faith. Trump may be determined but, with little background in government, the new administration's governing philosophy is not yet recognizable. As I have previously expressed, we don't yet know how Trump will govern; this makes things of a market-kind uncertain. The Democratic Party's Opposition : The Democrats, like the Republicans, have their own set of problems as they are caught in their own cul-de-sac. Facing a bleak few years, the Democratic leadership is old and there is a lot of tension. It is uncertain where the next leadership comes from, but should the Dems get their act together while there is some Trump administration delays, the opposition could have more impact and a more forceful policy influence on the Republicans. In other words, the Democrats may be down but not out, and how much of the Republican policies ultimately will be implemented is a big question mark. Facebook and FANG : Facing its second significant issue in a month, the consensus favorite stock could disappoint in the months ahead. Maybe Facebook ( FB ) is a better short than long. FANG stocks may continue to be weighed down by fears of trade wars, a stronger currency and other threats to world trade. Gold: The yellow metal is a hated asset. What if gold is the buy of the decade and breaks out under the aforementioned U.S. political issues? The U.S. Dollar : Buoyed by confidence in pro-growth Trump initiatives and a Fed rate hike, our currency is strengthening. If economic growth slows and the U.S. dollar's strength continues, might we again have to ratchet down forecast global and corporate profit growth for 2017-2018? Inflation : Consensus is for a slow increase in inflation. Suppose the pattern is quicker? Are the markets (bond and stocks) prepared for this? The Year-End Rally: Everyone every year expects a year-end rally, and 2016 is no exception. But suppose that large hedge fund redemptions are much greater than expected. Who is left to buy to offset that selling? Fraud : We haven't had a giant company fraud, a meaningful hedge fund fraud or any other fraud for some time. Suppose something comes up? I have a hunch about one big one. Stay tuned! I have some more contraries, but I will wait for my 15 Surprises for 2017 next month.",

      "text": "What Brexit? Facebook to increase UK presence by 50 percent What Brexit? Facebook to increase UK presence by 50 percent The Silicon Valley company is set to expand its British engineering team and open a new London HQ in 2017. What Brexit? Facebook to increase UK presence by 50 percent 0 \nFacebook hosted a Brexit debate with then UK Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this year. Photo by BuzzFeed News/Facebook/Getty Images \nFacebook isn't batting an eyelid over Brexit -- it still sees the UK as a great place to invest. \nThe Silicon Valley-based social network announced on Monday that it was expanding its UK-based operations by 50 percent next year, as well as opening a new, bigger London headquarters. \nFacebook will boost its UK headcount to 1,500, said the company's vice president of EMEA Nicola Mendelsohn, speaking at the CBI business conference in London. The UK is Facebook's biggest engineering base outside of the US, building products such as Workplace , and the new roles will make London an even larger engineering hub for the company. More on Brexit London to tech startups: Please don't mind the Brexit gap \n\"Facebook's decision to expand in London is further evidence that London's strength as a tech hub keeps on growing,\" said Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, reacting to the news in a statement. \nFollowing the UK's decision to leave the European Union in May there was widespread concern that the country would become a less attractive place for foreign companies to do business. But Facebook has not been dissuaded from investing in the UK following the Brexit vote, and it's not alone. \nGoogle also views London as an important hub and said earlier this month that it would be investing in thousands of new engineering roles in the UK. Likewise, Amazon said in June that by the end of 2016 it expects to have created 3,500 new jobs in the UK across multiple departments. \nThe country also presents another opportunity to Facebook in the form of small businesses that have a presence on the social network. More than 300 million people from around the world are connected to a small business in the UK and almost 30 million people on Facebook in the UK are connected to at least one UK business, according to the social network. \nHelping small businesses grow these numbers and connect with new customers creates opportunities for Facebook to boost its advertising revenue from within the UK too. \n\"The UK remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story,\" Mendelsohn said.

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg Shares Plan for Cutting Back Fake News on Facebook \"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically.\" Twitter © 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP \nEvery since the election, Facebook has received a lot of criticism due to the fake news that has proliferated on the social network, from everyone from college students to President Barack Obama . Although Mark Zuckerberg has promised that \"more than 99% of what people see is authentic,\" a recent investigation by BuzzFeed News found that 38% of right-wing news stories and 20% of left-wing news stories shared on Facebook were false. (For example, Obama did not tell the UN they had to give up all of their freedom to join a \"New World Government,\" like Freedom Daily News claimed.) \nFinally, on Friday night, the Facebook founder laid out a plan to decrease the number of fake news stories in a post on — you guessed it — Facebook . \n\"The problems here are complex, both technically and philosophically,\" he said, before laying out seven different ways that the company can crack down on misleading viral content. Facebook's plan includes: Stronger detection. The most important thing we can do is improve our ability to classify misinformation. This means better technical systems to detect what people will flag as false before they do it themselves. Easy reporting. Making it much easier for people to report stories as fake will help us catch more misinformation faster. Third party verification. There are many respected fact checking organizations and, while we have reached out to some, we plan to learn from many more. Warnings. We are exploring labeling stories that have been flagged as false by third parties or our community, and showing warnings when people read or share them. Related articles quality. We are raising the bar for stories that appear in related articles under links in News Feed. Disrupting fake news economics. A lot of misinformation is driven by financially motivated spam. We're looking into disrupting the economics with ads policies like the one we announced earlier this week, and better ad farm detection. Listening. We will continue to work with journalists and others in the news industry to get their input, in particular, to better understand their fact checking systems and learn from them. \nYou can read his full post below:",

So consumers, researchers and policy makers alike are constantly trying to find new ways to get excellent care without breaking the bank. (Photo: CareConnect) \nHealth insurance, as everyone knows all too well, can get very costly. So consumers, researchers and policy makers alike are constantly trying to find new ways to get excellent care without breaking the bank. \nRecently, a team of researchers — an economist, a political scientist and a professor of medicine — took a look at different models of health insurance and their overall performance in the state of California. The researchers were interested in finding out whether plans with narrow networks — health care networks designed to offer access to a limited and carefully curated community of physicians and facilities and which, as a result, come at a more modest price tag — could really provide access to top-quality care while keeping prices down. Their conclusion: These plans not only saved members money on their premiums, they offered access to care that was of just as high quality — or higher! — than plans with more extensive networks. This led the researchers to suggest that one advantage of narrow networks is the ability insurers have to cut out all but the best-performing hospitals from the plans they offer patients. \nThese findings are more than just an academic curiosity: they promise real savings to real people. To give a real-world example, the most popular family plan offered by one narrow network provider in the New York area would cost you $800 less per month* in premiums than a comparable plan from one of the big insurance companies offering a traditional network. That amounts to savings of almost $10,000 a year. \nSo is a narrow network right for you? If you see a number of doctors at a wide variety of institutions and can’t imagine switching, then the answer may be no. But if you’re a little flexible and happy to save some cash, a narrow network may be just the right fit. You’ll want to check just who the network covers: a good narrow network centered in your community may already include your local hospital, physician and other health care professionals you already know, see and trust. \nA good place to start is getting a quote online; one company that offers narrow network plans in the New York area is CareConnect. At CareConnect.com , you can compare a few plans, check out their prices and features, find out what doctors and hospitals are in the plans, and decide which one works best for you. \n* Estimate is based on a comparison between publicly available rates. \nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor: CareConnect Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/2gdl4kE",

      "text": "Filed in: News (Photo: Facebook) \nIn the early hours of Friday morning, Ben McBride took to Facebook to post about his experience with the Richmond, California police when he felt he needed to stick up for a black woman they were harassing. \n“You should be ashamed of yourselves,” McBride says in the video in which he is seen to be berating the officers. “Ashamed that you didn’t use discretion that you could have used to write her a ticket and allow her the margin to be able to go and get the kind of tags that was necessary for her vehicle.” \n“There’s no criminal record here. You didn’t find anything in the car. But you chose not to use discretion,” he continues. “And you could have used that discretion, but you chose not to. And that sir, is the reason why black people do not have trust for white police officers in their community, where you do not live and where you do have no sense of commitment to the life and the needs of the people in the community.” \n“So you can laugh, you can smile, you can look away, but tonight, sir, you have demonstrated yourself to be without humanity. Tonight, sir, you have rendered yourself and demonstrated yourself to not have compassion, and for that, you should be ashamed.” \nCheck out the full, amazing, rousing speech that McBride gave below.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nNEW YORK (CBSMiami/AP) — There is a lot of very good basketball being played by teams from Coral Gables this season.\nMiami coach Katie Meier was happy to head back to Florida with a victory.\nErykah Davenport scored 16 points, Jessica Thomas had 15 and No. 22 Miami held St. John’s without a basket for nearly the entire fourth quarter to beat the Red Storm 62-50 on Sunday night.\n“I think that wasn’t a pretty basketball game at all,” Meier said. “We prepared for it to be a slugfest game.”\nKeyona Hayes added 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Hurricanes (3-1), who trailed by eight in the third quarter before mounting their comeback.\nMiami was down 47-43 entering the final period when St. John’s went cold from the field. The Red Storm missed their first 11 shots in the final period until Andrayah Adams hit a floater on the baseline with just under 20 seconds left in the game. It was too late as the Hurricanes outscored them 19-3 in the period.\n“I’m going to be proud of this win,” Meier said. “We might burn this film.”\nThe Hurricanes rallied without really a great game from star Adrienne Motley, who was saddled with foul trouble and dealing with a stiff back. She finished with just five points.\nAkina Wellere scored a career-high 19 points to lead St. John’s (1-2).\n“I thought we played real well in stretches. We had a tremendous third quarter and found a way to come up empty in the fourth,” St. John’s coach Joe Tartamella said. “We lost our composure in the fourth.”\nAfter struggling in their home opener in the third quarter against Duquesne when the Red Storm scored just five points in the period, St. John’s used a big third quarter to take the lead against the Hurricanes.\nSt. John’s trailed by five at the half, but scored 16 of the first 19 points in the third period thanks to Wellere. She had two 3-pointers during the run. Aaliyah Lewis’ floater capped the run and made it 39-31.\nMiami battled back to trail only 47-43 heading into the final quarter.\nNeither team could really get into an offensive flow in the first half. The game was tied at 21 late in the second quarter when Keyona Hayes hit a 3-pointer to spark a 7-2 run to close the half and give the Hurricanes a 28-23 advantage at the break.\nBIG PICTURE\nMiami: The Hurricanes were missing Emese Hof and Laura Cornelius as the pair was playing for the Dutch national team at the Euro qualifiers. They’ll be back for the Thanksgiving tournament. … This was the 25th meeting between the schools, but the first since 2004 when Miami left the Big East to join the ACC. The Hurricanes lead the series 19-6 and have won the last nine matchups. … Davenport scored in double figures for the fourth straight time to open the season. In her first two years, she had scored 10-plus in back-to-back games just one time.\nSt. John’s: New York Knicks great Earl “The Pearl” Monroe was in the crowd. … Wellere’s previous career high was 17 points against Sacred Heart last season. … St. John’s shot 30 percent from the field (18-for-60) for the game. The Red Storm was just 9 for 20 from the free throw line.\nENJOYING THE BIG APPLE:\nWith Miami on break next week, the Hurricanes were going to be able to enjoy New York. The team had a wonderful dinner Saturday night and will visit Ground Zero on Monday before flying home.\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS:\nMiami is poised to stay in the Top 25 and might even move up a spot or two.\nUP NEXT:\nMiami: The Hurricanes host their own Thanksgiving tournament playing Grambling and then either Fordham or Texas Tech.\nSt. John’s: The Red Storm head to Las Vegas to play against Virginia and Arizona State in the South Point Shootout during Thanksgiving.\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "text": "Share on Facebook via Jonathan Fertig/ how the modern flaneur dresses for walking \nBravo to the Globe and Mail, self-described as Canada's National Newspaper, for an editorial that finally gets the point about pedestrian safety. In an era of victim blaming and complaining about distracted walking, the editorial starts with a bang: \nAny unnecessary, violent death should always be deeply disturbing. But one category of death gets far less attention than it deserves – to the point where it has been largely normalized as the acceptable by-product of our busy, mobile society. \nThe killing of pedestrians is an overlooked tragedy in a car-centred culture that prefers to regard road deaths as both accidental and inevitable. \nThey are neither – at least not if you’re determined to make our cities safe places where people can go for a walk without fear of sudden death or disability. \nThat last sentence is the one that makes the point we have made so many times, that we shouldn’t have to walk in fear, even on the sidewalks these days. That we shouldn’t have to dress up like construction workers just to go out. \nThe Globe also ignores all the fake statistics about the dangers of distracted walking and writes: \nBlame-the-victim types will say that distracted pedestrians are the agents of their own misfortune – the image of the ear-budded millennial staring down at a phone while blindly stepping into traffic is often trotted out. But according to a long-term analysis of the data, of the 23,240 pedestrian deaths in the U.S. between 2010 and 2014, portable electronic devices were a factor in only 25 cases. \nThey conclude that it is time to fix our cities, which they note are designed to serve cars and drivers, where a “certain amount of death is a predictable byproduct.” And that it is not just about regulation, it is also about design. \nIt is time to undo this destructive choice – by dropping speed limits, narrowing roads, extending curbs at crossings, and providing safety islands on broad, busy streets. Politicians must find the courage to resist the crude war-on-the-car arguments that will inevitably result. Pedestrians already have priority under the law. It is time they had it in reality. Bravo. Instead of complaining about distracted walkers (like most of the comments to the article do) or yelling for more enforcement, they get the important stuff: slow everyone down through design. It is the true essence of Vision Zero.\nFrom the Toronto Star/Screen capture \nThis is so different from what we get in another Toronto paper, where a certain writer insults cyclists, drivers and claims \"Pedestrians are dim-witted, dark-cloaked dreamers who drift all over God’s green acre with a dopey sense of entitlement.\" \nOf course the comments to the post complain about the idiot pedestrians who don't obey the rules and go on about how \"after dark the masses are dressed in their finest and darkest fashions...it is a miracle more are not hit!\" and \"don't just demonize car drivers!\" and even \"I also suggest that the author of this piece is lying. Or, more precisely, he's trying to mislead by cherry-picking what portions of the truth he is referencing.\" -I get the same on TreeHugger. \nBut the Globe and Mail gets the point : We want to walk without fear. It summarizes a couple of years worth of TreeHugger arguments, many here in related links:  ",

Companies operating in the U.K. have been grappling with whether they'll still be able to easily hire from within the European Union after the Brexit process is complete. Credit: Meg Roussos/Bloomberg Most Popular \nFacebook is to increase its U.K. headcount by 50%, hiring 500 new staff and backing the U.K. capital as an important technology hub. \nThe social media company is moving to a new London headquarters in 2017, and has plans to increase its headcount from 1,000 to 1,500, the company said in a statement Monday. \n\"Many of those new roles will be high-skilled engineering jobs,\" said Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's VP for the EMEA region. \"The U.K. remains one of the best places to be a tech company and is an important part of Facebook's story.\" \nIn the statement on Monday, Facebook noted the breadth of nationalities -- over 65 -- it employed in London. \nMultinational companies in the U.K. have been busy grappling with the U.K.'s plans for leaving the EU -- in particular whether they will be easily able to hire workers from the bloc. \nThe announcement extends a recent string of similar promises made by major U.S. tech companies regarding their plans in the U.K. \nLast week Google cemented plans that it would expand in the U.K., saying it will go-ahead with plans to complete a new London office that can hold as many as 7,000 workers -- 3,000 more than a spokesman said it currently employs in the U.K. \nApple said in September it is leasing about 500,000 square feet of office space at Battersea Power Station on the south bank of London's River Thames. \nFacebook arrived in London in 2007, and the U.K. is now home to its largest engineering base outside of the U.S. Its Workplace offering, which lets employees collaborate with one another on products, was developed in the U.K. capital. \n-- Bloomberg News",

      "text": "Two days after the election of Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg found himself on the hot seat.\nAt a tech conference, an interviewer grilled the Facebook chief executive about the fake news that proliferates there, suggesting that it had swayed the election toward Trump. One widely shared story, for example, said that Pope Francis had endorsed the Republican nominee.\nZuckerberg scoffed:\n“Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way - I think is a pretty crazy idea. Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.”\nBut since then, under fire (including from President Barack Obama who railed against the fake-news epidemic last week), Facebook has taken some positive steps.\nLate Friday, Zuckerberg posted about how he grasps the seriousness of the problem and outlined the ways Facebook might deal with it. He mentioned third-party verification services; better ways for users to flag hoaxes; and efforts to keep fake websites from getting rich on advertising dollars.\nThat’s welcome progress.\nNow it’s time for a bolder move: Facebook should hire a top-flight executive editor and give that person the resources, power and staff to make sound editorial decisions.\nZuckerberg may not want to call this person an editor, since he has been insistent that Facebook isn’t a media company. He sees it as a technology company, a platform for connectivity. And indeed, Facebook itself does not produce news content but merely allows its community members to share their own offerings - whether baby pictures or hoaxes about political candidates.\nThat’s fine. Call this person the chief sharing officer or the engagement czarina.\nWhatever the title, Facebook needs someone who can distinguish a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph from child pornography and who can tell a baseless lie from a thoroughly vetted investigative story.\nWhat rules the roost at Facebook is “engagement.” To oversimplify: The more an item is shared among your friends, the more likely you are to see it.\nClearly, that’s not nearly enough. What’s needed is sound judgment.\nThe Silicon Valley behemoth is a major news source - for some demographic groups, the leading one. Its influence is only going in one direction: ever upward.\nUnderstandably, Facebook doesn’t want to turn into the world’s censor in chief. And it shouldn’t and doesn’t have to.\nWhen Zuckerberg said recently that identifying truth is hard, Ben Smith, chief editor of Buzzfeed, had a ready answer:\nThat might be the case, he said, “for algorithms and epistemologists. But it’s something that professional journalists are asked to do every day, and it’s not actually that complicated.”\nIt comes down to judgment - the kind that can’t be done by complicated code or by relying on well-intentioned but vague “community standards.”\nThe need for editorial judgment at Facebook didn’t start with this post-election finger-pointing. It’s been growing for many months.\nLast summer, for example, a Minnesota woman named Diamond Reynolds used her smartphone to livestream a horrific scene onto Facebook: Her boyfriend, Philando Castile, had been fatally shot by a police officer. Her post was removed for about an hour - Facebook said that was because of a technical glitch - then restored.\nThen, in September, Facebook deleted Nick Ut’s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack because it violated the platform’s standards on nudity and child pornography. When global outrage followed, it too was restored.\nEmily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, has called on Zuckerberg to change his mind about Facebook’s role in the media ecosystem.\n“By acknowledging that Facebook can and should play a more active part in editing - yes, editing - its own platform, and hiring actual people to do so, Zuckerberg will further the civic commons as well as address a growing problem of how people perceive Facebook,” she wrote in Columbia Journalism Review.\nAnd last week, author Jeff Jarvis and tech entrepreneur John Borthwick, writing on Medium, offered 15 ways to combat the fake-news epidemic. Among them: hire some editors, “not to create content, not to edit ... but instead to bring a sense of public responsibility to their companies and products.”\nEditors, of course, are far from infallible. Most of them would be quick to admit that. But this move would put someone in charge - at a high level - who could help journalists and technologists talk to one another and who could make decisions based on sound judgment.\nWould it be enough to stamp out fake news? Certainly not.\nBut Facebook’s appointment of an executive editor would be a step forward, bringing accountability and good sense where it’s sorely needed. It would also set a good example for other tech companies and social platforms that are grappling with the same problems.\nAnother “pretty crazy idea”? Maybe so. But one whose time has come.\nMargaret Sullivan is the media columnist for The Washington Post",

      "text": "How two unemployed guys got rich off Facebook,... | 57 minutes ago | Vote 0 0 How two unemployed guys got rich off Facebook, fake news and an army of Trump supporters Jobless in May, Paris Wade and Ben Goldman were ruling an empire built on Facebook shares by the time of the vote, influencing millions with rumours, exaggeration, conspiracy theories and lies. Paris Wade and Ben Goldman Stuart Palley,The Washington Post Liberty Writers News founders Paris Wade, left, and Ben Goldman work at their apartment in Long Beach, California By Terrence McCoy LONG BEACH, Calif. — Fewer than 2,000 readers are on his website when Paris Wade, 26, awakens from a nap, reaches for his laptop and thinks he needs to, as he puts it, \"feed\" his audience. \"Man, no one is covering this TPP thing,\" he says after seeing an article suggesting that President Obama wants to pass the trans-Pacific Partnership before he leaves office. Wade, a modern-day digital opportunist, sees an opportunity. He begins typing a story. \"CAN'T TRUST OBAMA,\" he writes as the headline, then pauses. His audience hates Obama and loves President-elect Donald Trump, and he wants to capture that disgust and cast it as a drama between good and evil. He resumes typing: \"Look At Sick Thing He Just Did To STAB Trump In The Back ...\" Ten minutes and nearly 200 words later, he is done with a story that is all opinion, innuendo and rumour. He types at the bottom, \"Comment 'DOWN WITH THE GLOBALISTS!' below if you love this country,\" publishes the story to his website, LibertyWritersNews.com, and then pulls up the Facebook page he uses to promote the site, which in six months has collected 805,000 followers and brought in tens of millions of page views. \"WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN!\" he writes, posting the article. \"#SHARE this 1 million times, patriots!\" Then he looks at a nearby monitor that shows the site's analytics, and watches as the readers pour in. \"Down with the globalists,\" writes a woman in Cape Girardeau, Mo., one of 3,192 people now on the website, 1,244 of whom are reading the story he just posted. \"Down with the globalists!\" writes a man in Las Vegas. Now 1,855 are reading the story. \"DOWN WITH THE GLOBALISTS !!!\" writes a woman in Helena, Mont. Now 1,982. At a time of continuing discussion over the role that hyperpartisan websites, fake news and social media play in the divided America of 2016, LibertyWritersNews illustrates how websites can use Facebook to tap into a surging ideology, quickly go from nothing to influencing millions of people and make big profits in the process. Six months ago, Wade and his business partner, Ben Goldman, were unemployed restaurant workers. Now they're at the helm of a website that gained 300,000 Facebook followers in October alone and say they are making so much money that they feel uncomfortable talking about it because they don't want people to start asking for loans. Instead, Wade hums a hip-hop song and starts a new post as readers keep reading, sharing and sending in personal messages. One comes from a woman who frequently contacts his page. \"YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE I TRUST TO REPORT THE TRUTH,\" is one of the things she has written, and Wade doesn't need to look at her Facebook profile to have a clear sense of who she is. White. Working class. Midwestern. \"And the economy screwed her.\" He writes another headline, \"THE TRUTH IS OUT! The Media Doesn't Want You To See What Hillary Did After Losing ...\" \"Nothing in this article is anti-media, but I've used this headline a thousand times,\" he says. \"Violence and chaos and aggressive wording is what people are attracted to.\" \"Our audience does not trust the mainstream media,\" Goldman, 26, says a little later as Wade keeps typing. \"It's definitely easier to hook them with that.\" \"There's not a ton of thought put into it,\" Wade says. \"Other than it frames the story so it gets a click.\" \"True,\" Goldman says. \"We're the new yellow journalists,\" Wade will say after a day and night when the number of people following LibertyWritersNews on Facebook will swell by more than 20,000. \"We're the people on the side of the street yelling that the world is about to end.\" But for now, it's only 7 p.m., readers on both coasts are still awake, and there are several more stories that need posting. An itinerant lifestyle Everything about the lives of Wade and Goldman has the flimsy feel of something that can be taken apart in a matter of hours, boxed up and carted away, from the fake bylines they use — Wade is Paris Swade; Goldman is Danny Gold — right down to the rental they found on Airbnb. It is stripped of accoutrements, except for some clothes strewn across the bedroom floors, a pair of laptops and a PlayStation 4. They say they plan on spending two more months here and don't know where they'll be after that. Every evening, they write stories on the couch, watch them go viral, schedule more for morning, head off to bed, and now, on another morning, comes Goldman, creaking down the steps. \"My article got banned,\" Goldman says, explaining Facebook had removed a trending piece headlined: \"Right After LOSING The Election, Hillary Clinton Just Humiliated Herself In Worst Way Ever!!\" \"F--- Facebook,\" Wade says, knowing its algorithms sometimes assume that rapidly shared articles are spam and temporarily blocks them if posted by an alternative outlet. \"They had a spam filter.\" Wade calls their server technician in Texas. \"I don't know what we have to do to get through these spam filters,\" Wade says into the phone. \"But we've probably lost thousands of dollars because of them.\" Goldman sits on the couch, logs onto an advertiser's website and looks up how much money they've nonetheless made. \"Super great election sales,\" he says. \"All of the candidates put their super PAC money into it, so there were some days where we were getting $13, $14 per 1,000 views.\" Between June and August, they say, when they had fewer than 150,000 Facebook followers, they made between $10,000 and $40,000 every month running advertisements that, among other things, promised acne solutions, Viagra alternatives, ways to remove lip lines, cracked feet, \"deep fat,\" and \"the 13 sexiest and most naked celebrity selfies.\" Then the political drama deepened, and their audience expanded fivefold, and now Goldman sometimes thinks that what he made in the last six months would have taken him 20 years waiting tables at his old job. Wade and Goldman now have a lawyer and an accountant, employ other writers and are expanding so quickly that they're surprised to think the majority of their adult lives were spent scraping by. They graduated from the University of Tennessee — Wade in 2012 with an advertising degree and Goldman in 2013 with a business degree — but could only find unpaid internships and ended up working at a Mexican restaurant. On weekends, they would sell water bottles at college football games, and Goldman scalped tickets. Neither thought much about politics. Raised in liberal homes, they both voted for Obama twice, but as they struggled to find better jobs, they began to doubt those votes, their college education and the progressive values with which they were raised. They moved to California, first Wade, then Goldman, and started an advertising business that quickly failed. But it did attract one client who ran numerous alt-right Facebook pages. He needed more writers, and in 2015 Wade and Goldman started doing stories and getting paid based on how many clicks they got. The first story Wade did aggregated a South Korean news report that claimed an anonymous source had said that a North Korean scientist had defected with data from human experiments. Wade knew he needed a picture to sell the story to readers. He searched online for an image of a human experiment that, as he describes it, would make people think, \"What is that? I got to click.\" He found what he recalls was a \"totally misleading\" photograph of a fleshy mass and made it the featured image. He wrote the headline, \"[PROOF] N. Korea Experiments on Humans,\" published the story and made $120 off 10 minutes of work. It was, he says, a revelation: \"You have to trick people into reading the news.\" Now settled into the career that has grown from that revelation, Wade turns the television to Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist with nearly 1.4 million followers on Facebook, who is the opportunist they would most like to become. Wade clicks on the LibertyWritersNews site, which says at the bottom, \"You Can Count On Liberty Writers News,\" begins typing a new story, and looks up to watch Jones yell into the camera. But it isn't Jones's monologue that Wade notices. It's his setup. \"We want to start filming in a studio like that,\" Wade says. \"That stuff works on Facebook.\" What works on Facebook and what doesn't work occupies many of the conversations between Wade and Goldman. Explicitly telling people to prove that they support Trump by sharing their stories works, so they do that. Neither of them is particularly religious, but their readers are, so in their writing they ask God to bless the president-elect, and that works, too. So does exaggeration: \"OBAMA BIRTH SECRETS REVEALED! The Letters From His Dad Reveal Something Sinister ...\" And stoking fear: \"Terrorists Have Infiltrated the US Government! Look Who They Want to ASSASSINATE!!\" And inflaming racial and gender tension: \"BREAKING: Michelle Obama holds Feminist Rally At HER SLAVE HOUSE!\" And conspiracy theories: \"BREAKING: Top Official Set to Testify Against Hillary Clinton Found DEAD!\" Wade now finishes a new post calling House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R.-Wis.) a traitor because \"our audience hates Paul Ryan.\" He shares a story he wrote on their Facebook page claiming that former President Bill Clinton will soon go to jail, not because Clinton will soon go to jail, but because his audience wants to hear that Clinton is a criminal. \"All successful journalism has shock value,\" Goldman says as he and Wade sit at their computers later that day. \"There was once a lot more competition among newspapers,\" Wade says. \"It was like a race to see who could write the craziest s---.\" \"And whoever wrote the craziest s--- won,\" Goldman says. \"There used to be a joke that every single day a new world war started,\" Wade says. \"Because that's what sold papers.\" Now Wade writes on their Facebook page that \"THOUSANDS\" of protesters are marching \"with MEXICAN FLAGS,\" and meanwhile Goldman types his own article. \"What is it?\" Wade asks. \"Megyn Kelly,\" Goldman says. \"Going to do great.\" \"Yeah,\" Wade says. \"People love Megyn Kelly.\" Writing for audience There are times when Wade wonders what it would be like to write an article he truly believes in. \"In a perfect world,\" he says, it would have nuance and balance and long paragraphs and take longer than 10 minutes to compose. It would make people think. But he never writes it, he says, because no one would click on it, so what would be the point? Instead, as 4,000 people are on the website one night, Wade and Goldman keep writing and feeding, writing and feeding. Wade writes about a rumour he has seen on Fox News's website, which says \"the new batch of anti-Trump protesters has been bankrolled by individuals like billionaire liberal activist George Soros and groups like Moveon.org.\" \"Dude,\" Wade says. \"The left has been, like, manufacturing the protest.\" Goldman, meanwhile, is typing a story — \"It was a literal Hell Storm at DNC headquarters today\" — and laughing at what he has written. \"God, I just know everything about this statement is so wrong,\" he says, and adds, still laughing, \"What is a hell storm?\" He finishes it as Wade is putting an old headline on his story about Soros, one that has nothing to do with what he has written but once brought in a lot of page views. He shares it on their Facebook page and watches as readers stream into the website — first a few hundred, then nearly 1,000. \"Boom, dude, look at that,\" Wade says. \"That one is doing super well.\" Goldman scans through what Wade had written. \"When are we going to go after this traitor!\" it says. \"It is time to take this traitor out! He should be pursued to the depths of hell and beyond.\" He looks up and smiles nervously. \"Maybe there's a less violent way to say that.\" \"I'm going to change that one, actually,\" Wade says, suddenly looking panicked as he grabs his laptop and moves to replace \"take this traitor out\" to \"take this traitor down.\" \"Down is so much better sounding than out,\" Goldman says. But the comments are already coming in fast. \"Arrest and hang him for war crimes,\" one woman writes of Soros. \"This man should go straight to F@#KING HELL,\" another woman posts. \"I gladly volunteer to take this Traitor to America out,\" another says. \"Jail is way too good for him.\" Goldman and Wade often tell each other they aren't creating anything that's not already there, that they're simply fanning it, that readers know not to take their hyperbole and embellishments seriously. And even if the comments suggest otherwise, they try not to pay them too much attention. People will say anything on Facebook, they remind themselves. They tell one another they're only minor participants in a broader \"meme war\" between outlets such as The Other 98% (other98.com) on the left and Nation In Distress (facebook.com/NationInDistress) on the right, but then they see the protests in the streets, the divisions in America, and wonder if their work is making things worse. What if one of their readers actually does harm Soros? Would they be complicit? Is their website dangerous? Or is it savvy entrepreneurship? Their opportunity? And if it is opportunity, how far can they go with it? One afternoon, Goldman has an idea. \"It would be a perfect time to open up a small liberal newspaper right now,\" he says as he types a post with, \"The Democratic party is finished! Just wait til you see what happened today ...\" \"It would,\" Wade says. \"There is so much animus on the left right now.\" \"You could get more traffic than we do now,\" Goldman says. \"It wouldn't be very hard to argue the other side for me,\" Wade says, as he types a post that says, \"LIKE + SHARE IF YOU LOVE TRUMP! It's time to heal the nation. All the lies that we have been fed about him were wrong. He is not a Nazi, he is not a Xenophobe, he is not Deplorable, he is not racist and he is about to make America great again!\" Goldman keeps typing. So does Wade. There are 2,268 readers on their website, and it's time to get more. | Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nI am a 21-year-old black female senior who attends Ohio University. \nIt was just a regular Saturday night at school, when me and my friends decided to go out. This was the usual for us. Go to school, do homework, and go out. Repeat. There’s really nothing else to do in little Athens County. \nI was out at a bar a few weeks ago one night out drinking with my friends, and I overheard two white men whispering to each other. One said, “That black girl has on a Patagonia fleece, I didn’t know black people wore those,” and they began to laugh. \nAt first when I heard that statement, I didn’t know if it was the cranberry vodkas settling in my system and I was imagining them saying this, or if he really had the audacity to say it in front of me. I soon realized it was definitely real. \nThe “angry black woman” stereotype was two seconds away from coming out of me, so I calmed down, and politely turned around and confronted the two men. \nI asked, “Why is it so crazy that I’m wearing a Patagonia?” One guy appeared shocked I said something, and eventually responded: “I just didn’t know black people hiked, that’s all.” \nWhat does that even mean?! \nI told him he was racist bigot, and that I could wear whatever the hell I wanted to wear. Then my roommate went up to him and told him to leave us alone and to stop making racist comments and we walked away. “I didn’t know black people hiked.” \nWe discussed how being black in America is really a scary thing at times. \nThe stereotype that black people don’t like the outdoors is false. Maybe some don’t and maybe some do, but some white people don’t like going outside either. What was the point of saying that statement to begin with? \nFirst of all, Patagonia fleeces are not just for hiking purposes; they can be worn whenever and wherever, regardless of what their brand represents. \nOf course right after that situation, I was thinking, well, do all white people look at me that way or talk about me when I wear it? Then I had to realize, I like the sweater because I like the way it feels and the way it looks on me. \nI also talked to my mother and friends about it and everyone told me that I don’t need to second guess what I wear just because two ignorant white privileged males made a comment about me. \nLife can be hard to deal with when you’re so commonly stereotyped. Granted, I go to a predominantly white institute (PWI), so maybe they weren’t used to seeing a black girl in a Patagonia, but the point is, why does it matter? \nSadly, this was not my first racial experience at my university, so when it happened, I was honestly not that surprised. \nAlthough racist comments have been made about me to my face and around me, I’ve never felt worried or shaken by it. I’m very comfortable with my blackness and my identity, and to be black, you have to have thick skin, so it bothered me, but it didn’t ruin my night. “To be black, you have to have thick skin.” \nPatagonia was not made for white people only. In addition, Patagonia isn’t a cheap brand, so I also felt that he was shocked that I was able to afford such clothing. \nIt just got me thinking, there’s really no reason to make these kinds of judgments on people without knowing them. \nHere are five things to think about before you let judging someone be your first instinct: Stop and think. \nThink about what you’re going to say before you say it. Is it nice? Is it true? Do you even know this person for you to judge them? Is it appropriate to say in front of that person’s face? \nYou don’t know it, but what you say can affect a person for the rest of their lives. Would you want to be stereotyped? “Clothes are for everybody. ” \nYou wouldn’t, so why do it to another person? Just because you’re used to seeing a certain group wear an article of clothing doesn’t mean you need to be in complete shock that a person you’ve never seen before is wearing it. Clothes are for everybody. Is it necessary? \nI bet that you making a racist comment is not doing anything beneficial to your life, so just save yourself some time and breath and don’t say anything. \nThe saying, “if you don’t have anything nice at all to say, don’t say it at all” is so useful at times like this. Put your family in their shoes. \nIf someone didn’t know your sister, brother, cousin, mother, father or whoever you love and care about, wouldn’t you be pissed off if a total stranger is judging them just based off of a material thing as little as clothing? \nBetter yet, if the person is judging them because of the color of their skin? Mind your business. \nYou don’t know somebody’s story or background based on looking at their appearance. You can assume what you want, because you have that right to do that, but again, it doesn’t have anything to do with you, so why even look deep into something that really doesn’t even matter? \nIt’s so sad to me that it is almost 2017, and people still feel the need to make racist comments. If you see something that is different than what you’re used to, instead of making an assumption, try to look at the bigger picture. \nWhat was said about me shows me that we, as a nation, have so much more work to do. \nIn light of everything that has happened this year , I think we need to come together as a nation and love one another, rather then finding a small excuse to not like a person. Trump’s Impact On Sexism To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nNo matter our skin color, we are all human beings and we all deserve the same amount of respect. \nI have three Patagonia fleeces, and I’m asking for another one for Christmas. \nI’ll wear them with my head held high. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "Want to see the latest flight deals as soon as they’re published? Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter , and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @ tpg_alerts . \nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia , which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you’re using the American Express Platinum Card , you’ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points . Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia’s courtesy cancellation if you’re unable to get the time away from work or family. \nLast week, JetBlue was offering fantastic prices on transcontinental flights from New York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) and San Francisco (SFO). Now, other airlines are getting in on this low-fare fun, offering round-trip tickets from just $216 round-trip. If you’re looking to do an end-of-year mileage run to push yourself over the threshold for a certain elite status, this is definitely a no-brainer! However, these fares seem to only be available on certain days in early December, so you’ll have to have some flexibility in order to take advantage of this deal.\nAirline: American, Delta, JetBlue, United and Virgin America\nRoute: JFK — LAX, SFO\nCost: $216+ round-trip\nDates: December 2016\nBooking Link: Orbitz or Expedia \nPay With: American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on airfare ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold , Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\nNew York (JFK) to San Francisco (SFO) for $216 round-trip on JetBlue: \n\nNewark (EWR) to San Francisco (SFO) for $216 round-trip on United: \n\nNewark (EWR) to San Francisco (SFO) for $216 round-trip on Virgin America: \n\nNew York (JFK) to San Francisco (SFO) for $223 round-trip on American: \n\nNew York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) for $236 round-trip on Delta: \n\nNew York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) for $236 round-trip on JetBlue: \n\nNewark (EWR) to Los Angeles (LAX) for $236 round-trip on United: \n\nNew York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) for $256 round-trip on Virgin America: \n\nNew York (JFK) to Los Angeles (LAX) for $266 round-trip on American:\n\nMaximize Your Purchase \nDon’t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the American Express Platinum Card ( 5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel ), Chase Sapphire Reserve , American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nWalking into the Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel in Sydney’s business district, you kind of expect another corporate haven for businessman, airline employees on stopovers, and retirees shipped in by bus. No, it’s so much more. \nWhile the hotel would welcome all those groups, its gorgeous sandstone exterior with a definite nod to all things Italian, also looks to entice lovers of design. \nRedesigned in July 2016, this hotel sets itself above its competitors in this price bracket by laying on the style. The lobby, bar, and breakfast room all shout plush furniture, comfy lounges and polished marble in a stylish layout. \nMy room had a blue feature, a nod to its name, with a retro blue velour lounge-come-daybed, perfect for stretching out by the floor-to-ceiling windows each Atrium Room boasts. \nMetallic, galvanised-effect feature walls are eye-catching as you enter the room. The beds, too, are spot on, with a free-of-charge pillow menu to ensure you get the best sleep. \nThe bathrooms have all the features you’d expect. Each one has a massive tub taking centre stage alongside a peeping window that looks through to the bedroom. I found this feature a little odd but it certainly leant a portion of each room’s space to the other, combining with the high ceilings to make a regular hotel room feel almost suite-like. \nThe Radisson Blu has the usual free additions like Wi-Fi in every room (good enough to write this piece and upload photos) and the expected toiletries laid on in the bathroom. \nI sampled each of the hotel’s free amenities and can confirm that the gym had enough equipment to handle the post-breakfast rush that I was a part of. Speaking of which, the buffet breakfast that came included was tasty. The lap pool, steam room, and spa, meanwhile, were all nice and completely empty when I arrived, which was a real treat. \nThere is an in-room 20/20/20 exercise, wellness, and beauty package available that sees a high-intensity workout combined with a 20-minute mindfulness session and self-treat beauty package for those wanting to treat themselves without leaving their room. The $24 price tag is reasonable and includes everything you’ll need including extra towels, beauty products, and a yoga mat. \nThe Radisson Blu Plaza hotel has 364 boutique rooms with the recent redesign, taking them from the boring norm they were before to the beautifully appointed next level. \nWhile we had a one night staycation, this hotel would also be perfect for those coming to Sydney and wanting a stylish hotel in the heart of the city without paying Monaco prices. \nNote: The writer stayed one night complimentary as a guest of the hotel.

      "text": "Instagram users will soon be able to broadcast to their friends in real time, joining Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms in adding a live video option.\nBut unlike on Facebook and some other social networks, Instagram's live videos will disappear after the broadcast is over.\nThe Facebook-owned photo sharing platform unveiled the new feature Monday alongside the addition of ephemeral messaging, in an announcement that elicited further ongoing speculation that the company is poised to become the new Snapchat.\nRecommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. “We want Instagram to be a place where you can share all of your moments , to create a pressure-free space to do so,” Kevin Weil, the head of product at Instagram, told The New York Times, explaining that he hoped the new features would provide an alternative to sharing the posed, filtered photos for which Instagram is known.\nTest your knowledge Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. Snapchat, with its disappearing photos and videos, has changed the way we present ourselves and interact with others on social media in recent years, say observers, by providing a low-risk way to share images with friends.\n\"Snapchat is changing the way we communicate. The app is affecting our audience, even if you don’t use the social media platform,\" writes Bethany Swain, a lecturer in the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism, for MediaShift. \"Snapchat is a free app to download and low-stakes way to experiment. It is another tool for real-time storytelling and sharing life's little moments.\"\nThis isn't the first time Instagram has channeled Snapchat by adding new features: Earlier this year, Instagram introduced Instagram Stories, a feature that mimics Snapchat's story feature, through which users can publicly share a series of photos or videos for 24 hours.\nMuch of the appeal of Snapchat, researchers have found, is the low-stakes nature of the app. In one recent study by Cornell University's Social Media Lab, users reported liking the app because they didn't have to worry that their message would be shared with an unintended person or taken out of context.\n\"With so much to store mentally and digitally, users reported that they enjoy being able to have an interaction where they can be their true selves without worrying about the repercussions of their exchanges,\" said Cornell researcher Bin Xu in a news release.\nIn an era where many people find themselves glued to their cell phones and connected to social media 24/7, some observers have also suggested that the ephemeral nature of Snapchat may remind us of more authentic human interaction, reflecting a full circle of sorts in communication habits.\n\"Snapchat is like real life ,\" writes Sujan Patel for Forbes. \"A conversation had, and shared, disappears shortly after it's over. It's only between those involved, and then you're left with the memory.\"\nMr. Weil of Instagram told the New York Times that while Snapchat may have sparked the trend of ephemeral photo communication, Instagram had made the model its own with unique adjustments and improvements.\n\"The format is definitely something that Snapchat innovated on,\" Weil said. \"But it's just like how hashtags started on Twitter and are used everywhere. I think this particular format is one that we will see adopted everywhere else.\"",

      "text": "By Chris Chase \nPublished November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print East Rutherford, MA--11/22/2012 New England Patriots (l to r) Tom Brady, Steve Gregory, and Vince Wilfork join television broadcaster Michele Tafoya eating turkey legs after defeating the New York Jets 49-19 at Metlife Stadium on Thursday November 22 2012. (Matthew J. Lee/Globe staff) Topic: Jets-Patriots Reporter: Young \nThere's never been a more legitimate reason to ignore your in-laws.\nThanks to some keen scheduling and some fortuitous bounces of the ball through the first 11 weeks of the year, this Thanksgiving marks the first time since 1993 and only the second time in the past 39 seasons, that every team in action on turkey day enters the day with a record of .500 or better. It's all the more impressive when you consider that up until 2006 there were just two games played on Thanksgiving as opposed to the three we have now. (With a three-game slate, it's theoretically 50% harder to get such a great down-the-line schedule).\n12:30 p.m. ET (CBS): Minnesota Vikings (6-4) at Detroit Lions (6-4) \nMore from FoxSports Giants are on a roll, but still taking it one game at a time The Green Bay Packers are popular, but are they actually an elite NFL franchise? | THE HERD Dak Prescott impressed Colin Cowhed by picking up after himself - find out why | THE HERD Shannon Sharpe does not hold back talking about Packers QB Aaron Rodgers | UNDISPUTED This is usually the dreaded Lions time slot that involves a halfway-decent team looking like a Super Bowl favorite in routing a pathetic Detroit team, thus leading to conversations around your dinner table about the NFL should totally snatch the game from the Lions because they're so terrible. This year, though, Detroit and Minnesota are tied atop the NFC North and playing for sole possession of first place. A Lions win is like a win-and-a-half, as they'd sweep the season series against Minnesota and take any potential tiebreaker.\n4:30 p.m. ET (Fox): Washington Redskins (6-3-1) at Dallas Cowboys (9-1) \nThe game of the day (which after looking at decades of historical Thanksgiving duds isn't always a compliment). It's the classic \"show me what you've got game\" between a team moving the delicate balance between contender and pretender and the Washington Redskins. The Cowboys will be the considerable favorite, as they should be, but when these two teams met earlier this year in Week 2, the game was decided by a couple of ill-advised goal-line play calls by the Redskins (live by the fade, die a painful, painful death by the fade) and ended with a 27-23 Dallas win. (With their Week 1 loss to the Giants, the Cowboys were on the cusp of an 0-2 start.) Is Kirk Cousins legit? Is Dak Prescott? This the second big test of the year for the 'Boys. They won an instant classic against the Steelers last week to show they're for real. A Thursday win would show the Super Bowl buzz is right.\n8:30 p.m. ET (NBC): Pittsburgh Steelers (5-5) at Indianapolis Colts (5-5) \nThank goodness for the Browns and the Titans. A week ago, this primetime game was looking like a possible post-dinner dud. But after both the Steelers and Colts took fairly easy wins on Sunday (every Thanksgiving team won on the Sunday before the holiday games, the first time that's happened since 2011), this becomes a crucial game for both, with Pittsburgh looking to jump ahead of the Ravens for first place in the North while the Colts try to hang on in both the South and the wild-card race. Even if this game lays an egg, there's still reason to watch, just in case Mike Tomlin tries to play footsie with a Colts returner Jordan Todman.",

      "text": "My Reputation Points: 3371 How two unemployed guys got rich off Facebook, fake news and an army of Trump supporters E GLOBALISTS !!! writes a woman in Helena, Mont. Now 1,982. Six months ago, Wade and his business partner, Ben Goldman, were unemployed restaurant workers. Now theyre at the helm of a website that gained 300,000 Facebook followers in October alone and say they are making so much money that they feel uncomfortable talking about it because they dont want people to start asking for loans. He writes another headline, THE TRUTH IS OUT! The Media Doesnt Want You To See What Hillary Did After Losing ... Nothing in this article is anti-media, but Ive used this headline a thousand times, he says. Violence and chaos and aggressive wording is what people are attracted to. Our audience does not trust the mainstream media, Goldman, 26, says a little later as Wade keeps typing. Its definitely easier to hook them with that. Theres not a ton of thought put into it, Wade says. Other than it frames the story so it gets a click. True, Goldman says. Were the new yellow journalists, Wade will say after a day and night when the number of people following LibertyWritersNews on Facebook will swell by more than 20,000. Were the people on the side of the street yelling that the world is about to end. Super great election sales, he says. All of the candidates put their super PAC money into it, so there were some days where we were getting $13, $14 per 1,000 views. Between June and August, they say, when they had fewer than 150,000 Facebook followers, they made between $10,000 and $40,000 every month running advertisements that, among other things, promised acne solutions, Viagra alternatives, ways to remove lip lines, cracked feet, deep fat, and the 13 sexiest and most naked celebrity selfies. Then the political drama deepened, and their audience expanded fivefold, and Wade and Goldman now have a lawyer and an accountant, employ other writers and are expanding so quickly that theyre surprised to think the majority of their adult lives were spent scraping by. They graduated from the University of Tennessee  Wade in 2012 with an advertising degree and Goldman in 2013 with a business degree  What works on Facebook and what doesnt work occupies many of the conversations between Wade and Goldman. Explicitly telling people to prove that they support Trump by sharing their stories works, so they do that. Neither of them is particularly religious, but their readers are, so in their writing they ask God to bless the president-elect, and that works, too. So does exaggeration: OBAMA BIRTH SECRETS REVEALED! The Letters From His Dad Reveal Something Sinister ... Goldman, meanwhile, is typing a story  It was a literal Hell Storm at DNC headquarters today  and laughing at what he has written. God, I just know everything about this statement is It would be a perfect time to open up a small liberal newspaper right now, he says as he types a post with, The Democratic party is finished! Just wait til you see what happened today ... It would, Wade says. There is so much animus on the left right now",

      "text": "Share on Facebook \n\"Asperger's Are Us\" is the name of the first comedy troupe made up of openly autistic performers. It's also the title of a new documentary which follows these young, comic comrades around Boston as they get ready for what could be their final show: \nThe film was directed by Alex Lehmann and produced by Mark Duplass. The two recently spoke with Take Two's Alex Cohen about the film. Interview highlights: \nOn how to describe the 'Asberger's Are Us' style of comedy \nMark Duplass: \n\"The first and easiest way, which is a bit reductive, is to describe it as extremely dry. And I think that's fair. And we understand dry humor as stuff that's a little bit subtle and you're not sure if they're kidding or not... but it's way beyond dry. Sometimes it is the comedy of discomfort, sometimes it is them specifically— even though they like you a lot— trying to derail any preconceptions you have about them to throw it off and get into that interesting energy. For whatever reason, there are a lot of puns in the comedy. It's a big wordplay thing.\" \nAlex Lehmann: \n\"All of their comedy is victim-less. They don't ever make fun of specific individuals. They don't make fun of other groups or anything. That's something that they've always focused on, is making sure that there's no harm in their comedy. Which is why they end up focusing on puns, literal humor, and absurdity because those are a couple of the ways that you can make people laugh without hurting anyone.\" \nOn the troupe's struggle between being spokespersons for Asperger's and just wanting to make people laugh \nAlex Lehmann: \n\"There's a little bit of a paradox there for sure. They're honest, sweet performers and they're trying to validate their work by not just being spokespersons for autism. And you have to respect that because if they did embrace the spokesperson role too much, it would cheapen what they're doing. If they pursue being legitimate comedians and, by happenstance, other people look up to them for that, then they're doing the legitimate thing of being artists and being successful as comedians, instead of being successful as spokespersons. So I respect it, but it's really interesting to watch that struggle.\" \nOn what the film reveals about the similarities between people on the autism spectrum and people who are neurotypical \nMark Duplass: \n\"As I watched the movie and spent more time with the guys off-screen, I guess what I realized is like, for me, there's a lot of things that I can relate to as just standard social anxiety stuff that I have here and there. You know, where you walk into a room and you feel like there's preconceptions of who you are, you feel like there's an expectation of how you're supposed to be, you find yourself performing to that. And the guys talk about that a lot— it's like 'We're not feeling certain things people are expecting us to feel, so we are taught to perform them for people.' And when I heard that I was like, 'Oh I do that all the time!' And that was a big connection point for me.\" \nTo hear the full interview, click the blue player above. \n\"Asperger's Are Us\" is currently playing at Arena Cinelounge in Los Angeles and is available on iTunes.

      "text": "By Dan Graf \nPublished November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The last time Adrian Peterson suffered a major knee injury, he came back in record time and ended up leading the NFL in rushing and winning the league MVP award in 2012.\nNeither of those achievements is likely as Peterson recovers from surgery to repair torn meniscus following a Week 2 injury against the Packers, but the 31-year-old, seven-time Pro Bowl selection reportedly is on track to get back on the field in mid- to late December, according to ESPN .\nPeterson reportedly could start running this week, and if he keeps progressing possible return dates are Dec. 18 vs. Indianapolis and Dec. 24 at Green Bay. Peterson led the NFL with 1,485 rushing yards in 2015 but this season was off to the slowest start of his career before the injury. He had 31 carries for 50 yards and no touchdowns in 6 &frac12; quarters when he went down against the Packers.\nMore from FoxSports Jared Goff's first NFL start by the numbers Drew Bledsoe explains what Tony Romo is feeling as a backup to Dak Prescott in Dallas | THE HERD Herd Hierarchy: Colin's Top 10 NFL Teams after Week 11 | THE HERD Giants are on a roll, but still taking it one game at a time Still, he could be the offensive difference-maker the Vikings have been looking for as they've fallen from a 5-0 start to 6-4, and his teammates know better than to doubt him.\n\"He's a workaholic,\" cornerback Captain Munnerlyn said Monday, via ESPN. \"I definitely wouldn't put anything past this guy. He's a fast healer. His makeup is definitely a fighter. We'll see. I think [he'll be back], but at the same time, you never know. That's a tough injury to come back from. He's got to think about his career, but he's a guy that wants to come out there and help the team win. One thing is on his mind: He wants to win that Super Bowl. So he feels like if he can come back and definitely contribute to us winning, he definitely will do it.\"",

      "text": "Kim Kardashian Is Allegedly Fed Up With Kanye West’s Behavior Like This Article Like us on Facebook \nKim Kardashian is reportedly not happy with husband Kanye West 's recent behavior. The 36-year-old reality TV star has told friends and family she has \"had it\" with West's \"narcissistic\" behavior recently and wants him to \"man up and change.\" Advertisement \nWest has been on a tour across The United States to promote his most recent album, The Life of Pablo . According to sources, Kim never wanted Kanye to go on tour in the first place – let alone join him on the tour. The mother of two believes Kanye has been too busy to spend any time with her or their two children and in return, has been pushing him to cancel the rest of the tour. \nTrouble struck when Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, France while attending Paris Fashion Week. The mother of two was held up at gunpoint in her hotel room by five masked men who were dressed up as fake Paris police officers. Although Kim was unharmed, she was tied up and gagged in the bathtub while the robbers stole over $10 million worth of jewelry and belongings. She was traumatized from the situation and since then, has put all of her career plans and use of social media on hold. Friends and family say she is still struggling, a month later, with the incident. \nIt comes as no surprise then, that Kim was unhappy that Kanye West decided to continue his tour through December. According to sources, Kanye took off several nights right after the robbery from performing and rescheduled those shows for later in the year. However, now, representatives for West say he has made the announcement to cancel the remainder of his tour. \nA source close to the couple told Daily Mail : Advertisement \"Kim is fed up. They’ve been bickering constantly - she didn’t want Kanye to do the tour in the first place. She wanted him by her side as she recovered from her traumatic robbery in Paris. She lost days with him while he’s touring and then he made a rash decision to end the concert after ten minutes and go on a rant. She wants him to grow up and really be a man, stop throwing tantrums and thinking throwing a tantrum on stage is more important than being with your children, especially after she just went through this horrible ordeal. That’s messed up. Her heart and soul need to be nurtured right now. She wishes that person was Kanye but she’s realizing right now that it’s probably not. Advertisement Kanye is not helping matters at all – first by not supporting her and then by going off on an erratic rant.\" \nThe news of the tour cancellation came as no surprise to some fans after Kanye went on an epic rant and public meltdown while performing Saturday night in Sacramento, California. \nAccording to videos posted on social media, this is how it goes. Kanye West took the stage in Sacramento on Saturday and decided that what he had to say was more important than any song he was going to sing. \" Beyonce I was hurt because I heard you said you wouldn't perform unless you won video of the year over me and over Hotline Bling. In my opinion - now don't go dissing Beyoncé , she's great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are - just to win. F*ck winning, f*ck looking cool, f*ck being cool.' At the risk of my own success. I'll give ya'll the truth.' The \"Famous\" rapper went on to say: \" Jay Z , I know you got killas. Please don't send them at my head. Just call me—talk to me like I man. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again. You don't like that. Guess what? Y'all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way motherf*ckers put money up so high. Popularity. Radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. It's a new world, Hillary Clinton. It's a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way, and they showed you how they felt... It's a new world Barack. It's a new world Jay Z .' He finished off his rant by saying: \"If you keep following old models, your ass is going to get Hillary Clinton'd. I ain't here to massage you with the fake truth, telling you that Hillary going to win over and over and over. Then you wake up and you still can't believe it. You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg.\" According to fans, he then walked off stage and didn't return. After he had only performed one song, twice. Fans were outraged that they had spent so much money to see the rapper for him to leave and not perform a concert at all. \nThey took to Twitter to discuss their outrage.

      "text": "Zeynep Tufekci saw it coming. \nPlayer utilities Popout Share download This story is based on a radio interview. Listen to the full interview.\nPRI.org \n\nBack in 2012, after US President Barack Obama won his second term in office, the University of North Carolina professor tried to tell government officials that Facebook's targeted \"dark posts\" could be used to erode democracy — and that the use of the social media tool in elections had to be rethought. \nSo-called dark posts are visible only to specific audiences and can be tailored for each group. Obama's team used the targeted ads to turn out specific groups of voters in his re-election bid. President-elect Donald Trump's team told Bloomberg that they used dark posts to discourage particular groups of voters from heading to the polls. Trump operatives admitted that they sent targeted dark posts about Hillary Clinton's infamous \"super predator\" comment to potential black voters. They also divulged that they'd sent posts about the Clinton Foundation's incompetence in Haiti (following the 2010 earthquake) to residents of Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood, hoping to dissuade Latino voters there. \nTufekci says her warnings to officials went unheeded.\n\"I said, 'Look, these tools that a lot of people credit President Obama with using to win aren't these nice, neutral tools that will only lead to good things you like, if you are a fan of President Obama.' I said, 'These tools, wherever you are on the political spectrum, have great potential for misinformation for these dark ads that are targeted to specific people — unlike TV ads or radio ads or newspaper ads that you get a chance to see — with these there's no rebuttal going on.\" \nTufekci says she doesn't think Obama operatives thought about her lecture again until the day after Election Day this year. Now, she says if the dark posts continue to go unchecked, all voters will be targeted on social media feeds with ads that tap into unacknowledged biases and can never be challenged by competitors because they are invisible to nontargeted groups. \n\"If anybody cares about having a democracy in which we can debate ideas and debate policy, and that we're not completely polarized into these dueling factions who live in alternative universes, we have to care about how to create some common ground to talk about facts and truths, ideas and policies.\" \nThe dangers are significant. Open Society fellow McKenzie Funk wrote in the New York Times on Sunday about how seemingly inconsequential Facebook quizzes are used to collect data points that could then be used to manipulate voters. \nTufekci says Facebook isn't the only culpable actor in an election that chipped away at democratic values. But she says its employees are in a position to agitate for change. \n\"Facebook has a major role that comes from its power, its unique positioning in that it has no competitor, and it has 2 billion people that it controls what they see every day,\" she says. \"This is really more than the stock options that the people who work there are going to get. This is about what it's going to say in the history books.\"",

But I want you to know that we have always taken this seriously, we understand how important the issue is for our community and we are committed to getting this right,” Zuckerberg wrote. \nREAD MORE: Facebook, Google to combat fake news after US election \nThe update marks the first time Zuckerberg has commented on the fake news issue since he said it was “extremely unlikely” fake news or hoaxes affected the outcome of the U.S. presidential election last week. \nREAD MORE: Mark Zuckerberg explains why he thinks fake news on Facebook did not influence the US election \nSince the election there has been growing outrage over Facebook’s so-called fake news problem, prompting President Obama to comment on the matter during a press conference in Germany. \n“If we are not serious about facts, and what’s true and what’s not, and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in sound bites and snippets off their phones, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” Obama said Thursday. \nIn the days following the U.S. election, several media outlets published opinion pieces accusing Facebook of influencing voters by allowing fake news websites and blogs masquerading as legitimate sources to be featured next to articles from legitimate news sources. Several pundits and media companies were concerned the information may have swayed voters towards President-elect Donald Trump. ",

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nhttp://kevbakershow.com/\nThe post REVEALED! LEAKED COVER Of Rothschilds’ The Economist 2017 DECODED! appeared first on Kev Baker Show .\nThis weekend I came across a leaked cover of the Economists’ “THE WORLD IN 2017” edition entitles Planet Trump. Previously I have had NanoGirl AKA Sharon Barrington on hand to lead the analysis of what is an illustration always abundant with symbology. This year is no different & I go over the cover in the video below. The reason myself & others take the time to decode this annual production by The Economist is the fact that is was set-up & still part owned by none other than the Rothschild family.\nSo, lets get into PLANET TRUMP!\nThis year the artist behind the illustration, on the command of his paymasters, has given us yet another feast of symbols to try and analyse so as to try and get some idea of what the Rothschild’s see coming in the year ahead, or more to the point, what they have planned for us!\nIts all tarot cards this year & i will list the cards and their meanings below.\nI give my own out-there take of what they may or may not mean in the video but its up to you what you think it all means.\nSo, lets begin…\nTHE TOWER In the opening image we have The Tower card. On the left side of the image we can see the red flag with hammer & sickle on it. Could this be a hint at Putin bringing back together the old Soviet Union as the propaganda machine the west is constantly bombarding us with?\nOn the right of the image is a cross.\nClash of civilizations?\nTAROT DEFINITION… The Tower is a card about change. Just as with the Devil and Death, the Tower is not as frightening or as ominous as the pictorial representation in most decks. Trying to hold too tightly to the status quo can be disastrous now. Roll with the changes. ( cont.. )\nJUDGEMENT\nThis one seems pretty straight forward with Trump about to put his nationalist stamp on the world.\nTAROT DEFINITION… Judgment can be a card about jumping to conclusions, decisions and judgments. which are too hastily made. If you are prone to such things, this is a clear signal to slow down and give things more thought and to give people “more chances.” This can be a real time of spiritual awakening. ( cont.. )\nTHE WORLD\nTAROT DEFINITION… The World can signify that you are figuratively feeling the weight of the world on your shoulders, which is not an easy place to be. It’s an excellent time to review how well you do at “asking for help” when you need it. Remember you don’t have to do everything on your own. ( cont.. )\nTHE HERMIT\nTAROT DEFINITION… The Hermit is an extremely spiritual card, and often has to do with institutions and large organizations – everything from a bank to the entire Christian Church. This card indicates spirituality even if you are an atheist. It’s in whatever sense the word “spirit” makes sense to you, even if for you “spirit” equates to “emotion.” You may be trying hard to figure out what the “truth” is about someone (or some matter), don’t feel that you have to do it all on your own, ask for help if you need it to gain different perspectives, more information, etc. ( cont.. )",

US Military Flag officers loyal to Donald Trump took matters into their own hands when they saw the election hack being initiated in the early morning hours of November 9th! Remember when all the counting seemed to freeze and Fox News said they wouldn’t be able to call any of the critical states until the next morning? That’s exactly when they tried to steal it! Mainstream fake news announcers were all in on the steal and knew it was coming! This explains why Megyn Kelly and others looked so shocked after having just reported from Fox’s election back room to be told no results until morning! US Military Flag Officers were willing to declare war on the CIA in Virginia and forced them to back off and disconnect their computers immediately or face an airstrike! Hear the amazing story directly from Stew Webb in the video. We’ll never know the names of the patriots who stopped the steal but they are the true heroes! The evil ones are desperate now! They are now playing their last cards of Race War, Protests, Killing Cops, False Flags and Electoral College fraud by pushing the lie Hillary won the popular vote! She didn’t!\n…\n“We can now report that Hillary Clinton made a call to her CIA ‘handler’ daddy Bush aka George Herbert Walker Bush to hack and steal five (5) states on election night 2016 on behalf of Satanist lesbian Hillary as daddy had done for his Satanist homosexual son in the year 2000 election coup de eat.\nAfter a half an hour after the 2016 election coup was ordered by pedophile daddy Bush (George H.W. Bush) the patriotic U.S. Military stepped in and stopped the election hacking operation and tuned off the E-Systems West Star satellites and Israeli VIA Sat satellite out of Englewood, Colorado that were about to steal yet another U.S. Presidential election.”\nhttp://www.stewwebb.com/2016/11/21/pizza-gate-is-pedophile-gate/\nMegyn Kelly in shock!

It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nNew American Hero – Admiral Mike Rogers\nhttps://youtu.be/-p4Z-Hoa1gc\nNote from Glenn Canady – Sorcha Faal is known to put out far more truth than the Fake News outlets Fox News, CNN, CBS and the rest so this recent post about Admiral Mike Rogers is very interesting! See also the latest regarding the Pedesta Pedophile ring where US Intelligence sources now claim the Podestas were in Portugal at the same time Madeleine McCann disappeared! The police sketches match the Podestas exactly!\nBut even more stunning is the news that according to FBI and intelligence sources, the Podesta brothers were in Portugal on May 3, 2007, the date of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. http://totalrehash.com/breaking-news-podesta-brothers-pedo-ring/\nhttp://www.stewwebb.com/2016/11/21/pizza-gate-is-pedophile-gate/\nhttp://www.stewwebb.com/2016/11/21/pizza-gate-is-pedophile-gate/\nTop US Spy Chief Flees To Trump After Stopping “False Flag” Attack\nAn astonishing Foreign Intelligence Service ( SVR ) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that US Navy Admiral Mike Rogers , who heads the Obama regimes National Security Agency ( NSA ), United States Cyber Command ( USCYBERCOM ) and is the Chief of the Central Security Service ( CSS ), fled to New York City on Thursday (17 November) seeking an urgent meeting with President-elect Donald Trump just hours after he, Rogers, singlehandedly aborted the unauthorized flight of one of America’s “ Doomsday Planes ” . [ Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in Quote: s in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, during the late afternoon (Moscow time) of 16 November, the Ministry of Defense ( MoD ) requested urgent “ assistance/guidance ” from the SVR relating to the takeoff from California’s Travis Air Force Base ( TAFB ) of a US Navy Boeing E-6 Mercury airborne command post and communications relay aircraft (popularly known as a “ Doomsday Plane ”) that was designated with the radio call sign of “ IRON99 ”, and whose destination was not able to be determined.\nThe flights of these types of “ doomsday ” aircraft, this report explains, are strictly “ governed/observed ” under the procedures, protocols and guidelines of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) signed between the Federation and the Obama regime that took effect on 5 February 2011—and that this “ IRON99 ” doomsday plane flight was in “ strict/blatant ” violation of due to the US failing to notify the MoD of its exact mission status.\nUpon being notified by the MoD of this grave New START treaty “ war threat ” violation by the Obama regime, this report continues, SVR Director Sergey Naryshkin contacted his US counterpart Admiral Mike Rogers—and though the exact details of their conversation are higher classified than this general report allows, it is important to note that immediately after Director Naryshkin contacted Admiral Rogers, this “ doomsday planes ” flight was halted over the skies of Denver, Colorado, where it was put into a “ holding pattern ” with it eventually returning to Travis Air Force Base .\nHolding pattern of “ IRON99 ” doomsday plane flight over Denver\nAs to why the US Navy ordered this doomsday plane to take flight at all, this report notes, is “ highly alarming ” as the American Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) has previously been implicated by the SVR as a “ controlling partner ” in the “ false flag ” attack events known as “ 9/11 ” that occurred on 11 September 2001—and that were only able to be stopped when a cruise missile was fired into ONI’s Pentagon communication center .\nhttps://youtu.be/07Bn_CC_mrg\nWith Admiral Rogers having stopped what was another obvious “ false flag ” attack from occurring at the hands of the ONI, and his fleeing for protection to President-elect Donald Trump afterwards, this report continues, the Obama regime and its mainstream propaganda media sycophants have now placed this esteemed US military commander under a withering public assault and are calling for him to be removed from office —and that President Obama is said to now be considering .\nAnd in what this report states can only be described as “ farcical irony ”, the same Obama regime propaganda mainstream media lapdogs that are now calling for Admiral Rogers destruction, were just 3 days ago praising him for his public statements saying that a nation-state (presumably Russia) was responsible for the hacking of secret Hillary Clinton related emails .\nBut to the “ real/true ” reasons behind the Obama-Clinton regime wanting to stage another “ false flag ” attack upon America, SVR intelligence analysts in this report say, is their fears over President-elect Trump’s assembling what is being described as a “ nationalist dream team ” to defeat the satanic and tyrannical forces of globalism forever.\nAnd so decimated have these elite globalists become in America, this report notes, these warmongers are only able to rule now from what are called their “ Coastal Citadels ” with fully one third of all US Congressional seats held by their communistic Democrat Party coming from just three States—California, New York and Massachusetts.\nEven worse, this report continues, these elite globalist Obama-Clinton Democrats are still failing to realize that President-elect Trump won the popular vote when adding 49 States (out of 50) and lost the popular vote only when adding in the communistic State of California .\nWith President-elect Trump winning these 49 States with 57.8 million votes compared to Secretary Clinton’s 55.9 million , this report further states, the Obama-Clinton supporting Washington Post newspaper is astonishingly even today beginning their re-writing of American history falsely proclaiming that Trump won only 14 States —which has led the highly respected former US Congressman, and presidential candidate, Ron Paul to include this propaganda mouthpiece on his list of real “ fake news ” media sites that not only colluded with Hillary Clinton, but continue to lie to the American people too.\nProtecting these real “ fake news ” Obama-Clinton media sites, this report continues, are America’s top technology giants—and who were joined yesterday by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg whose message for his billion-plus users is most plainly stated as: “ you’re not capable of deciding for yourself what is ‘news’ and what is not, so we will do it for you ”.\nAnd among the many things being kept hidden from the American people by these real “ fake news ” propaganda mainstream media sites, this report says, are the astounding 81,640 pages of new regulations the Obama-Clinton are unleashing upon these unsuspecting people before President-elect Trump can take power, and that goes along with the stunning $2.4 trillion of additional debt they are being saddled with too .\nNot making any sense either about the elite globalist supporting propaganda US mainstream “ fake news ” media, this report continues, are their astonishingly insane “ new ideas ” for America—and that include Japan establishing a large military training facility in the United States to create jobs and boost real estate values .\nFrom their “ Coastal Citadels ” too, this report concludes, these elite globalists are even now calling on all top fashion designers not to make an inaugural gown for the new First Lady Melania Trump , while Vice President-elect Mike Pence, likewise, was dishonorably and shamefully treated while attending a Broadway play with his family, and whose “ diverse ” cast was hired from a casting notice declaring “ no whites are able to apply ” —and leading SVR analysts to conclude that the only thing maybe saving the United States now are those military officers, like Admiral Rogers, and government officials remembering the unique among world nation’s oath they took to protect their country that pledges allegiance not to persons or regimes, but to a piece of ancient paper called the US Constitution that says :\n“I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.”\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nSource:\nhttp://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2168.htm",

      "text": "(Before It's News) Most people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship. By Eric Edwards “Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of Jehovah?” (Numbers 16:1-3).\nRebellion against God has always brought awful repercussions.\nLooking at Korah’s rebellion in Numbers 16 with the aftermath of that rebellion—should tell Americans that over His appointed rulers to protect His children.\n“And the sons of Eliab: Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against Jehovah, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign” (Numbers 26:9-10)\nIt is sad to see demonstrations in American streets for an election that did not go the way the rebels thought it should. It is reported that many are paid demonstrators, many are from out of state, and many who are instate did not vote or even register to vote.\nThe Free Dictionary by Farlex (found online) gave this definition of rebellion:\nAn act or a show of defiance toward an authority or established convention.\nGod establishes authority and most Christians are aware of Paul’s thoughts on this matter.\nPaul let us know more than once that we should accept authority because God put that authority in place to protect us.\nAdditionally, and surprisingly appropriate to our form of government, the same definition of rebellion explains the meaning of “left wing”: left-wing – Espousing radical or progressive political, social, or economic ideologies; favoring extensive political, social, or economic reform; socialistic; communistic.\nThis expression arose as the result of the French National Assembly of 1789 in which conservatives were seated in the right side, or wing, of the hall, moderates in the middle, and radical democrats and extremists in the left wing.\nThis seating arrangement persists in several contemporary legislatures including the British Commonwealth Assemblies where politicians with radical or socialistic views usually sit to the left of the presiding officer.\nAfter World War II, and especially during the McCarthy era, left-wing usually implied that one was a Communist or a Communist sympathizer. The left-wing challenge over Europe is expected to unseat at least one member of the Labour Party National Executive Committee. (Times, September 5, 1972)\nPeople or groups of people with left-wing philosophies are frequently called left wing, left-wingers, or the Left. The radical political activists in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s were often called the New Left—in an attempt to dissociate them and their activities from intimations of Communist influence or complicity.\nThis could help explain the last eight years of Obama and Clinton policies and governing.\n“But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron…” (1 Timothy 4:1-4).\nhttp://www.raptureready.com/soap2/edwards1.html\nMore great articles here: http://www.raptureready.com",

      "text": "(Before It's News) BIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nNovember 21, 2016\nThe liberation of the planet earth from Khazarian gangster control is now snowballing. The UK liberated itself with the Brexit vote while the Americans freed themselves by electing Donald Trump as President. Trump’s election was followed immediately by anti-Khazarian regime change in Bulgaria and Moldova. Next, a Presidential election in Austria and a referendum in Italy, both due on December 4th, are expected to liberate those countries. Following this will be the likely election of Marine Le Pen as President of France in May and the ouster of German Chancellor Angelina Merkel sometime in 2017.\nIn South Korea as well, Khazarian puppet President Park Geun Hye has been exposed as totally corrupt and is being removed from power. In Japan too, right-wing forces are moving against Khazarian proxies like Yasuyuki Nambu of the Pasona Group, Masayoshi Son of Softbank and others to prepare the way for the liberation of this country.\nLater in the game the European Union, the United Nations and subsidiary organizations like the IMF and the World Bank are also expected to collapse before being replaced by more representative, meritocratic, democratic and competently run institutions.\nMuch of this outcome hinges on the nearly over but still not finished power struggle in Washington D.C.\nThe first senior staff members selected by Donald Trump are all US armed forces veterans making it clear his government will be strongly linked to the US military. This means the men with guns are finally taking action.\nNavy veteran Steve Bannon is Chief Strategist, army veterans Mike Pompeo, Jeff Sessions and Michael Flynn respectively have the jobs of CIA head, Attorney General and Director of National Security. So far no neocons or Khazarians have been selected.\nA Pentagon source says the names of neocons like Rudolph Giuliani, John Bolton, David Petraeus and Mitt Romney were “floated so trump can say ‘you’re fired.’”\nNew National Security Adviser General Michael Flynn summed up the situation as follows:\n“We just went through a revolution…This is probably the biggest election in our nation’s history, since bringing on George Washington when he decided not to be a king. That’s how important this is.”\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-flynn-idUSKBN13D0AD\nIn a clear sign this really is a revolution, CIA sources tell us that arch-criminal George Soros has been “taken out,” as reported by this writer on November 20th. Pentagon sources are saying that others on the list who need to be removed from the scene include Senator John “ISIS” McCain and Edgar Bronfman who “owns McCain.”\nOther Pentagon sources say that a special “navy doomsday plane” was sent to fly from California to Denver last week to\ndeploy “special weapons” in order to “drive cabalists out of underground bases” so that they could be arrested.\nSpeaking about underground bases, White Dragon Society sources in Antarctica say:\n” One of our team members in Antarctica saw David Rockefeller with his son Richard at ‘The Base’ along with several other elites from Europe. There is a top secret meeting taking place there now. The word is that they are preparing for January 20.”\nOther sources say they saw members of the Rothschild family at that Antarctic base too.\n(The Russian documentary linked below is recommended as the most thoroughly researched background information this writer could find on secret Antarctic bases,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwUpPwyyvLw)\nIt is a good guess these elites are hoping to find shelter or else a ticket off-planet at that base but they are unlikely to find either because all the evidence indicates this planet is under some form of quarantine.\nIn any case, judging from the 2017 occult cover of the Rothschild and P2 Freemason Agnelli family owned Economist, the bloodline families are in a state of confusion. The cover, seen at the link below, is called “Planet Trump” and features tarot cards.\nhttps://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0591/1981/products/TW2017_Cover_UK_REV_NO-BC_trimmed_1024×1024.jpg?v=1479401028\nHere is this writer’s first stab and what it means:\nThe first card, called “the tower,” shows the Catholic Church being split between its communist and traditional Christian factions.\nThe second, called “Judgement” shows Donald Trump holding the symbols of power, meaning most likely they expect a Neurenberg type tribunal to be convened when he assumes office.\nThe third, called “the World” shows symbols of the gnostic Illuminati, the family owned central banks and monotheism unified under what appears to be a moon god. Above them are what appear to be Maria (the Goddess Isis), the holy book and the sun god. It seems they think the world will be unified under these symbols.\nThe fourth called “the Hermit” shows North America leading a populist movement against TPP, TTIP and the EU, indicating they have gone against their “globalist” agenda.\nThe fifth, called “death,” shows plagues, tsunamis, fish die-offs, nuclear weapons and crop failures and is probably meant as a threat by the bloodline families to unleash these calamities if they are cornered.\nThe sixth, called “the magician,” seems to indicate they expect 3d printing and virtual reality to be the biggest high tech trends of the year.\nThe seventh, called the “Wheel of Fortune” shows a smiling Marine Le Pen and a frowning Angela Merkel waiting for the results of elections indicating they expect Le Pen to win and Merkel to lose. This writer could not identify the third person.\nThe final one, “the star,” seems to show pictures of pop culture personalities who will have strong financial backing during the year. The only one this pop culture knowledge deficient writer could identify appears to be Lady Gaga.\nWhat their predictions are showing most of all though is a clear sign they no longer control the destiny of this planet and that is why the resorted to tarot cards.\nSince the Rothschilds and Angellis appear to be out of the loop on future events now, here is a bit of what sources in the new regime are saying is coming up.\nFor one thing, as soon as President Barack Obama loses his ability to issue pardons on January 20th, there are going to be a flood of revelations coming out of the US agencies about pedophilia and human sacrifice carried out by many well-known US and European politicians and personalities. The Bush/Clinton family, Mitt Romney, Carl Rove and others are expected to be included in these revelations, Pentagon sources say.\nThe Rothschilds and their kinfolk can also expect hearings about what really caused the Asian tsunami of 2006, the Japanese tsunami and nuclear disaster of 2011, the Haiti tsunami etc. In other words, the world will find out they are a bunch of ruthless mass murderers.\nThe coming months will also reveal a “Trump/Putin tag team that will kill ISIS as a prelude to a US-EU-Russian and Vatican Christian bloc to contain China and terminate the global Khazarian mafia,” the sources say.\nThe Chinese, for their part, are already leading towards a form of Christianity with Chinese features, Chinese secret society sources say. They point out that many of the features that separate Christianity from Judaism actually came from their founder Mozi 墨子(450 to 291 BC). He promoted universal love and came up with the idea of a heaven that only the virtuous could enter. He also came up with the idea that if you give a person a piece of bread you only feed them for one day but if you give them a fishing rod and teach them to fish, you can feed them for life.\nThe point being is that the Asian secret societies are already sold on the idea of make love, not war, with the West. They just don’t want to be raped, robbed and killed.\nThe obstacle to a world of universal love is now the still unsettled battle for control of the financial system and thus the process for deciding what humanity does in the future.\nOn that front, the latest news is the Dutch delegation that is visiting Indonesia this week on behalf of the Dutch royal family is upset that three Dutch World War 2 sunken warships that were discovered off the coast of Indonesia in 2002 have vanished.\nhttp://www.indonesia-investments.com/culture/culture-columns/ahead-of-trade-mission-to-indonesia-dutch-war-graves-vanish-in-java-sea/item7364\n“It is all about the Gold that was in those ships. The Dutch were trying to bring part of the ancient royal treasure that they had stolen from the Indonesia Royals of Java and Sulawesi to the Netherlands so the Japanese would not get it,” a WDS source in Indonesia explains.\nIt sounds like the European bloodline families were counting on this gold to back their efforts to keep control of the world’s financial system and now they are back to square one.\nIf there is in fact no gold, or if it has already all been stolen and used, we need to find this out ASAP. We cannot wait forever for these legendary million ton stashes of gold to appear. If the gold does not exist, a new reality based financial system can be made without it. Money can be backed by real estate, commodities, industrial facilities, labour etc.\nAs soon as a new, transparently, meritocratically and honestly run financial system is launched many wonderful things can start right away.\nThe Russians, for example, have already given the go ahead for a tunnel linking Siberia with Alaska. People and freight could then move by train from New York to London via Moscow.\nBIN NOTE: If by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nhttp://inhabitat.com/russia-green-lights-65-billion-siberia-alaska-rail-and-tunnel-to-bridge-the-bering-strait/ We must stop fighting and starting saving the planet.",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMost people who use social media have figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the government, for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nDylan Charles , Editor\nWaking Times\nNow that the establishment corporate and liberal media have declared open war on so-called ‘ fake news ,’ already rolling out plans to flag, censor, robotically restrict and demonetize the efforts of independent journalists, the world waits with bated breath to see exactly what form the control of information will take.\nThe 24/7 talking heads on cable news are already repeating ad nauseam the ‘fake news’ talking points, as they do whenever there is a top-down agenda to push onto our supposedly free society.\nIn this case: America is divided because of fake news, fake news is a dangerous threat to democracy, fake news looks just like real news and we need experts to tell us what’s what, if we don’t stop fake news then people will be misled, fake news causes confusion and disrupts society, facts have no meaning when there’s fake news, fake news is information warfare and needs to be treated like terrorism.\nYou may be wondering, what, then, is real news?\nHere’s an example, hot off the press.\nAt the ongoing Standing Rock civil disobedience action in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline, some 167 people were injured last night by militarized police forces who assaulted a bridge occupied by peaceful protestors including men, women, children and elderly persons. The temperature was well below freezing and for hours the police sprayed the crowd water cannons, fired many rounds of flash bang grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas, and used the LRAD acoustic weapon to disperse dissidents.\nHere’s a video of the assault, from TYT .\nDuring the assault, at least one elder was left in critical condition and it is reported that 13-year old girl suffered serious injuries when shot with a rubber bullet.\nThis is happening in America, to Americans, by American police, which makes it quite newsworthy to Americans.\nWe know without question, without even having to ask, that any crackdown on ‘fake news’ will not in any way apply to mainstream, corporate news sources such as the major newspapers and the major cable news networks.\nA scan of ‘real news’ sources the morning after this major confrontation between police and resistors at Standing Rock reveals that stories like this, stories of resistance to corporate rule and government authoritarianism.\nThese Sources Did Not Report On This:\nCNN.com – Although the homepage of CNN features around a hundred stories, as of the time of this post, there was no mention whatsoever about the Standing Rock confrontation last night.\nMSNBC.com – No mention whatsoever of this event on this mainstream news site. The top 6 posts at the time this article was written were all about Donald Trump, his cabinet picks, and how his administration was going to be terrible.\nCBS News – No coverage of this story on the CBS News homepage.\nDrudgeReport.com – This story has not been aggregated on the Drudge Report.\nThese Sources Did Report on This:\nFoxNews.com – The confrontation did make it the homepage of Fox, but not as a headline story. A short video was included, and the coverage was short and to the point.\nABC News – ABC did cover this story, under the headline, ‘ Hundreds of Dakota Access Protestors Clash with Police ,’ implying that demonstrators engaged law enforcement.\nWashingtonPost.com – WP did cover this story, ‘ Police, citing ‘ongoing riot,’ use water cannons on Dakota Access protesters in freezing weather.’\nNew York Times – This story is mentioned here, under the headline, ‘ Dakota Pipeline Protestors Soaked by Police Water Cannons .’\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile this story is featured on some of the typical mainstream corporate sites, the depth and extent of their coverage is nothing compared to the work of independent journalists such as Unicorn Riot . In the months long standoff over the Dakota Access pipeline, mainstream media has been almost completely absent.\nIn the information age, the media has become the narrator of our society and culture, setting priorities and defining the agenda of the day. It has the power to amplify issues and the power to hide issues. The power to fee us, and the power to keep us enslaved.\nWhen the hammer of widespread internet censorship drops in America, who will decide which issues should be seen by the public? Will the attack on ‘fake news’ be used by corporate media to further control the public narrative by making it easier to omit the facts and stories that help to expose and disrupt the increasingly authoritarian overtures of corporations and government?\nRead more articles by Dylan Charles .\nAbout the Author Dylan Charles is a student and teacher of Shaolin Kung Fu, Tai Chi and Qi Gong, a practitioner of Yoga and Taoist arts, and an activist and idealist passionately engaged in the struggle for a more sustainable and just world for future generations.

(Photo: Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports) \nAfter the presidential election, Gregg Popovich fired off a passionate rant about Donald Trump's election . It was a moment that had some thinking Popovich wouldn't be all that bad at politics. \nPopovich, 67, has never publicly expressed a desire to get into politics, but he was asked about this potential career change on Monday. \nLet's just say he didn't rule it out. \nVia ESPN's Tim MacMahon : \nAfter listening to Gregg Popovich speak passionately about social issues, I asked if he'd ever consider going into politics. \"Anybody else have anything?\" he answered. Not a no. \nNot a yes either, but leave it to Popovich to just change the subject rather than saying no. We wouldn't expect him to handle the question any differently. \nClassic Popovich.

Facebook is planning to spend $6 billion to buy back some of its stock. The move is being seen as a sign of confidence from the company’s management team. By Nov. 21, 2016 3:01 p.m. ET Text Size Large Photo: Getty Images \nAfter a rough few weeks, Facebook needs some new likes and the company is devoting $6 billion to the task. That’s how much Facebook is spending to buy back its own stock . \nA buyback is a way of boosting earnings by reducing the number of shareholders that divide up a company’s profits. \nTechnology companies have traditionally avoided such buybacks, preferring to spend the money on new growth opportunities. But buybacks have become more popular of late in Silicon Valley. Apple and Google-parent Alphabet have spent big money on their stock, as well. \nFor Facebook, the buyback seems to have quelled recent concerns about the stock. Facebook shares jumped 4% on Monday, to $122, erasing some of the recent losses. \nInvestors and others have been worried about the wrath of “fake news” that filled Facebook leading up to the election. Also, last week, Facebook added to the overall worries by admitting that it had misreported some of its advertising metrics . \nThe buyback is a sign of confidence from Facebook’s management team -- a way of saying everything is on track, and we’re handing $6 billion back to shareholders to prove it. \nThe move seems to have worked. Perhaps investors are once again thinking about Facebook’s massive global reach . \nBig Picture: Facebook is spending $6 billion to “buy back” some of its stock. That’s being seen as a sign of confidence from the company’s management team. \nMore from Barron’s Next:",
