      "text": "Chinese Makers Lead Smartphone Growth as Apple, Samsung Shares Plummet: Gartner Reddit \nChinese manufacturers are driving growth in the smartphone market as sector leaders Samsung and Apple sputter, a survey showed Thursday. \nThe survey by Gartner Inc. showed that in the third quarter, three Chinese vendors - Huawei , Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment - together accounted for 21 percent of the smartphones sold worldwide, and were the only vendors in the top five to increase sales. \n\"Sales of smartphones in China grew by 12.4 percent, and the vendors who most successfully exploited the sales opportunities there were Oppo and BBK,\" said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta. \n\"In Oppo's case, 81 percent of its smartphone sales came from China, while BBK accounted for 89 percent of smartphones sales in China. These two vendors also grew strongly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia.\" ( Also see: Lenovo Takes Second Spot in Indian Smartphone Market, Says IDC )\nGartner's survey confirmed other reports showing Samsung and Apple at the top of the global market but with slipping sales. \nThe research firm said Samsung's market share dropped to 19.2 percent amid the fiasco over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were recalled and then halted after overheating batteries leading to fires. \n\"The decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note 7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung's brand will make it harder for the company to increase its smartphone sales in the short term,\" said Gupta. \n\"For Samsung, it's crucial that the Galaxy S8 launches successfully, so that partners and customers regain trust in its brand.\" \nApple's share dropped to 11.5 percent as the iPhone maker failed to get much benefit from Samsung's woes, Gartner said. \n\"The withdrawal of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 may benefit sales of Apple's iPhone 7 Plus only slightly, as Galaxy Note 7 users are likely to stay with Samsung or at least with Android,\" said Gartner's Roberta Cozza. \n\"To some extent, other Android vendors could capitalize on this situation in the short term - for example, Huawei and other Chinese brands present in the premium Android phone segment.\" \nCozza said the Samsung problems could also benefit Google , which recently introduced its Pixel and Pixel XL devices. \nGartner said overall smartphone sales in the quarter rose 5.4 percent to 373 million units.",

( AAPL ) has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays. But, the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity√Ç to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe report indicated that OLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities,. The four largest producers are Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and Japan Display Inc. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. \nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's debut, the report said.",

      "text": "4 hours ago \n‚ÄúDesigned in California,‚Äù and soon to be made there as well? \nApple has asked two of its major product assemblers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to explore the possibility of manufacturing future iPhones in the US, Nikkei reported Thursday, Nov. 17 (Friday morning in Japan). \nThe report suggests that Apple has asked both companies to look into how feasible it would be to produce the number of iPhones they currently do‚Äîroughly 200 million a year‚Äîin the US rather than Asia. Pegatron turned down the request, citing concerns around how much it would cost, while Foxconn looked into it, according Nikkei. ‚ÄúMaking iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,‚Äù the unnamed source told Nikkei. Apple wasn‚Äôt immediately available to comment on the report. \nApple‚Äôs impetus for potentially moving production of its most popular product to the US is reportedly due to concerns that president-elect Donald Trump may attempt to force the company to produce at least part of the iPhone domestically. Trump criticized Apple multiple times during his campaign, including its stance on refusing the FBI‚Äôs demand to unlock the San Bernardino shooter‚Äôs phone, and suggesting that the company should build the iPhone in the US. \nProduction costs would likely skyrocket were Apple to build its next generations of the iPhone in the US, but it wouldn‚Äôt really be because labor would cost so much more there. One of the benefits of Western companies manufacturing goods in Asia is that labor costs are indeed far lower than what they are at home. But as Jason Dedrick, a professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, told The Wall Street Journal , if Apple could find enough workers in one place to assemble massive amounts of iPhones in the US, the cost per iPhone would likely increase by about $30 or $40 (a new iPhone starts at $649 in the US), and only a small part of that would be due to labor. \nThe real issue is that the vast majority of Apple‚Äôs suppliers, the companies that build the individual components that make up an iPhone‚Äîsuch as the battery, the camera, the display, the sensors, and just about every other part inside the iPhone‚Äîare based in Asia. \nApple has suppliers in 28 countries, and the countries with the highest concentration of suppliers are China, Japan, the US, and Taiwan, according to MIT Technology Review . Shipping all of those individual parts to the US would cost a lot more than moving them around China or shipping them across Asia. \nDedrick estimated for The Wall Street Journal that making all the iPhone components in the US could see the cost of an iPhone rise by $90. And that‚Äôs assuming Apple would be able to source all of the same components in the US. Apple has been working with manufacturers and suppliers for decades, and almost 10 years on the iPhone alone, and replacing those relationships would not necessarily be easy. The company also uses manufacturers like Foxconn to help prototype products, so the research and development costs of finding new partners (or doing more work in-house) would also likely increase.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

It could happen soon.\nQuote: s in the article Apple Inc AAPL\n‚ñº 109.95 -0.04 -0.04% Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF\n‚ñº 4.97 -0.29 -5.48% Pegatron Corp 4938\n‚ñ≤ 73.20 +0.90 +1.24% Apple asked Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S., according to a report in financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.\nFoxconn agreed to look into the possibility though Pegatron declined over concerns that the cost of doing so would be too high, the report said.\nThe report comes one week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While on the campaign trail in January, then-candidate Trump warned he would try to force Apple into manufacturing its products in the U.S.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,‚Äù he told a crowd a Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.\nThat isn't all. As a candidate, Trump also called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters.\nApple declined to comment on the report, though it provided a statement about its efforts in the U.S.\n‚ÄúApple is responsible for creating more than 2 million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers,\" the company said, citing a jobs creation link on its website. \"We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.‚Äù\n¬© Apple A worker inspects an iPhone at a final assembly facility in Zhengzhou, China. Bringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could be seen as a big win for the President-elect, though at exactly what cost remains to be seen. Market researcher IHS Markit said it costs roughly $225 to build the 32GB iPhone 7, the cheapest new model Apple makes. It retails for $649.\nAlthough it may not sound like a lot, the phone is $36.89 pricier than last year's iPhone 6S, and that is with IHS factoring in $5 for manufacturing costs.\nFoxconn has similarly expressed concerns over cost, including from chairman Terry Gou. One unnamed source told Nikkei magazine that \"making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double.\"\nThere is also the risk of Chinese push-back. Amid concerns over Trump vow to impose a 45% tax on all Chinese imports, Chinese state-backed paper Global Times published an op-ed saying China would respond \"tit-for-tat,\" and that \"US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\"\nIf Apple does bring the iPhone to the U.S., it would not be the first product the company has manufactured domestically.\nWhile the company already builds a variety of parts for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs in the U.S., in 2013 the company notably announced that its updated Mac Pro computer would be assembled in the U.S.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\nGo to MSN Home",

(Photo : Getty Images/Stephen Lam) Advertisement \nThe much hyped Apple New MacBook Pro(2016) was launched on October 27, 2016, by Apple CEO, Tim Cook at Cupertino, California. The new MacBook Pro was released in two models -13-Inch & 15-Inch, of which 15-inch is pampered with incredible specs and features. \nApple claims that the new ultra-thin MacBook Pro is 17% thinner in size and lighter than its predecessors. Also, it is 67% brighter and 130% faster in graphics than earlier models. The battery powers more than 10 hours when fully charged. As in vogue, the 15-inch will boast retina display with AMOLED screen, featuring P3 colors which exhibit 25% sharper and brighter colors more than standard RGB. \nAs per The Verge , the 15-inch new MacBook pro has brilliantly designed Touch bar, replacing the old function keys on the keyboard. The intelligent Touch ID offers varied functionality as per user inputs. The Touch ID incorporated with a fingerprint sensor is similar to the one incorporated in iPhone7, useful to authenticate and process purchases seamlessly. \nNew MacBook Pro powered with two base configurations, reports Apple Inside . The first version uses 2.6 GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7 Skylake with 6GB shared L3 cache & 256 GB storage and second configured with 2.7 GHz Quad-core Intel i7 Skylake with 8GB L3 cache & 512 GB storage. Both advanced processors are designed to deliver utmost performance coupled with optimal energy consumption. Graphics are best supported with basic Intel HD Graphics 530 with AMD Radeon 450 or 455 GPU depending on configurations. \nHowever, there are no surprises in the store for color options. The laptop comes in 2 standard shades- Space Grey & Silver. The price for the two 15-inch variants offered at $2399 & 2799 on the Apple official website. \nOur verdict is that with fabulous specs and fantastic features, the new MacBook pro is a technological marvel for geeks who can't resist the temptation of a premium laptop. \n¬© 2016 Enstarz, All rights reserved.

      "text": "Find on Facebook   7:27 p.m. \nREED PLANTATION, Maine ‚Äî One of the world‚Äôs largest tech companies and a top-ranked conservation organization who last year partnered to buy a large swath of land in southern Aroostook County are again joining forces to donate a conservation easement on the more than 32,400 acres known as Reed Forest. \nIn April 2015, Apple gave an undisclosed amount of money to The Conservation Fund to buy and manage more than 36,000 acres of working forestland in Maine and North Carolina, with the vast majority of the land being located on the Mattawamkeag River in The County. \nThe intent was to maintain the property as a working forest and prevent it from being subdivided or developed for nonforest uses. \nApple announced this week that in partnership with The Conservation Fund it was donating the conservation easement on the Reed Forest land to the Forest Society of Maine.   \nThe easement puts restrictions on the deed so that use of the land can be monitored and enforced legally in perpetuity, said Tom Duffus, vice president of The Conservation Fund, a national nonprofit land trust with offices in Freeport. \nApple also is supporting The Conservation Fund‚Äôs donation of an endowment to the Forest Society of Maine to ensure the protection of the land ‚Äúfor centuries to come.‚Äù \nThe easement guarantees recreational activities in the forest, such as hunting and fishing, and requires forest harvest plans to address water quality, native fish and wildlife habitat, scenic benefits and other conservation values, according to the entities involved. \nDuffus said Thursday that after last year‚Äôs land purchase, officials with The Conservation Fund immediately set about studying the land to inventory it for plant and animal species and natural resources. The land also has been used as a working forest, supplying mills throughout the state and keeping residents of Maine employed, he added. \nReed‚Äôs wetlands, rivers and upland forest provide refuge in the North Woods for Atlantic salmon, bald eagle, northern goshawk and Canada lynx, according to The Conservation Fund. \nLast year, Lisa Jackson, Apple‚Äôs vice president of Environmental Initiatives, co-wrote an article with The Conservation Fund CEO Larry Selzer about the partnership, laying out Apple‚Äôs case for starting a campaign to supply 100 percent of the fibers used in its paper and packaging ‚Äúfrom sustainably managed forests or controlled wood sources.‚Äù \nThe partnership launched its initiative last year by acquiring the Maine land and another 3,600 acres of pine and hardwood forest along the southern coast of North Carolina. Apple said it is working to buy and conserve working forestland that produces amounts of wood products equivalent to what it uses in packaging for its electronic products. \nAlan Hutchinson, executive director of the Forest Society of Maine, said Thursday that he ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt be happier‚Äù about the conservation easement project. \n‚ÄúIt is a tremendous step forward for our country and a tremendous gain for our state,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese conservation easements are a real gain for the people of Maine, because they allow landowners to keep the forests as forests. I also think that every company should be so forward thinking about their packaging as Apple is.‚Äù",

      "text": "Apple offers to repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with 'touch disease' The company says it will repair the phones for $149 Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 17, 2016 6:57 PM PT Email   There was an error emailing this page. iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus Credit: Serenity Caldwell More like this 10 tablets for under $500 \nApple is offering to repair at a reduced price iPhone 6 Plus smartphones with display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThe problem, described in August as ‚Äútouch disease‚Äù by repair guide website iFixit, is characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen. The issue affects both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, according to iFixit. \nApple appears to consider it a problem with the way users handled the phone rather than a defect. It said Thursday that the company has determined that the smartphones may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues ‚Äú after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.‚Äù \n[ Also on CIO.com: How to save on mobile plans: Your guide to 16 no-contract carriers ] \nThe company is now offering to repair the problem for a service price of US$149 if the phone is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken. \nThe problem, however, runs deeper, according to iFixit. Merely replacing the touchscreen doesn‚Äôt fix the issue as the gray bar eventually shows up on the new screen, too, it said. It quotes repair experts as stating that the problem is with the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone, which convert touch information into inputs for the phone. \nOn Thursday, iFixit said it had found that stress on the phone causes the chips to eventually lose connection with the motherboard, and pointed to \"insufficient structural support around the logic board.\" It said it had seen the problem on phones that have never been dropped. \nA proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users was filed in August by a law firm, alleging a design defect in the iPhone 6 series phones. \nApple has offered to reimburse the cost difference to those iPhone 6 customers who have already repaired the phone earlier for the same issue either through Apple or through an authorized service provider. Those who have paid for a repair believed to be related to the issue but have not been contacted yet by Apple, are asked to get in touch with the company.

It could happen soon.\nApple asked Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S., according to a report in financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.\nFoxconn agreed to look into the possibility though Pegatron declined over concerns that the cost of doing so would be too high, the report said.\nThe report comes one week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While on the campaign trail in January, then-candidate Trump warned he would try to force Apple into manufacturing its products in the U.S.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,‚Äù he told a crowd a Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.\nThat isn't all. As a candidate, Trump also called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters.\nApple declined to comment on the report, though it provided a statement about its efforts in the U.S.\n‚ÄúApple is responsible for creating more than 2 million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers,\" the company said, citing a jobs creation link on its website. \"We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.‚Äù\n¬© Apple A worker inspects an iPhone at a final assembly facility in Zhengzhou, China. Bringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could be seen as a big win for the President-elect, though at exactly what cost remains to be seen. Market researcher IHS Markit said it costs roughly $225 to build the 32GB iPhone 7, the cheapest new model Apple makes. It retails for $649.\nAlthough it may not sound like a lot, the phone is $36.89 pricier than last year's iPhone 6S, and that is with IHS factoring in $5 for manufacturing costs.\nFoxconn has similarly expressed concerns over cost, including from chairman Terry Gou. One unnamed source told Nikkei magazine that \"making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double.\"\nThere is also the risk of Chinese push-back. Amid concerns over Trump vow to impose a 45% tax on all Chinese imports, Chinese state-backed paper Global Times published an op-ed saying China would respond \"tit-for-tat,\" and that \"US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\"\nIf Apple does bring the iPhone to the U.S., it would not be the first product the company has manufactured domestically.\nWhile the company already builds a variety of parts for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs in the U.S., in 2013 the company notably announced that its updated Mac Pro computer would be assembled in the U.S.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "The camera quality on Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 Plus is already best in class, but Apple certainly has no plans to rest on its laurels and let the rest of the industry play catch-up. According to a new research report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple‚Äôs larger iPhone 8 models will likely sport dual optical image stabilization. \nDON‚ÄôT MISS:  Your iPhone 8 might not include Apple‚Äôs hottest new feature next year \nAs it stands now, of the two camera lens‚Äô on the iPhone 7 Plus, only the wide-angle lens comes equipped with optical image stabilization. Kuo‚Äôs note, obtained by MacRumors , relays that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the accompanying telephoto lens gets in on the action as well.\nThe research note reads in part:\n\nWe believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of next year‚Äôs new iPhone. We think photo quality and optical zoom range may both improve as a result. We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from: (1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes; and (2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners.\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that Apple‚Äôs 4.7-inch iPhone 8 will reportedly not be graced with a dual camera setup. That being the case, the feature will only be available on the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 and the premium iPhone 8 with the edgeless and curved OLED display.\nAll in all, Apple‚Äôs plans with the iPhone 8 camera are starting to look incredibly intriguing. Earlier today, we relayed how Apple‚Äôs next-gen iPhone may incorporate some compelling new augmented reality features into the camera app itself.\nTrending right now: \nThis $20 gadget will completely change the way you experience TV The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 Walmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money.",

Dubbed \"Touch Disease,\" the symptoms include an unresponsive display and a horizontal flickering gray bar across the top of the screen. While many third party repair experts have seen plenty of 2015 iPhone units with the disease, Apple did not originally recognize it as an issue. The company told those with an affected model out of warranty, that they would have to buy a new phone.While a class action suit has been filed against Apple by those with an iPhone that has caught the \"illness,\" the company now not only agrees that the problem exists, but is offering a repair program. The cost of the repair is $149.While Apple is saying that the issue comes as a result of multiple drops on a hard service, repair pros say that more specifically, Touch Disease could be the result of problems with the controller chips that turn touch inputs into signals. One theory is that the issue is caused by a manufacturing defect with the U2402 Meson Touch IC chip. Another theory is that solder balls used on the motherboard have cracked, allowing the controller chips to lose contact with the board. Both theories could be consistent with an iPhone that has suffered multiple drops. \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.\"-Apple Support If you have an iPhone 6 Plus with Touch Disease, you might want to have Apple make the necessary repairs.

      "text": "Sony PlayStation Vue Now Available on Apple TV Updated: November 17, 2016 ‚Äî 1:13 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Todd Spangler \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Sony Interactive Entertainment's PlayStation Vue broadband-delivered pay-TV service is now available on Apple TV set-tops -- with the launch coming just before AT&T debuts its DirecTV Now rival. \nPS Vue is available only on fourth-generation Apple TV devices. Users will be able to take advantage of Apple TV's Siri-enabled remote and touch-based navigation. Sony's virtual pay-TV service is also available on PlayStation 3 and 4 consoles, Roku, Google Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, iOS and Android devices, and Amazon Fire tablets. \nRelated Will Skinny Bundles Like AT&T's DirecTV Now Destroy Pay TV? \nPlayStation Vue provides access to live TV programming, including sports networks like ESPN and NFL Network and entertainment channels like AMC, FX and HBO. Last week, Sony dropped Viacom's networks from the lineup, citing the need to provide \"compelling value to our fans.\" The company has not disclosed how many subs it has signed up for PS Vue, which first launched in March 2015. \nUsers with an existing PlayStation Vue account can link their subscription to Apple TV and start streaming immediately. New users can sign up for one of several plan options through the PlayStation Vue website and link their subscription to Apple TV, without the need for a PlayStation console. A seven-day free trial is available to new PlayStation Vue customers. \nRelated Sony's PlayStation Vue TV Service Loses Viacom Networks, Adds Vice and NBA TV \nSony offers four PlayStation Vue plans: Access, with 45-plus channels for $29.99 per month ($39.99 in markets with local TV channels, which include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, and Miami), Core, with 60-plus channels for $34.99 ($44.99 in local TV markets); Elite, with 90-plus channels for $44.99 per month ($54.99 in local TV markets); and Ultra, which includes all the Elite channels plus HBO and Showtime for $64.99 ($74.99 in local TV markets). \nPlayStation Vue will get a formidable new competitor with DirecTV Now, which AT&T says it plans to launch in late November. DirecTV Now will comprise a bundle of more than 100 channels starting at $35 per month -- aggressive price point that analysts say mean the over-the-top service will operate initially with a negative margin. \nPS Vue also competes with Dish Network's Sling TV, which starts at $20 per month for about 30 channels.

      "text": " Tech stocks have taken a beating since Donald Trump was elected president last week as investors weigh concerns about his anti-trade rhetoric throughout his campaign.\nPiper Jaffray's Gene Munster released a note this morning saying that the current dip in tech stocks has created is a \"buying opportunity\" for Apple ( AAPL ) and the members of big-cap tech group FANG, including Facebook ( FB ) , Amazon.com ( AMZN ) , Netflix ( NFLX ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL ) . Munster joined CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Thursday afternoon to talk about the call.\nThe firm can make \"this kind of lump or basket-type of a call\" because the tech selloff has been \"pretty consistent across the board,\" Munster noted. All of the stocks are down because Trump's comments were \"broader\" and talked about the Internet and tech space in general.\nPiper Jaffray isn't worried about a bubble mentality because \"each company is unique in terms of how they're playing into this,\" he said.\n\"I was an analyst during the bubble and learned a lot of lessons about not kind of playing into the group think but there is a distinction here between these past bubbles,\" Munster noted. \"I think each of these companies has some really bright outlooks.\nApple in particular is a \"great story to own\" in the next year because the iPhone 7 has such low expectations, Munster claimed.\nWith FANG, it's easier to \"dream\" about where those stocks could go longer term, so the bubble mentality isn't as big of a concern there, he added.",

Advertisement \niOS 10.2 beta 3 is accompanied by the third betas for MacOS Sierra 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, while the previous versions of the beta updates included support for new emoji, SOS feature and more. \nDevelopers can now download iOS 10.2 beta 3 directly from the Apple developer center. The release notes for the iOS 10.2 beta do not mention any new features. However, the previous two beta builds amazed us with a few new additions, reports CultOfMac . \nMacOS Sierra is the latest Mac operating system since September. It included support for Siri, Apple Pay for the web, Apple Watch auto-unlocking, Universal Clipboard, Picture-in-Picture multitasking, improved iCloud Drive integration, and other features. \nApple Watch users can also get the watchOS 3.1.1 through the dedicated Apple Watch app on iPhone. Users have to go to General, Software, then Update. \nFor the installation of the watchOS 3.1.1 beta update, Apple Watch battery must be at least 50 percent charged and the device must be connected to the charger. Most importantly, Apple Watch must be in the range with iPhone as, watchOS 3.1 beta update requires an iPhone that runs on iOS 10 to install, Mac Rumors reported. \niPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus users will get a new batch of wallpapers with iOS 10.2 and the iOS update also brings the new TV app to all iPhones and iPads. The SOS feature, which was added in iOS 10.2 beta 2, appears to have been pulled out from the newest build. \nMacOS 10.12.2 beta 3 have a number of bug fixes and performance enhancements. The latest update will also contain support for all the new Unicode 9.0 emoji with that the Mac users will now be able to send shrugs, avocados, face palms, sharks and other characters over SMS and iMessage. \nIn the release notes for tvOS 10.1 beta 3 there were not mentioning of any major changes. Apple is likely working on under-the-hood improvements for the new TV app, which is set to make a debut on the Apple TV in December, reports TechTimes . \nFor now, all the major and minor changes for the third set of betas have yet to be discovered. ¬© 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "title": "Uber protests legal battle in Taiwan, as government ponders app removal",
      "text": "Taiwan plans to ask Apple and Google to remove the ride sharing app from the nation's app stores in an attempt to curb the company‚Äôs influence on the island, Reuters reports, the latest development in Uber's continuing legal troubles around the world.\nIn Taiwan, Uber operates as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company. The Taiwanese government argues that this is a misrepresentation of the company, and has ordered it to pay back taxes.\n\"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, told Reuters.\nRecommended: Foreign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game The action would remove all Uber-associated apps ‚Äì including UberEATS, which was launched just days ago in Taiwan. However, the government has not said how it will prevent downloading from other sources, or what to do about phones that have already downloaded the apps.\nForeign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/17 Uber, however, maintains that it is working with authorities to comply with regulations, and has urged the government to reconsider .\n\"These developments directly threaten the interests of over a million Taiwanese citizens, especially the mothers, fathers, retirees, professionals, and the otherwise unemployed who have come to rely on the economic opportunities Uber has created,\" Uber said in a letter signed by Mike Brown, the regional general manager of Uber Asia Pacific.\nUber started operating in Taiwan in 2013, after President Tsai Ing-wen's \"Asian Silicon Valley\" initiative, pushing for Taiwan to become a bigger center for high-tech business. However, as the app has grown in popularity, it has been staunchly opposed by local taxi drivers, similar to conflicts it has faced in cities from the United States to Hong Kong.\nNow in over 60 countries around the globe, \"Uber moved faster than any other company going international\" in order to secure the markets from local companies mimicking their business model, Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, a company investor and board member, told Reuters in 2015 .\nBut foreign markets, particularly those in Asian countries, have delivered new challenges in addition to the lawsuits the ride-sharing company is entrenched with at home. Uber only became legal in China this summer after facing a litany of legal problems, and has had to stop some services in Hong Kong .\nUber has tried to adapt to different societies' transportation needs by adapting its business model to fit each one, Reuters reported last year. In Singapore, for example, where cars are limited, it rents approved cars out to its drivers.\n\"Uber is smart to have this flexibility in different markets and not have the same features everywhere,\" Jan Dawson, an Uber analyst with Jackdaw Research, told Reuters. \"The downside is that it is very costly.\"",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus Credit: Serenity Caldwell More good reads Stocking Stuffer Ideas, Deals and Discounts - Deal Alert \nApple is offering to repair at a reduced price iPhone 6 Plus smartphones with display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThe problem, described in August as ‚Äútouch disease‚Äù by repair guide website iFixit, is characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen. The issue affects both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, according to iFixit. \nApple appears to consider it a problem with the way users handled the phone rather than a defect. It said Thursday that the company has determined that the smartphones may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues ‚Äú after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.‚Äù [ITWorld DealPost: The best in tech deals and discounts. ] \nThe company is now offering to repair the problem for a service price of US$149 if the phone is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken. \nThe problem, however, runs deeper, according to iFixit. Merely replacing the touchscreen doesn‚Äôt fix the issue as the gray bar eventually shows up on the new screen, too, it said. It quotes repair experts as stating that the problem is with the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone, which convert touch information into inputs for the phone. \nOn Thursday, iFixit said it had found that stress on the phone causes the chips to eventually lose connection with the motherboard, and pointed to \"insufficient structural support around the logic board.\" It said it had seen the problem on phones that have never been dropped. \nA proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users was filed in August by a law firm, alleging a design defect in the iPhone 6 series phones. \nApple has offered to reimburse the cost difference to those iPhone 6 customers who have already repaired the phone earlier for the same issue either through Apple or through an authorized service provider. Those who have paid for a repair believed to be related to the issue but have not been contacted yet by Apple, are asked to get in touch with the company. Related:",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nSling TV has been available on the fourth-generation Apple TV since the latest update was announced at the company‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference event this past summer. Sony‚Äôs competing live TV streaming service, PlayStation Vue, has been conspicuously absent, however. That has finally changed, as Sony‚Äôs streaming service is finally coming to Apple‚Äôs streamer. \nDan Myers, PlayStation Vue head of product, announced the expansion to Apple TV in a blog post on Thursday. ‚ÄúAs one of the most highly requested devices by our fans, the PlayStation Vue experience on Apple TV will provide viewers with a better option to watch your favorite live TV programming, with unique streaming features such as cloud DVR, simultaneous streaming, and no long-term contract commitments,‚Äù Myers wrote. \nMore: PlayStation Vue has finally come to Android TV devices; PC, Mac are next \nLike Sling TV, PlayStation Vue is only available on the fourth-generation Apple TV, but owners of older models are likely used to no longer getting new channels by now. Unlike PlayStation Vue‚Äôs app for Roku devices, it seems that the streaming service‚Äôs standard look and feel will remain intact on the Apple TV, though device-specific features like the Siri remote and touch navigation will mean some differences. \nIf you‚Äôre already a PlayStation Vue subscriber, all you‚Äôll need to do is download the app and link your account. If you‚Äôre a first-time subscriber, you won‚Äôt be able to subscribe right from the Apple TV. Instead, you‚Äôll need access to a web browser so you can sign up and link your account on the PlayStation Vue website. \nMore: PlayStation Vue drops Viacom channels, adds BBC America, Vice, and NBA TV \nPlayStation Vue allows viewers to link their accounts on up to five devices, and simultaneously stream on all of them at once, including access to the service‚Äôs cloud-based DVR. Plans start at $30, though the base price is $40 if you‚Äôre in a location where channels from local network affiliates can be included in your package. Currently these cities include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, and Miami. \nIf you‚Äôre not sure about the service but would like to try it out, a seven-day free trial is available. For more information or to subscribe, head to the PlayStation Vue website . Also watch: Yamaha YSP-5600 Review | Atmos/DTS-X sound bar ",

      "text": "Automated detection of sleep, a feature previously only available to purchasers of dedicated health and fitness trackers such as Fitbit or Jawbone, is now available to Apple Watch owners. Sleep Watch by Bodymatter is the first and only sleep monitoring app for Apple Watch that lets users collect their sleep statistics without the need to open apps at bedtime or upon rising. The app automatically detects and monitors estimated sleep time, awake time, sleeping heart rate and sleep quality, but allows users to manually adjust their results to more accurately track their patterns.\nSince the launch of Sleep Watch version 1.8 on October 17, 2016, the app has boasted an average user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 stars and has consistently ranked among the Top 50 Paid Health and Fitness Apps in the US iTunes App Store. Reception from Apple Watch owners continues to be extremely positive:\n‚Äú...I purchased the app and have been using nightly for about 10 days. This is one app that really takes advantage of the Watch and the first indispensable app I've found.‚Äù\njsamuels, MacRumors.com Forum, Nov 5, 2016\n‚ÄúI was looking for sleep tracking as close to the automatic tracking of the Fitbit as I could find and with SleepWatch my search is over. It works well and allows you to adjust the times if they are not detected correctly, can't really expect much more on that front (certainly beats having to manually start and end‚Ä¶)‚Äù\nhsafavi, App Store Review, Nov 2, 2016\n‚ÄúAuto-tracking works great with continuous app updates. Best I've used so far, well worth the $.\"\nTiltasauras, App Store Review, Oct 25, 2016\nIn numerous amounts of research prepared by many renowned institutions, the importance of sleep regularly shows to be part of a healthy lifestyle, associated with the following potential benefits:\nImproved mood Better immune strength Better cardiovascular health Lower stress levels Improved memory Maintenance of a healthy weight or improved weight loss efforts Elevated energy levels during the day Increased creativity\nSleep Watch leverages the state-of-the-art motion and pulse sensors built into the Apple Watch to estimate when users are asleep by continually monitoring the heart rate and motion data provided by the Watch. Once set up, the app requires virtually no user intervention to detect sleep, aside from simply wearing the Watch to bed. Sleep Watch can also send daily sleep briefing notifications to users upon waking up in the morning. Sleep Watch also lets users automatically sync detected sleep times into the Apple Health app.\n‚ÄúWe believe that digital health applications and wearables have a bright future in helping users achieve positive health outcomes. We chose to focus on sleep for a first application as it plays a critical role in our overall health including our cardiovascular health. We are thrilled that the feedback from our users has been so positive and we look forward to continuing to improve the functionality of the application and to enhancing the performance of our sleep algorithms.‚Äù said Aaron Giroux, Executive Chairman of Bodymatter, Inc., creator of Sleep Watch.\nSleep Watch for Apple Watch and iPhone is $4.99 and available now to download in the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1138066420 .\nIf you are a journalist and would like to review the app, please contact press(at)bodymatter(dot)io.

      "title": "Bitefruit Launches New Website That Makes Apple Products More Accessible",
      "text": "Bitefruit , an online service where consumers can purchase Apple products at discounted prices, has recently launched their first website. On the new site, consumers can browse various items from the Apple store including iPhones and iPads, and buy them at discounted rates by using bitcoins. Unlike conventional online stores, the website does not sell products directly, and instead allows customers to save money by applying discounts unavailable in the Apple store. Maksym Zaremba, creator of the project, originally planned on creating a blog before moving in the direction of his current finished product.\n‚ÄúI worked at [a] small Portuguese company as a programmer, and additionally was working remotely in setting up various advertising campaigns for different customers. In my spare time I was developing my fruit project,‚Äù says Zaremba. ‚ÄúI decided to start working with Apple products simply because their products do not require any additional advertising promotion, however, in the future I hope that my project will grow into a catalog of the most interesting devices that could be purchased at amazing prices and into a great community, where participants will exchange various information about the ways to save money when buying products.‚Äù\nProducts on Bitefruit are initially listed at full retail value and they eventually decrease until a customer decides to accept the new price and make a purchase. Discounts on Bitefruit are determined based on the website‚Äôs traffic; the more customers who choose to view product prices, the faster those prices are reduced. After a sale, product prices revert to their original prices, matching what is listed on the Apple store website, and the process starts again.\nBitefruit offers a simple and accessible method for finding products and conducting sales, allowing customers the convenience of making their full purchase solely on the Bitefruit website. After a customer selects an Apple product, Bitefruit makes the purchase for them through the Apple website while applying the Bitefruit discount that the customer agreed on.\nBitefruit decided to accept bitcoin payments due to their low transaction fees, which positively impact both the website and the website‚Äôs customers. When commission fees are low, Bitefruit is able to maximize discounted prices and offer these favorable prices to consumers.\nAbout Bitefruit\nBitefruit is an online store created by Maksym Zaremba that offers consumers a unique way of conducting Apple product purchases. Instead of selling products, Bitefruit creates product discounts based on the website‚Äôs activity and allows customers to apply these discounts to items from the Apple store website. Bitefruit accepts bitcoin payments and strives to create an accessible and enjoyable shopping experience. Zaremba‚Äôs goal is to expand Bitefruit into a larger catalog where customers can maximize their savings while still purchasing new items.",

      "text": "Apple Secretly Stores Your iPhone Call History, Russian Firm Warns GO Information on pretty much every call is saved, they add Nov 17, 2016 19:05 GMT ¬∑ By Bogdan Popa ¬∑ Share: Russian security firm Elcomsoft claims that Apple secretly logs information on pretty much every single call that you make with your iPhone without offering any option to disable this. It turns out that users who have iCloud enabled on their devices get their call history automatically synced to the cloud and there‚Äôs no way to stop this unless they disable the cloud synchronization completely. According to the security firm , the log that Apple automatically collects includes call history, phone numbers, dates, call duration, missed calls, FaceTime calls, and information collected from other applications that can also initiate calls over the Internet, including here WhatsApp, Skype, or Facebook. Apple stores this information for a total of 4 months, and while everything is encrypted, the company could become an easy target for governments seeking access to user data, with the firm also raising doubts over possible surveillance that could be performed. No reason to worry, Apple says Apple, on the other hand, says there‚Äôs nothing wrong with its feature, and call history is synced only because users want access to their calls from any device that uses an Apple ID. Furthermore, the company guarantees that all data is encrypted and two-factor authentication adds an extra security layer to block any hacking attempts. ‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Device data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication,‚Äù the company said. The Russian company explains that Apple is aware of the fact that call syncing isn‚Äôt quite the most convenient and secure way to make call information on all devices and this is why the company says that it‚Äôs better to use Family Sharing instead of the same ID on all devices. ‚ÄúSome users note that Family Sharing is not an ideal solution since it doesn‚Äôt allow sharing iCloud Photo Library. In our opinion, Apple‚Äôs recommendation actually makes sense as someone‚Äôs Apple ID is personal and should not be used across devices owned by different persons (even within the family),‚Äù it says. Apple hasn‚Äôt revealed whether it plans to provide an update that would give users more control over their synced call history.",

      "text": "Apple has made no bones about its interest in augmented reality. And lately, evidence is mounting that the company is rapidly moving to adding AR to its mobile products, possibly as soon as next year.\nThe latest piece of the puzzle emerged tonight (Nov. 16) when Business Insider reported on an effort underway at Apple to integrate AR technology into the iPhone's camera app. The report, which cites \"a person familiar with matter,\" says Apple's AR push is tapping resources from an array of startups bought by the company with an eye toward getting AR into its product lineup as quickly as possible.\nThat looks like it's going to be next year. Business Insider's sources say Apple will add AR capabilities to the iPhone's camera app, likely in 2017's iOS 11 update. Once that AR support is in place, you'll be able to point your iPhone's camera at a real-world object, and the software will be able to recognize it. Business Insider says the AR feature could also tap into the facial recognition features added in iOS 10, allowing the Camera app to recognize and manipulate people's faces.\nView photos\nMORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone\nGiven the rumored timing of Apple's planned updates to its Camera app -- the company typically releases major iOS updates at the same time as it rolls out new iPhones -- it looks like AR could wind up being one of the major additions to next year's iPhone 8. The company is reportedly planning to overhaul the phone's design -- think OLED displays that stretch from one edge of the phone to the other -- so adding AR features would allow Apple to tout substantial software changes for the iPhone as well.\nIn some sense, Apple would be playing catch-up with an AR-enabled phone. Google and Lenovo teamed up to release the Phab2 Pro , a phone that uses motion tracking and depth perception features to superimpose virtual objects on top of the real world as seen through that phone's camera. The Phab2 Pro has just started shipping after it was unveiled earlier this year.\nThis is hardly the first time someone has suggested that AR will be a major focus for the iPhone 8 . Last month, tech blogger Robert Scoble predicted that the next iPhone would feature a virtually see-through design, making it well-suited for AR uses. Scoble says he based his forecast on talking to multiple industry sources, including those making the components for the next iPhone.\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Apple is working on a pair of AR glasses similar to Google Glasses. But that AR product likely won't appear until 2018 at the earliest, Bloomberg says.\nApple normally plays its cards close to the vest when it comes to future product plans, and it has yet to confirm any of the many rumors already swirling about the iPhone 8. But it has been quite up front about its interest in augmented reality. In July, CEO Tim Cook confirmed to Wall Street analysts that Apple was investing in AR . More recently, Cook spoke enthusiastically about AR's potential during a TV interview, especially when compared to virtual reality.\n\"There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality,\" Cook said on Good Morning America back in September. \"Both of these are incredibly interesting. But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.\"\nShould reports of Apple adding AR features to the iOS Camera app pan out, augmented reality could wind up meeting that potential sooner rather than later.\nSee also : Best Augmented Reality Apps I Touched Augmented Reality with Meta 2 iOS 10 Photos: All the New Features and How to Use Them Best Camera Phones",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 7:00pm \nSince 2013, Apple has run an annual coding workshop at Apple stores around the world. \nThis year, from December 5th to 11th, in celebration of Computer Science Education week, the ritual returns. The event will be hosted in collaboration with Code.org, as it was last year. \n‚ÄúSince we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science. The global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more,‚Äù said Code.org founder Hadi Partovi in a statement. \nHowever, this year‚Äôs itinerary will include an introduction to Swift Playgrounds at many Apple store locations. Swift Playgrounds is a free iPad app that helps teach users how to develop with Apple‚Äôs own coding language, Swift. \nCoding is just like any language and the earlier you‚Äôre exposed the more successful you‚Äôll be. Whether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity,‚Äù said Craig Federighi, Apple‚Äôs senior vice-president of software engineering, in a statement. \nThere are 86,976 Hour of Code events happening around the world, 2,275 of which are taking place in Canada.",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nNovember 17, 2016 2:00am \nThis may be a controversial opinion, but I like Apple‚Äôs Touch Bar and believe that those who question its utility, haven‚Äôt had a chance to try it yet. \nHowever, as it stands right now, the Touch Bar doesn‚Äôt work exactly how Apple envisions it, and some apps, especially first-party developed ones, don‚Äôt use the Bar in a way that will work for all users. Glow bright \nMost onlookers will see Apple new MacBook Pros as the company‚Äôs way of competing with the likes of Microsoft and its Surface lineup, even if the company is doing so on its own terms. The Touch Bar does not turn Apple‚Äôs MacBook Pro line into a laptop-tablet hybrid like the Surface. Instead, it maintains the wall of separation between iOS and macOS that Apple says it will never tear down, even as it adds a new wrinkle to how macOS works. \nSure, this feature has been attempted before by companies like Razer, which should come as a surprise to no one given Apple rarely comes up with completely original ideas. What the tech giant does do, however, is take concepts other companies have already attempted, and improves and builds upon them. In the case of the Touch Bar, this is exactly what Apple has done. \nThe advantage Apple‚Äôs Touch Bar presents over past iterations of this idea is that it‚Äôs built into all of the company‚Äôs higher-end Pro offerings. More importantly, the software that powers the Touch Bar is baked directly into macOS. This gives developers a viable platform to build from, which means if the concept of a contextual, always-changing touchscreen is going to prove successful, just like it did when the iPhone revolutionized how we interact with our mobile devices, Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pro line has the best shot at doing so. How it works \nWhile the Touch Bar features a 2170 x 60 OLED panel, it doesn‚Äôt look or feel like a traditional touch screen. My finger slides across its surface with ease, moving from left to right with a slight glide. In fact, the Touch Bar is so slick that it almost feels greasy, which I found off-putting at first, though after spending a few days with the 13-inch MacBook Pro equipped with the Touch bar, it grew on me. \nDepending on which app you‚Äôre using and what is going on within that app, different options display across the Touch Bar. As expected at launch, few third-party apps support the Bar, though this creates more problems than it probably should. \nIn its standard configuration, the Touch Bar is mostly a blank canvas with the exception of shortcuts that provide control over the computer‚Äôs sound volume, brightness and quick access to Siri, all located on the far right side of the screen. I customized this feature to include the ability to snap a screenshot, shift screen brightness and alter sound volume (not sure why you would add those when the options are already there?). Tapping an expand arrow on the left-hand side of the screen opens up the full set of standard Mac function keys many will find familiar, including one‚Äôs that control media playback backlit key brightness. \nThe issue here stems from the fact that the additional step of pressing the arrow key is always required for the full function bar to show up, even when you‚Äôre using an app that doesn‚Äôt currently feature Bar functionality like Chrome or Spotify. Apple should have given users an option to always display the full Touch Bar, rather than this limited version. It‚Äôs possible to make the full Touch Bar the default, but doing so removes the ability for the screen to shift to contextual buttons when the user is in an app that supports the functionality, defeating the purpose of the Touch Bar altogether. \nWhen more developers begin supporting the Touch Bar, this problem will become less of an issue. Currently, however, the system feels convoluted. For example, if I‚Äôm listening to Spotify and don‚Äôt have the Touch Bar‚Äôs function keys expanded, I don‚Äôt have the ability to skip tracks or pause music directly at my fingertips. \nThe level of customization present in the Touch Bar in its current iteration is impressive, allowing users to pin the functions they want in specific locations, especially when Finder is open. The ability to set the Bar for specific needs for every app, however, is necessary, especially in this interim period where few apps support the Touch Bar. Hopefully, this functionality is added in a subsequent macOS software update. Where it works \nWhere the Touch Bar really comes alive is when you use it with one of Apple‚Äôs own apps. Currently, that list includes Mail, Notes, Photos, iMovie, Garage Band and Final Cut Pro X. This means that in order to take advantage of the Touch Bar right now you need to have bought into both Apple‚Äôs hardware ecosystem and its software ecosystem. \nIn my case, this creates issues. While I often find myself using an iPhone or Mac as my primary computing devices, I live in a Google services ecosystem. This means that, for example, Gmail and Keep are my preferred programs rather than Mail and Notes. This will likely change in the future once Google updates Chrome as well as its other apps to support the Touch Bar, but the current situation is less than ideal. \nIn Mail, the Touch Bar offers users a number of options for common actions, most of which weren‚Äôt that hard to reach in the first place. Replying to emails and navigating by week or month can easily be performed with the Touch Bar, though these tasks can just as easily be accomplished with the keyboard. \nWhere the Touch Bar makes more sense is when it comes to Final Cut Pro X, creating a natural more fluid scrubbing experience. Rather than scrolling with a mouse or trackpad, using the touch bar to slide left or right through a video‚Äôs timeline is intuitive and useful. \nThe same can be said about the shortcuts present in Photos and Pixelmator which relate to cropping and altering colour hue. Again, however, most of my creative applications come from Adobe, which currently doesn‚Äôt support the Touch Bar ‚Äî the company has already stated it is committed to supporting the Touch Bar. Touch ID finally hits the Mac \nDespite the fact that adding a fingerprint sensor is Apple playing catchup, I‚Äôve been thrilled with the addition of Touch ID in the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar I‚Äôve been testing for the last few days. \nRather than having to enter my password each time I need to perform a system function or to even log into the Mac, all I need to do is tap my finger on the sensor that doubles as a power button. The process overall is incredibly fast and seamless and in the probably 50 times so far that I‚Äôve used the Touch ID sensor it hasn‚Äôt once been unable to detect my print. \nIf you‚Äôre a Safari user, Touch ID can be used to purchase products via Apple Pay, removing the need to enter credit card details on supported websites. While I haven‚Äôt tried this feature, the general impression I‚Äôve gathered from other technology critics indicates that it works as advertised, though Apple Pay support doesn‚Äôt seem to be very widespread. Not ready for prime time \nWhile Apple‚Äôs Touch bar is far from the revolution the company has made it out to be, the concept of a constantly shifting, contextual screen on a traditional laptop is compelling. Unfortunately, as it stands right now, beyond Apple‚Äôs first-party offerings and a few standout third-party apps, there are few apps that take advantage of the Bar‚Äôs unique functionality. \nWhile that will likely change over the course of the next few weeks now that the Touch Bar‚Äôs development API is out in the wild, Apple has let consumers down in the past when it comes to devices with untapped potential, with the 4th Generation Apple TV and its ample gaming potential being the most prominent example. \nWill the Touch Bar become more than just a fascinating gimmick? Only time will tell. As it stands right now Apple‚Äôs print-sized contextual touchscreen is just a fascinating, expensive experiment. Do Do \n‚ÄúApple‚Äôs MacBook Pro Touch Bar is fascinating experiment full of untapped potential‚Äù \nOr a gimmick! Reviewers are already saying it‚Äôs annoying to have to look down to have to use it while working and it‚Äôs not a matter of getting used to it, it‚Äôs a matter of it breaking the flow of how people work. \nTouch ID is smart however. I don‚Äôt get how it‚Äôs not on all computers. It seems to come and go with some companies but as far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs a no brainer, and you don‚Äôt need a touch bar to have touch ID or whatever you want to call it. The Iceman Cometh \nThis is a gimmick and has absolutely no utilitarian value at all today. Maybe that‚Äôll change as Patrick points out but its no guarantee and many people I know don‚Äôt even bother with Mac App Store applications that you need to be invested in to use this feature. Its most certainly not worth the extra $500 on top of the base price of the unit. Jason \nA neat idea sure but taking a step back its still an F bar, the emoji picture for example, most emojis can be entered with keyboard shortcuts which most people can probably do blind folded. Selecting a picture, whats wrong with looking at a much bigger (and higher res) monitor? cappein \nThe touch bar is a gimmick and people will quickly look for the ways to disable it. FlamesFan89 \nThe touch bar is the definition of a solution looking for a problem. fruvous \nHere‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt understand. If they design a laptop to operated by a keyboard and use that as an excuse for not giving it a touch screen, why do they bother making keyboard accessories for iOS devices if they‚Äôre designed to be touch-centric? HotelQuebec \nSilly gimmick no matter how you sugar coat it. Building it into the trackpad would‚Äôve been better but still not as good as a touchscreen. Smanny \nPersonally I think Apple should have used a touch display. Or if they want something new and different. Then add a touch pad like the Lenovo yoga books. But take it one step further, and add a full display for the keyboard as well. I would love to see a notebook with two full touch screen displays. Now that would be awesome.

      "text": "A Russian security firm is casting doubt on just how big of an ally Apple is when it comes to consumer privacy. In a new report, the company alleges that Apple‚Äôs iCloud retains the entire call history of every iPhone for as long as four months, making it an easy target for law enforcement and surveillance.\nThe firm, Elcomsoft, discovered that as long as a user has iCloud enabled, their call history is synced and stored. The log includes phone numbers, dates and durations of the calls, and even missed calls, but the log doesn‚Äôt stop there; FaceTime call logs, as well as calls from apps that utilize the ‚ÄúCall History‚Äù feature, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, are also stored.\nMUST SEE: Apple‚Äôs iPhone 8 may incorporate some next-level augmented reality features\nThere is also apparently no way to actually disable the feature without disabling iCloud entirely, as there is no toggle for call syncing.\n‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,‚Äù an Apple spokesperson told The Intercept via email.‚ÄùDevice data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.‚Äù\nBut security from unauthorized eyes isn‚Äôt what users should be worrying about, according to former FBI agent and computer forensics expert Robert Osgood. ‚ÄúAbsolutely this is an advantage [for law enforcement],‚Äù Osgood told The Intercept . ‚Äú‚ÄúFour months is a long time [to retain call logs]. It‚Äôs generally 30 or 60 days for telecom providers, because they don‚Äôt want to keep more [records] than they absolutely have to.‚Äù\nIf the name Elcomsoft sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because the company‚Äôs phone-cracking software was used by many of the hackers involved in 2014‚Äôs massive celebrity nudes leak. Elcomsoft‚Äôs ‚ÄúPhone Breaker‚Äù software claims the ability to crack iCloud backups, as well as backup files from Microsoft OneDrive and BlackBerry.\nTrending right now:\nMassive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles Best Buy‚Äôs pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now ‚Äì here are the 20 best deals Your iPhone 8 might not include Apple‚Äôs hottest new feature next year See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

The NDX also saw its MACD cross above signal, joining the other major indices. The ARMS index ended the day at 1.93, a rather bearish reading. \nThe strength in the NDX, helped by AAPL, helped the index move toward near term technical strength parity with the other 2 major indices. It moved above its 20D-SMA of 4789, but remains below its 50D-SMA of 4811. The DJIA did some consolidation yesterday and it was the first session in 5 that it did not establish a new high. It remains the strongest of the big 3 indices near term. \nThe SPX pulled back some yesterday, but still remains just 14 points from its all-time closing high of 2190. It is comfortably above its near term critical support of 2147. The Dow Transports have also displayed strength recently and are at their highest(8844) since early 2015. The VIX added 2.6% to finish at 13.72. Near term support for the NDX is at 4789 and 4775. Near term resistance is at 4811 and 4825. Near term support for the SPX is at 2175 and 2162. Near term resistance is at 2190, 2193 and 2200. \nEurope is mixed in early trade, while US Futures are pointing slightly higher in the pre-market. \nAlong with key earnings releases from Walmart , Best Buy , and J.M. Smucker , it‚Äôs also a packed day for economic reports. Today well see the CPI numbers released at 8:30am, Housing Starts/Building Permits at 8:30am, Continuing Claims at 8:30am, Philadelphia FED at 8:30am, and Natural Gas Inventories at 10:30am. \nThe PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF)( NASDAQ:QQQ ) was mostly flat in premarket trading Thursday at $116.90 per share.

      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money. \n\n\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook \nFollow John on Twitter ( @johnmatarese ) Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

      "text": "Apple has asked Foxconn and Pegatron to explore manufacturing in the US Apple currently manufactures its iPhones in China Apple CEO earlier said that US didn't have skilled workers for production \nApple is reportedly studying possibilities of moving iPhone production from China to the US. A new report by Japanese publication Nikkei Asian Review, which has had an excellent track record with Apple leaks, claims that the Cupertino-based company has asked two of its major manufacturers - Foxconn and Pegatron - to explore plans to move manufacturing to the US. \nApple's move to studying the ideas to change its manufacturing base to the US is inspired by President-elect Donald Trump's previous pledge where he claimed that America-based companies will be pushed to manufacture at home instead of other countries. \n( Also see : What an iPhone Could Cost in Donald Trump's America ) \nIn its report, Nikkei Asian Review cites a person familiar with the matter as saying, \" Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the US. Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" On manufacturing the iPhones in the US, Apple's CEO Tim Cook had previously told CBS' 60 Minutes program that \"America simply did not have enough skilled workers for the production of iPhones.\" Several Apple devices sport the 'designed in California' tag at the rear though the products are mostly made in China.\nNikkei also quotes an industry executive familiar with the iPhone production process who also claimed that it would be difficult to produce the iPhones in large quantities in the US. \n\"To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the US does not have at the moment. Even if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the US,\" executive told Nikkei. \nAnother industry source told Nikkei, \"It is not easy to make iPhones in America, unless the US government subsidises local companies for producing domestically.\" \nSome of the third-party suppliers that are major suppliers for Apple's iPhones include TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co) which supplies chips for iPhones; Japan Display and Sharp supplies panels for iPhones, and SK Hynix and Toshiba supply memory chips for iPhones. \nOut of several suppliers, Sharp has been one of the companies that is ready to move manufacturing to the US while TSMC has been \"clear that it would be much more expensive to make chips outside of Taiwan,\" according to Nikkei. \nAt this moment, it isn't clear whether Apple has made its mind to start manufacturing in the US though if this turns out to be true then we might see increase in iPhone prices in future.",

      "text": "The drastic price drop in App Store premium could allow Apple to aggressively push its own video strategy. Video services' eligibility to the reduced fees will require an agreement to be integrated into Apple's new TV app. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nApple is planning to launch its own TV app for the iOS and tvOS platforms and it is seen as a cornerstone of its own video strategy. To leverage the app, the company is reportedly slashing premium fees. \nThe payment scheme should be quite convoluted for consumers who are only familiar about downloading apps and consuming content in the app marketplace. Video Publishing In iOS App Store \nIt is widely believed that media providers such as Netflix and Hulu Plus have to give Apple around 30 percent for each sale, a policy that purportedly began last year. The outrageous amount has been a cause of a lot of grumblings from the ranks of the media publishers. \nThe immense size of App Store market has so far kept them from launching an open revolt. Not a few of these publishers state how the policy runs smack into the realm of anticompetitive behavior. \nInformation obtained by Bloomberg revealed that Cupertino is now willing to shed about half of the premium payment. It should already appease video service providers despite the fact that the offer includes one particular string attached. \nTo avail of the reduced premium, video services must be willing to be integrated into its new TV app. What Is iOS TV App? \nThe world has already seen the iOS TV app after its debut last October. Essentially, the TV app will be aggregating video content in one location. Apple is aggressively pursuing content providers such as Netflix and Hulu after its live TV service ambition fizzled out. \nApple had difficulty securing rights from broadcast and cable networks who are wary of the company's goals. These companies recall how Apple immediately dominated the music industry after gaining a mere foothold. The offshoot is that Apple has been forced ‚Äî at least at this point ‚Äî to turn to Hulu, Showtime and HBO for its own programming . Courting Netflix \nWhen the TV app integration proposal was outlined, Netflix reportedly balked. The video streaming service cited that it is against Apple's data-collection policy to explain its decision. It is not yet clear if the company has other reasons for saying no. Observers are now less certain about Netflix's position after the drastic premium price drop. \nAt this point, the emerging narrative is that the App Store fee reduction will effectively hit two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it will address the unhappiness of video service providers in general. On the other hand, Apple will be ensuring that iOS TV app enjoys tremendous support from the get go.

By: FE Online | Published: November 18, 2016 12:46 PM The new TV app is one of the many efforts by Apple to make its products the hub for watching TV shows and movies. (Reuters) \nApple Inc., in order to please the partners whose movies and TV shows are important to the tech giant‚Äôs TV, plans to reduce the charges of its video services available on the App Store. According to Bloomberg, the Cupertino giant has plans of reducing the revenue collection from subscribed video streaming apps from 30% to 15%. This major cut in revenue is hopeful of appeasing multiple partners who have been accusing Apple of using the App Store as a means of strangling rival services. Hence, these concessions in revenue are a way of appealing to the ever increasing importance of video services to the tech giant, which intends on introducing a new application that would be devoted to TV shows and movies. \nThe new TV app is one of the many efforts of Apple to make its products the hub for watching TV shows and movies. Earlier Apple had plans of introducing ist own TV line but had delayed the plans after facing problems regarding getting rights from programmers and broadcast network. However, the Apple Tv functions on programming services like HBO, Showtime and Hulu. \nIt was reported by Bloomberg that some of its video partners have already been paying 15% instead of 30% of the monthly subscription fees. If the current reports are true, then Apple intends to extend this courtesy to every programming channel that is involved in the new TV app. To compensate for the fee, a few of these service providers are known to have increased the prices of their services sold through the Apple store. It is speculated that this has been done to match the revenue generated on other distribution channels.  ",

More >> \nIt looks like the fight between Ireland, Apple, and the EU is only set to escalate -- Ireland is prepared to bring that fight to EU courts. An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes. \nBy Kat Boogaar d Contributor, Inc.com \nIt was 3PM, and I was blurry-eyed from working in front of my computer for the past six hours. A solid six hours of work sounds perfectly normal, right? Except this was a Saturday -- a day I normally try to reserve for computer-free activities. \nChances are, you've found yourself in this exact same scenario more times than you care to admit. The ability to be constantly connected offers great convenience, but it also makes it overwhelmingly difficult to truly unplug and disconnect -- even on weekends . \nIn fact, according to a 2013 survey, an astounding 97% of small business owners work weekends. And, another study shows that American employees work longer hours than anyone else. \nWe all deserve a little time to relax and recharge. But, taking your weekends back from that to-do list of yours can be a challenge. Use these five tips to reclaim your weekend and finally step away from that computer. 1. Adjust Your View \nBefore you can make any further changes, you first need to alter your perception of the weekend. Too many of us view it as a bonus extension of the work week. We tell ourselves that we can take care of those things we weren't able to wrap up on Friday afternoon on Saturday or Sunday. \nHowever, that assumption needs to change if you truly want to reserve your weekends for relaxation and enjoyment. \nStop viewing your weekend as the catchall for the work you can't quite finish during the regular week. It'll make you that much more productive those other five days in an effort to tie up any loose ends before you clock out. 2. Prepare, Prepare, Prepare \nSpeaking of tying up loose ends, if you previously worked the majority of the weekend and now plan to stop, you're technically losing two working days. \nObviously, you can't just cut out a chunk of your work week without it having an impact. So, adequate preparation is key to ensure that you can actually unplug for two days each week. This might mean longer hours Monday through Friday, but it's usually worth it to have an entire stress-free weekend. \nStart each week by jotting down all of the major things you need to get done before Friday afternoon. Having this master list will keep you focused on the big tasks you need to accomplish, and help you avoid missing the forest for the trees when your week gets crazy. 3. Utilize Small Pockets of Time \nWish you could add a little more time to your work week? Well, you probably can. \nNo, there isn't some magic formula that'll actually stretch your working hours. However, making an effort to effectively utilize those small pockets of time you're used to wasting -- like those twenty minutes before your next meeting starts or those ten minutes before you head out to lunch -- can really maximize your productivity. \nThose might seem like small, insignificant time blocks. But, they add up fast. And, by using them for real, productive work, you could technically add a couple of hours to each week -- meaning there's less for you to feel tempted to handle over the weekend. 4. Set Expectations \nIf you've gotten used to working weekends, chances are other people have gotten used to you working during that time as well. Maybe colleagues and clients are emailing you at all hours on Sundays. Or, perhaps you've become accustomed to having to take a call on a Saturday afternoon. \nSimilarly to how you had to adjust your own expectations, you'll also have to tweak the expectations of the people you work with. \nMake it clear that you're going to do your best to stay away from work each weekend -- even if that means you need to set an \"out of office\" message on your email. Eventually, people will get used to the fact that they shouldn't reach out to you on your days off, and you'll be able to relax without your inbox constantly filling up (hopefully). 5. Accept the Unfinished \nIf you spend the majority of your weekend working, chances are you have a lot to do -- so much that you couldn't quite cram it all into a normal work week. \nBut, take a minute to ask yourself: How much of the stuff you do over the weekend absolutely has to be done by Monday morning? I'm willing to bet only a very minor slice of it. \nI hate having pending work and projects hanging over my head just as much as the next person. However, if you're seriously aiming to reserve your weekends for personal time, you're going to need to be comfortable with recognizing what's unfinished and -- unless it's incredibly urgent -- leaving it on your desk for Monday. I promise, it'll still be there when you get back. \nYou may be accustomed to working during the weekend. But, you deserve some time to unplug and recharge. Use these five tips, and you're sure to reclaim your weekends from the firm grasp of your to-do list! \nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com \nThe original \"5 tips to take your weekends back\" article can be seen here . ¬© 2016 Inc.com.

Apple Inc.'s New MacBook Pro Computers Aren't Overpriced \nWhen Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced its latest 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, there were some potential buyers who were completely put off by the prices.

      "text": "Just when we thought were starting to get a handle on Apple‚Äôs 2017 iPhone lineup, a new Bloomberg report relays that Apple‚Äôs OLED supplier will likely not be able to meet the demand that Apple is anticipating when it releases what will presumably be called the iPhone 8 next September.\nThough there a handful of OLED suppliers out there, it‚Äôs believed that Samsung inked a deal to be the exclusive provider of OLED panels for the iPhone 8. Having said that, Samsung‚Äôs production capacity will reportedly be heavily constrained and may remain an ongoing issue in early 2018.\nDON‚ÄôT MISS: The best leather cases for Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus\nAs for how this will affect Apple‚Äôs upcoming iPhone lineup, here‚Äôs what we know so far. According to reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple‚Äôs product roadmap involves releasing three new iPhone models next year, a 4.7-inch iPhone 8 with an LCD screen, a 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus with an LCD screen and a premium 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus with an OLED panel.\nSo while the aforementioned OLED supply issue won‚Äôt impact what will likely be Apple‚Äôs two more popular iPhone 8 models, news that Apple‚Äôs premium iPhone 8 model will be in short supply is nonetheless disappointing. The shortage will have a detrimental impact on Apple‚Äôs bottom line as it stands to reason that the margins on the premium 5.5-inch handset will be the highest across the company‚Äôs next-gen iPhone lineup.\nWhile OLED panels are thinner and offer richer and more vibrant colors than LCD panels, they‚Äôre also technically more challenging to manufacture, thus resulting in disappointing yields.\nBloomberg adds:\nOLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and Japan Display Inc. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand.\nApple‚Äôs deal with Samsung is said to call for deliveries of 100 million OLED panels in 2017, a figure the company will reportedly struggle and fail to meet.\nWhat remains unknown at this is point is whether or not Apple‚Äôs non-OLED iPhone 8 models will be graced with the rumored edgeless display we‚Äôve been hearing so much about lately. Hopefully that‚Äôs not the case, but given that the edgeless display is said to be curved, it‚Äôs entirely possible that only the OLED iPhone 8 model will house the exciting new design.\nTrending right now:\nMassive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles Samsung might not be done with the Galaxy Note 7 Microsoft joins the Linux foundation and blows everyone‚Äôs mind See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "I'm a fan of Apple, so I was very excited for the introduction of the new Macbook Pro. It's been a few years since Apple came out with any kind of major design update, and I was ready to see some cool innovation. That much I got, but not all of it was cool. While the new MacBook Pro boasts some interesting new developments, some of them seem very anti-consumer to this tech editor.\nLet's start at the heart of the issue, which for me, is Apple's abandonment of all external ports except for USB-C. USB-C may be a superior connection in terms of speed and form factor, but it's also a connection that still has yet to gain industry-wide adoption. Of course, this is common practice for Apple, the company that boldly pioneered the phase-out of CD/DVD drives in previous generations of MacBooks, and eliminated the Ethernet port that most PC laptops are still sporting. But those cuts made sense to me, because at the time they were made, the everyday use of those technologies was on its way out the door and better, built-in alternatives were already in wide use. For example, the availability of WiFi replaced the need for Ethernet, and web-based file downloads, streaming services and USB drives replaced the need for optical media. When I bought my current MacBook Pro in late 2013, I didn't really miss either of those features.\nBut the loss of my ports is another matter. I still often use the traditional USB ports for flash drives or other devices, I often have need of the built-in HDMI port, and the SD card reader is very handy for viewing images and videos from different cameras. All of that is gone from the new MacBook, and the only way to connect these devices now is by using an adapter for each one, which can get pretty costly.\nRecommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. How costly? The lowest price we could find for an HDMI to USB-C adapter was $12.99, and we can't be sure about its reliability, as it's a brand we've never heard of. Adapters can be tricky -- you can find them for cheap, but depending on the brand, they might not work correctly. Sure, you can find multi-port adapters, like this one from Monoprice , but even that will run you $29.99 and it STILL doesn't include everything you might need. And let's not forget that carting all these adapters around is bulky and awkward. I love the versatility of my current MacBook, and if I bought a new one right now, that would all go out the window. The least Apple could have done was include a USB to USB-C adapter as an olive branch to users, but they didn't.\nTest your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Apple says using USB-C only allows them to make the new MacBook thinner and lighter. While this is objectively true, it's a very small difference. The old 13\" MacBook Pro was 18mm in height and weighed 3.48 lbs. The new version measures 14.9mm in height and weighs 3 lbs. Honestly, it's pretty easy to make up or exceed the weight difference with the number of adapters you'll need to keep in your laptop bag. Where's the win there?\nPorts aside, let's look at the storage specs. While, at $1,299, the starting price on a new MacBook is the same as previous entry-level models were, the RAM and storage space at this price are also around the same as the old models, at 8GB of RAM and a 128GB solid state drive. While this is typical of Apple, I am not impressed. Frankly, that drive size is way too small for most users in this day and age. In my opinion, a laptop in the $1,200 price range should offer a starting drive of at least 256GB. Oh, and don't forget that the entry level model only has two USB-C ports, one of which also serves as the power port. This means users effectively have one port to work with while they're charing their laptops.\nThe 'Touch Bar' seems cool, though. The one feature that is very unique and forward thinking is the Touch Bar , the new interactive strip that adapts its controls based on the application you are using. Next to that is a fingerprint reader, which is very useful for security. Some call the Touch Bar a gimmick, while others say it is smarter innovation than a laptop with a touchscreen. One this is for sure: It's only available in the models priced at $1,799 and above, so if you want it, you'll be paying a premium price for it.\nMy advice? Buy the 2015 model. I know, it seems weird to recommend last year's model, but here's my thinking: the MacBook Pro line is superior to many other laptop lines because of reliability and longevity. I bought the late 2013 model (a 13\" with 8GB RAM and a 256GB drive) when it was introduced and it still works great today. Even after constant OS updates (I always download and install the latest version), it's just as fast as the day I bought it and the unibody metal construction makes it the most durable laptop I have ever owned. I love it and I think I'll get at least another two years out of it before I get the upgrade itch. By that time, perhaps USB-C will have caught on enough that being relegated to just one type of port will be more bearable.\nApple isn't selling the older models anymore, but plenty of other retailers still have the them for sale. B&H Photo, for example, is selling the 2015 13\" version with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB drive for $1,349. That is $150 less than the new version, and you get all the ports the new MacBook doesn't offer. Of course there are a few differences: the older model runs on a 5th generation Intel i5 processor, rather than a 6th generation version, and it has an older graphics chip set, but neither of these shortcomings make the 2015 model inferior -- it's still a great laptop that will last several years!\nThis article first appeared in Brad's Deals.",

      "text": "Apple‚Äôs late October event wasn‚Äôt solely about the new MacBook Pro and its Touch Bar keyboard, although the new Mac was undoubtedly the star of the show. Before it unveiled the laptop, Apple announced a TV app that will work across Apple devices. Users will be able to access content from a variety of services and resume watching TV shows and movies on all their devices.\nNotably absent from the new TV app are streaming services including Netflix and Amazon. But Apple is already taking a huge step to sweeten the deal: It just cut the App Store fee for video streaming apps.\nDON‚ÄôT MISS: Your iPhone 8 might not include Apple‚Äôs hottest new feature next year\nAccording to Bloomberg , Apple will reduce its cut from 30% to 15%, a move that might convince services like Netflix and others to get on board.\nThe rate will be available to all subscription video services that are integrated with Apple‚Äôs new TV app, sources told the news site. Some video partners have already been paying 15% of monthly subscription fees to Apple, rather than the usual 30% fee that Apple takes from other paid App Store apps. Bloomberg notes that other non-video subscription apps also pay 15% to Apple only after a customer completes a year‚Äôs subscription.\nWhile there are no guarantees that Netflix will immediately get with the program, Apple‚Äôs move should still be good news for other companies considering Apple‚Äôs new TV app.\nIt should also benefit end-users. Some streaming services already charge customers who subscribe via Apple devices more than clients who buy subscriptions elsewhere. YouTube Red and Spotify are such streaming services. Subscription for either one costs $12.99 on iOS devices, but $9.99 elsewhere. By lowering its cut, Apple would help these companies lower their asking price for streaming services sold on iPhones and iPads.\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy‚Äôs pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now ‚Äì here are the 20 best deals The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 The exciting iPhone 8 is expected to do what the boring iPhone 7 can‚Äôt See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "  KGI Securities, aus dessen Haus auch der bekannte Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo immer wieder f√ºr Spekulationen rund um neue Apple-Produkte sorgt, hat einen weiteren Report zur iPhone-Zukunft im Jahr 2017 ver√∂ffentlicht. Wie √ºblich bei solch fr√ºhen Analysen, gibt es verglichen mit anderen Reports Widerspr√ºche im Detail, beispielsweise bei den Displaygr√∂√üen, dennoch berichten auff√§llig viele Analysen in letzter Zeit von drei Modellen im iPhone-Jubil√§umsjahr 2017. Schon bisher wurde vermutet, dass nur eines der drei Modelle mit OLED-Display ausgestattet wird, diese Theorie bekr√§ftigt auch KGI in ihrer neuen Analyse. So soll Apple das neue Premium-Modell in der Gr√∂√üe zwischen den beiden traditionellen Modellen mit 4,7 Zoll- und 5,5 Zoll LCD-Display einordnen. Es d√ºrfte als einziges iPhone im kommenden Jahr mit seitlich gebogenem OLED-Display ausgestattet sein, k√∂nnte aber mehr noch als Samsung bei seinem edge-Design mit einem neuen Rundum-Display ausgestattet sein. Hierbei soll die aktive Displayfl√§che 5,1 bis 5,2 Zoll betragen, das gesamte OLED-Panel d√ºrfte aber 5,8 Zoll gro√ü sein und √ºber die seitlichen Kanten hinaus reichen. In dieser Variante wird der Home-Button im Display integriert sein, das Panel soll exklusiv von Samsung stammen. Neben dieser Premium-Variante, die, KGI zufolge, 2017 die meisten Neuerungen erhalten wird, soll Apple aber auch planen die beiden traditionellen Varianten mit 4,7 Zoll- und 5,5 Zoll LCD-Panels weiterhin anzubieten, m√∂glicherweise zu g√ºnstigeren Preisen und wohl auch, weil derzeit schlicht zuwenig OLED-Panels produziert werden. Letzteres d√ºrfte sich erst 2018 mit der Fertigstellung neuer OLED-Fabriken √§ndern. Diese beiden LCD-Modelle werden ebenfalls ein neues Glas-Design erhalten und im Detail upgedatet, beispielsweise soll bei der Dual-Kamera im Plus-Modell auch die Telephoto-Linse optische Bildstabilisierung (OIS) erhalten, allerdings d√ºrfte ihnen das neue Premium-Modell die Schau stehlen.

      "text": "Apple has finally acknowledged the pain point that a few of its customers are facing and are finally offering an olive branch to iPhone 6 Plus owners fighting ‚Äú Touch Disease ‚Äú.\nIn addressing the issue, the company determined that users were suffering from grayed-out pixels and lack of Multi-Touch response due to the device having been ‚Äúdropped multiple times on a hard surface and then [taking on] further stress.‚Äù\nWhile iPhone 6 owners have also complained to Apple about Touch Disease, it is only the Plus-model users that will benefit from a fee reduction for first-party repairs: $149. The screen must not have suffered from cracks or further issues beyond the above symptoms. Users who already got repairs from an Apple-approved dealer will get compensation up to that price point.\niFixit is reporting through a statement to TechCrunch that $149 is currently the typical market price for a third-party Touch Disease repair.\nIt doesn‚Äôt help much the class action suit that is still apparently on against Apple for having so far treated the problem to their customers‚Äô dissatisfaction. But it‚Äôs something from Apple. Let‚Äôs just not let this be the standard of care we come to expect from it.\nThe post Some Touch Disease repairs will be warrantied by Apple for $149 deductible appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple Inc.\nObama had thrown his support behind the initiative, a move AT&T decried as an improper intervention on behalf of what it called a ‚ÄúGoogle proposal.‚Äù\n‚ÄúGoogle has been much more actively involved in this than Apple has,‚Äù said Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs critical to Google‚Äôs business at all that it be allowed to provide these next generation set-top boxes, but there was a business opportunity there.‚Äù\nCable companies have expressed concerns that rivals like Google or Apple could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content.\nThe FCC‚Äôs moves came a day after Republican lawmakers urged Wheeler, a Democrat, to avoid any contested regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration, saying new rules would be subject to review by the incoming Republican-led Congress and Trump‚Äôs administration and ‚Äúcould create confusion if reversed.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe question is how far will the pendulum swing back‚Äù in favor of telecom companies, said Hal Singer, senior fellow at the George Washington Institute of Public Policy. ‚ÄúIt has swung in Google‚Äôs direction under the FCC and Chairman Wheeler.‚Äù\nAmong other regulations, Trump‚Äôs Nov. 8 election has increased the chances that Obama‚Äôs net neutrality rules, adopted by the FCC in early 2015, could be rolled back, analysts said.\nMost Republicans strongly oppose net neutrality, which requires internet service providers to treat all data equally and bars them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The rules were a victory for internet firms like Google and Netflix Inc that have advocated an open internet.\nJimmy Schaeffler, telecom industry consultant at the Carmel Group, said that ‚Äúthe bottom line is that things will change and there will be less optimism among and fewer opportunities‚Äù for companies like Google that do not own the internet networks.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to impede their success and those that rely on what they do,‚Äù Schaeffler added.\nRepublicans in Congress or at a Republican-controlled FCC under a Trump administration could also pare back new privacy rules adopted in October that subject internet service providers to stricter rules than those faced by Google and other websites.\nSince Trump‚Äôs victory, Alphabet shares have fallen 2.4 percent, Netflix shares have dropped 5.9 percent and Amazon shares are down 2 percent. AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc shares have been relatively unchanged, while Comcast Corp shares have soared 7.7 percent.\nGoogle did not respond to requests for comment.\nEXTENSIVE TIES\nDuring Obama‚Äôs presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability watchdog group‚Äôs Google Transparency Project.\nEric Schmidt, Alphabet‚Äôs executive chairman, was seen at Clinton‚Äôs Election Night party wearing a staff badge in a widely circulated photo.\nIn the stolen and leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta disclosed by WikiLeaks, an adviser wrote a memo to Clinton in 2014 that said ‚Äúworking relationships with Google, Facebook, Apple, and other technology companies were important to us in 2012 and should be even more important to you in 2016, given their still-ascendent positions in the culture.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe have begun having discreet conversations with some of these companies to get a sense of their priorities for the coming cycle,‚Äù the adviser wrote.\nTelecoms and cable companies have accused Wheeler of favoring Google at the expense of cable companies. Responding to the criticism, Wheeler said in May: ‚ÄúI hear that allegation, and I scratch my head. I don‚Äôt get that charge.‚Äù\n‚ÄúCertainly the sort of cozy relationship that Google enjoyed with the Obama administration is not going to continue with Trump,‚Äù Jackdaw Research‚Äôs Dawson added.\nSome analysts and former Google lobbyists noted that the company similarly faced a set of challenging regulatory dynamics when it opened its Washington office in 2005, with Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress and the young tech firm widely perceived to have a liberal bent.\n‚ÄúThey have a tailwind (in the Obama administration), and that does end now,‚Äù a former Google employee at the company‚Äôs Washington office said. ‚ÄúBut I think in the long run Google is going to be just fine in Washington. In many ways, its whole operation was built just for moments like this.‚Äù",

      "text": "The new TV app is one of the many efforts by Apple to make its products the hub for watching TV shows and movies. (Reuters) Apple Inc., in order to please the partners whose movies and TV shows are important to the tech giant‚Äôs TV, plans to reduce the charges of its video services available on the App Store. According to Bloomberg, the Cupertino giant has plans of reducing the revenue collection from subscribed video streaming apps from 30% to 15%. This major cut in revenue is hopeful of appeasing multiple partners who have been accusing Apple of using the App Store as a means of strangling rival services. Hence, these concessions in revenue are a way of appealing to the ever increasing importance of video services to the tech giant, which intends on introducing a new application that would be devoted to TV shows and movies.\nThe new TV app is one of the many efforts of Apple to make its products the hub for watching TV shows and movies. Earlier Apple had plans of introducing ist own TV line but had delayed the plans after facing problems regarding getting rights from programmers and broadcast network. However, the Apple Tv functions on programming services like HBO, Showtime and Hulu.\nIt was reported by Bloomberg that some of its video partners have already been paying 15% instead of 30% of the monthly subscription fees. If the current reports are true, then Apple intends to extend this courtesy to every programming channel that is involved in the new TV app. To compensate for the fee, a few of these service providers are known to have increased the prices of their services sold through the Apple store. It is speculated that this has been done to match the revenue generated on other distribution channels.",

The company has gone to great lengths to secure customer data in recent years, by implementing better encryption for all phones and refusing to undermine that encryption.\nBut private information still escapes from Apple products under some circumstances. The latest involves the company‚Äôs online syncing service iCloud.\nRussian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apple‚Äôs mobile devices automatically send a user‚Äôs call history to the company‚Äôs servers if iCloud is enabled ‚Äî but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification.\n‚ÄúYou only need to have iCloud itself enabled‚Äù for the data to be sent, said Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft.\nThe logs surreptitiously uploaded to Apple contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. They also include missed and bypassed calls. Elcomsoft said Apple retains the data in a user‚Äôs iCloud account for up to four months, providing a boon to law enforcement who may not be able to obtain the data either from the user‚Äôs carrier, who may retain the data for only a short period, or from the user‚Äôs device, if it‚Äôs encrypted with an unbreakable passcode.\n‚ÄúAbsolutely this is an advantage [for law enforcement],‚Äù Robert Osgood, a former FBI supervisory agent who now directs a graduate program in computer forensics at George Mason University, said of Apple‚Äôs call-history uploads. ‚ÄúFour months is a long time [to retain call logs]. It‚Äôs generally 30 or 60 days for telecom providers, because they don‚Äôt want to keep more [records] than they absolutely have to. So if Apple is holding data for four months, that could be a very interesting data repository and they may have data that the telecom provider might not.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs not just regular call logs that get sent to Apple‚Äôs servers. FaceTime, which is used to make audio and video calls on iOS devices, also syncs call history to iCloud automatically, according to Elcomsoft. The company believes syncing of both regular calls and FaceTime call logs goes back to at least iOS 8.2, which Apple released in March 2015.\nAnd beginning with Apple‚Äôs latest operating system, iOS 10, incoming missed calls that are made through third-party VoIP applications like Skype, WhatsApp, and Viber, and that use Apple CallKit to make the calls, also get logged to the cloud, Katalov said.\nBecause Apple possesses the keys to unlock iCloud accounts, U.S. law enforcement agencies can obtain direct access to the logs with a court order. But they still need a tool to extract and parse it.\nElcomsoft said it‚Äôs releasing an update to its Phone Breaker software tool today, that can be used to extract the call histories from iCloud accounts, using the accountholder‚Äôs credentials. Elcomsoft‚Äôs forensic tools are used by law enforcement, corporate security departments, and even consumers. The company also leases some of its extraction code to Cellebrite, the Israeli firm the FBI regularly uses to get into seized phones and iCloud data.\nIn some cases Elcomsoft‚Äôs tool can help customers access the iCloud even without account credentials, if they can obtain an authentication token for the account from the accountholder‚Äôs computer, allowing them to get iCloud data without Apple‚Äôs help. The use of authentication tokens also bypasses two-factor authentication if the accountholder has set this up to prevent a hacker from getting into their account, Elcomsoft notes on its web site.\nApple‚Äôs collection of call logs potentially puts sensitive information at the disposal of people other than law enforcement and other Elcomsoft customers. Anyone else who might be able to obtain the user‚Äôs iCloud credentials, like hackers, could potentially get at it too. In 2014, more than 100 celebrities fell victim to a phishing attack that allowed a hacker to obtain their iCloud credentials and steal nude photos of them from their iCloud accounts . The perpetrator reportedly used Elcomsoft‚Äôs software to harvest the celebrity photos once the accounts were unlocked.\nGenerally, if someone were to attempt to download data in an iCloud account, the system would email a notification to the account owner. But Katalov said no notification occurs when someone downloads synced call logs from iCloud.\nApple acknowledged that the call logs are being synced and said it‚Äôs intentional.\n‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,‚Äù an Apple spokesperson said in an email.‚ÄùDevice data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.‚Äù\nThe syncing of iCloud call logs would not be the first time Apple has been found collecting data secretly.

Sling TV is already there , and today Sony launched a PlayStation Vue app, which lets Vue subscribers stream live programming from AMC, Discovery, FX, ESPN, and many other channels right from the Apple TV. ‚ÄúYou will be able to take advantage of Apple TV‚Äôs Siri Remote and easy navigation with touch, while enjoying PlayStation Vue‚Äôs sleek look and feel,‚Äù Dan Myers, Sony‚Äôs head of product for Vue, wrote in a blog post .\nYou can‚Äôt sign up for Vue directly from the Apple TV, however; that still requires a web browser, since Sony presumably doesn‚Äôt want to give Apple a cut of in-app subscriptions. PlayStation Vue allows customers to stream on up to 5 devices simultaneously, which is useful considering the growing number of platforms it has already expanded to. The biggest feature that sets Vue apart from Dish‚Äôs Sling TV service is its cloud DVR, which helps ease the transition away from traditional cable. Prices start at $29 or $39 per month in markets where live network programming (CBS, FOX, NBC, etc.) is available.\nPlayStation Vue isn‚Äôt yet integrated with Apple‚Äôs new TV app, which aggregates TV shows and movies from multiple streaming services and puts them in one central destination. Sony might soon have incentive to make that happen , though; yesterday Bloomberg reported that Apple will halve its cut of in-app subscriptions from 30 percent down to 15 percent for video apps that serve content to the TV app. That difference might be enough for Sony to enable direct subscriptions, in turn upping Vue‚Äôs subscriber count.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Apple's repair program targets iPhone 6 Plus \"touch disease\" flaw November 18, 2016 - 13:14 AMT \nPanARMENIAN.Net - Apple has launched a new repair program for a widely reported on iPhone 6 Plus hardware malfunction known as ‚Äútouch disease,‚Äù which renders the touchscreen useless and manifests as a thin grey line at the top the display. According to Apple, however, this flaw is caused by dropping the phone repeatedly. The company says it will not cover the cost of a repair and will ask those affected by the issue to pay $149 to have it fixed. That might not sit too well with the iPhone owners who filed class action lawsuits against Apple over the touch disease issue, The Verge reports. \n‚ÄúApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,‚Äù the company writes on its website. ‚ÄúIf your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.‚Äù \nApple says those who have already paid for a service repair related to the issue are eligible for reimbursement equal to the difference between the original service repair cost and the new $149 price. The company says it has begun contacting those who have already paid for such a repair, but urges customers who think they‚Äôre affected to reach out and contact Apple Technical Support to expedite the process.

However, a new report from a security firm suggests Apple's online syncing service iCloud secretly stores logs of its users' private information for as long as four months ‚Äî even when iCloud backup is switched off. Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft discovered that Apple's mobile devices automatically send its users' call history to the company's servers if iCloud is enabled, and stored that data for up to four months. And it turns out that there is no way for iCloud users to stop this phone call syncing service unless they completely disable the cloud synchronization feature. Elcomsoft, which sells software to extract data from Apple's iCloud backups and works with police and intelligence agencies, says the company should tell its customers exactly what personal data it is backing up‚Äîand should give users an easy option to turn it off. Why does this Matter? If you own an iPhone or iPad, your device automatically collects and transmits private information ‚Äî including call history, phone numbers, dates, the length of calls, missed calls, FaceTime calls ‚Äî to iCloud if it is enabled. Not just this, your iPhone also send information collected from other third-party applications that use VoIP service, including WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. \"We discovered that yet another piece of data is stored in the cloud for no apparent reason,\" Elcomsoft's Oleg Afonin writes. \"Using an iPhone and have an active iCloud account? Your calls will sync with iCloud whether you want it or not.\" Apple stores this information for as long as 4 months, and while the company encrypts everything, Privacy buffs note that Apple could become an easy target for law enforcement seeking access to user data. The security firm also raised doubts over possible government surveillance that could be performed. What's more? Elcomsoft says that the logs are uploaded from any iPhone which has iCloud Drive enabled and that this effectively allows spying on you \"without you even knowing.\" \"Syncing call logs happens almost in real time, though sometimes only in a few hours,\" says Elcomsoft CEO Vladimir Katalov. \"But all you need to have is just iCloud Drive enabled, and there is no way to turn that syncing off, apart from just disabling iCloud Drive completely. In that case, many applications will stop working or lose iCloud-related features completely.\" Apple: No Need to Worry However, Apple says there is no reason to worry. Yes, the company says there is nothing wrong with its feature, as it is simply part of its iCloud service that allows its users to access their calls from any of their devices that use an Apple ID. Moreover, Apple guarantees that all of its customers' data is encrypted and two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security for blocking any hacking attempts from hackers or law enforcement. Here's what the company said in the statement: \"We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' data. That is why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private. Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.\" So, as long as you keep your Apple ID to yourself and use a strong password, you do not need to freak out over this report of your call logs being \"secretly\" sent to Apple. Disable iCloud Drive to Prevent Apple from Logging Your calls The solution? At the time, the only way to prevent Apple from logging your call history is to simply disable iCloud Drive altogether. Besides this, you can also manually delete every call entry from your iPhone or iPad, and this will automatically remove the data from iCloud on the next backup. Apple is not the only company that syncs its users' call logs to the cloud. Android smartphones also sync its users' call logs to the cloud as part of backups. Windows 10 mobile devices also sync call logs by default with other Windows 10 devices that use the same Microsoft account. ",

      "title": "Apple wants OLED in iPhones, but most suppliers aren‚Äôt ready",
      "text": "Apple has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that's already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers. The trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the company.\nOLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display.\nWhile Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand.\nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags.\n\"Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,\" said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple's stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said.\nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won't be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\"Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple's first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone's first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options.\nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device's back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple's plans.\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they're unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice.\nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations.\n\"There is all this talk about OLEDs, but I'm not at all sure about their future,\" Sharp president Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. \"We need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.\"\nBloomberg",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd ¬∑ 2 seconds ago with 0 comments Between Bendgate, Touch Disease and that horrific battery case, the iPhone 6 has proven to be an unfortunate model \nBack in August a design defect inside of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices started becoming widespread, leaving countless users with malfunctioning devices. The handsets would lose their touch functionality and display a grey bar or a flickering screen thanks to this flaw. Now, months later, Apple has quietly admitted to the problem and is offering a repair service for $149. \nBack in August, many Apple users reported that their iPhones had started having display issues and non-responsive touch screens. Putting pressure on the devices seemed to help for a while, but the issues would return quickly afterwards. Tinkerers discovered that the problem, dubbed ‚ÄúTouch Disease‚Äù, was likely due to the way the chips inside of the phone were fixed, or rather, weren‚Äôt fixed, in place. Issues with the devices became so widespread that Apple eventually got taken to court in a class-action lawsuit . \nBut now, in the first public, albeit quiet, acknowledgement of the flaw, the company has launched the Multi-Touch Repair program on its site. Apple said that it determined some iPhone 6 models had this issue ‚Äúafter being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device‚Äù. That sounds a bit like the company is trying to cover its own liability. \nThrough this program, affected users can have their iPhones fixed, for $149. While that‚Äôs still a high-price to pay for a flaw that could‚Äôve been completely avoided, it‚Äôs definitely better than the $329 that customers were being charged for out of warranty services. And the company said that users who had paid the full price would be refunded the difference. \nThe Multi-Touch Repair program will run for five years after the first retail sale of the unit.",

      "text": "The camera quality on Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 Plus is already best in class, but Apple certainly has no plans to rest on its laurels and let the rest of the industry play catch-up. According to a new research report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple‚Äôs larger iPhone 8 models will likely sport dual optical image stabilization.\nDON‚ÄôT MISS: Your iPhone 8 might not include Apple‚Äôs hottest new feature next year\nAs it stands now, of the two camera lens‚Äô on the iPhone 7 Plus, only the wide-angle lens comes equipped with optical image stabilization. Kuo‚Äôs note, obtained by MacRumors , relays that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the accompanying telephoto lens gets in on the action as well.\nThe research note reads in part:\nWe believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of next year‚Äôs new iPhone. We think photo quality and optical zoom range may both improve as a result. We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from: (1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes; and (2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corners.\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that Apple‚Äôs 4.7-inch iPhone 8 will reportedly not be graced with a dual camera setup. That being the case, the feature will only be available on the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 and the premium iPhone 8 with the edgeless and curved OLED display.\nAll in all, Apple‚Äôs plans with the iPhone 8 camera are starting to look incredibly intriguing. Earlier today, we relayed how Apple‚Äôs next-gen iPhone may incorporate some compelling new augmented reality features into the camera app itself.\nTrending right now:\nThis $20 gadget will completely change the way you experience TV The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 Walmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "1 \nIn recent months, many iPhone 6 owners have been complaining of an issue described as ‚Äú touch disease ‚Äù that causes a flickering gray bar to appear at the top of their screen and then causes the touchscreen to become unresponsive. We haven‚Äôt heard much about the issue from Apple, but today the company broke its silence. \nApple today launched the ‚Äú Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus .‚Äù The company says that some iPhone 6 Plus units may have screen flickering or multi-touch issues ‚Äúafter being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.‚Äù \nIf you‚Äôve got an iPhone 6 Plus suffering from this issue, you can take your phone to an Apple store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to get it repaired. The fix will cost $149. If you‚Äôve already paid to have the issue fixed by Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, Apple will contact you for a reimbursement for the difference between the price you paid and this $149 repair cost. \nIt‚Äôs good to see Apple finally acknowledge this touchscreen issue, but I‚Äôm sure that most folks suffering from the problem won‚Äôt be pleased about forking over $149 to get it fixed. Plus, the program looks like it‚Äôs only available to iPhone 6 Plus owners, so any iPhone 6 users that‚Äôve encountered the problem appear to be out of luck. \nHave you encountered this so-called ‚Äútouch disease‚Äù on an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus?

      "text": "0 Even some of Apple's newest products will be available at discounted prices. YouTube/Apple \nBefore the end of the month, serious deals will be available in various online retailers and physical shops. If doubts are amidst in purchasing particular Apple products - like the iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7, as well as various MacBook Pro and MacBook Air devices - the available discounts are coming to push consumers over the edge. \nREAD: Black Friday and Cyber Monday Australia 2016: Best tech and gadget deals; Get the most with less \nThough Black Friday and Cyber Monday are not as big a deal in Australia as it is in the US, the annual event is definitely picking up more and more ground every year. Kogan.Com is a website that makes it easier for interested buyers who want to partake in the festivities. And because it is an online-only store, the physical madness of it all can be avoided completely. \nThe iPhone 7 Plus is available on the site in an array of colors, but that discount is not that great. An unit will still set a buyer back by about $1,239, with the original price, which is a $30 discount. However, the iPhone 7 plus is still new to the market and it offers some of the best specifications in the market, including a superior dual-lens camera, IP67 rating and stronger battery life. \nThe iPhone 7 will, on the other hand, cost about $969. The deal will save buyers a rough $110, which is great considering how new the iPhone 7 is. Much like its larger partner, the device has an AMOLED display and an A10 processor. However, it does not have the dual lens camera. \nREAD: Black moon on Friday sparks end-of-the-world fears \nThe site is also offering the 13 inch MacBook Pro for $2339. The savings in this deal are not exactly ideal, considering that the discount is just $159 and a newer model has already been released and is available. The 2015 release does, however, still pack a punch with its 2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Iris 6100 graphics chip and 8GB RAM. \nOn the other hand, the 11 inch MacBook Air, which originally costs $1,398 will only cost $1,199.

      "text": "Female founders, apply now for Include Office Hours with Accel \nFoxconn, Apple‚Äôs key manufacturing partner, is among a number of supply chain companies that are said to be exploring the potential to relocate iPhone production facilities from Asia to the U.S., according to a report in Japanese newspaper The Nikkei . \nThe report comes in the wake of the U.S. election and promises that the winning candidate made in the lead-up to it. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump criticized Apple‚Äôs overseas production capabilities a number of times during his campaign, citing lost jobs for America, pledging , for example, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.‚Äù \nWhile Trump has not communicated an official policy on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., Apple has reportedly already made early enquiries to assess what options, if any, may be possible. \nThe Nikkei claims that Foxconn ‚Äúhas been studying the possibility‚Äù of opening manufacturing facilities on U.S. soil. Pegatron, another key producer of Apple components, is said to have rejected the suggestion up front on account of the increased costs associated. Apple already has invested in some hardware production to the U.S. with a Mac facility in Texas. \nApple and Foxconn have not responded to our requests for comment. We will update this post as and when we hear more. \nThe Nikkei reports that Apple made its U.S. product requests to those crucial supply partners as early as June, which would have placed the conversations squarely in the middle of the Presidential campaign period, when many of these issues about foreign production and tariffs were swirling. \nOne of Trump‚Äôs main soundbites was a proposal to increase international trade tariffs to discourage imports and move jobs and production back to America, hiking import taxes as high as 45 percent on Chinese-made goods . \nHowever, as with many claims and promises made during the campaign, we‚Äôll have to see just how whether any of these will realistically pan out. (Trump is known for bombastic platitudes. He once also also urged Americans to boycott Apple products following its deadlock with the FBI over an order to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.) \nThe President-elect‚Äôs stance on trade has already drawn criticism from China, where a state-owned paper editorialised that iPhone sales in the country could get negatively impacted in retaliation. \nApple‚Äôs orders are said to account for half of Foxconn‚Äôs business, so perhaps it is not hugely surprisingly that the Taiwanese company is at least open to looking into the possibility of relocating some of its work to appease any political pressure that Apple may be facing or preparing to face. \nThere is more to the question than politics, of course, including figuring out the economies of making iPhones in the U.S. and how easy and possible it would be to make these in a new country in terms of labor conditions and expertise, and what part of the production process would move (assembly versus component making, for example). \nTogether, Foxconn and Pegatron produce more than 200 million iPhones per year to satisfy demand for the iconic Apple smartphones worldwide. 0",

      "text": "Apple stores users' call history to iCloud without giving them the option to disable this Apple stores users' call history to iCloud without giving them the option to disable this Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + In a blog post on its web page, Russian security firm Elcomsoft announced the little-known fact that Apple saves up to four months of users' call history in their iCloud account, complete with details such as phune numbers, dates, times of the day when the call were made or received, and their duration. Missed and ignored calls are also uploaded, along with call data by VoIP apps based on Apple's CallKit framework.The iPhone maker has deemed this a convenience feature that helps customers make and return calls from any of their devices. According to Elcomsoft, it has been doing this since at least iOS 8.2, released in March 2015. Unfortunately, users don't have the option to opt out of this feature, and aren't informed about it unless they have read a rather obscure iOS security white paper.Meanwhile, four months of call history (twice as long as that kept by wireless carriers) is sensitive data that's of potential interest to attackers and law enforcement agencies, accessible by obtaining a user's login data or a login token from their devices. Users can still stop uploading of call history data by turning off iCloud Drive functionality, which will prevent third-party apps that rely on it to save data from doing so √¢¬Ä¬ì this might be an inconvenience for some.Elcomsoft notes that the ability to sync call logs to the cloud isn't unique to iOS devices. Google has enabled this feature for Android 6.0 phones and newer that are signed to Google Play Services. Windows 10 Mobile also syncs call logs across devices that share the same Microsoft account. However, Android users have the choice of opting out of syncing this and other information within their smartphones' sync options.",

      "title": "Apple and the Conservation Fund Boost Forest Protection in Maine",
      "text": "  Ninety percent of Maine is covered by forests. \nThis week, Apple partnered with the Conservation Fund to donate 32,400 acres of forest, which the tech giant purchased last year, to the Forest Society of Maine . Apple‚Äôs gift connects over 1 million acres of forest that reach far beyond Maine‚Äôs border with Canada. \nForests by far define Maine‚Äôs landscape: Approximately 90 percent of this New England state is covered by trees, more than any other U.S. state. The 12 million acres nestled against the Canadian border is home to few people, but they offer residents and visitors diverse wildlife, plenty of recreation choices, and economic opportunities. But unlike much of the western U.S. , the vast majority of Maine‚Äôs forests are privately owned ‚Äì as much as 93 percent according to one survey. \nOver the last several years, changes in the U.S. forestry sector caused shifts in ownership for millions of acres with little certainty about their eventual fate. Hence steps taken by companies such as Apple are important in order to allow for some economic activity on this land, while protecting wildlife and permitting recreational activities such as kayaking and fishing. \nApple‚Äôs donation of land and funds will protect the Reed Forest in Aroostook County, located in the northern region of the state, according to the Forest Society of Maine . The endowment allows for sustainable timber harvest that helps employ 38,000 locals, ensures clean water for local communities and provides a carbon sink as a buffer against future climate change risks. \nThis is not Apple‚Äôs first forestry initiative. Last year the tech giant entered into an agreement with WWF to halt deforestation in China. Its project aims to transition 1 million acres of forested lands to responsibly managed forests by 2020. The paper produced from trees grown within these forests will be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). With the world‚Äôs population growing and demand for paper products rising in kind, Apple views these partnerships as a way to groom sustainable development while reducing any encroachment on natural forests. \n‚ÄúFor Apple, this is the beginning of a worldwide effort, one that represents a new approach as it reassesses its impact on the world‚Äôs paper supply chain,‚Äù wrote Lisa P. Jackson , the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and who now serves as VP of environment, policy and aocial initiatives for Apple, upon announcing the company‚Äôs work with the Conservation Fund last year. \nApple has long been called out for its lack of transparency , and the company has been opaque about where it sources the paper and cardboard needed to box its product suite of electronics and accessories. As Philip Elmer-DeWitt has pointed out on Fortune , Apple‚Äôs purchase and donation of forest lands is a way to counter the amount of pulp and paper consumed by its supply chain. Critics of the company will not be mollified until Apple sheds more light how it procures its paper supply; others will see this as a sign that the company is trying to do its part to mitigate its impact on the planet. \nImage credit: Lee Coursey/ Flickr",

      "text": "Apple's acquired companies working for new AR features Metaio and Flyby Media acquisitions playing major role for Apple Apple CEO has previously said that the company will invest in AR \nApple CEO Tim Cook has previously stressed that he sees more potential in augmented reality (AR) than virtual reality (VR) . He had also claimed that Apple will continue to invest a \"lot\" in augmented reality . A new report suggests that Apple is working to integrate augmented reality into iPhone's camera app. \nBusiness Insider citing a person familiar with the matter reports that Apple's effort to include AR in iPhones includes technology from Metaio and Flyby Media, two of the companies that were acquired by the company in recent years. \nTo recall, Apple acquired Metaio , a German company which created virtual product showrooms and other products for clients such as IKEA, in May last year. The Flyby Media, on the other hand, was acquired by Apple earlier this year. Notably, Apple is also rumoured to be working on augmented reality-based wearable glasses. With the added AR capabilities, Apple sees people using iPhones to \"point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised,\" adds the report.\nThe report states that the employees of both Metaio and Flyby Media are working with Apple's camera team for augmented reality feature. It also said that Apple will release the AR as SDK for app developers much like it released for Touch ID fingerprint sensor. Another use of augmented reality being contemplated by Apple according to reports is for automated driving platform. \nBased on preliminary leaks, Apple is said to ditch the 'iPhone 7s' name for next year's iPhone based on its naming convention and directly name it iPhone 8 considering 2017 will be its tenth anniversary of launch of the original iPhone.",

      "text": "Apple offers to repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with 'touch disease' The company says it will repair the phones for $149 Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 17, 2016 6:57 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus Credit: Serenity Caldwell Related Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks \nApple is offering to repair at a reduced price iPhone 6 Plus smartphones with display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThe problem, described in August as ‚Äútouch disease‚Äù by repair guide website iFixit, is characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen. The issue affects both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, according to iFixit. \nApple appears to consider it a problem with the way users handled the phone rather than a defect. It said Thursday that the company has determined that the smartphones may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues ‚Äú after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.‚Äù \nThe company is now offering to repair the problem for a service price of US$149 if the phone is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken. \nThe problem, however, runs deeper, according to iFixit. Merely replacing the touchscreen doesn‚Äôt fix the issue as the gray bar eventually shows up on the new screen, too, it said. It quotes repair experts as stating that the problem is with the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone, which convert touch information into inputs for the phone. \nOn Thursday, iFixit said it had found that stress on the phone causes the chips to eventually lose connection with the motherboard, and pointed to \"insufficient structural support around the logic board.\" It said it had seen the problem on phones that have never been dropped. \nA proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users was filed in August by a law firm, alleging a design defect in the iPhone 6 series phones. \nApple has offered to reimburse the cost difference to those iPhone 6 customers who have already repaired the phone earlier for the same issue either through Apple or through an authorized service provider. Those who have paid for a repair believed to be related to the issue but have not been contacted yet by Apple, are asked to get in touch with the company.

By: IANS | New York | Updated: November 18, 2016 3:33 pm For Apple, making of iPhones in the US will cost will more than double, according to sources. \niPhones may soon be made in US as Apple has asked Foxconn and Pegatron to look into this possibility, reports said. According to Nikkei Asian Review, key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the US. \n‚ÄúApple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the US Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns,‚Äù sources said. \nBut the sources have said that making of iPhones in the US will cost will more than double. The general perception among Americans that they are losing manufacturing jobs to other countries overlaps the Apple‚Äôs ‚Äòrumoured‚Äô prospect move. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump referred to Apple multiple times during his campaign and vowed to slap a 45 per cent tariff on goods made in China. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,‚Äù Trump said at Liberty University in Virginia in January. \nApple‚Äôs Chief Executive Tim Cook was quoted by CBS‚Äô 60 Minutes programme in December 2015 that America simply did not have enough skilled workers for the production of iPhones. \nRead: Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‚Äòtouch disease‚Äô issue \n‚ÄúTo make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the US does not have at the moment. Even if Trump imposes a 45 per cent tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the US,‚Äù sources familiar with the iPhone production process were quoted by Nikkei Asian Review. \nSources said that to make iPhones, America will need US government to subsidise local companies for domestic productions.

      "text": "Apple Accused of Storing Call Logs on iCloud Servers Without an Easy Opt-Out Apple backs up call logs to sync them across your multiple devices They‚Äôre stored on a server, which Apple holds the encryption keys to iCloud is the Achilles Heel in Apple‚Äôs privacy-focused narrative \nApple has long been a champion of user privacy, with the famous San Bernadino battle with the FBI a frequently cited example of the company protecting its users' rights. However, the company hasn't always been forthright when it comes to communicating what it stores and shares. \nA little over a month ago, it was revealed that Apple may be sharing iMessage logs with authorities when requested. Now, the California-based tech giant is being accused of storing call logs on its servers without a loud-and-clear intimation to its users. The Intercept reports of Russian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft, which says that starting with iOS 9, Apple backs up the user‚Äôs call history if iCloud - the service that syncs information like contacts, reminders, photos etc across Apple devices - is enabled. The logs uploaded include phone numbers, date, time, and duration. It‚Äôs no secret that Apple would backup call logs, so that users get consistent information across all of their Apple devices registered with the same Apple ID. Soon after the story broke, an official Apple spokesperson responded to the Intercept report, saying, ‚ÄúWe offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Device data is encrypted with a user‚Äôs passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user‚Äôs Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication‚Äù.\nThe service is under fire for not being forthcoming to the user that such information is being synced. ‚ÄúYou only need to have iCloud itself enabled‚Äù, says Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft. While you have granular controls to disable syncing of contacts, reminders, notes, calendars, safari browsing data etc, there‚Äôs no switch to enable or disable the logging of calls. Also, since iOS 10, calls made from third-party VoIP services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Skype are also integrated into the call history. These details too, are subject to backup, as are FaceTime calls. \nJonathan Zdziarski is an iOS forensics expert and security researcher, who suggests that since Apple holds the encryption keys to iCloud data on servers, it can access your call logs and other information any time it wants, or any time the authorities want. \nAccording to the report, other mobile operating systems like Android 6.0 and above and Microsoft‚Äôs Windows 10 mobile also sync call logs. It adds, \"As with Apple devices, the only way for a user to disable the call history syncing is to disable syncing completely.\" \nIf you‚Äôre concerned about this, Zdziarski suggests not using iCloud at all, ‚Äúuntil the user is in control of the encryption keys‚Äù, not the companies. Not using iCloud also takes away some of the advantages of using multiple products of the Apple ecosystem, that sync seamlessly because of it. Katalov is of the opinion that Apple should provide a switch ‚Äúto disable call log syncing, like they do for other things‚Äù. \nApple is reportedly also not very clear about how long it stores call log backups. A document that details Apple's processes for handling law enforcement requests mentions that it stores call histories associated with FaceTime for up to 30 days, but Katalov insists this is not true - FaceTime call logs are stored for as long as four months, he says. \nWhile not much can be done about what Apple shares with law enforcement authorities when it's forced to do so, another bone of contention is how hackers can access the data if they get a hold of the account holder's credentials, like Apple ID. Elcomsoft itself provides a Phone Breaker tool that can allow access to iCloud backups even without the credentials, as long as an authentication token for the account can be obtained. The tool has now been updated to extract call histories using account credentials or authentication tokens. It gets worse though, as users won't even be notified if call histories are extracted. \n\"Generally, if someone were to attempt to download data in an iCloud account, the system would email a notification to the account owner. But Katalov said no notification occurs when someone downloads synced call logs from iCloud,\" the report adds. \niCloud on many occasions has become the weakest link in Apple‚Äôs privacy-first approach. In the Intercept report, Chris Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, adds that call log backups ‚Äúare not even the worst thing about iCloud‚Äù. The fact that iMessage conversations are backed up on Apple servers, the encryption keys which again, the company holds, is far worse according to him.",

      "text": "Source: courtesy of Apple Inc. According to a report in Nikkei Asian Review, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) could do what has been unthinkable, which is to move some iPhone production to the U.S. Most experts have argued that assembly line production will continue to move to Asia due to the costs of American labor\nThe newspaper reports: \n‚Äî iPhones might one day soon carry ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù labels.\nKey Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., sources told the Nikkei Asian Review.\n‚ÄúApple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúFoxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.‚Äù\nHowever, the report also acknowledge the labor cost problem:\n \nAnother source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs.\n‚ÄúMaking iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,‚Äù the source said.\nSo, it is not quite clear what the goal would be to move production to the U.S. One theory might be to counter Donald Trump‚Äôs threat to put tariffs and products like the iPhone, if it continues to be made overseas. Another one, more far fetched, is that Apple could press Foxconn to add U.S. jobs as leverage to keep its cash overseas‚Äìa trade of adding manufacturing jobs for possible financial punishment. However, that argument is a stretch.\nNo matter what the reason, the entire story seems odd",

      "text": "Three UK suffers major data breach via compromised employee login Posted Report: Apple asked manufacturing partners to explore making iPhones in the U.S. \nThree UK is the latest company to suffer what looks to be a major data breach ‚Äî potentially exposing the personal information of millions of customers. \nAs many as two-thirds of Three‚Äôs customers are thought to have had their information compromised after hackers obtained an employee login. \nThe UK mobile network operator has some 8.8 million active customers, and 4,400 employees. \nThe Telegraph reports that hackers successfully gained access to Three‚Äôs customer upgrade database using an employee login. They then used the login to trigger bogus upgrades for premium smartphones ‚Äî with the aim of intercepting devices before they reached customers. \nThree customer data accessed is said to include names, phone numbers, addresses and dates of birth but no financial information. \nIn a statement give to the newspaper Three said it has seen an increased level of attempted handset fraud over the past month ‚Äî confirming that 400 high value handsets have been stolen via burglaries at its retail stores over this period, with a further eight devices ‚Äúillegally obtained through the upgrade activity‚Äù. \n‚ÄúIn order to commit this type of upgrade handset fraud, the perpetrators used authorised logins to Three‚Äôs upgrade system. This upgrade system does not include any customer payment, card information or bank account information,‚Äù it added. \nWe‚Äôve reached out to Three with additional questions and will update this story with any response. \nIn an update about the breach posted to its Facebook page today, Three adds: We‚Äôre aware of an attempted fraud issue regarding upgrade devices and are working with police and relevant authorities on the matter. The objective was to steal high-end smartphones from Three, but we‚Äôve already put measures in place to stop the fraudulent activity. We‚Äôd like to reassure customers that their financial details are not at risk. We are investigating how many customers are affected and will be contacting them as soon as possible. We‚Äôll update with further information once we have this. \nThree men have been arrested for the hack, according to the National Crime Agency. \nA spokesperson for the UK‚Äôs data watchdog, the ICO, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware of this incident and are making enquiries. The law requires that organisations take appropriate measures to keep people‚Äôs personal data secure. As the regulator, it‚Äôs our job to act on behalf of consumers to see whether that‚Äôs happened.‚Äù \nThe breach follows a record fine by the ICO for UK ISP TalkTalk which suffered a major breach in 2015 when hackers stole around 157,000 customer accounts using an SQL injection technique on vulnerable webpages. In that instance the breach was blamed squarely on TalkTalk having poor website security, rather than on a compromised login. \nBut as security systems are bolstered against external hacking threats there is growing chatter about rising threats inside corporate networks ‚Äî when a compromised employee login can offer hackers a far easier route to acquiring sensitive data vs trying to penetrate expensive security systems. \nOne mitigating measure is to deploy is to use two-factor authentication for employee logins. \nThere are also a growing number of security startups pitching machine learning powered network monitoring systems which alert IT managers to suspicious behavior, such as by analyzing patterns of employee activity. One example there being UK-based Darktrace. Featured Image: Getty Images",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe launch of the PS4 Pro, and before that the launch of the PS VR, will have most likely grabbed most of the attention as far as Sony‚Äôs entertainment products go. Not to be outdone, however, its PlayStation Vue is trying to grab headlines by appealing to Apple fans‚Äô hearts. At long last, Apple TV users will be able to kick back and enjoy PS Vue‚Äôs selection, or what‚Äôs left of it, from their couches. Without having to hold and stare at an iPad, of course. \nDespite carrying the PlayStation brand, PS Vue isn‚Äôt exactly one of the biggest names when it come to video streaming subscription services. Of course, that hasn‚Äôt stopped Sony from pushing its ‚Äúbig screen‚Äù entertainment platform to more (paying) customers. Last month, it rolled out PS Vue for Android TV, so it‚Äôs only proper that Apple TV get its fair share as well. \nPS Vue only works with the 4th gen Apple TV, which is probably for the best since it has more up to date hardware. Plus the Siri remote to navigate through the available channels. All that Apple TV users need to do is install the app and link their existing account, if they have one, like if they used PS Vue on their iPad. If not, they can always sign up for one. Subscription costs $30 to $40 a month. \nThe arrival of PS Vue gives Apple TV owners another source of distraction while waiting for Apple‚Äôs fabled own subscription service. That one will supposedly also sync across multiple Apple devices. If and when it does happen. \nPS Vue itself isn‚Äôt in a very happy state either. Earlier this week it lost no small amount of channels when it parted ways with Viacom, losing Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon, among other channels.",

      "text": "Youtube Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus‚Äô multi-touch issue \nA few days back, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users reported an issue with the phone freezing and becoming unresponsive to touch all of a sudden. \nApple has acknowledged the so-called ‚ÄòTouch disease‚Äô and in response to that, the Cupertino giant has rolled out a new global repair program recently. As per the new program, the company will be repairing the affected device at $149 ( Rs. 10,150 approx.), if the phone is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken. \nYou can easily diagnose it because the handset will display flickering gray bar at the top of the screen. This happens mainly because of two tiny ‚Äòtouch IC‚Äô connectors, which translate the tapping and swiping on the screen into the input, will become slightly detached from the phone‚Äôs logic board. On the other hand, Apple said that the iPhone 6 might face display flickering after being dropped on hard surface. \nIn case if you want to repair your device, you can visit the nearest Apple store or Apple authorized service providers. \nIn an official statement, Apple said: \nApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. \nIf your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.",

By: FE Online | Updated: November 18, 2016 4:09 PM Melanie said that after her visit to the hospital, the doctors informed her that the flesh had been burnt by a foreign object, which she later determined were an iPhone 7. (Representative image) \nIn another rarely heard incident involving sleeping with a smartphone on charge, an Australian woman, Melanie Tan Palaez woke up with 2nd-degree burns on her arm. Speaking to News.com.au, Melanie said that after her visit to the hospital, the doctors informed her that the flesh had been burnt by a foreign object, which she later determined were an iPhone 7 on charge. Melanie said that they tried to match the burnt marks on her arms to the phone and charger. \nOf course, this is Melanie‚Äôs mere assumption and the story might not check out. Apple informed News.com.au that its officials were in contact with Melanie and were investigating the case for more details. Although it is not completely impossible, there have been very few claims such as these in the past. Burn incidents involving laptops have also emerged in the past. \nAn incident like Melanie‚Äôs burns might be a result of bad habits that deliver the worst results when the devices are on charge. A smartphone or a laptop is often designed in a way to exhale excess heat when it is being charged but if it covered or in any way is blocked from doing so, it has the tendency to transfer that excess heat to whatever it is in contact with, in this case, Melanie‚Äôs arm. Although, it has to be noted that it doesn‚Äôt explode like the Note 7, which was due to a battery defect in the smartphone  ",

      "text": "Home Mobiles & Tablets Apple launches Global Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus Display Issues Apple launches Global Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus Display Issues Reported by Zara Ali Mobiles & Tablets , News Posted: November 18, 2016 at 5:38 pm 0 \nA few days ago, many iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users started reporting an issue with the phone. The affected units were facing problems with calibration and touch. Users reported that their iPhone units were becoming unresponsive out of the blue. \nApple acknowledged the issue and had started rolling out a global repair program for the plagued units. As per the repair program, Apple will be fixing the faulty iPhone 6 Plus units at $149 (approx. Rs. 10,150). The eligible units should be in working condition without any crack on the screen. One of the conventional methods that Apple resorts to whenever its devices face a backlash. \nThe touch problem within the iPhone 6 Plus units is due to a shortcoming in the small ‚Äòtouch IC‚Äô connectors. One can easily spot the problem as the phone display flickering grey bar at the top of the screen. Touch IC connectors are responsible for touch input, a fault in these connectors leads to detached touch input. Apple also stated that the iPhone 6 Plus could also face such problem if it has been dropped on a hard floor. \nAlso Read: Apple iPhone 6 Plus Review \nIn an official statement , Apple said, ‚ÄúApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.‚Äù \nFor the iPhone 6 Plus users who have been facing such problem with their handset; you can visit your nearest Apple authorised store.",

      "title": "How India's Micromax took the fight to Apple and Samsung",
      "text": "Micromax works to improve India's connectivity Every so often, Rahul Sharma goes to a cellphone store and acts as a salesman. It isn't something he needs to do, but it's helped him build Micromax into one of the world's biggest smartphone manufacturers. \"I sell every phone, whether it is Micromax or any other competitive brand,\" the Micromax founder and CEO told CNNMoney in an interview. \"Just to understand what exactly the consumers are looking for.\" \nHaving a strong grasp of what customers want is a key part of Micromax's efforts to take on foreign competitors such as Samsung ( SSNLF ) and China's Xiaomi in India's booming market. \n\"People in India need Indian flavor,\" the 40-year-old entrepreneur said. \"People want products that will solve the problems in their day-to-day lives.\" \nRelated: India isn't just growing fast, it's much more competitive \nSharma and three college friends founded Micromax as a software company in 1999. But it was the desire to fix a problem that catapulted it into the cellphone market nine years later. \nWhile traveling through a remote village in West Bengal, Sharma came across an old man using a truck battery to power the village payphone. Since the man's own village had no electricity, he would take it to a neighboring village on his bicycle to charge it overnight. \n\"And that's how the first Micromax phone was born -- with one month of battery backup,\" Sharma said. \nThe first phone was a simple device with an optimized battery that could last 30 days on a single charge. \nHe and his partners were nervous about plunging into a market that was already crowded with big foreign brands including Nokia, Samsung and Motorola. They didn't have to be: The 10,000 phones they made sold out in 10 days. \n\"That was the 'Aha!' moment,\" he said. \"We realized there is massive potential in this country.\" \nAs CEO of Indian smartphone maker Micromax, Rahul Sharma wants to take his company into the world's top five. \nThe company's affordable phones, packed with features tailored to groups of users, have enabled it to grab a bigger share of the Indian market than any competitor, except for South Korean giant Samsung. \nMicromax is currently the 10th-largest cellphone maker in the world, according to technology research firm Gartner. The Indian company has also begun exporting to countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Russia. \nSharma has set his sights on climbing even higher up the global sales rankings. \n\"In the next five years we want to be in the top five in the world,\" he said. Those spots are currently held by Samsung, Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) and three Chinese brands ‚Äî Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi. \nCatching up with them is easier said than done. \nThe Chinese companies are aggressively expanding in India. The latest figures from research firm IDC show Micromax slipping behind Lenovo ( LNVGF ) (which also owns Motorola) and barely ahead of Xiaomi. Newer local brands are also gaining ground, looking to beat Micromax at its own game. \nIndia's smartphone market, already the second-largest in the world, is expected to cross 800 million by 2021 \nIndia is the world's second largest cellphone market, with more than one billion mobile users, and demand for more sophisticated devices is growing fast. The number of smartphone subscriptions is expected to rise from roughly 220 million to 810 million by 2021, according to a recent report by telecoms firm Ericsson. \nAnd nearly 80% Indians still aren't connected to the Internet, a gap that internet giants Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) and Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) would dearly like to help bridge. India's richest man also entered the fray two months ago, debuting a service with free 4G subscriptions until the end of the year. \nRelated: 900 million Indians can't get online. Here's why \nApple, meanwhile, may soon be able to open its own stores in India as foreign investment regulations are relaxed. \nBut Sharma is confident that his company is best placed to tap into the needs India's consumers. \n\"The mission of Micromax has always been to democratize technology,\" he said. \nCNNMoney (New Delhi )   7:07 AM ET",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Apple has rolled out a new ad for its latest MacBook Pro just as the notebook starts hitting store shelves. Called ‚ÄúBulbs,‚Äù the video showcases the fancy new Touch Bar, which Apple describes as ‚Äúa tool for all the ideas to come.‚Äù\nWe probably could have guessed the first MacBook Pro ad would focus on the Touch Bar, but ‚ÄúBulbs‚Äù isn‚Äôt quite what we expected. During the 1-minute, 37-second clip, the Touch Bar itself only appears on screen for about four seconds.\nIt‚Äôs certainly a cool ad, though. In typical Apple fashion, it‚Äôs interesting and dramatic, and it makes you want to find out more about that Touch Bar and the new MacBook Pro.\nIf you haven‚Äôt already ordered your new MacBook Pro from the Apple online store, you may now be able to find one at your local Apple store. The 13-inch model became available for in-store pickup at many locations in the U.S., but there‚Äôs no sign of the 15-inch just yet.\nTo check stock at an Apple store near you, simply choose the 13-inch MacBook Pro on Apple‚Äôs website, then click ‚Äúcheck availability‚Äù under the ‚ÄúPickup‚Äù option. You can then type in your city or zip code to find stores closest to you.\n\n\nSource : ",

      "text": "In June Apple asked both Apple iPhone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron to look into the matter if iPhone could be manufactured in the US. Apple is considering to manufacturer iPhones in the US in near future, according to a report by financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.\nIn June Apple asked both Apple iPhone assemblers Foxconn and Pegatron to look if iPhone could be manufactured in the US.\nAccording to Nikkei Asian Review‚Äôs source, Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate Apple‚Äôs plan due to cost concerns.\nThe report has arrived one week after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. In January, then-candidate Trump said he would get Apple to manufacturer its products at home.\n‚ÄúWe are going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country, instead of other countries,‚Äù he said.\nHowever, Nikkei‚Äôs source fears that making iPhone in the US would double Apple‚Äôs production cost.\nAccording to a research company HIS Markit, will cost about $ 225 for Apple to make a 32GB iPhone 7, while it retails for $649.",

Wei Gu, a long-time China reporter most recently with the Wall Street Journal, has joined Apple to take up a PR Director role based out of its office in Shanghai, China. \nBeijing-based Carolyn Wu leads Apple‚Äôs media relations in China, and Wei will add significant experience to the team having spent more than 18 years in media, across both print and broadcast. That includes more than a decade as a columnist at Reuters in New York and Hong Kong, and close to four years at the Journal, where she wrote about business and markets as its Hong Kong-based China Wealth and Luxury Editor . \nThe Journal is set to make layoffs across its international offices in a bid to restructure its business, but Wei‚Äôs departure isn‚Äôt related to that. She left the paper in August and spent a short period freelancing in communications before taking the Apple role, according to LinkedIn . \nPast Apple hires from the media pool include former reporter at The Verge Josh Lowenstein, Anandtech‚Äôs Anand Shimpi and Brian Klug, and our own Darrell Etherington , who has since returned to write for TechCrunch once again. 0",

The two-year-old phone, and especially the Plus version, is prone to develop what‚Äôs called a Touch Disease affliction. What happens is that a phone could experience display flickering, multitouch issues, and even Touch ID problems.\nThe problem has been linked to Bendgate, the infamous iPhone 6 issue discovered soon after launch. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus can bend when a certain pressure is applied. But Apple never explained what causes Touch Disease until now. And while some people say Touch Disease is a direct result of a manufacturing issue, Apple isn‚Äôt ready to admit that. In fact, the company will charge you $149 to repair your device. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nThis is how Apple gets Netflix on its new TV app New MacBook Pro ad places Apple‚Äôs laptop among some of history‚Äôs greatest inventions The exciting iPhone 8 is expected to do what the boring iPhone 7 can‚Äôt ",

      "title": "AppleScript, the perfect adjunct to iTunes: An open letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook",
      "text": "MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac \nDear Mr. Cook, \nI was chagrined to learn that Sal Soghoian, who was Apple‚Äôs Product Manager of Automation Technologies, was let go for ‚Äú business reasons .‚Äù Mr. Soghoian had been with Apple for nearly 20 years, and was the keeper of the flame for technologies such as AppleScript, Automator, and more. \nIn my writings about iTunes , I have often explained to readers how they could extend iTunes‚Äôs feature set using AppleScripts. Most of these have been written by Doug Adams, proprietor of Doug‚Äôs AppleScripts for iTunes , a site that started out as a repository of tools to extend iTunes, but has become an essential resource for iTunes users. [Full disclosure: Doug and I host a podcast together. ] \nNo application can do everything its users need, and none should offer everything they want. For this reason, AppleScript has long been the perfect adjunct to iTunes, which is already feature-rich (some say ‚Äúbloated,‚Äù but I disagree ), and doesn‚Äôt need more options and tools. Many of these AppleScripts are designed to tag files, edit their metadata to correct errors, improve consistency, and ensure that users can find the files they want, and help them efficiently use smart playlists. \nIt‚Äôs not clear whether the termination of Mr. Soghoian means the demise of AppleScript altogether, and particularly in iTunes, but many developers, iTunes users, and others are concerned by this decision. \nYou see, it‚Äôs all about freedom. Freedom to do things we want that Apple doesn‚Äôt think we need to be able to do. Freedom to explore. Freedom to discover new ways to link applications, to interact with files, to create our own solutions. We can‚Äôt expect apps to cater to all our whims, and tools like AppleScript and Automator allow us to go a step further and discover ways to do things that Apple never even considered. \nA lot of the AppleScripts I use with iTunes allow me to tweak the text in file metadata. For example, I use Remove n Characters From Front or Back often to delete extraneous words in song titles when I rip CDs. In the Gracenote database that iTunes uses to add metadata when ripping, you often find live recordings where (Live) is present after each track name. A script like that allows me to quickly remove this text that I don‚Äôt need. Find Album Artwork with Google lets me search for artwork when iTunes can‚Äôt find any. And Dupin lets me scour my library for duplicate tracks; something I do often, since I rip a lot of box sets of classical music, many of which contain music that I already have from different releases. Siri can‚Äôt do any of this. \nI know you want us all to embrace streaming, via Apple Music, but it‚Äôs frustrating, if you‚Äôre a serious music listener, to deal with the poor metadata in Apple‚Äôs library, the tracks that go missing, and the many problems with iCloud Music Library. In addition, some of us have large CD collections, and plan to keep buying CDs. \nI don‚Äôt pretend to have any idea what ‚Äúbusiness reasons‚Äù have led to Mr. Soghoian being terminated, but I speak for many iTunes users who depend on this technology to maintain their media libraries in iTunes. \nPlease, Mr. Cook, don‚Äôt shut us out. While AppleScript is not widely used, it is a valuable technology for iTunes users. Don‚Äôt take away our freedom to explore, to innovate, to solve problems with this tool. \nYours sincerely, \nKirk McElhearn To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Apple ( AAPL ) stands to benefit the most from any U.S. tax holiday on overseas cash, writes Morgan Stanley ‚Äôs Katy Huberty , while disk drive maker Western Digital ( WDC ) could be at risk from trad policy by a Trump administration.\nReflecting on Trump‚Äôs vow to offer a lower, 10% tax on any overseas cash brought back to the U.S., Huberty writes it ‚Äúshould be beneficial and most impactful for the mid-to-large cap names that have a significant percentage of cash held by foreign subsidiaries and are interested in making acquisitions or stepping up capital return to shareholders.‚Äù\nChief among them is Apple:\nApple, with $216B of cash held offshore (or 37% of market cap), is the largest beneficiary and would likely pay $54B less in taxes should a repatriation holiday occur and they decide to move all their cash onshore. This would give Apple a significant amount of accessible dry powder to potentially make a sizable acquisition, boost returns to shareholders, pay down debt or do all of the above. It would likely also remove an overhang on the stock that has been in place for many years. Other companies with large offshore cash balances that could potentially step up M&A activity or return cash to shareholders (Exhibit 1)? NTAP (offshore cash is 43% of mkt cap), HPE (26%), HPQ (21%), WDC (17%) and IBM (6%). Collectively, these six companies could save over $61B in taxes, or 25% of their current offshore cash balance, with a 10% repatriation holiday.\nOn the flip side, for Western and other names with high exposure to international sales, tariffs or other limitations would be a risk.\n‚ÄúInternational markets make up, on average, 46% of reported revenue for our coverage universe, with the Asia Pacific region representing about 20% of revenue.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhile we have no advanced knowledge of specific policies president-elect Trump will enact,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúinvestors are asking who could be most exposed if tariffs and other limitations on global trade are put in place.‚Äù\nHuberty offers the following ranking of international revenue exposure for the major hardware names:",

Apple is not only charging customer to fix the problem, but also only willing to work on iPhones whose \"screen is not cracked or broken\". Financial compensation is also available to anyone who has already fixed their phone at greater expense. \nLaunching the Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus , Apple says: \nApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. \nIf your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. \nApple will contact customers who may have paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to arrange reimbursement. If you have not been contacted but paid for a repair that you believe was related to this issue, please contact Apple. \nThe reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price.",

      "text": "Apple Hires Former WSJ Reporter as Public Relations Director in China Friday November 18, 2016 5:13 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Apple has hired a former reporter and columnist for The Wall Street Journal , Wei Gu, to its public relations department in Shanghai, China. Gu's role, per LinkedIn (via TechCrunch ) will be PR Director, which she began this month. Gu's professional history spans 18 years and includes jobs at CNN and Reuters , working as a video journalist and reporter to break news regarding technology companies based out of the United States. She left The Wall Street Journal in August -- where her work included a focus on a weekly finance column -- and had since been writing and editing a personal blog before joining Apple this month. As Apple continues to boost its presence in China , it makes sense for the company to begin expanding and improving its talent pool in regards to China-based public relations. Just this year, Apple faced issues with Chinese regulators regarding a controversial independent movie which led to the shut down of iTunes and iBooks in the country. Although China has lost ground to Europe and is now Apple's third most profitable market, the company continues to expand its influence within the country, with CEO Tim Cook remaining steadily \" optimistic \" about Apple's presence in China, recently saying that \"China is not as weak as has been talked about.\"",

According to Apple, however, this flaw is caused by dropping the phone repeatedly. The company says it will not cover the cost of a repair and will ask those affected by the issue to pay $149 to have it fixed. That might not sit too well with the iPhone owners who filed class action lawsuits against Apple over the touch disease issue.\n‚ÄúApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,‚Äù the company writes on its website. ‚ÄúIf your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.‚Äù\nApple says those who have already paid for a service repair related to the issue are eligible for reimbursement equal to the difference between the original service repair cost and the new $149 price. The company says it has begun contacting those who have already paid for such a repair, but urges customers who think they‚Äôre affected to reach out and contact Apple Technical Support to expedite the process.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "\nReport: Apple considering making iPhones in US USA TODAY 59 mins ago Eli Blumenthal ¬© Apple A worker inspects an iPhone at a final assembly facility in Zhengzhou, China. An iPhone \"Designed in California\" and made in the USA? It could happen soon.\nApple asked Asian-based manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron in June to explore the possibility of manufacturing the popular smartphone in the U.S., according to a report in financial magazine Nikkei Asian Review , citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.\nFoxconn agreed to look into the possibility though Pegatron declined over concerns that the cost of doing so would be too high, the report said.\nThe report comes one week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While on the campaign trail in January, then-candidate Trump warned he would try to force Apple into manufacturing its products in the U.S.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,‚Äù he told a crowd a Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.\nThat isn't all. As a candidate, Trump also called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters.\nApple declined to comment on the report, though it provided a statement about its efforts in the U.S.\n‚ÄúApple is responsible for creating more than 2 million jobs across the United States, from engineers, retail and call center employees to operations and delivery drivers,\" the company said, citing a jobs creation link on its website. \"We work with over 8,000 suppliers from coast to coast and are investing heavily in American jobs and innovation.‚Äù\nBringing iPhone manufacturing to the U.S. could be seen as a big win for the President-elect, though at exactly what cost remains to be seen. Market researcher IHS Markit said it costs roughly $225 to build the 32GB iPhone 7, the cheapest new model Apple makes. It retails for $649.\nAlthough it may not sound like a lot, the phone is $36.89 pricier than last year's iPhone 6S, and that is with IHS factoring in $5 for manufacturing costs.\nFoxconn has similarly expressed concerns over cost, including from chairman Terry Gou. One unnamed source told Nikkei magazine that \"making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double.\"\nThere is also the risk of Chinese push-back. Amid concerns over Trump vow to impose a 45% tax on all Chinese imports, Chinese state-backed paper Global Times published an op-ed saying China would respond \"tit-for-tat,\" and that \"US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback.\"\nIf Apple does bring the iPhone to the U.S., it would not be the first product the company has manufactured domestically.\nWhile the company already builds a variety of parts for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs in the U.S., in 2013 the company notably announced that its updated Mac Pro computer would be assembled in the U.S.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Apple offers to repair iPhone 6 Plus devices with 'touch disease' The company says it will repair the phones for $149 Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 18, 2016 3:44 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Credit: Image credit: Macworld/Serenity Caldwell More like this Computerworld Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Wonderful Wearables \nApple is offering to repair at a reduced price iPhone 6 Plus smartphones with display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThe problem, described in August as ‚Äútouch disease‚Äù by repair guide website iFixit, is characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen. The issue affects both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus, according to iFixit. \nApple appears to consider it a problem with the way users handled the phone rather than a defect. It said Thursday that the company has determined that the smartphones may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues ‚Äú after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.‚Äù \nThe company is offering to repair the problem for a service price of $149 if the phone is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken. \nThe problem, however, runs deeper, according to iFixit. Merely replacing the touchscreen doesn‚Äôt fix the issue as the gray bar eventually shows up on the new screen, too, it said. It quotes repair experts as stating that the problem is with the two touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC chips, on the logic board inside the phone, which convert touch information into inputs for the phone. \nOn Thursday, iFixit said it had found that stress on the phone causes the chips to eventually lose connection with the motherboard, and pointed to \"insufficient structural support around the logic board.\" It said it had seen the problem on phones that have never been dropped. \nA proposed class-action lawsuit on behalf of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users was filed in August, alleging a design defect in the iPhone 6 series phones. \nApple has offered to reimburse the cost difference to those iPhone 6 customers who have already repaired the phone earlier for the same issue either through Apple or through an authorized service provider. Those who have paid for a repair believed to be related to the issue but have not been contacted yet by Apple, are asked to get in touch with the company.

      "title": "Apple Launches iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' Repair Program",
      "text": "The iPhone 6 Plus has a problem, and some say it's a design flaw. Apple's larger last generation smartphone can start displaying flashing gray bars at the top of the screen and become unresponsive to touch input. It took several months, but Apple finally decided to offer a repair program . The kicker being, it costs $149.\nThe fault has been dubbed \"Touch Disease.\" As the iFixit video below explains, it happens because the touchscreen integrated circuit (IC) tasked with processing touchscreen input is detaching from the solder holding it to the logic board.\nEven though the touchscreen IC hasn't changed much over different generations of iPhone, Apple made two key tweaks to the internal design of the iPhone 6 Plus which allowed Touch Disease to occur.\nFirstly, Apple removed a metal shield sitting over the chips and board in previous iPhones, which results in a loss of strength. Secondly, it stopped underfilling the chip, which acts like a concrete and ensures the chip is very securely held in place over its lifetime. Add to that the fact an iPhone 6 Plus can bend during normal use, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\nApple does not believe the fault lies with the touchscreen IC, though. On the Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus page the company states, \"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\"",

      "text": "Posted 2 minutes ago by iClarified ¬∑ 189 views ¬∑ Translate Apple has announced the launch of a Multi-Touch Repair Program for the iPhone 6 Plus. Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. The company also notes that it will contact customers who may have paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to arrange reimbursement.

      "text": "Apple looking to integrate Augmented Reality into iPhone camera app: Report Apple looking to integrate Augmented Reality into iPhone camera app: Report Apple's iPhone camera app could come with Augmented Reality integration, own pair of smart glasses By: Tech Desk | Published:November 18, 2016 6:36 pm Apple‚Äôs augmented reality mode could also allow for the app to recognise faces and add filters to it, just like Snapchat \nApple ‚Äôs iPhone camera app could come with Augmented Reality integration, reports BusinessInsider citing people familiar with the matter. The report says that Apple is relying on several teams acquired from various startups to pull this off, even as a Bloomberg report had highlighted that the Cupertino giant is working on its own pair of smart glasses. \nAccording to the Business Insider report, Apple iPhone users will be able to ‚Äúpoint the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognized.‚Äù The augmented reality mode could also allow for the app to recognise faces and add filters to it, just like Snapchat. Apple acquired FaceShift a company that was working on such a technology in 2015. \nOther Apple acquisitions around AR are Metaio and Flyby Media, which are also working in the company‚Äôs camera group, says the report. \nIn the company‚Äôs Q3 results for 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said in his comments that they believe in the future of Augmented Reality and have invested in the technology. ‚ÄúAR can be huge, even if it doesn‚Äôt become a separate platform,‚Äù he had said at the time. \nA report in March in the Financial Times has said Apple also has a secret team working on both VR and AR prototypes of headsets. The report said the secret research unit consists of staff poached from other companies. \nAlso read: Apple investing in Augmented Reality, confirms Tim Cook \nIn another interview with ABC News, Tim Cook had said, ‚ÄúVirtual Reality and Augmented Reality are incredibly interesting but that AR is more present compared to VR.‚Äù The Apple CEO had said that while virtual reality has great potential in the fields of education and gaming, he was putting his money on augmented reality to grow big. \nA Bloomberg report said Apple is exploring the smart glasses business. The report notes, ‚ÄúApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn‚Äôt ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added.‚Äù ¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "title": "Apple Reportedly Conducting Feasibility Study Of Trump's Vision Of The American Made iPhone",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill ‚Äî Friday, November 18, 2016 Apple Reportedly Conducting Feasibility Study Of Trump's Vision Of The American Made iPhone Apple may be an American company, but the bulk of its products (save for the long-neglected Mac Pro , which is assembled in the United States) are manufactured in China. The relatively low cost of labor, coupled with premium pricing for devices like the iPhone , has allowed Apple to become one of the most profitable companies in the world.\nHowever, according to a new report from the Nikkei Asian Review , during the past year, Apple has at least explored the idea of manufacturing the iPhone in the United States. According to a source for the publication, ‚ÄúApple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron , the two iPhone assembly plants, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S. Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.\" \nEven though Foxconn at least entertained Apple‚Äôs request, it too eventually came to the same conclusion as Pegatron. A Foxconn source added, \"Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double.‚Äù \nBut why would Apple even make such a request if the obvious response would be that it is financially not feasible to pull off? Perhaps Apple was just following up on a contingency plan should Donald Trump win the race for the White House (which of course he did). \"We have such amazing people in this country -- smart, sharp, energetic, they're amazing,‚Äù said Trump during the primaries back in January . \n‚ÄúI was saying, make America great again, and I actually think we can say now, and I really believe this, we're gonna get things coming. We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.‚Äù President-elect Donald Trump \nTrump also threatened to strangle American businesses that outsource to other countries by hitting them with a 35 percent tariff on products once they arrive on United States soil. \nWhatever the case, Apple CEO Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt seem to be in a rush to bring iPhone production to the United States. \"To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,\" said Cook during a December 2015 interview with 60 Minutes . \"Even if Trump imposes a 45% tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook \nApple and President-elect Trump shared headlines earlier this week thanks to an editorial from Global Times , a state-run Chinese newspaper. The paper took Trump to task, and said that he in fact has little power to impose crippling tariffs long-term, writing, ‚ÄúTo impose a 45 percent tariff on imports from China is merely campaign rhetoric. The greatest authority a US president has is to impose tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days on all imported goods and the limit can only be broken on the condition that the country is declared to be in a state of emergency. \n‚ÄúIf Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-US trade will be paralyzed.‚Äù \nThe paper went on to drag Apple and Boeing into the discussion, writing, ‚ÄúChina will take a tit-for-tat approach then. A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted.‚Äù \nBut of course, this is all speculation at this point. Campaign promises are one thing, but we‚Äôll have to wait until Trump is in office to see how trade relationships between China and the United States are altered and how it will affect companies like Apple.",

      "title": "Apple‚Äôs Hour of Code Features Swift Playgrounds",
      "text": "NateSwanner Hour of Code \nApple is bringing its Hour of Code initiative back, and extending the learning to its new Swift Playgrounds app. \nFrom December 5 through 11 ( Computer Science education week , naturally), Apple stores across the world will host a free hour-long introduction to coding. The company is again partnering with code.org for the initiative. \n‚ÄúHour of Code embodies our vision for Apple stores as a place for the community to gather, learn and be entertained,‚Äù said Angela Ahrendts, Apple‚Äôs senior vice president of Retail. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud to introduce the Swift Playgrounds app into the workshops and honored to again work side-by-side with Code.org on this incredibly important initiative. Hour of Code is one of the absolute highlights of the year for both our teams and the families that visit our stores.‚Äù \nApple‚Äôs Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi added: ‚ÄúCoding is just like any language, the earlier you‚Äôre exposed the more successful you‚Äôll be. Whether at an Apple Store, in a classroom, or at home with an iPad, Swift Playgrounds brings real coding concepts to life and empowers the next generation with the skills they need to express their creativity.‚Äù \nThe company also says it has tools for those who want to extend the learning into community centers or elsewhere kids may gather, such as schools. The Swift Playgrounds app has a customizable ‚ÄòHour of Code challenge‚Äô for those efforts, a new ‚ÄòLearn to Code 3‚Äô area in the Swift Playgrounds for educators and a companion teacher‚Äôs guide available via the Apple Teacher platform. \nApple is only one facet of the program, though. Spearheaded by Code.org, Hour of Code has events all over the globe during the week of December 5 (typically hosted at schools and libraries). It claims the programs reaches ‚Äútens of millions of students‚Äù in 180 countries, and has tools and tips for those interested in hosting an event. \nCode.org hosts its lessons in perpetuity on its site so you can continue learning after the 60 minutes are up. To keep kids engaged on their level, there are themed lessons. You can program new creatures in a ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù environment, for example, or a digital droid for ‚ÄúStar Wars.‚Äù Disney lends its ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù franchise to the cause as well, or kids can learn to create their own ‚ÄúFlappy Bird‚Äù clone ( please don‚Äôt, kids ). \nLessons scale to all ages, too. While getting kids learning young is obviously a big push for Code.org, there are also lessons pointed towards those 13 and older. At that point, Code.org jumps beyond concepts and into JavaScript. \nAimed at kids, Hour of Code is open to all. What used to be plopping kids down in front of a terminal to hack out some basic code is now morphing into a full-fledged mobile experience. It‚Äôs a smart move, too; the Swift Playgrounds app is a much better way to learn the concepts of coding , and will likely help demystify things that may confuse kids about writing code. \nApple hasn‚Äôt yet mentioned any Featured Events, but 2015 brought some lectures from known developers to Apple Stores at various metro locations. We‚Äôd expect that to be the case this year, as well, but we‚Äôll have to wait and see where (and when) those events may happen. \nIf you‚Äôre interested in an Hour of Code near you , it‚Äôs best to check with your local Apple Store for details on when it plans to host one.
