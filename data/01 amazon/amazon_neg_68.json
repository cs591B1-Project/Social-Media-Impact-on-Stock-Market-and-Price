      "text": "November 30, 2016, 6:00 AM Amazon’s Alexa speaker will soon have a screen companion By Bloomberg News A seven-inch touchscreen will enable Amazon’s digital assistant Alexa to access such content as weather and news, a source says. \n(Bloomberg)—Amazon.com Inc. is developing a premium Echo-like speaker with a screen, a sign the world’s largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple Inc. \nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon’s existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company’s voice-based Alexa digital assistant , according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced. \nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upward so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said. \nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon’s new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, No. 1 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , declined to comment. \nSo-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon’s hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014. Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating U.S. sales of more than 5 million units since 2014. \nAmazon’s planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.’s Google Home speaker and Apple’s (No. 2) interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant . \nThe new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon’s Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box . The gadget will still respond to verbal commands and spoken questions, just like current Alexa devices. Amazon is also testing a feature that allows users to pin items such as photos on their speaker’s screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door, one of the people said. \nAmazon plans to keep selling the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers that are typically stationed in living rooms and bedrooms, one of the people said. The current speakers cost $50, $130 and $180, respectively, while the model with a screen will likely be priced higher, the other person said. \nSome reviewers panned the current Echo for poor audio quality, which is partly due to Amazon designing it to sound better at moderate volume levels, according to one of the people. The new speaker will play high-quality audio at all volume levels, this person said. At least one prototype version of the device places the speakers below and behind the screen, they added. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon’s Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tablet-like computer screen known internally as “Knight.” Topics ",

      "text": "Amazon’s Alexa has gained many skills over the past year, such as being able to read tweets or deliver election results and fantasy football scores. Starting on Wednesday, you’ll be able to ask Alexa about Mars. The new skill for the voice-controlled speaker comes courtesy of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It’s the first Alexa app from the space agency.\nTom Soderstrom, the chief technology officer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory was on hand at the AWS re:invent conference in Las Vegas tonight to make the announcement.\nView photos \nTom Soderstrom More According to Soderstrom, the “NASA Mars” skill is part of an outreach effort to get people more interested in Mars.\n“Tomorrow you’ll be able to use Amazon Dots and your Amazon Echos, and you can ask questions about Mars,” Soderstrom said tonight. “This is all about exploring and getting crowd-sourcing and getting people to understand and care about Mars and ask new questions.”\nAlexa has already been able to handle questions about Mars, such as how far away it is. (The answer is 133 million miles.) When the NASA skill is enabled, Alexa’s repertoire is widened to allow queries like these:\n“Alexa, open NASA Mars.” “Alexa, ask NASA Mars for a Curiosity rover update.” “Alexa, ask NASA Mars: Why is Mars red?” View photos \nROV-E is a Mars outreach rover that’s modeled after NASA’s Curiosity rover and the upcoming Mars 2020 rover. (NASA / JPL-Caltech Photo) More Soderstrom also teased an upcoming demonstration of ROV-E, a miniaturized version of the Mars exploration rover. The cute little rover is controllable either with a joystick or with Alexa commands, and you can ask it questions about Mars as well.\nThe rover is built with commonly available parts, and NASA is making the blueprint available so that schools, universities, museums and do-it-yourself types can build their own rovers.\nMore from GeekWire: NASA uses Microsoft’s HoloLens and ProtoSpace to build its next Mars rover in augmented reality An engine for Mars: Aerojet wins $67M NASA contract for solar electric propulsion Microsoft and NASA team up to create virtual Mars tour with HoloLens Amazon’s Alexa can now pay credit card bills with Capital One integration",

      "text": "30th November 2016 by Adam Smith Follow @adamndsmith Similar to the Amazon Echo, this speaker will reportedly feature a touchscreen display and better-quality speakers. \nAmazon is planning a premium version of its voice controlled speakers - the Echo and the Dot - which will come with a big, touchscreen display, according to reports. \nBloomberg quotes \"two people familiar with the matter\" who claim the new speaker will have a 7-inch screen, in order to make it easier for users to access weather forecasts, calendar appointments and news. \nMORE: Amazon Echo review \nThe Fire HD 8 has an 8in screen - slightly larger than the one expected on Amazon's new speaker \nThe speaker will be larger, and the screen will tilt upwards so that it can be viewed on a counter. It will also reportedly have better speakers to make the premium Echo sound better than its existing counterparts. \nThese speakers are apparently being added with a focus on high-quality audio at all volume levels, with at least one prototype version of the device placing speakers below and behind the screen. More after the break \nOne of our criticisms of the Echo was its \"so-so sound\" \nThe new device will run a version of Amazon's Fire operating system, similar to that on its tablets such as the Fire HD 8 . According to sources, Amazon is testing features that allow users to \"pin items such as photos on their speaker’s screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door\". \nAmazon is looking to fend-off competition from other AI speakers, such as Google's new Home speaker , which has similar functionalities to the Echo. \nThis new Amazon AI speaker is apparently scheduled to be announced in the first quarter of 2017, although Amazon are yet to officially release details.",

      "text": " \nAmazon Web Services used to be the public cloud of choice for scrappy cash-strapped startups. Small companies liked that they could buy (or rent) computer servers, networking, and storage as needed, typically with a credit card.\nTiny companies are unlikely to spend much on VMware vmw data center software or Workday wday human resource and financial applications. And yet at this week’s AWS Re:Invent tech conference in Las Vegas, VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger and Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri will share the stage with AWS CEO Andy Jassy.\nThat shows that not only does Amazon amzn want to sell its data center servers and storage to big customers, but to the software providers that also sell to those customers. It wants to supply the suppliers as well as the suppliers’ customers. Towards that end, Amazon is well into year six of a push for big business customers . There have been signs of traction already: General Electric , an AWS customer, has been a presence at this conference for a few years now, and companies don’t get much bigger than that.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter \nJust a few weeks ago, AWS and VMware, once bitter rivals, agreed to work together to make VMware vSphere available on AWS so that joint customers could take the same software packages that now run on their own servers over to the Amazon cloud. Last spring, Salesforce crm , which sells customer management and sales software to big companies, committed to spending $400 million over four years to host new software on AWS rather than in its own data centers.\nThat traction results from a concerted effort Amazon management over the past four or five years to convince businesses in the financial services, healthcare, and government that running on shared public cloud infrastructure meets their security and other requirements.\nAnd now the battle is on as AWS, Microsoft , IBM , Google fight to win big business accounts (and the software vendors selling into those accounts) for their respective clouds.\nSome examples:\nMicrosoft msft recently signed up SAP sap SuccessFactors for its Microsoft Azure cloud. Meanwhile, AWS bragged about landing Salesforce as a big customer earlier this year. IBM , Amazon, and Hewlett Packard (before last year’s Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe split from Hewlett-Packard Inc. publicized that Workday used its cloud.\nAs an interesting aside, many of these deals smack of mutual back scratching. Does Salesforce’s commitment to spending $400 million on AWS infrastructure over the next four years have anything to do with Amazon signing a deal to give its employees access to all of Salesforce’s products?\nFor more on AWS, watch: \nThe Microsoft-SAP deal has a similar back story. In October, Microsoft proclaimed that SAP’s SuccessFactors human resources software would be available on its Azure as well as SAP’s own infrastructure. Less than a month later, SAP announced that Microsoft would use SuccessFactors for its human resources needs.\nAs the cloud vendors scrap over customers, expect more such deals between major software suppliers. AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google googl Cloud Platform, and IBM ibm SoftLayer all would love to be a one-stop shop for the software applications and infrastructure for big companies.",

      "text": "View on Amazon If you're tired of Samsung, the OnePlus 3 is a worthy 5.5-inch flagship that's sold unlocked. Read Greenbot's full review \n“Isn’t there anything good between those cheap $300-or-less phones and ultra-premium $700 phones?” you ask. Why yes, indeed there is. Phones that are sold primarily direct-to-consumer without carrier interference (or bloatware) belong to one of the fastest-growing segments. There are lots of exciting, quality phones in the $300 to $500 range that you won’t necessarily find in your local carrier store. \nOnePlus is the king of the “high specs for a low price” game. Its latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 3, delivers exceptional value. It’s got a Snapdragon 820 system-on-chip, a whopping 6 gigs of RAM, and 64 gigabytes of storage. Unlike past OnePlus models, it’s also got NFC. The OnePlus 3 also boasts a 1080p AMOLED display, and really good front and rear facing cameras. This USB-C phone also delivers super-fast charging, and has a very attractive metal casing. All this for only $399, and no carrier bloatware? That’s a good deal. \nUnfortunately, Verizon and Sprint customers need not apply. The 4G LTE bands supported by the OnePlus 3 don’t include band 13 (Verizon’s main band), nor 25, 26, or 41 (Sprint’s bands). But if you’re on AT&T, T-Mobile, or any of the MVNOs that piggyback off their networks, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a phone that gives you more bang for the buck. How we test Android phones \nFirst and foremost, we spend at least several days with the phone under review, treating it as if it were our one and only. No number of lab tests or benchmarks will tell you as much about a phone as living with it for awhile. We’re concerned with real-world performance, stability, interface usability, camera quality, and whether proprietary features are useful or cumbersome. We use social media, check email, play games, take photos and videos in a variety of conditions, navigate around town, and do all the things most people do with their phones. \nWe run a suite of benchmarks, but what matters most is the overall experience. \nOf course, we also run extensive benchmarks: 3DMark (both Ice Storm Unlimited and Sling Shot), PCMark, GFXBench, AnTuTu, Geekbench, and Vellamo. We run all our tests with the phone set up the way it would be out of the box, without disabling any pre-installed apps or services. We do, however, make efforts to make sure benchmarks are not interrupted by notifications and that background downloads aren’t taking place. We may not report results from all of these tests (real-world everyday performance is far more important than benchmarks), but we do share the most interesting results. \nBefore running each benchmark, we make sure the phone is charged to 100 percent, plugged in, and left to cool off. Phones can sometimes run slower as their batteries get low, and charging the phone can make it hot and cause the SoC to slow down. So we do our best to make sure every test starts with the phone topped off and at room temperature. \nWhen we run battery benchmarks (PCMark and Geekbench), we calibrate the display to 200 nits and disable all auto-brightness and screen-dimming features. Display brightness plays a major role in draining your battery, and we want to create a level playing field. Of course, we also keep a close eye on how long the battery lasts in our everyday use, including screen-on time, standby time, and even how fast the battery charges with the included charger. What to look for in a phone \nSmartphones are very personal. Everyone has different needs, a unique budget, and personal preferences. You might need to access secure corporate email and documents with a phone that works on lots of networks around the world. Or you might spend all your time chronicling your life on Snapchat. \nThat said, there are major features of all smartphones that you should compare before making a purchase decision. \nDisplay: A good display has a high resolution (1920x1080 for smaller phones, 2650x1440 for larger phones), so that you can read fine text without it becoming blurry or illegible. A high-resolution display is especially important for VR. You want a display that accurately displays colors when looking at it from any angle, and a high contrast ratio and maximum brightness will make it easier to see in bright sunlight. Florence Ion \nSamsung leads the pack for display quality. \nCamera: Smartphone vendors like to tout camera specs like megapixels and aperture, but a high resolution and wide aperture (low f-stop number like f/1.8) only get you so far. The particulars of the sensor, image processing chip, and camera software have a huge impact on the photo- and video-taking experience. \nYou want a camera that launches quickly, focuses in an instant, and has no lag between when you hit the shutter button and the photo is taken. A great phone camera produces shots with accurate colors and little noise in lots of different environments. If you take selfies, pay particular attention to the quality of the front-facing camera. Finally, we love manual camera controls, and reward phones that deliver manual fine tuning. \nProcessor and memory: Most modern phones are “fast enough” for common tasks like web browsing and social media. You don’t always need a super high-end processor and tons of RAM unless you plan to use your phone for more taxing activities like 3D gaming, VR, or video editing. Still, don’t settle for less than 2GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600-series processor or better. \nBattery: Every time they poll users about what they want out of their next smartphone, “better battery life” is at the top of the list. The capacity of a smartphone battery is measured in milliamp-hours (mAh), and ranges from just under 2,000 mAh to over 4,000 mAh. Phones with bigger, brighter displays and more powerful processors drain the battery more quickly, though, so a smaller and less-expensive phone with a 2,500 mAh battery might actually last longer than a big high-end phone with a 2,800 mAh battery. Still, as a rule of thumb, more mAh is better. \nYou want a phone with a big battery. In general, the higher the mAh rating, the better. \nSize and weight: Some people love big phones. Some love smaller phones. Some want a lightweight phone that disappears in the pocket, while others need to feel some heft. It’s a matter of personal preference. Don’t assume that you won’t like large phones if you have small hands, however. There seems to be no real correlation between hand size and preferred phone size. \nSoftware and Bloatware: If you want a phone that runs pure Android with no embellishments, you need to buy a Nexus model. Anything else you buy is going to have a custom build of Android; and that could be good or bad (or both at once). \nPhone makers change the Android interface and icons to varying degree, and add features and software of their own. Sometimes this stuff is useful, sometimes it isn’t. Pre-installed apps that can’t be removed (usually called “bloatware”) can slow down your phone or, at the very least, take up valuable storage space. And if you buy a phone from a carrier instead of an unlocked carrier-neutral model, you’ll probably find a bunch of carrier apps you may not want. Know what you’re getting into before you buy. Our latest phone reviews \nIs there a phone you’re interested in, but don’t see it recommended as one of our top picks? That’s fine—different users have different needs and preferences. Maybe another model is the best one for you . Take a look at our latest reviews to see what else is out there. At a Glance",

      "text": "Amazon Web Services used to be the public cloud of choice for scrappy cash-strapped startups. Small companies liked that they could buy (or rent) computer servers, networking, and storage as needed, typically with a credit card.\nTiny companies are unlikely to spend much on VMware vmw data center software or Workday wday human resource and financial applications. And yet at this week’s AWS Re:Invent tech conference in Las Vegas, VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger and Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri will share the stage with AWS CEO Andy Jassy.\nThat shows that not only does Amazon amzn want to sell its data center servers and storage to big customers, but to the software providers that also sell to those customers. It wants to supply the suppliers as well as the suppliers’ customers. Towards that end, Amazon is well into year six of a push for big business customers . There have been signs of traction already: General Electric , an AWS customer, has been a presence at this conference for a few years now, and companies don’t get much bigger than that.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter\nJust a few weeks ago, AWS and VMware, once bitter rivals, agreed to work together to make VMware vSphere available on AWS so that joint customers could take the same software packages that now run on their own servers over to the Amazon cloud. Last spring, Salesforce crm , which sells customer management and sales software to big companies, committed to spending $400 million over four years to host new software on AWS rather than in its own data centers.\nThat traction results from a concerted effort Amazon management over the past four or five years to convince businesses in the financial services, healthcare, and government that running on shared public cloud infrastructure meets their security and other requirements.\nAnd now the battle is on as AWS, Microsoft , IBM , Google fight to win big business accounts (and the software vendors selling into those accounts) for their respective clouds.\nSome examples:\nMicrosoft msft recently signed up SAP sap SuccessFactors for its Microsoft Azure cloud. Meanwhile, AWS bragged about landing Salesforce as a big customer earlier this year. IBM , Amazon, and Hewlett Packard (before last year’s Hewlett-Packard Enterprise hpe split from Hewlett-Packard Inc. publicized that Workday used its cloud.\nAs an interesting aside, many of these deals smack of mutual back scratching. Does Salesforce’s commitment to spending $400 million on AWS infrastructure over the next four years have anything to do with Amazon signing a deal to give its employees access to all of Salesforce’s products?\nFor more on AWS, watch:\nThe Microsoft-SAP deal has a similar back story. In October, Microsoft proclaimed that SAP’s SuccessFactors human resources software would be available on its Azure as well as SAP’s own infrastructure. Less than a month later, SAP announced that Microsoft would use SuccessFactors for its human resources needs.\nAs the cloud vendors scrap over customers, expect more such deals between major software suppliers. AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google googl Cloud Platform, and IBM ibm SoftLayer all would love to be a one-stop shop for the software applications and infrastructure for big companies.",

      "title": "Amazon's \"The Grand Tour\" With Jeremy Clarkson Breaks a Record",
      "text": "Image source: Getty Images.\nAmazon.com 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) The Grand Tour represents a major victory in the company's bid to rival Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) in the online streaming space . The first episode of the car-focused program led by former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James Hammond, and Richard May delivered record-setting viewership on the Prime Video platform and enticed lots of people into signing up for Amazon's Prime service.\nThe Grand Tour is a landmark release that is furthering the company's online content and international expansion ambitions, and appears to be making good on its blockbuster budget, rumored to be in the neighborhood of $250 million for three seasons of the show.\nAmazon's streaming content push shifts into high gear The first episode of The Grand Tour , launched on Nov. 18, was streamed by millions of Prime accounts in America, the U.K., Germany, and Japan, according to Amazon. British internet service provider TalkTalk said it recently added 200 gigabytes per second of data capacity to its network to account for increased Prime Video streaming, with half of that amount being needed just to accommodate viewership of the recently released auto show.\nAmazon did not give specific numbers, but said viewership of the first episode \"exceeded that of the previous number one show, The Man in The High Castle .\" The first The Grand Tour episode won raves, though the second episode apparently left viewers divided.\nThe series debut also spurred the second-biggest sales day for Prime subscriptions of the year, trailing only the company's Prime Day. Getting users on board with its subscription service is one of the core components of Amazon's broader strategy, and the company is making big investments in original content production in order to grow membership. Prime subscribers spend an estimated 2.4 times more than non-members through the company's online store, and while investment in video and features like two-day shipping are tamping down earnings, they're helping Amazon bring users into the company's ecosystem and building powerful advantages over other retailers.\nThat explains why the company was willing to discount the $99 annual cost of Prime membership by $20, and 20 pounds in the U.K., on the day of The Grand Tour 's debut. Even with a steep discount reducing the money Amazon will make, Amazon is counting on the long-term benefits of reaching an even more subscribers more than making up for what it's passing up in the short term.\nThe amount that Amazon paid to secure three seasons of The Grand Tour was recently said to be $250 million by Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos. Netflix has the streaming rights to Top Gear , and the company didn't think that the follow-up show from Clarkson, Hammond, and May made sense at a quarter-billion-dollar price. The decision not to pursue a show at that price points to an advantage that its rival has in online content production. Amazon can afford to spend more on original shows and rights acquisitions because the benefits created by adding such a landmark show extend beyond adding new streaming customers.\nThe Grand Tour could fast-track Amazon's international growth Amazon's last quarter saw its international segment account for roughly 36% of its retail business. While North American segment revenue grew 28% in the quarter, sales from other territories grew more modestly at roughly 7%. America and Canada account for just around 5% of the global population. Amazon has tremendous room for growth in overseas markets, and -- if The Grand Tour lives up to its promise -- Amazon could be set to capitalize on one of the hottest properties in streaming content to get more people to become Prime members.\nThe Clarkson, Hammond, and May iteration of Top Gear had an estimated global viewer base of 350 million people, wa broadcast in 212 countries, and held the Guinness world record for most widely watched factual television program. It seems clear the trio have brought much of their previous show's appeal to Amazon's The Grand Tour and there's good reason to expect an overall fantastic global reception and a significant boost to Prime subscription numbers after the company brings the series to over 200 new countries in December.\nIf that proves to be the case, Amazon's sizable investment in the show will pay off in a big way.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago \nAmazon's digital assistant, Alexa, debuted on the company's Echo home speaker hub , and it's recently been made available on some of its Fire tablets too . But now, Amazon is also said to be working on a 'premium Echo-like speaker' that also has a screen. \nAccording to Bloomberg , citing unnamed sources, the new device will have a touchscreen around seven inches in size, in order \"to make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news\". The device is supposedly intended for use in kitchens, and its display will reportedly \"tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing\". \nThe description makes the device sound an awful lot like an Amazon Fire tablet bolted to an Echo speaker; in fact, the report also states that it will use the same Fire OS that comes on its tablets, albeit with certain 'optimizations'. Like the Echo, the device will still respond to voice commands and enquiries, but its display will offer features like 'pinning' items such as photos and notes to the home screen, in the same way that you might do so on the door of your refrigerator. \nIt's said to feature improved speakers compared with the existing Echo, capable of playing \"high-quality audio at all volume levels\". Along with the touchscreen, that will enable Amazon to attach a higher price tag to the device compared with its existing Alexa devices, although an exact price has not yet revealed. \nAmazon is expected to unveil the new tablet",

      "text": "Unlocked LeEco Le Pro3 And Le S3 To Hit Amazon, Best Buy And Target On Dec. 1 30 November 2016, 8:59 am EST By Sumit Passary Tech Times LeEco's Le Pro 3 and Le S3 smartphones will be available in the United States via Amazon, Best Buy, Target and the company's own website. Both handsets pack in impressive features that could impress many customers this holiday season. ( LeEco ) Advertisement \nChinese smartphone maker LeEco has confirmed that the company's new phones Le Pro3 and Le S3 will be available in the United States via a number of retailers starting Dec. 1. \nLeEco's foray in the U.S. market was delayed because of financial issues. However, on Tuesday, Nov. 29 the company announced that its new products will be available in the United States via Amazon, Best Buy and Target. \n\"We continue to bring to life our vision of a connected ecosystem that puts content at the center of the experience. With today's announcements, we are making our premium products and the best content even more accessible,\" said Danny Bowman, chief revenue officer for LeEco North America. \"We've had tremendous success with our direct-to-consumer e-commerce site, LeMall.com, but we're thrilled to be working with the top retailers to make our products more accessible.\" LeEco Le Pro3 \nThe handset boasts a 5.5-inch IPS LCD screen with a display resolution of 1,080 x 1,920 pixels. Under the hood are a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and Adreno 530 GPU. \nThe Le Pro3 is available with 32 GB / 64 GB internal storage and 4 GB of RAM or 64 GB / 128 GB on-board storage and 6 GB RAM. The LeMall only has the 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage option. \nThe mobile phone is equipped with a 16-megapixel (f/2.0 lens) primary camera and an 8-megapixel (f/2.2 lens) selfie camera. \n\"Aspiring filmmakers will love the 4K UHD video capture and upscale effects, including slow-motion,\" says LeEco. \nThe Le Pro3 includes a 4,070 mAh battery that offers up to 318 hours of standby time on 4G. The smartphone runs on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Le S3 \nThe Le S3 has the same screen size and resolution as the Le Pro3. The camera specifications of the Le S3 are also identical to the Le Pro3. However, the Le S3 smartphone includes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, Adreno 510 graphics card, 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. \nThe Le S3 also comes running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow straight out of the box. The mobile phone includes a smaller 3,000 mAh battery. Free DirecTV Access \nLeEco has also confirmed that customers who purchase the unlocked Le Pro3 or the Le S3 from Amazon , Best Buy , Target or LeMall between Nov. 29 and Jan. 5 will also get free access to DirecTV Now for three months. \nIt is worth noting that the Le Pro3 and the Le S3 are not compatible with CDMA networks, which means customers will not be able to use these phones on Verizon or Sprint in the United States.

      "text": "Technology News | Wed Nov 30, 2016 | 9:33am EST Amazon looking to convert Italy power stations into data centers Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo By Giulia Segreti and Stephen Jewkes | MILAN \nMILAN Amazon is in talks with utility Enel over the conversion of old power stations in north and central Italy into data centers as it seeks to expand its lucrative cloud services business in the country. \nAn Enel spokeswoman said on Wednesday there had been contacts with the U.S. online retailer while a source close to the matter said a deal could be closed in coming months. \nAmazon is market leader in the global cloud infrastructure services sector. In the third quarter of 2016, its cloud business grew sales by 55 percent from a year earlier. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud services unit, recently announced it would open data centers in the Paris region, after investing in Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom. \nIt will spend up to 1 billion euros ($1.06 billion) to convert plants in Italy, the source said, adding the investment was in line with other data hub deals it had done in Europe. \nAWS's interest in Italy comes as Enel, Europe's biggest utility in terms of capacity is shutting down old plants as part of a strategy to shift its focus to grids, renewable energy and retail business, especially in emerging markets. \nEnel invited parties interested in taking on the sites to present projects on how to use them. Two sale processes were now in an advanced stage, it said last week, giving no details. \nAmazon has invested over 450 million euros in Italy since setting up shop in 2010 and employs 1,700 people. In July it announced it would build a major storage and logistics center outside Rome. \nPrime Minister Matteo Renzi has been striving since coming to office in 2014 to attract foreign investors to help kick start Italy's sluggish economy. He has staked his political future on a constitutional reform referendum in December, aimed at creating stable government and streamlining law-making. \nState-controlled Enel said last year it was scrapping 23 thermal power stations in Italy with a total capacity of 13 gigawatts to meet falling power demand and changing business patterns as green energy replaces fossil fuel generation. \nThe source said talks between Amazon and Enel focus on three to five sites, all in the north of Italy, including the plants of Trino, in the north-western region of Piedmont, and La Casella, close to the northern town of Piacenza. \nA second source familiar with the matter said negotiations involved three sites, including La Casella. \"The plant is not among the 23 plants being decommissioned but Amazon has asked for a piece of land there.\" \nAmazon has its main Italian distribution center employing 1,000 workers on the outskirts of Piacenza. \nIndustry Ministry undersecretary Paola De Micheli told parliament last Thursday Amazon was looking into converting three Enel sites, adding the utility could help make the technology company's power consumption more efficient. \n($1 = 0.9405 euros)",

      "text": "Tweet \nHoliday sales from Black Friday and Cyber Monday could very well help Amazon hit its target of $134 billion in annual sales, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) could make up for $12 billion of it \nThe company began offering web services to its customers over 10 years ago and in recent years this division has grown from a small to significant portion of the online retailer's business. AWS currently operates in 38 availability zones within 14 geographic locations and large companies such as Netflix, Adobe and Spotify have turned to the company for hosting and operating their websites and services. \nAndy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, explains in a recent interview that AWS might possibly become the largest part of Amazon one day, saying: \"It would likely take time. But I do think it’s possible that in the fullness of time AWS could be the largest business in Amazon. Part of that is because, if you look at the market segments AWS addresses -- infrastructure software, hardware, data center services, plus some capability to build further up stack as well -- that’s trillions of dollars worldwide. It’s a very large opportunity and we’re very optimistic about where AWS will be in the long term\". \nAmazon's cloud platform has grown tremendously over the past few years, with a recent study revealing that AWS now accounts for a larger portion of the IaaS market than that of Microsoft, Google and IBM combined. \nAs public cloud services continue to increase in popularity and importance, AWS could be well positioned to dominate the market for some time to come. \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

      "title": "Amazon Wants to Turn Old Italian Power Stations Into Data Centers",
      "text": "Amazon is in talks with utility Enel over the conversion of old power stations in north and central Italy into data centers as it seeks to expand its lucrative cloud services business in the country. \nAn Enel spokeswoman said on Wednesday there had been contacts with the U.S. online retailer, while a source close to the matter said a deal could be closed in coming months. \nAmazon amzn is the market leader in the global cloud infrastructure services sector. In the third quarter of 2016, its cloud business grew sales by 55% from a year earlier. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud services unit, recently announced it would open data centers in the Paris region, after investing in Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom. \nIt will spend up to 1 billion euros ($1.06 billion) to convert plants in Italy, the source said, adding the investment was in line with other data hub deals it had done in Europe. \nAWS’s interest in Italy comes as Enel enel , Europe’s biggest utility in terms of capacity, is shutting down old plants as part of a strategy to shift its focus to grids, renewable energy and retail business, especially in emerging markets. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nEnel invited parties interested in taking on the sites to present projects on how to use them. Two sale processes are now in an advanced stage, it said last week, giving no details. \nAmazon has invested over 450 million euros in Italy since setting up shop in 2010 and employs 1,700 people. In July, the company announced it would build a major storage and logistics center outside Rome. \nPrime Minister Matteo Renzi has been striving since coming to office in 2014 to attract foreign investors to help kick-start Italy’s sluggish economy. He has staked his political future on a constitutional reform referendum in December, aimed at creating a stable government and streamlining law-making. \nState-controlled Enel said last year it was scrapping 23 thermal power stations in Italy with a total capacity of 13 gigawatts to meet falling power demand and changing business patterns as green energy replaces fossil fuel generation. \nThe source said talks between Amazon and Enel focus on three to five sites, all in the north of Italy, including the plants of Trino, in the north-western region of Piedmont, and La Casella, close to the northern town of Piacenza. \nA second source familiar with the matter said negotiations involved three sites, including La Casella. “The plant is not among the 23 plants being decommissioned but Amazon has asked for a piece of land there.” \n\nAmazon has its main Italian distribution center employing 1,000 workers on the outskirts of Piacenza. \nIndustry Ministry undersecretary Paola De Micheli told parliament last Thursday Amazon was looking into converting three Enel sites, adding the utility could help make the technology company’s power consumption more efficient.

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Andy Jassy, a 19-year Amazon veteran, is arguably the most powerful man in the cloud.\nHe heads Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division that drives much of Amazon.com's profitability and that dwarfs most competitors, including ventures by crosstown rival Microsoft and search giant Google. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who calls AWS a \"pillar,\" earlier this year upgraded Jassy's title to division \"CEO.\"\nIn an interview with The Seattle Times, Jassy said that AWS could one day evolve to become an even bigger business for Seattle-based Amazon than e-commerce because it's addressing markets potentially worth \"trillions of dollars worldwide.\" But a spinoff is unlikely because there's \"no compelling reason\" to do so, the executive said.\nJassy's comments come before re: Invent, AWS' annual mammoth Las Vegas conference, which runs through Friday.\nMore than 32,000 are expected to attend, reflecting, in Jassy's words, the growing \"movement\" of builders embracing the possibilities of the cloud. \"It is palpable when you're there,\" he says.\nHere's an edited excerpt of the conversation.\nQ: AWS has evolved into a $12 billion business in a decade. Why did it grow so quickly so fast? Was that growth a surprise?\nA: I don't think any of us had the audacity to predict it would grow to be that big when we were starting it.\nBefore, companies and startups had to lay up all this capital for data centers and servers, and take your scarce resource, which in most companies is engineers, and have them work on the undifferentiated heavy lifting of infrastructure.\nWhat the cloud has done is completely flipped that model on its head so that you only pay for what you consume. You're able to get work done so much faster than ever before.\nStartups and smaller companies got that revolution started, but we always expected large enterprises and government agencies to be very large AWS companies, because they have very large amounts of infrastructure to spend.\nQ: Where is AWS now? Where is it going next?\nA: We have a pretty significant market-leadership position, and we're not close to being done delivering capabilities for our customers.\nWe have a very broad geographic footprint, but we're not close to being done. Over time we can expect we'll have an AWS \"region\" (a cluster of data centers) in practically every Tier 1 country and a lot of developing countries as well.\nWe have a machine-learning service that we launched about a year and a half ago, and there are a lot of artificial intelligence (AI) machine-learning capabilities coming. We have a large number of people working in AI.\nIf you look around homes and the workplace, there are all these sensors in many devices. This is what people commonly call the Internet of Things.\nThese sensors have a small amount of (computing power) and memory. Which means the cloud becomes disproportionately important to supplement their capabilities. Most of the big IoT cases today are built on top of AWS.\nWe are at the start of what we think is possible. Over time, many enterprises are going to think about their own infrastructure as servers and also as devices they use to collect data, do analytics and take action back on these devices. So that's another area of significant investment for us.\nQ: What are the biggest bottlenecks you're seeing?\nA: There are only 24 hours in the day. There is so much that we're doing simultaneously. We're going to launch 1,000 significant services or features this year.\nWe are hiring so many people all over the world and we have a very high hiring bar. We're not willing to compromise in order to make sure we have the right quality of folks. That always takes a fair quality of focus and work from the team.\nQ: How do you see the competition? Who keeps you up at night?\nProbably the single biggest surprise is just how long it took for other large technology companies to build an offering here. I don't think any of us believed, in our wildest dreams, that we would have a six-year head start.\nIt's not a surprise to us that every large technology company is trying to build an offering like AWS' because it's such a good value proposition for customers. But the offerings and the platforms are in very different spots today.\nAWS has a lot more capability and functionality than anybody else by a large margin, and is also iterating at a faster clip than anybody else. We have an impression we use internally: There's no compression algorithm for experience.\nQ: Tell us about re: Invent.\nA: Re: Invent is different from the typical technology-industry conference in that it's not a sales and marketing event, but about learning and education. We will have 400 different sessions on virtually every imaginable topic in the cloud.\nThe first year (2012), we weren't sure we could get 4,000 people to go. We'll have 32,000 people there. It's a lot of fun, there's a lot of community, we'll probably have some announcements there as well.\nThere's a kind of a movement around the cloud. It is palpable when you're there.\nQ: What are your thoughts on \"moving up the stack\" (offering clients more sophisticated applications beyond storage and computing power)?\nYou'll increasingly see us build services a little bit further up the stack. The ones we choose to add are the ones our customers tell us they'd like us to build.\nThe vast majority of applications that are really having success in the market today are run by AWS partners. We have a very large ecosystem of partners that cover the gauntlet of applications that our customers love using.\nQ: Will AWS become the largest business within Amazon?\nA: If it came to pass, it would likely take time. But I do think it's possible that in the fullness of time AWS could be the largest business in Amazon.\nPart of that is because, if you look at the market segments AWS addresses -- infrastructure software, hardware, data center services, plus some capability to build further up stack as well -- that's trillions of dollars worldwide.\nIt's a very large opportunity and we're very optimistic about where AWS will be in the long term.\nQ: Could AWS operate as a company separate from Amazon?\nA: AWS has always functioned as an independent, separable business distinct from (Amazon's retail unit): a different customer base, a different leadership team. Amazon, the retailer, is a really important customer of AWS', but they're really one of several, very important customers.\nOne of the reasons why Netflix, (which) competes so aggressively with Amazon the retailer, is all in on top of AWS is because Net­flix knows and has seen that they're every bit as important to AWS as Amazon the retailer is.\nI'll never say never about anything, I've learned that in my time here. But I don't anticipate that we'll spin AWS out largely because there's no compelling reason to do so. Amazon has been so generous and so gracious in funding AWS for whatever investment needs required that there is really no compelling reason to do so.\nQ: Has AWS' culture had to change much in order to better serve enterprise customers? Over the last five or six years we've had to build out a really strong enterprise and public-sector capability.\nA: But what enterprises have come to appreciate is that the culture is really different. We're unusually customer-focused. We're pioneers.\nMost large technology companies have lost their will and their DNA to invent. They acquire most of their innovation. We like to hire builders that look at customer experiences as flawed and figure out how to reinvent those.\nAlso, we're unusually long-term-oriented. You won't see our folks show up at customers' doors the day before the end of the quarter, or the day before the end of the year and try to harass them into a sale not to be seen again for a year. We're trying to build relationships and business that outlast all of us in this room.\nQ: Has the new CEO title changed things for you?\nA: No. It's all the same.\nQ: What about corporate succession at the top?\nA: We're really incredibly fortunate to have a leader as strong as Jeff (Bezos). I've been at the company now for 19 1/2 years and I will tell you that Jeff has at least as much energy and passion for the business as he did when I started in 1997.\nJeff will be running the business for a very, very long time. We're lucky that he will.\nAndy Jassy\nTitle: CEO, Amazon Web Services\nAge: 48\nEducation: Bachelor's degree and an MBA from Harvard\nBack story: Part of Amazon.com's senior executive team since 2002. Joined the company in 1997. Conceived the company's entry into the music business, was director of marketing, served as technical assistant to CEO Jeff Bezos, and in 2006 launched AWS, the largest computing cloud business in the world.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

      "text": "By Stephen Eisenhammer | November 30 2016 \n(Reuters) The rainforest shook with the sound of exploding tires and groaning steel as flames tore through a truck carrying giant tree trunks illegally sawn from the Amazon. \nAn agent of Brazil’s environment police had, moments earlier, ordered the driver from his cab at gun point. In a scuffed blue cap and muddied jeans, the 25-year-old fought back tears as he learned his truck would be set alight right there. \nHe walked away rather than watch it burn. \nWhen able to do their job, agents of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, are decisive, punishing illegal loggers on the spot. \nBut this seizure was the only success in four days of operations this month near the town of Novo Progresso in Brazil’s vast northern state of Para. \nHampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognised by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows. \n“The loggers are better equipped than we are,” said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama’s head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. “Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won’t be able to work.” \nNearly twice the size of India, the Amazon absorbs an estimated 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, making its preservation vital in the fight to halt global warming. \nIbama, responsible for preserving Brazil’s 65 percent share of the world’s largest rainforest, is one of the most important groups in that fight. But after years of surprising success, the rate of deforestation is on the rise again. \nOver the past four years it has risen 35 percent, as Ibama suffered from a lack of funding amid Brazil’s worst recession in decades. \nLast year, rainforest five times the size of Los Angeles was cut down. \nLeaders from nearly 200 different countries met in Morocco this month to move forward on commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, amid concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump might cut funding for the deal signed in Paris last year. \nHere, in the badlands of rural Para, the challenges to those commitments are all too clear. \nA 30 percent cut in Ibama’s budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n“We haven’t even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,” said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60). \nIt is dangerous work. In June, a policeman was shot dead during an Ibama operation in Novo Progresso, a grid of dirt streets whose 25,000 inhabitants rely on illegal mining and logging for survival. \nCorruption is also a problem. Three Ibama officials in Santarem were charged last month for taking bribes from logging companies. \n“I only trust around half the people I work with,” Barroso said. \nNEW STRATEGY \nBrazil’s environment ministry admits a lack of funds has reduced Ibama’s ability to operate. \nThe situation should be helped by 56 million reais secured from the Fundo Amazonia, a fund principally financed by Norway and Germany. \nBut officials say a broader strategic change is also needed. \n“The effectiveness of our current measures and enforcement has reached its limit,” said Everton Lucero, the government’s undersecretary for climate change. \nUntil four years ago, the approach proved highly effective. \nIbama helped to reduce the rate of deforestation by over 80 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nA mix of satellite imagery and a tough on-the-ground presence made Ibama a highly effective force in the fight against global warming. \nNow, there is a sense that Brazil’s target of zero deforestation by 2030 will not simply be achieved with more 4x4s and semiautomatic rifles. \nA carrot is needed alongside the stick, officials say. \nOne option being discussed with other ministries, according to Lucero, is to create economic incentives for landowners and communities to preserve their forests. He said details on how this would work were still being finalised. \nPIONEERS \nPersuading towns like Novo Progresso to preserve the rainforest means transforming their culture and economy. \nIt lies on the BR-163 highway that runs north-to-south through the rainforest to join frontier farms with ports in the southeast. \nEnvironmental groups estimate 60 percent of Brazil’s Amazonian deforestation happens along this stretch. \nNovo Progresso was one of many towns founded during Brazil’s drive deep into the Amazon during the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \nThen, cutting down the Amazon to construct roads and towns was patriotic, a means of securing Brazil’s borders. Many also got rich in the process. \nJose Carlos Rovaris, 62, bought his land near Novo Progresso in 1984, leaving his home in the southern state of Santa Catarina for a new life on the forest frontier. \n“This was all trees when I arrived,” he said, his belly protruding from a scrubby polo shirt as he moved his arm across the land now planted with soy as far as the eye can see. “I cut it down bit by bit, every year a little more.” \nThe impact of those pioneers is staggering. \nIn 1933, British explorer Peter Fleming described neighbouring Mato Grosso state as “huge tracts of jungle which no white man has even attempted to enter.” \nNow, it is Brazil’s largest soy producer. Its transformation from jungle to agricultural heartland helped make Brazil the world’s largest exporter of beef and soy. \nWith that has come increased power in Congress and environmentalists fear President Michel Temer’s government will bow to pressure to ease environmental licensing laws as it aims to rekindle economic growth. \nThe transition from forest to farmland is a devastating double blow for the environment. Trees absorbing CO2 are commonly replaced with methane polluting cattle. \nNO JOBS \nIbama operates on the limits of a law its agents regard as too soft. \nBurning trucks is the most effective deterrent in their arsenal. They do this if the vehicle is on protected land inhabited by indigenous groups or if the truck cannot be removed because the driver has fled or the vehicle is damaged. \nBut those caught cutting down the rainforest never see the inside of a jail cell unless convicted of a more serious, related crime such as money laundering or violence. \nMany in Novo Progresso see no other way to get by. \n“There is nothing else,” said Elis Pereira, 25, at the Ibama office after his truck was burned. Sleep-deprived and famished after days in the forest waiting for the rain to pass, he said the fine and loss of his truck meant he would be “pushed into crime.” \nWith no new land legally available and farming so mechanized it requires little labour, Pereira is part of a generation growing up in towns like Novo Progresso with scant job prospects. Unless a sustainable source of employment can be created, deforestation is unlikely to stop. \nPereira’s future looks bleak. He bought the truck that is now charred steel for 60,000 reais just six weeks ago. That money was borrowed from the illegal loggers for whom he worked transporting timber. \n“I’ll have to let them know,” he said, eyes vacant with exhaustion and fear. “I hope they understand.” \nClick on reut.rs/2fsKzRB to see a related photo essay Topics",

Dick’s Hugo Award-winning 1962 alternate history novel. \nRoot, whose credits include the likes of Selma , Trumbo , Boardwalk Empire and Office Space , is set to make his debut in the second season of the show, where he’ll play the mysterious figure tied to the Resistance movement who collects the enigmatic films that seem to depict alternate versions of reality. Check out a clip of his character in action here… \nSEE ALSO: New trailer for season 2 of The Man in the High Castle \nThe Man in the High Castle stars Alexa Davalos, Rupert Evans, Luke Kleintank, DJ Qualls, Joel de la Fuente, Brennan Brown, Bella Heathcote, Callum Keith Rennie, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Rufus Sewell, and is executive produced by David Zucker and Isa Dick Hackett. Season two resumes with Juliana Crain (Davalos) facing the consequences of her decision to betray the Resistance and allow Joe Blake (Kleintank), a suspected Nazi agent, to escape the Pacific States with a film originally bound for the Man in the High Castle. Joe himself returns a hero to the Reich and finds himself thrust into the Nazi capital of Berlin, face to face with the father who abandoned him. Meanwhile, Frank Frink (Rupert Evans) becomes increasingly radicalised and drawn further into the resistance after seeing images of his own execution in the mysterious films. \nWith political tensions mounting between Germany and Japan, Trade Minister Tagomi (Tagawa) begins to regret his success in smuggling nuclear technology from the Reich and seeks solace in the strange new world he discovered at the end of season one. Meanwhile, Obergruppenführer John Smith (Sewell) struggles to reconcile the values of the Reich with the deteriorating health of his son— all while tasked with a mission from the Fuhrer for which failure is not an option. And Chief Inspector Kido (De La Fuente) begins to take greater interest in the Man in the High Castle, the films, and how Juliana Crain is connected to it all. \nSeason two of The Man in the High Castle hits Amazon Prime on December 16th.

      "text": "svenska Eseye Launches Breakthrough in IoT Security with Amazon Web Services Seamless, Over-the-Air IoT connectivity and Secure Provisioning for AWS Cloud Customers Launched on Stage at Re:Invent, Las Vegas  26   NEW YORK , Nov.   Eseye and Amazon Web Services today announced the launch of a breakthrough in IoT Security, AnyNet Secure™. Eseye, a leading global cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity provider for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, saw the culmination of many months working with AWS at the global corporation's Re:Invent convention in Las Vegas . Demonstrated live onstage, the new Eseye AnyNet Secure™ SIM was introduced as a new cellular connectivity solution integrated fully with the AWS Cloud management console and Cloud platform. AnyNet Secure provides AWS IoT customers with enhanced security and connectivity features that enables IoT devices across the globe to remotely, automatically and securely activate, provision, authenticate and certify 'things', over-the-air, and to then ingest data into AWS customers' clouds. This innovative technology delivers several IoT breakthroughs. It launches devices or 'things' securely onto the global AWS Cloud network without the need for any physical configuration; no manual passwords or onsite intervention is required; and the need for the release of third party security keys to manufacturers is also now removed. The potential for a reduction in the risks and costs of IoT deployments for AWS customers are significant. Julian Hardy , CEO at Eseye, says: \"This new technology will ultimately allow more and varied products to go to market and to succeed by offering AWS customers the chance to take much of the cost, risk and time out of M2M IoT deployments. Collectively, we create a globally-available ubiquitous service layer through which projects can be deployed at scale, in a more secure manner and way that was previously impossible for customers. AnyNet Secure removes the need to make long-term sacrifices on security or go through a painstaking deployment process of manual intervention, one device at a time.\" The new 'plug-and-play' or 'zero touch' SIM delivers increased efficiency thanks to its simple installation and remote management. Through the multi-IMSI technology embedded within the solution, the SIM allows organizations to deploy almost anywhere in the world, while establishing more robust levels of security.

      "title": "Amazon looking to convert Italy power stations into data centers",
      "text": "Related Content View Photo Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016. REUTERS/Kim …\n\nBy Giulia Segreti and Stephen Jewkes\nMILAN (Reuters) - Amazon is in talks with utility Enel over the conversion of old power stations in north and central Italy into data centers as it seeks to expand its lucrative cloud services business in the country.\nAn Enel spokeswoman said on Wednesday there had been contacts with the U.S. online retailer while a source close to the matter said a deal could be closed in coming months. \nAmazon is market leader in the global cloud infrastructure services sector. In the third quarter of 2016, its cloud business grew sales by 55 percent from a year earlier. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud services unit, recently announced it would open data centers in the Paris region, after investing in Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom. \nIt will spend up to 1 billion euros ($1.06 billion) to convert plants in Italy, the source said, adding the investment was in line with other data hub deals it had done in Europe.\nAWS's interest in Italy comes as Enel, Europe's biggest utility in terms of capacity is shutting down old plants as part of a strategy to shift its focus to grids, renewable energy and retail business, especially in emerging markets.\nEnel invited parties interested in taking on the sites to present projects on how to use them. Two sale processes were now in an advanced stage, it said last week, giving no details.\nAmazon has invested over 450 million euros in Italy since setting up shop in 2010 and employs 1,700 people. In July it announced it would build a major storage and logistics center outside Rome. \nPrime Minister Matteo Renzi has been striving since coming to office in 2014 to attract foreign investors to help kick start Italy's sluggish economy. He has staked his political future on a constitutional reform referendum in December, aimed at creating stable government and streamlining law-making.\nState-controlled Enel said last year it was scrapping 23 thermal power stations in Italy with a total capacity of 13 gigawatts to meet falling power demand and changing business patterns as green energy replaces fossil fuel generation.\nThe source said talks between Amazon and Enel focus on three to five sites, all in the north of Italy, including the plants of Trino, in the north-western region of Piedmont, and La Casella, close to the northern town of Piacenza.\nA second source familiar with the matter said negotiations involved three sites, including La Casella. \"The plant is not among the 23 plants being decommissioned but Amazon has asked for a piece of land there.\"\nAmazon has its main Italian distribution center employing 1,000 workers on the outskirts of Piacenza.\n\nIndustry Ministry undersecretary Paola De Micheli told parliament last Thursday Amazon was looking into converting three Enel sites, adding the utility could help make the technology company's power consumption more efficient. \n($1 = 0.9405 euros)\n\n(Editing by Alexandra Hudson)",

      "text": "Amazon Prime members beware... More than a third don't shop anywhere but Amazon & that can cost you more than $99 per year: Bottom Line: Amazon has without a doubt created a super smart model. Get people to subscribe to your website for $99 and get \"free shipping\". Now aside from shipping not being free, if you pay a hundred dollars a year for it, once you do buy the subscription – you certaint y want to make use of it. Amazon knows that too. Here are a couple of key findings about the online shopping habits of Prime members (according to research from Feedvisor ): 95% have purchased from Amazon.com this year at least once 61% have purchased from another online retailer this year So it's clear that the overwhelming majority of Prime customers s ubscribe for the shipping benefit (not the extras like streaming services). Secondly, you'll notice that 34% of all Prime members don’t shop anywhere else online. That's a potentially costly mistake. Each of the recent side by side comparisons of everyday items has reveal ed that Wal-Mart.com is typically a bit cheaper. In a related note... three purchases I made over the weekend were significantly cheaper ($190 over the course of three items I paid $91 total for) elsewhere. So if it's about ease of use – it may well be worth it to you. If you're concerned about getting the best prices consistently ... Amazon's Prime may well be the primrose path.

      "text": "November 29, 2016\nThis is an email that was sent to our VIP mailing list a few months back. Details on how to get on the VIP list is at the bottom of the article.\nGot a treat for you.\nI’ve got you listed as a reader on the “A” list email club which means, I’m sending you extra value emails that I won’t be posting anywhere else or sending to the rest of the group.\nBecause you’ve shown that you appreciate my emails, I want to return the favor by giving you special goodies.\nAnd here’s one.\nAn investment letter from Coho Capital . Jake Rosser is the managing partner but one heck of an investor.\nHis analysis is what helped me invest in Amerco (UHAL) and has been one of my big wins over the past couple of years.\nThis time, his latest letter is all about Amazon (AMZN).\nAnd I must say, I’m ashamed.\nBecause I blindly convinced myself that Amazon is a great company but a BAD stock.\nBut I read The Everything Store a month back and it was one heck of a read. You learn about the company and Jeff Bezos in a way you never will from the media.\nMy wife also sells her products through Amazon so I am very well versed in the Amazon system and what they do. With Old School Value, I use Amazon Web Services so I also have first hand experience of the vast array of products.\nBefore you read the thesis, Jake uses a Munger Quote: very effectively.\n“Over the long-term, it’s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold for that 40 years, you’re not going to make much different than a 6% return, even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you’ll end up with a fine result.” – Charlie Munger\nAnd after reading this letter, it’s made me want to buy Amazon at the right price.\nSummary of the Letter Amazon holds a 41% share of online commerce. The next largest competitor is Best Buy with a 2.7% share. And yet despite its dominant position, Amazon continues to grow faster than the competition – capturing 60% of total US online sales growth in 2015. 2015 Internet Retailer Market Share\nThis next image is a bit old, but it’s safe to say the margin has widened in 2016.\nAmazon’s Influence in Online Shopping\nWith Amazon’s domestic infrastructure largely in place, we expect margins within the company’s e-commerce segment to inflect materially higher as operating leverage continues to ramp. Amazon Prime is a cornerstone of Amazon’s growth strategy as Prime customers tend to spend more and embed themselves more deeply within the Amazon eco-system. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Prime members spend $1,100 a year compared to $600 for non-prime customers. For long-term Prime members, the numbers are even more compelling with those using the service for 7-10 years spending 8-10x more than non-Prime members. Close to 50% of the units sold on Amazon are from third parties (3P). Third party sales comprise Amazon’s Marketplace business where Amazon serves as the storefront but participating merchants are responsible for shipping, logistics and inventory management. Margins on 3P are higher than Amazon’s regular e-commerce business with merchants paying Amazon a royalty of up to 15% on sales. Apart from higher margins, Amazon Marketplace serves as a natural on-ramp to Fulfillment by Amazon (detailed later). Last year, Amazon broke out financial metrics for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business for the first time and the numbers were a revelation. AWS grew revenue 70% to $7.9B in 2015 and the division accounted for 83% of Amazon’s operating profit. This year AWS is on pace to surpass $10 billion in annual sales. If it were a stand-alone company, AWS would be the fastest to ever achieve $10 billion in revenue. Demand for FBA was so robust last year that Amazon incurred extra costs during last year’s holiday shopping season to rush-ship packages. In order to suppress demand, Amazon raised pricing on inventory storage fees by 213%. And this is what one comes to realize when studying Amazon: there is untapped pricing power everywhere. We believe Amazon is poised for a multi-decade period of excess economic returns. One can quibble with Amazon’s valuation on a 12-month basis but if one focuses on the long-term economic potential of its multiple platform businesses, future returns will send many toward happy retirements. At its core, Amazon is four operating segments with some of the most dominant moats in all of business. All four of these businesses are leveraged to multi-decade growth trends in cloud computing and e-commerce with reinvestment prospects as far as the eye can see. Each of these businesses possesses untapped pricing power, have sticky customer bases, and are poised for material margin expansion. To top it all off, the businesses are presided over by an owner-operator CEO focused on long-term free cash flow generation.

      "title": "Amazon’s Next Echo Suggests In-Home A.I. is Broken",
      "text": "NateSwanner Amazon Echo \nAmazon is reportedly set to bring a new-look Alexa to your living room. According to Bloomberg , the e-commerce giant will soon marry a touchscreen and voice-activated Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) in one device. It sounds amazing, but could signal something is missing from home-based A.I. as we know it. \nThe report indicates that Amazon is going to have a touch-capacitive screen (we don’t know what size; likely the footprint of a larger tablet) built right into some sort of Alexa-based device (round is probably out of the question with a touchscreen). Like the Echo, it’ll still respond to voice commands, but will also display information on the screen that users can interact with. \nYou may also be able to ‘pin’ widgets to it. Rather than asking for the weather report each morning, a simple glance at the screen would tell you it’s 45 degrees out – and that you should grab a coat. \nSources report the new device, which has an internal name of ‘Knight,’ will have premium speakers and “will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing.” \nAll told, that’s a smart home hub that seems to make a good bit of sense. Devices such as the Echo or Google Home try hard to be pretty, but their functionality is limited to voice commands and users listening carefully. It’s impressive, but ultimately not ideal. \nHaving text on a screen in addition to spoken feedback provides a more interactive and intuitive experience. Think of your phone: asking Siri or Google Assistant to do things like find you directions ultimately sends you to Maps, which is best experienced on-screen. Voice-only feedback would make Siri a backseat driver, and nobody likes that. \nSimilarly, querying Alexa for a recipe is best when there’s a screen handy that can keep the information surfaced for you. If the home hub is meant as a centerpiece of your living space, a screen makes sense. \nIt also opens Alexa up to more context, and offers scalability for hardware and software. It’s possible that you could ask Alexa to cobble together pictures form a recent vacation on-screen, eliminate the ones you don’t like, and stream the remaining as a slideshow – or cast them to a TV. The possibilities are almost endless. \nBut what we can glean from this potential move is that voice-only A.I. was only a first step for the home. On mobile, all major A.I. assistants use a screen to hand off more complex tasks. Google chose to ditch the screen for its own in-home assistant, likely to keep costs down, but added a touch capacitive surface for functions like volume control. (Siri is in your home via Apple TV, but it’s not quite the same experience.) \nIn their own ways, both Google and Apple followed Amazon down the home A.I. rabbit hole. Expect them to do the same with in-home screens, too. \nA touch-screen may give A.I. an avenue for expression, but it also suggests voice-only interactions don’t work well enough for a mainstream audience. With a richer form-factor comes opportunity, and we should expect A.I. platforms to take full advantage. Related Articles",

      "text": " 35 AM EST Amazon’s ‘re:invent’ Shows ‘Torrid’ Move to Cloud by Large Companies, Says RBC Shares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are down $4.51, or 0.6%, at $758.01, as the company’s “ re:invent ” conference for its Amazon Web Services continues in Las Vegas, with a keynote this morning, at 8 am, Pacific time, from CEO Andy Jassy , and a keynote tomorrow from AWS’s technology guru, Werner Vogels . You can sign up for the live Webcast at the conference site . Ross Macmillan with RBC Capital Markets is at the show and today offers up his impressions, including that \"the migration of workloads to public cloud continues at a torrid pace,” based on his chats with customers at the show. Last year GE made waves when it stated it would move 60% of its corporate workloads to AWS. This year we heard from customers such as Ticketmaster and the University of Arizona that both have an all-cloud strategy and believe they will have made the full migration in only 2-3 years from now. It is becoming clear that the corporate data center is becoming a thing of the past for a number of forward-thinking customers. Cost savings remain a key driver, but the agility and pace of innovation driven by access to the myriad of AWS services are becoming more important drivers of adoption. Macmillan also notes Amazon’s focus on databases :",

What is odd is that we know he has hit US retail since he is readily available on Amazon.com (ship and sold by Amazon) for 44.80. So, just in case some of you were looking for this toy and thinking he had not hit retail yet, you can get him on Amazon .

      "text": "November 30, 2016 at 10:26 AM EST Eseye Launches Breakthrough in IoT Security with Amazon Web Services \nNEW YORK , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Eseye and Amazon Web Services today announced the launch of a breakthrough in IoT Security, AnyNet Secure™. \nEseye, a leading global cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity provider for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, saw the culmination of many months working with AWS at the global corporation's Re:Invent convention in Las Vegas . Demonstrated live onstage, the new Eseye AnyNet Secure™ SIM was introduced as a new cellular connectivity solution integrated fully with the AWS Cloud management console and Cloud platform. \nAnyNet Secure provides AWS IoT customers with enhanced security and connectivity features that enables IoT devices across the globe to remotely, automatically and securely activate, provision, authenticate and certify 'things', over-the-air, and to then ingest data into AWS customers' clouds. \nThis innovative technology delivers several IoT breakthroughs. It launches devices or 'things' securely onto the global AWS Cloud network without the need for any physical configuration; no manual passwords or onsite intervention is required; and the need for the release of third party security keys to manufacturers is also now removed. The potential for a reduction in the risks and costs of IoT deployments for AWS customers are significant. \nJulian Hardy , CEO at Eseye, says: \"This new technology will ultimately allow more and varied products to go to market and to succeed by offering AWS customers the chance to take much of the cost, risk and time out of M2M IoT deployments. Collectively, we create a globally-available ubiquitous service layer through which projects can be deployed at scale, in a more secure manner and way that was previously impossible for customers. AnyNet Secure removes the need to make long-term sacrifices on security or go through a painstaking deployment process of manual intervention, one device at a time.\" \nThe new 'plug-and-play' or 'zero touch' SIM delivers increased efficiency thanks to its simple installation and remote management. Through the multi-IMSI technology embedded within the solution, the SIM allows organizations to deploy almost anywhere in the world, while establishing more robust levels of security. \nFind out how it works https://youtu.be/asnuCeybB1s \nContact anynetsecure.com , , @eseyem2m \nAbout Eseye Established in 2007, Eseye is a leading global cellular internet connectivity provider for IoT devices and is recognised in Gartner's 2016 Managed M2M Services Magic Quadrant.

      "text": "Amazon   Posted AWS announces FPGA instances for its EC2 cloud computing service \nAmazon is rolling out a new tool for users of its Amazon Web Services that will allow them to essentially use just as much GPU power as necessary without using up a full cluster. \nThat means companies can tap into just a sliver of GPU power, or a larger amount, on demand as they need it and pay for that amount. GPUs can run a ton of tasks in parallel and have a lot of advantages in certain compute situations, like rendering games. But some lightweight processes don’t necessary require a full GPU cluster, which running for a company — especially a smaller one — might become prohibitively expensive very quickly. The new product, introduced at AWS Re:Invent, is called Elastic GPU for EC2. \n“You will be able to do the exact same to GPUs with our instances, run the same OpenGL code that application runs,” Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said. “If you need some amount of GPU but don’t need the full instances, and don’t want to attach to any one of your instances.” \nThis is a similar trend to what’s happening in cloud computing across the board — basically deploying just as much power and storage as you need versus needing to have to run full instances. That’s provided companies and developers a lot more flexibility over time, and a product like this gives Amazon a particular advantage over other services. \nOne natural implication of this is that, if smaller companies pick something along these lines, then Amazon can grow with those companies over time and they’ll continue to retain them as a customer. Amazon has said before it expects AWS to be a business worth more than $10 billion annually, and beyond just acquiring larger customers, capturing future potential is equally important. \nAmazon announced a lot of upgrades to its AWS products, generally providing more computer power and storage for its generally available cloud products. As Amazon continues to expand these products, it’s goal is to keep ahead of increasing competition from companies like Google that are trying to snatch away customers as the business has become more valuable to Amazon. 0",

      "text": "Creative Works By Gillian West - 30 November 2016 15:53pm \nPoland’s answer to eBay and Amazon, Allegro, has released its Christmas ad – and it’s a tearjerker. Ad of the Day \nCreated by Warasw agency Bardzo, the ad opens with an elderly man ordering ‘English for Beginners’ before going all-in on the task at hand. \nFrom learning in the bathtub to on the bus and covering his house – and pet – in post-it notes, the spot follows his determined journey to master the language before receiving a second Allegro delivery – a suitcase. \nTravelling to England, the fruits of his labour are revealed as he introduces himself, in perfect English, to his British granddaughter.",

      "text": "At its annual re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced Amazon Lightsail, a new way for developers to quickly and easily get access to low-cost virtual private servers (VPS). \nThey don’t need to worry about provisioning storage, security groups, or identity and access management (IAM) when they want to just get a box to run a simple application. They can just use Amazon Lightsail now.\nThe thing is for years companies like Linode and BlueHost have offered cheap VPS servers. The startup DigitalOcean has risen to popularity because it made the VPS hip and a simpler alternative to AWS. Now AWS is directly going after the DigitalOcean style of cloud infrastructure — starting at $5, the Lightsail VPS prices are certainly competitive.\nVPS isn’t something that the other major cloud infrastructure providers like Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure offer. But it’s only a matter of time before that changes.\nDetail on the service is here .\n",

( more ) ►Sharpeners I use in this video (Amazon affiliates links) ※These sharpeners seem to be sold more expensively outside of Japan. I believe you can find cheaper ones that are decent online as well. Zwilling J.A. Henckels also has good sharpening stones which I have used before. Unlike the ones I used in this video, you don't need to soak it in water to sharpen a knife (but it still needs to be wet). Shapton (Orange) #1000: http://amzn.to/2gI5D3O Shapton (Green) #2000: http://amzn.to/2gI4uco Sharpening stones come in grits, and these two grits would be enough for a normal household knife. I used grits 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 8,000, and 12,000 in this video. The higher the number, the finer the sanding and the sharper the knife will be. Sharpening with Bob Kramer",

      "text": "Amazon launches Amazon AI to bring its machine learning smarts to developers Posted YouTube adds support for 4K live streaming \nAmazon today announced the launch of its new Amazon AI platform at its re:Invent developer event in Las Vegas. This new service brings many of the machine learning smarts Amazon has developed in-house over the years to developers outside the company. For now, the service only makes three different tools available to developers, but the plan is to add more over time. \nAmazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy stressed that Amazon itself has a lot of background in machine learning, even though the company hasn’t always talked about it. “We do a lot of AI in our company,” he said. “We have thousands of people dedicated to AI in our business.” \nThe fist of these new services under the Amazon AI umbrella is an image recognition service called “ Rekognition .” It allows you to recognize objects and scenes, similar to services already available from Google, Microsoft and others. Amazon did stress that it’s system is smart enough to recognize the breed of dog is sees in an image, though it’s worth noting that its competitors can often do this, too. Jassy noted that the service is very cost-effective, though he didn’t announce pricing. \n\nThe second is Amazon Polly , a text-to-speech service that uses a lot of machine learning smarts under the hood. Jassy noted that it produces life-like speech. “ Polly was designed to address many of the more challenging aspects of speech generation,” Amazon explains. “For example, consider the difference in pronunciation of the word “live” in the phrases ‘I live in Seattle’ and ‘Live from New York.’ Polly knows that this pair of homographs are spelled the same but are pronounced quite differently.” \nPolly features 47 male and female voices and supports 24 languages. \nThe third, and probably most important new service is called “ Lex .” This, Jassy said, is essentially the technology that fuels Amazon’s own Alexa service. It allows you to build conversational applications that can feature multi-step conversations. Developers start designing their conversations in the Lex Console, where the can train the bot with a few sample phrases. \n“You can use Amazon Lex to build chatbots and other types of web & mobile applications that support engaging, lifelike interactions,” Amazon explains in today’s announcement. “Your bots can provide information, power your application, streamline work activities, or provide a control mechanism for robots, drones, and toys.” \nDuring today’s keynote, Amazon showed how this could allow a developer to easily book a flight with just your voice (somehow, that’s becoming the canonical demo for all of these services). Lex is deeply integrated with Lambda and other AWS services and comes with a number of enterprise connectors, too. In addition, it’s integrated with Facebook Messenger, Slack and Twilio, so it’s not just bound to Amazon’s own devices but could be built into virtually any other device, too. 0",

      "text": "‘Budding Prospects’: Adam Rose To Star In Amazon’s Pot Comedy Pilot Nellie Andreeva Pin it Share Veronica Mars alum Adam Rose is set as a lead opposite Joel David Moore and Will Sasso on Amazon ’s pot-themed comedy pilot Budding Prospects , a 1980s comedy from Bad Santa director Terry Zwigoff. Written by Melissa Axelrod based on the TC Boyle novel of the same name and to be directed by Zwigoff, Budding Prospects is set in 1983 San Francisco. Three hapless city boys — Felix (Rose), Phil (Moore) and Gesh (Sasso) — move to the country to grow marijuana. Their expectations of the experience being a back-to-the-land, nurturing adventure in a beautiful rustic setting run up against the harsh truth upon their arrival at “The Summer Camp” – a miserably run-down shanty out in the middle of nowhere, where they are bedeviled by rats, snakes, mosquitoes, and harsh, unfriendly growing conditions, noisy neighbors, dangerous locals, and menacing law enforcement. Rose’s Felix is a lovelorn romantic who is sensitive, brooding, vulnerable and ruefully self-aware but also likable and compelling. Zwigoff and Axelrod executive produce with Vincent Landay. Joanna Colbert is co-executive produce. Rose returns to Supernatural this season to reprise his guest starring role as Aaron Bass and was recently tapped for a guest stint on the upcoming Netflix series Santa Clarita Diet. He is repped by BRS and the Gage Talent Agency. Related stories",

      "text": "AWS gives developers larger instances to work with Posted \nAmazon kicked off its 2016 AWS re:Invent conference with a peppering of announcements regarding its EC2 instance roadmap. The company dropped an updated R4 instance, expanded T2 instances, and a new F1 instance. The F1 utilizes field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to offer a solution that is faster than traditional CPU/GPU combinations for quick reprogramming. \nWhile those new instances will be available today, Amazon also showed off new elastic GPUs as well as I3 and C5 instances that will launch shortly in the future. We decided to break out the F1 instance and new elastic GPUs in their own posts but info on the other instances is below. \nAmazon’s working hard to stay ahead of competitors like Google by packing as much power into EC2 instances as it possibly can. While instance updates can be expected on a regular basis as the cost of components decreases, today’s releases pack an undeniable power punch. T2 – Burstable, available today \nAmazon’s T2 instances , commonly used for web servers and small databases, got a serious extension with new T2.xlarge and T2.2xlarge instances. The former will include 16 GiB for 2x the memory while the later packs in 32 GiB for 4x the memory. Both new instances will run on a 64-bit platform. At a price-per-hour basis, Amazon quotes $0.188 for the xl instance and $0.376 for the 2xl instance running on Linux. R4 – Memory intensive, available today \nAmazon’s solution for in-memory processing also got an upgrade today. The company effectively doubled memory in moving from the 244 GiB of memory on the previous R3 instance to the 488 GiB of memory found on the new R4. This change also comes with a move to DDR4 for twice the speed, a 1.8X L3 cache and a 2x boost to 64 vCPUs. The R4 instances will feature High Frequency Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4 “Broadwell” Processors (2.4 GHz). I3 – High I/O, coming soon \nUsers of NoSQL databases like Cassandra and MongoDB and friends of Hadoop got a treat in the form of a 9x IOPS increase on the new I3 instance. It will have 3.3 million IOPS alongside 488 GiB, a 15.2TB NVMe SSD and 64 vCPUs. This is roughly twice the stats across the board when compared to the prior I2 instance. C5 – Compute intensive, coming soon \nLast but not least, Amazon announced that its C5 instance would replace the C4’s Intel Haswell processors with Intel Skylake for, you guessed it, twice the performance. Coming in six sizes, instances are optimized for machine learning, multimedia, and scientific calculations. Amazon is offering twice the vCPUSs on the new C5. Throughput and memory will increase by 3X and 2.4X respectively. This means the new C5 instance will include 144 GiB of memory and 12 Gbps to EBS. 0",

      "text": "AWS CEO Andy Jassy launches Amazon Lightsail at re:invent 2016 Providers of low-costs virtual private servers (VPS) are facing a major new competitor this morning, as AWS announced the new Amazon Lightsail service at the re:invent conference this morning in Las Vegas.\nLightsail allows users to skip most provisioning details to spin up a virtual server in the cloud. You don’t need to specify settings like storage, security or identity management. Rather a user can just pick the size of the server and get a server running in just a few clicks.\nThe move is a competitive response to VPS providers like DigitalOcean, Linode and Bluehost, and isn’t something that the other major cloud providers are offering yet. Pricing is competitive, starting at $5/month and up to $80/month, depending on the configuration chosen.\n\nYou can learn more about Amazon Lightsail here .",

      "text": "I heard an interesting statistic on TV this week. At least half of the remarkable $3.45 billion in sales on Cyber Monday can be chalked up to Amazon. Half. Last year, the most common figure cited was 36%. Best Buy, the closest retailer, gets only about 5-6% of Cyber Monday sales. Looking at a chart on fortune.com yesterday, I found it remarkable to see mighty Walmart reduced to a pathetic also-ran in this cyber sweepstakes.\nAn NRF survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that 122 million consumers were expected to buy, or at least shop, on Cyber Monday. Amazon says that it sold two million toys in the first half of the day. According to Yahoo! Finance, “Amazon says it’s offering 75,000 deals this week. Last year, Amazon customers bought 54 million items on Cyber Monday — a record-breaking 629 items per second. Amazon expects to top that record this year.”\nTry to imagine a parallel in a brick-and-mortar store — 629 items a second? How could even a huge chain of actual stores handle that? There aren’t enough minimum wage workers available. It’s mind-boggling.\nSo that begs a question: If Amazon is going to completely dominate cyber sales, how well are advertisers taking advantage of Amazon’s programmatic promotional opportunities?\nPerhaps Amazon’s most prominent ad opportunity is its Sponsored Products offer, which places product listings on search results, and works on a pay-per-click basis. Amazon says that during last year’s holiday rush, conversion rates (people who clicked on a Sponsored Products Ad and then bought the product) climbed 16% on Black Friday and 27% higher on Cyber Monday, while mid-December conversions were 42% higher. Return on Ad Spending (ROAS) on Cyber Monday was an average $13 in ad sales revenue for every dollar spent on Sponsored Product ads.\nAmazon also claims that 94% of U.S. consumers plan to shop on it over the holidays and 22% do not plan any in-store shopping this season, according to BloomReach’s “State of Amazon 2016” and the Rubicon Project’s “Millions of Consumers Have Already Begun Holiday Shopping,” respectively. Seventy percent of buys were via smartphones, we’re told.\nWe decided to test Amazon’s Sponsored Products ads for ourselves. Since I have a professional connection to the rare book industry, I tried the search term “19th century books.” Amazon correctly linked me to two products “inspired by your purchases” — two sizes of Sobo Premium Craft and Fabric Glue, which my wife buys for me on Amazon. The glue, and the kind of tape we use, also appeared on the home page when I signed on. I was impressed that they got it right.\nOn the other hand, the books they offered up were not so well chosen —  19th Century Patchwork Divas’ Treasury of Quilts ? Even clicking on “19th century” in the links on the left titled “Historical Time Period” didn’t help, as it still gave me 21st century books with 19th century in the titles. On the other hand, Amazon offered a link to a book by a friend of mine, L.A.-based Greg Goldin, Never Built New York . It's as if they were reading our email exchanges or something. That was impressive. Or scary, depending on your point of view. I chose to be impressed.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Amazon brings its AI expertise to AWS customers Three new AWS AI tools unveiled at re:Invent take advantage of the technology driving Alexa and Amazon's sophisticated logistics capabilities. | Topic: Cloud \nAWS unveiled Amazon Rekognition at the re:Invent conference on November 30, 2016. \nAmazon Web Services is giving its customers access to the artificial intelligence that's powered Amazon products and capabilities, AWS CEO Andy Jassy announced at the re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. \n\"A lot of companies don't realize the heritage Amazon has in the machine learning space,\" Jassy said in his keynote address. \nIndeed, as the cloud wars have heated up and competitors like Azure and Google Cloud Platform try to make a dent in AWS' dominance, expertise in machine learning has largely been one of Google's key value propositions . Yet Jassy pointed to multiple ways Amazon has deployed machine learning, such as in its voice-activated assistant Alexa, its fulfillment and logistics capabilities, and its discovery and search functions. \nAWS' first new AI product is Amazon Rekognition is an image recognition and analysis service. Once an image is submitted, it can recognize objects and scenes, and it can perform facial recognition. It can be used for real-time analysis, and it can take millions of images in batch form. The service is easy to use and cost effective, Jassy promised. \nNext, Amazon Polly is a text-to-speech service powered by deep learning. Once a stream of text is submitted, Polly will spin out an mp3 stream. Thanks to Polly's intelligence, if text such as \"The temp in WA is 75 degrees\" is submitted, the mp3 will deliver it as, \"The temperature in Washington is seventy-five degrees.\" \nPolly comes with 47 different voices in 24 languages. \nThird, Jassy introduced Amazon Lex , which provides natural language understanding and automatic speech recognition, powered by deep learning. \nIt's effectively \"what's inside Alexa,\" Jassy said. \"This will allow you to build all kinds of conversational applications.\" \nWith an integrated development console in AWS, customers can set up sample phrases used to build a natural language model and publish an Amazon Lex bot. A user can set up Lambda functions or triggers to pull up data for various responses and multi-step conversations. \nAmazon Lex is set up with several enterprise connectors, including Salesforce, Facebook Messenger and Twilio. It's a fully managed service, so there's no need to spend time managing or scaling up infrastructure. AWS re:Invent 2016",

Athena enables SQL queries directly on data stored in the AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) storage service.\nAthena is a serverless solution that does not require any infrastructure configuration. Users can create standard ANSI SQL queries in a new interactive query editor using standard SQL syntax like JOINs and window function to query objects stored in S3.\nAccording to AWS CEO Andy Jassy, Athena is a complementary query tool to the Redshit and Elastic Map Reduce, the company’s other data query offerings.\nQuery results can be visualized with AWS’s QuickSight business intelligence service or different ones via the Athena JDBC driver.\nDetails of the new Athena service are outlined in a new blog post from Jeff Barr at AWS .",
