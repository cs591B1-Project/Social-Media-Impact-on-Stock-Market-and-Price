One of its small bright spots, though, was Amazon's introduction to the smart speaker game with the Echo and Echo Dot . So if you're into voice requests and your life being streamlined by a virtual assistant, it can't get any better, right? Well, it turns out Amazon could already be looking to introduce a premium variant of the Echo featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, after a Bloomberg report indicated that the retail giant is working on the device. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below © Amazon Citing the ubiquitous \"people familiar with the matter\", the upgrade could offer information such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news on the alleged touchscreen. This won't be like leaving a tablet on the side, either, with the Echo set to tilt upwards to make it more accessible. While the introduction of a screen would add some functionality improvements to the Echo, its speakers are also reportedly set to receive a considerable upgrade. Related: 9 Amazon Echo Skills you need to try This doesn't mean the existing options will be replaced, though. The touchscreen version would simply be another addition to the Echo family when it's expected to be announced early next year. With many tech giants jumping aboard the smart home game, including Google, it wouldn't necessarily be a surprise if Amazon looked to expand its options by offering the mooted model. With none of this being confirmed, mind, be sure not to set those expectations of a touchscreen Echo too high. Want up- to -the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "print \nJeremy Clarkson with a Porsche 918 Spyder. Amazon \nAfter more than a year on the sidelines, Jeremy Clarkson is back with a new car show on Amazon Prime called \"The Grand Tour\". \nClarkson, along with long-time co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, launched \"The Grand Tour\" prior to the Thanksgiving holiday to rave reviews. \nIn fact, the first episode quickly became the most watch piece of programming in the history of Amazon Prime. \nIncredibly, Amazon's second-best performing show could only muster 1/3 of \"The Grand Tour's\" ratings, The Wrap reported. \nRecently, the bombastic TV host and long-time newspaper columnist sat down with Business Insider in New York while doing press for his new show. We had a brief chat about supercars, electric cars, and why James May should feel small and stupid. \nBenjamin Zhang : Let's talk about cars. One of our favorites this year has been the new Acura/Honda NSX. \nJeremy Clarkson : I'm annoyed to have to say that James May has driven it for the show, Richard Hammond has been in it, and I've only been looking at it. I've haven't had a go in it, not yet, but I will very soon \nIt's a very good looking car, I just hope its better than Honda's Formula One effort. (In reference to Honda's recent struggles as McLaren's engine supplier in the Formula One racing series.) \nJeremy Clarkson (L), Richard Hammond (C), James May. Amazon \nBZ: In the past you haven't been a huge of fan of Tesla. Has your thinking changed at all? \nJC : No, because I will never be a fan plug-in electric cars. You have brown-outs in New York already when you have people charging (phones) up, and running lights. America is barely coping with its demand for electricity. Same in Britain. We're 5% and you're 16% under here in the US. So, when people start charging their cars up, where's the power going to come? \nWho knows. \nYou'll have to build more power stations. Is that environmentally friendly? \nThe answer is hydrogen. But the more plug-in electric cars that come along, the less demand there is for carmakers to get off their asses and start making fuel cell cars — which is where we must go. We must have fuel cell cars. The world has to have them. \nBZ : Back to something more traditional. What are your thoughts on the new Ferrari 488 GTB? Is it an awesome car or a turbocharged abomination? \nJC : The 488 is fabulous car — make no mistake about that. And anyone who owns a 458 ( The 488's predecessor) now would feel small and stupid because they bought the wrong car... James May. \nFerrari 488 GTB. Hollis Johnson \nBZ: Yes, James May was extolling the merits of his Ferrari 458 Speciale earlier today. \nJC : Yes I know, he's the man who once drove it 26 mph. He'd certainly never go any faster than that. \nFerrari— difficult company to deal with, but extremely good cars when you get ahold of them. They are really, really good. In fact, I know of nothing, really, as a driver's machine that gets close to that. \nBZ : What about McLaren? \nJC : It does, but it's got these extremely clever electronic roll bars and matches Ferrari in terms of all of the outright figures. But I don't know. There's a fizz , James May calls it, (that you feel) when you drive a Ferrari. I know what he means and you just don't get that from a McLaren. The spirit of (long-time McLaren boss and well-known neat-freak) Ron Dennis is in every single thing you touch in there. \nBZ : Not for much longer I guess. \nJC : Yes, I know and that's slightly amazing. (Dennis was removed from is position of McLaren Technology Group's CEO last month) \nThere's this slightly antiseptic feel to the (McLaren). You know when you see someone with really neat hair and you want to lean over and just do that . (Clarkson stretches his arm out and pretends to mess up my hair.) It's what you want to do to a McLaren. You want to just rub mud on its face. It would make the car better and more human. \nMcLaren P1. Amazon \nBZ: On that note, what do you think of the new generation Audi A4? \nJC : I haven't bothered with it. The last Audi I drove was the TT, which was excellent. I drive a different car every week, why the bloody hell would I make one of them an A4. \nBZ : Well, what about American cars? Have they gotten any better in your opinion? \nJC : Yeah, much better. The new Corvettes are truly fantastic. You couldn't possibly have one in Europe because you'd look like a moron. But, it's a fabulous car. In fact, the last two generations have been extremely impressive. \nBZ : Even for everyday road use? \nJC : Yeah. Very very good. And I'd also say that, for the same exact reasons I was discussing with you on the McLaren, the Mustang is also a really good car. \nWe a drove the Roush one in the opening scene (of the first episode) and that was a really good car. \nAmazon \nBZ: You had a (Henrik Fisker-designed, modified Mustang) Rocket as well right? \nJC : Yeah, but the Roush was better. The Roush was the best of those three. \nBZ : Even better than the Shelby GT350? \nJC : I thought so. The last Roush I drove — based on the last model Mustang — was (on the track) at Willow Springs. I was just absolutely bowled over by it. Roush are really good. Never met them. Don't even know who they are or where they are, but I've driven two of their cars now and both of them have been incredibly impressive. \nBZ : Thank you very much.

      "text": "print Jeremy Clarkson with a Porsche 918 Spyder. Amazon \nAfter more than a year on the sidelines, Jeremy Clarkson is back with a new car show on Amazon Prime called \"The Grand Tour\". \nClarkson, along with long-time co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, launched \"The Grand Tour\" prior to the Thanksgiving holiday to rave reviews. \nIn fact, the first episode quickly became the most watch piece of programming in the history of Amazon Prime. \nIncredibly, Amazon's second-best performing show could only muster 1/3 of \"The Grand Tour's\" ratings, The Wrap reported. \nRecently, the bombastic TV host and long-time newspaper columnist sat down with Business Insider in New York while doing press for his new show. We had a brief chat about supercars, electric cars, and why James May should feel small and stupid. \nBenjamin Zhang : Let's talk about cars. One of our favorites this year has been the new Acura/Honda NSX. \nJeremy Clarkson : I'm annoyed to have to say that James May has driven it for the show, Richard Hammond has been in it, and I've only been looking at it. I've haven't had a go in it, not yet, but I will very soon \nIt's a very good looking car, I just hope its better than Honda's Formula One effort. (In reference to Honda's recent struggles as McLaren's engine supplier in the Formula One racing series.) \nJeremy Clarkson (L), Richard Hammond (C), James May. Amazon \nBZ: In the past you haven't been a huge of fan of Tesla. Has your thinking changed at all? \nJC : No, because I will never be a fan plug-in electric cars. You have brown-outs in New York already when you have people charging (phones) up, and running lights. America is barely coping with its demand for electricity. Same in Britain. We're 5% and you're 16% under here in the US. So, when people start charging their cars up, where's the power going to come? \nWho knows. \nYou'll have to build more power stations. Is that environmentally friendly? \nThe answer is hydrogen. But the more plug-in electric cars that come along, the less demand there is for carmakers to get off their asses and start making fuel cell cars — which is where we must go. We must have fuel cell cars. The world has to have them. \nBZ : Back to something more traditional. What are your thoughts on the new Ferrari 488 GTB? Is it an awesome car or a turbocharged abomination? \nJC : The 488 is fabulous car — make no mistake about that. And anyone who owns a 458 ( The 488's predecessor) now would feel small and stupid because they bought the wrong car... James May. \nFerrari 488 GTB. Hollis Johnson \nBZ: Yes, James May was extolling the merits of his Ferrari 458 Speciale earlier today. \nJC : Yes I know, he's the man who once drove it 26 mph. He'd certainly never go any faster than that. \nFerrari— difficult company to deal with, but extremely good cars when you get ahold of them. They are really, really good. In fact, I know of nothing, really, as a driver's machine that gets close to that. \nBZ : What about McLaren? \nJC : It does, but it's got these extremely clever electronic roll bars and matches Ferrari in terms of all of the outright figures. But I don't know. There's a fizz , James May calls it, (that you feel) when you drive a Ferrari. I know what he means and you just don't get that from a McLaren. The spirit of (long-time McLaren boss and well-known neat-freak) Ron Dennis is in every single thing you touch in there. \nBZ : Not for much longer I guess. \nJC : Yes, I know and that's slightly amazing. (Dennis was removed from is position of McLaren Technology Group's CEO last month) \nThere's this slightly antiseptic feel to the (McLaren). You know when you see someone with really neat hair and you want to lean over and just do that . (Clarkson stretches his arm out and pretends to mess up my hair.) It's what you want to do to a McLaren. You want to just rub mud on its face. It would make the car better and more human. \nMcLaren P1. Amazon \nBZ: On that note, what do you think of the new generation Audi A4? \nJC : I haven't bothered with it. The last Audi I drove was the TT, which was excellent. I drive a different car every week, why the bloody hell would I make one of them an A4. \nBZ : Well, what about American cars? Have they gotten any better in your opinion? \nJC : Yeah, much better. The new Corvettes are truly fantastic. You couldn't possibly have one in Europe because you'd look like a moron. But, it's a fabulous car. In fact, the last two generations have been extremely impressive. \nBZ : Even for everyday road use? \nJC : Yeah. Very very good. And I'd also say that, for the same exact reasons I was discussing with you on the McLaren, the Mustang is also a really good car. \nWe a drove the Roush one in the opening scene (of the first episode) and that was a really good car. \nAmazon \nBZ: You had a (Henrik Fisker-designed, modified Mustang) Rocket as well right? \nJC : Yeah, but the Roush was better. The Roush was the best of those three. \nBZ : Even better than the Shelby GT350? \nJC : I thought so. The last Roush I drove — based on the last model Mustang — was (on the track) at Willow Springs. I was just absolutely bowled over by it. Roush are really good. Never met them. Don't even know who they are or where they are, but I've driven two of their cars now and both of them have been incredibly impressive. \nBZ : Thank you very much.

      "title": "AWS unveils Snowmobile truck for moving data to its cloud",
      "text": "At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) unveiled the next generation of its Snowball boxes that customers can use to move lots of data to AWS. \nThe first version was announced at last year’s re:Invent — it had a capacity of 50TB. Then, in April of this year, AWS showed off a 80TB version . This time around, AWS decided to add on computing resources, which opens up new possibilities for companies that need a Snowball.\nMultiple Snowball Edge boxes can divvy up databases with sharding, for one thing, AWS chief executive Andy Jassy said, and they can sync data to S3, too. But also, they can run new AWS software called AWS Greengrass , which effectively brings the serverless event-driven computing model of AWS Lambda outside of AWS and onto other kinds of devices, including embedded devices.\nAbove: AWS Snowball Edge.\nImage Credit: Screenshot But AWS isn’t stopping there. For companies that have exabytes of data, of which there are a lot, Jassy said, AWS is introducing a full-size truck containing a 45-foot shipping container in which customers can load up data.\n“We’ll drive the truck over to your data center, we’ll take Snowmobile affixed to a trailer, we have power, and we’ll fiber-connect to your data center, you fill ‘er up, the truck will come back, we’ll put [the container] back on the truck, and we’ll move it back to AWS,” Jassy said. \nSending an exabyte of data to AWS data centers at a rate of 10 Gb/s would take 26 years, but using 10 Snowmobiles would take less than six months, Jassy said.\nAWS Snowmobile doesn’t have an official price. But AWS chief evangelist noted in a blog post that salespeople will work with interested customers, and that AWS is keen to ensure that the service “is both faster and less expensive than using a network-based data transfer model.”\nAs for the Snowball Edge, each job costs $300 plus shipping costs, Barr wrote in a blog post . If you keep it for longer than 10 days, you’ll have to pay $30 per box per day. Locally run Lambda functions are free.\n",

That shipping container is then transported to an Amazon data center where all the data is uploaded to S3 or Amazon Glacier, Amazon's cloud data storage services.\n\nThis is a sizable upgrade over Amazon's existing Snowball service, in which Amazon ships you a secure 80TB “Storage Appliance” to load your data onto over 10Gbps Ethernet.

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank $29 for This Premium 4-Course Training on Amazon Web Services- Deal Alert \nIt can be hard moving large amounts of data to the cloud. Even with consistent 10 Gbps of data transfer, it would take years to get hundreds of petabytes from an on-premises data center to a public cloud provider. \nAmazon is aiming to speed that process up with a high-capacity data transfer product: a literal truck. The Snowmobile is a big, white semi-trailer that can hold 100PB of data. It will then get driven to an Amazon endpoint, and the data will be loaded into its public cloud storage. \nFor smaller migrations that can also benefit from processing at the edge, Amazon also announced a new Snowball Edge appliance that provides 100TB of storage, local compute power, and migration for handling data transfer and processing. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nThese new products, announced Wednesday, are aimed at helping companies get large amounts of data into Amazon’s cloud, which will then encourage them to stick with the company's services going forward. That’s especially important because the company charges for data egress, and the costs of a full migration to a competing cloud provider could be too much for some businesses to bear. \nFor companies that want to move large swaths of data, the Snowmobile could be a useful tool. Amazon will back it up to a customer’s data center, and the truck can handle data transfers of up to 1TB per second by hooking up multiple 40Gbps fiber connections. The Snowmobile can be filled in about 10 days at maximum speed, according to a blog post from AWS evangelist Jeff Barr. \nWhat's more, the truck is waterproof and can be parked in either covered or uncovered locations. \nAmazon takes the security of the trailer seriously — the company can provide security for the Snowmobile while it's located at a customer's data center and will provide an escort for the data to its destination. Each container will provide GPS tracking as well, and users' data is encrypted. \nThe trucks are already being used, including with one large customer who is undergoing a \"pretty gigantic\" migration, AWS CEO Andy Jassy said during a press conference. \nThe Snowball Edge, by contrast, is designed to be a more easily portable and compute-heavy appliance. Like its namesake, the Snowball migration appliance, it’s a ruggedized storage device that comes with an e-ink shipping label to get it back to Amazon for data transfer into AWS. \nIt holds 100TB of data, compared to the Snowball’s 80TB, and also sports a touchscreen for interacting with the device. That’s useful because the device is also able to handle data processing on-device using AWS Lambda functions, meaning the Snowball Edge is able to provide analytics on-device. The appliance can also do all its own data encryption, which makes transfer operations faster. \nThe Snowball Edge was designed to be useful for situations like research boats that don't have internet connectivity, Jassy said during his keynote address at Amazon's Re:Invent conference. A Snowball Edge can collect data, slice down a subset of key information for on-premises processing, and then send the rest of the data to Amazon's cloud. \nThe device was among a fleet of services that Amazon announced at Re:Invent, including new machine learning-driven APIs and major updates to its compute services.

Whatever the motive, it allows more flexibility in dealing with GPUs in EC2, although it isn't generally available yet for Amazon customers; the only time frame Amazon would give is \"soon.\" \nGPUs may be the foundation for the current wave of hardware for machine learning, but Amazon and others are already eyeing what's next in that field: FPGAs . Amazon's latest offering is a new EC2 instance type, the F1 , that includes up to eight Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P FPGAs and accompanying programming tools. \nFPGAs probably will complement, not displace, CPUs. Al Hilwa, Program Director of Software Development Research at IDC, stated in an email that FPGAs will \"typically be used for highly customized compute workloads,\" such as \"image, video and audio stream processing, often done in the context of preparing data for machine learning.\" \nRight now there are far more machine learning software tools for GPUs than for FPGAs. However, apps written for the F1 can be shared on the AWS Marketplace, which should eventually provide many more examples to learn from, reuse, and repurpose. See and speak \nNot everyone wants to build entirely from scratch. For that audience, Amazon unveiled three new high-level, machine-learning powered services for text-to-speech, image recognition, and conversational interfaces. \nOf the three, Amazon Rekognition should be the most familiar -- it's essentially a refined version of an existing deep learning function. Feed it an image, and Rekognition will detect the presence of common objects in the image -- and perform face recognition -- and provide feedback on confidence levels regarding various aspects of the image (for example, \"appears to be happy\"). The API set is meant to be simple enough to allow quick demos to be hacked together, but the resulting data can be stored and reused for more sophisticated applications. \nAmazon Polly is a text-to-speech service that allows for contextual translation of text to speech. For instance, abbreviations like \"NYC\" are automatically expanded to \"New York City,\" but \"Main St.\" and \"St. Peter\" would be expanded to \"Main Street\" and \"Saint Peter.\" Text can also be marked up with contextual data if you want to be completely unambiguous, but Amazon's advantage is that you won't have to -- or you'll only have to in extreme cases. \nAmazon Lex is in some regards the most adventurous, since it provides a workflow for building voice-driven, conversational interfaces, via the same engine that drives the Amazon Alexa service and Amazon Echo devices. Lex workflows are built using some of the same concepts behind chatbots, and they can connect to business logic from other Amazon technologies, such as AWS Lambda. Right now, Lex is only available as a preview in one AWS region (U.S. East), but it'll be popular if it delivers on its promise of not needing to fine-tune the machine learning components to get the best results.

      "text": "News Here's what your hardware needs for the AWS Greengrass IoT service Amazon's Greengrass offline IoT service will work on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410c board and should work with Raspberry Pi 3 U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 30, 2016 2:34 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nQualcomm's Snapdragon 410c developer board can be used to make robots, drones and IoT devices. Credit: Qualcomm Preview: Computerworld's smart cities video tour, coming soon! \nAmazon is bringing the Greengrass IoT service to devices and board computers, meant to help boost offline data collection and analysis. \nThe goal of Greengrass, an AWS software tool, is to make IoT devices and maker boards smarter. Even underpowered devices collecting data won't be \"dumb\" anymore, Amazon says. \nAmazon has kept in mind that smart devices can't always be connected to the cloud for data analysis, and Greengrass brings some AWS software tools to devices to aid in better collection and analysis of data. \nDeveloper boards are strongly tied to cloud services, which add more functionality to smart devices. Data collected from sensors are typically dispatched and collected in the cloud, where it can be analyzed and can define the next steps. \nSmarter sorting of data on IoT devices could speed up the analysis, and ensure the right data is sent to the cloud. Sending loads of useless IoT data to cloud services can eat up bandwidth and cost money. \nFor example, data from sensors in industrial equipment can be analyzed to improve manufacturing or cut down on injuries. In the petroleum industry, sensors can be used to collect data that could effectively nail down the geographic location of oil reserves. \nA robot or drone operator could offload basic training models to the devices to help with movement and navigation without being connected to the cloud. \n\"Code running in the field can collect, filter, and aggregate freshly collected data and then push it up to the cloud for long-term storage and further aggregation,\" Amazon said in a blog post . \"Further, code running in the field can also take action very quickly, even in cases where connectivity to the cloud is temporarily unavailable.\" \nMany developer boards are being used for IoT. Raspberry Pi started off as a hobbyist board but is now tied to cloud services like Microsoft's Azure and IBM's Bluemix. Greengrass will work with a large number of developer boards. \nGreengrass has some hardware requirements. It requires minimum memory of 128MB and a 1GHz ARM or x86 CPU. A user needs to run the Amazon Linux or the Ubuntu OS. Qualcomm has said Greengrass will work on its Snapdragon 410c chip, and the offline IoT service will likely work on Raspberry Pi, which meets the minimum requirements. \nOther major developer boards like Orange Pi and Pine64 also meet the minimum requirements. Samsung's Artik developer board is tied tightly to Artik Cloud but is not friendly to other cloud services. \nAmazon said Greengrass will work on Intel hardware. However, the company could not immediately say if Intel developer boards like Joule would work with Greengrass. \nQualcomm said it believes Greengrass will be used by large-scale manufacturers making devices that rely on AWS cloud. \nAWS cloud services are wildly popular, and with Greengrass, more IoT devices could rely on the company's cloud.

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank 2016 State of The Cloud \nIt can be hard moving large amounts of data to the cloud. Even with consistent 10 Gbps of data transfer, it would take years to get hundreds of petabytes from an on-premises data center to a public cloud provider. \nAmazon is aiming to speed that process up with a high-capacity data transfer product: a literal truck. The Snowmobile is a big, white semi-trailer that can hold 100PB of data. It will then get driven to an Amazon endpoint, and the data will be loaded into its public cloud storage. \nFor smaller migrations that can also benefit from processing at the edge, Amazon also announced a new Snowball Edge appliance that provides 100TB of storage, local compute power, and migration for handling data transfer and processing. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 10 Most Powerful IaaS Companies \nThese new products, announced Wednesday, are aimed at helping companies get large amounts of data into Amazon’s cloud, which will then encourage them to stick with the company's services going forward. That’s especially important because the company charges for data egress, and the costs of a full migration to a competing cloud provider could be too much for some businesses to bear. \nFor companies that want to move large swaths of data, the Snowmobile could be a useful tool. Amazon will back it up to a customer’s data center, and the truck can handle data transfers of up to 1TB per second by hooking up multiple 40Gbps fiber connections. The Snowmobile can be filled in about 10 days at maximum speed, according to a blog post from AWS evangelist Jeff Barr. \nWhat's more, the truck is waterproof and can be parked in either covered or uncovered locations. \nAmazon takes the security of the trailer seriously — the company can provide security for the Snowmobile while it's located at a customer's data center and will provide an escort for the data to its destination. Each container will provide GPS tracking as well, and users' data is encrypted. \nThe trucks are already being used, including with one large customer who is undergoing a \"pretty gigantic\" migration, AWS CEO Andy Jassy said during a press conference. \nThe Snowball Edge, by contrast, is designed to be a more easily portable and compute-heavy appliance. Like its namesake, the Snowball migration appliance, it’s a ruggedized storage device that comes with an e-ink shipping label to get it back to Amazon for data transfer into AWS. \nIt holds 100TB of data, compared to the Snowball’s 80TB, and also sports a touchscreen for interacting with the device. That’s useful because the device is also able to handle data processing on-device using AWS Lambda functions, meaning the Snowball Edge is able to provide analytics on-device. The appliance can also do all its own data encryption, which makes transfer operations faster. \nThe Snowball Edge was designed to be useful for situations like research boats that don't have internet connectivity, Jassy said during his keynote address at Amazon's Re:Invent conference. A Snowball Edge can collect data, slice down a subset of key information for on-premises processing, and then send the rest of the data to Amazon's cloud. \nThe device was among a fleet of services that Amazon announced at Re:Invent, including new machine learning-driven APIs and major updates to its compute services.

      "text": "Everybody was Wrong About Amazon Fashion toggle menu Download \nWhen Amazon purchased a 10,000 square-foot warehouse in Williamsburg to use as fashion photography hub, most brands were skeptical of its grandiose ambitions. Louis Vuitton’s chief executive Yves Carcelle told Vogue UK in 2012 that it would never sell the brand on Amazon, because of the vertical, exclusive retail model of “ direct control ” they pioneered. Many others believed consumers would never be interested in buying luxury goods placed alongside detergent, even if Amazon provided more convenient and faster fulfillment than any luxury e-commerce site. Tony King, founder of luxury branding agency King & Partners told Digiday “A consumer doesn’t go to Target and then stop at Valentino. Right now, it’s like having a physical store like a Walmart asking luxury brands to fill it with their products. It’s not going to happen — it needs to overhaul.” \nFour years later, Amazon is expected to surpass retail giants Nordstrom and Macy’s in apparel and accessories sales in 2017. By 2020, Amazon sales are anticipated to be double that of macy’s. \nWhere did Amazon go right? It targeted mid-priced or aspirational luxury brands (e.g. Theory, DVF, Joie, Parker, Vince) that had cache but were more about being inclusive than exclusive. LVMH still has a “ no-engagement ” policy with Amazon, but it matters less each time a new mid-level luxury brand signs on. Amazon’s ambitions are grander, as it launched seven in-house brands in February and set aside a budget to advertise just its Fashion arm. \nAmazon’s advantage lies in its fulfillment capabilities, built out to near perfection across categories. Ninety-percent of American consumers say a convenient return policy and free shipping are the most important characteristics of an online shopping experience, both of which have been historically challenging for fashion brands. As 60% of luxury purchases are now influenced by a digital experience, brands lagging in omnichannel and e-commerce capabilities may find upside in working with Amazon.  ",

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick November 30, 2016 1:00 AM | ScreenCrush \nSubscribe to WDKS-FM on \nThe concept behind Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle is a funny one. Not so much the “ha, look at how far-fetched a totalitarian America feels,” but a deeper sci-fi premise than an alternate outcome to World War 2. Now, that idea is blossoming in Season 2, as a new clip introduces Stephen Root as the titular mysterious man. \nThe Boardwalk Empire , Office Space star and all-around character actor will debut in Amazon’s second season as the title character, purveyor of the mysterious alternate reality films that depict a history much closer to our own. The clip above doesn’t exactly answer the main mystery, but does illuminate how much more sci-fi season 2 might get. \nDebuting Season 2 on December 16, Amazon’s The Man in the High Castle adapts an old Philip K. Dick novel to imagine a 1962 in which the United States had lost World War II, and subsequently been divided between the German “Greater Nazi Reich,” and the “Japanese Pacific States.” \nThe series stars Alexa Davalos, Rufus Sewell, Rupert Evans, Luke Kleintank, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and DJ Qualls. Check out the first Season 2 trailers below, and watch all episodes on Amazon Prime. \nSubscribe to WDKS-FM on",

      "text": "\nChief Product and Strategy OfficerRadial \nWhen it’s done right, in-store technology can help retailers merge their online and offline channels and provide a holistic view of the customer, according to Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer at commerce technology and operations provider Radial. eMarketer’s Tricia Carr spoke with Weitz about how retailers can compete with ecommerce heavyweights like Amazon and why they need to stop and think before investing in flashy, new technology. \neMarketer: Does in-store technology always enhance the experience? \nStefan Weitz : Generally, in-store technology is a net benefit. Consumers expect and desire it, and they’re more informed than ever because of it. Extending that capability to store associates is a requirement. Technology should be used to provide an exceptional customer experience. \nTechnology goes wrong when it’s too cute—it’s technology for technology’s sake. This type of technology is either not necessary, because consumers already have the tools at their disposal, or it’s clunky and gets in the way of the customer experience. For example, some of the kiosks that allow consumers to buy something in-store just redirect them to a website. That’s not a good experience. \neMarketer: How can in-store technology help traditional retailers stay competitive with ecommerce businesses? \nWeitz: Consumers expect a level of personalization online that’s missing in the physical retail environment. Technology helps retailers bring that personalization into the store. Some retailers give store associates the ability to create orders on a mobile device right in front of the customer. The customer gives their email address and the associate knows who the customer is. Customers light up when retailers know them. Now customers can touch the product in the store [and have that level of personalization]—that’s where retailers can differentiate from Amazon. “Customers light up when retailers know them.” \nTechnology also helps retailers bring that friction-free experience that I have online into the store. Think of doing a search online. You find what you’re looking for and you can make a decision in a few minutes. When you walk into a huge store, you have to find the right aisle, things could be out of stock and you have less information. When these two modalities collapse together, we see real gains for the retailers that get it right. \neMarketer: What new technology trends have popped up in the retail space? \nWeitz: One trend is using technology to shrink physical retail spaces. Retailers are thinking, how do I have a lightweight retail experience? How can I use technology to have a 1,000-square-foot storefront vs. a 6,000-square-foot storefront so that I can push more out there while carrying less work and capital on my books? \nThere are also trends like beacons, augmented reality [AR] and smart mirrors. Those are all interesting, but you have to be careful because they are [only] marginally valuable to the customer. Sometimes there are more systemic issues retailers have to tackle before they think about a smart mirror. \neMarketer: Augmented reality has been a hot topic since the Pokémon Go craze. What are the pros and cons of AR for retailers? “Before I do augmented reality or smart mirrors, how do I make sure that I still have customers to serve in five years?” \nWeitz: There is certainly a level of desire for augmented reality, but it’s a very expensive piece of technology. If as a retailer you have 1,000 outlets, can you afford to put that into all stores? Is it for an uplift in sales, or just a great PR stunt? Pokémon Go absolutely started a conversation about the power of these super computers in our pockets. \nIt’s interesting to think about AR in the sense of holding my phone up to a product and getting more information about the product. Imagine if I could overlay an Amazon level of reviews, information and pricing onto my physical experience? I haven’t seen that done yet, but retailers are looking at how it works. \neMarketer: What’s your advice for retailers as they plan for the next year? \nWeitz: Next year is a good year to focus on the basics. Stop and look at how easy, pleasurable and friction-free it is for a consumer to use your ecommerce site or come into your store. Then compare and contrast that experience with the best-in-class retailers. Ask yourself, before I do AR or smart mirrors, how do I make sure that I still have customers to serve in five years?

      "text": "  \nA Best Book of the Year Entertainment Weekly • Bustle • Amazon • Women’s National Book Association • Kirkus Reviews • BookPage • Kobo • LitReactor “Audacious and gutsy and heartbreaking — Dietland completely blew me away.” — Jennifer Weiner The diet revolution is here. And it’s armed. Plum Kettle does her best not to be noticed, because when you’re fat, to be noticed is to be judged. With her job answering fan mail for a teen magazine, she is biding her time until her weight-loss surgery. But when a mysterious woman in colorful tights and combat boots begins following her, Plum falls down a rabbit hole into the world of Calliope House — an underground community of women who reject society’s rules — and is forced to confront the real costs of becoming “beautiful.” At the same time, a guerilla group begins terrorizing a world that mistreats women, and Plum becomes entangled in a sinister plot. The consequences are explosive. “A giddy revenge fantasy that will shake up your thinking and burrow under your skin” ( Entertainment Weekly ), Dietland takes on the beauty industry, gender inequality, and our weight-loss obsession — with fists flying. Customer Reviews by Maines19 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and Plum, the protagonist of Dietland, dispenses advice to teens in the guise of a fashion editor and retreats from the barrage of real-world mockery and fat-shaming into an imaginary, post-weight-loss surgery future, until a woman who's been stalking her leaves her a book and introduces her to the daughter of a disgraced diet plan guru and a whole new plan. The satire is biting and the story nonstop, and Plum is a heroine for every woman. Loved it. Through the Looking Glass by CCheyne In addition to being a witty and thoughtful adventure, this book was consciousness-raising for me. I'll never look at myself or other women, no matter their size, the same again. And that's a good thing! I hated that it came to an end. Wish I could go live with Plum and all her friends forever! Brilliant - couldn't stop reading by I'm me who are you This is such an incredibly well written and detailed story. You go through Plum's thoughts and feelings, despair and triumphs. It was amazing!

      "text": "News Here's what your hardware needs for the AWS Greengrass IoT service Amazon's Greengrass offline IoT service will work on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410c board and should work with Raspberry Pi 3 U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 30, 2016 2:10 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nQualcomm's Snapdragon 410c developer board can be used to make robots, drones and IoT devices. Credit: Qualcomm Does the Cloud Free up the Enterprise? \nAmazon is bringing a bit of its AWS magic to devices and board computers with its Greengrass IoT service, which will help boost offline data collection and analysis. \nThe goal of Greengrass, an AWS software tool, is to make IoT devices and maker boards smarter. Even underpowered devices collecting data won't be \"dumb\" anymore, Amazon says. \nAmazon has kept in mind that smart devices can't always be connected to the cloud for data analysis, and Greengrass brings some AWS software tools to devices to aid in better collection and analysis of data. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nDeveloper boards are strongly tied to cloud services, which add more functionality to smart devices. Data collected from sensors are typically dispatched and collected in the cloud, where it can be analyzed and can define the next steps. \nSmarter sorting of data on IoT devices could speed up the analysis, and ensure the right data is sent to the cloud. Sending loads of useless IoT data to cloud services can eat up bandwidth and cost money. \nFor example, data from sensors in industrial equipment can be analyzed to improve manufacturing or cut down on injuries. In the petroleum industry, sensors can be used to collect data that could effectively nail down the geographic location of oil reserves. \nA robot or drone operator could offload basic training models to the devices to help in movement and navigation without being connected to the cloud. \n\"Code running in the field can collect, filter, and aggregate freshly collected data and then push it up to the cloud for long-term storage and further aggregation,\" Amazon said in a blog post . \"Further, code running in the field can also take action very quickly, even in cases where connectivity to the cloud is temporarily unavailable.\" \nMany developer boards are being used for IoT. Raspberry Pi started off as a hobbyist board but is now tied to cloud services like Microsoft's Azure and IBM's Bluemix. Greengrass will work with a large number of developer boards. \nGreengrass has some hardware requirements. It requires minimum memory of 128MB of memory and a 1GHz ARM or x86 CPU. A user needs to run the Amazon Linux or the Ubuntu OS. Qualcomm has said Greengrass will work on its Snapdragon 410c chip, and the offline IoT service likely work on Raspberry Pi, which meets the minimum requirements. \nOther major developer boards like Orange Pi and Pine64 also meet the minimum requirements. Samsung's Artik developer board is tied tightly to Artik Cloud but is not friendly to other cloud services. \nAmazon said Greengrass will work on Intel hardware. However, the company could not immediately say if Intel developer boards like Joule would work with Greengrass. \nQualcomm said it believes Greengrass will be used by large-scale manufacturers making devices that rely on AWS cloud. \nAWS cloud services are wildly popular, and with Greengrass, more IoT devices could rely on the company's cloud.

      "text": "Amazon will literally truck your data into its cloud Its new 'Snowmobile' data truck offers 100PB of data transfer U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 30, 2016 1:10 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nA truck towing an AWS Snowmobile pulls into the Re:Invent keynote hall in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Does the Cloud Free up the Enterprise? \nIt can be hard moving large amounts of data to the cloud. Even with consistent 10 Gbps of data transfer, it would take years to get hundreds of petabytes from an on-premises data center to a public cloud provider. \nAmazon is aiming to speed that process up with a high-capacity data transfer product: a literal truck. The Snowmobile is a big, white semi-trailer that can hold 100PB of data. It will then get driven to an Amazon endpoint, and the data will be loaded into its public cloud storage. \nFor smaller migrations that can also benefit from processing at the edge, Amazon also announced a new Snowball Edge appliance that provides 100TB of storage, local compute power, and migration for handling data transfer and processing. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nThese new products, announced Wednesday, are aimed at helping companies get large amounts of data into Amazon’s cloud, which will then encourage them to stick with the company's services going forward. That’s especially important because the company charges for data egress, and the costs of a full migration to a competing cloud provider could be too much for some businesses to bear. \nFor companies that want to move large swaths of data, the Snowmobile could be a useful tool. Amazon will back it up to a customer’s data center, and the truck can handle data transfers of up to 1TB per second by hooking up multiple 40Gbps fiber connections. The Snowmobile can be filled in about 10 days at maximum speed, according to a blog post from AWS evangelist Jeff Barr. \nWhat's more, the truck is waterproof and can be parked in either covered or uncovered locations. \nAmazon takes the security of the trailer seriously — the company can provide security for the Snowmobile while it's located at a customer's data center and will provide an escort for the data to its destination. Each container will provide GPS tracking as well, and users' data is encrypted. \nThe trucks are already being used, including with one large customer who is undergoing a \"pretty gigantic\" migration, AWS CEO Andy Jassy said during a press conference. \nThe Snowball Edge, by contrast, is designed to be a more easily portable and compute-heavy appliance. Like its namesake, the Snowball migration appliance, it’s a ruggedized storage device that comes with an e-ink shipping label to get it back to Amazon for data transfer into AWS. \nIt holds 100TB of data, compared to the Snowball’s 80TB, and also sports a touchscreen for interacting with the device. That’s useful because the device is also able to handle data processing on-device using AWS Lambda functions, meaning the Snowball Edge is able to provide analytics on-device. The appliance can also do all its own data encryption, which makes transfer operations faster. \nThe Snowball Edge was designed to be useful for situations like research boats that don't have internet connectivity, Jassy said during his keynote address at Amazon's Re:Invent conference. A Snowball Edge can collect data, slice down a subset of key information for on-premises processing, and then send the rest of the data to Amazon's cloud. \nThe device was among a fleet of services that Amazon announced at Re:Invent, including new machine learning-driven APIs and major updates to its compute services.

      "text": "5 ways to make money on Amazon \n\nAmazon is a popular place for online shopping. The site has just about everything you could think of, and there are numerous ways to save, whether it's through free shipping, Amazon Prime deals, the Amazon Rewards card, or Amazon Mom deals. What some people don't know is that you can actually earn money on Amazon and have them pay you instead of just using the site for shopping online.\nHere are 5 of my favorite ways to earn money with Amazon.\n1. Sell Items From Your Home \nOne of the easiest ways to make money on Amazon is to sell items from your home online . If you have clothes, shoes, toys, books, electronics, etc. you might be better off listing the items online instead of trying to sell them at a garage sale or in person.\nIt's a bit more competitive to sell items on Amazon because tons of people are doing it, but you have the potential to reach a larger audience. They key with selling successfully on Amazon is to take good pictures and use specific keywords so people who are searching for the item you are selling can easily find your listing. If you're selling a specific product, like an iPhone for example, Amazon may already have a professional photo you can use in your listing. Amazon usually takes a small fee ($0.99 per item) out of each item you sell, so charge a realistic amount and consider the fee.\nIf you want to sell more than 40 items each month, you'll need to upgrade to a seller's account, which I will talk more about in my next point.\n2. Become a Third Party Seller \nIf you plan on selling items regularly and turning it into a business , it's best to upgrade to an Amazon seller account, which costs $39.99 per month. I know people who flip thrift store clothing to sell on Amazon each month, design coffee mugs, sell sports jerseys etc., so there are plenty of categories to choose from if you want to start your own side business selling items on Amazon. Plus, the more you list, the higher your earning potential can be.\nIf you're going to sign up for a professional sellers account on Amazon, consider taking advantage of the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) service. Instead of having to ship every single order you receive manually, you can use FBA, which allows Amazon to pick up items you're selling at your home, store them in their warehouse, and ship them for you whenever you receive an order.\nThis will save you a lot of time that would have been spent in the post office if you are selling multiple items each month. FBA is also pay as you go, so you are charged for storage space for the orders that are fulfilled. The cost of shipping is also included in your fees, so you don't have to worry about it when you make a sale.\n\n3. Become an Amazon Affiliate \nIf you're not interested in selling items on Amazon, you can promote them instead by becoming an Amazon Affiliate. If you own a website, blog, or even moderate an online group or forum, that means you have an audience, and you can use that to your advantage.\nIf you like to recommend helpful and quality products to people, odds are some of those items can be found on Amazon, and Amazon will pay you to refer people to purchase from them. You can join Amazon Associates, and depending on the product, you can earn anywhere from 4 – 10% of the purchase price for directing your audience to purchase the product for themselves.\nYou don't have to become a used car salesman to earn money with Amazon Associates. Your main priority should be considering what your audience truly needs and what will help them. For example, if you run a podcast and you have a lot of listeners who may be interested in starting a podcast of their own, you can create a tutorial guide that helps walk people through the process of launching a podcast step-by-step.\nWhen you mention the equipment you use, you can use an Amazon affiliate link, so if anyone purchases something, you'll get a commission for referring them. Bottom line, you're helping people learn something, being honest, and catering to their interests.\nOf course, when you promote something, whether it's written content, audio, video, or even a Facebook post, you must disclose that you are an Amazon affiliate and will earn a small commission if they purchase anything you recommend in the content.\n4. Get Paid for Completing Tasks Via Mechanical Turk \nAmazon Mechanical Turk has been around for several years. This site offers short tasks or 'HITs' that you can do to earn money. These tasks require little skill or equipment as long as you have a computer with internet and basic computer skills.\nSome of the tasks include things like transcription, data entry, information verification, etc. The pay won't allow you to quit your full-time job or anything, but it's a laid back way to earn extra money whenever you have spare time.\n\n5. Customer Service Jobs \nYou can actually work for Amazon as a customer service rep if you wish. There are always positions available around the holidays, so it wouldn't hurt to apply. I actually have a family member who recently got hired by Amazon. There are seasonal, full-time, and part-time customer service jobs available along with other remote work opportunities. You can check out current available positions here .\nHave you ever done any of these things to earn money with Amazon? Why or why not? \n5 ways to make money on Amazon is a post originally published on Everything Finance \nRELATED: Shop the best Amazon tech products ",

      "text": "Mark Stockwell/AP Amazon isn't always the cheapest. \nNow that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are in the bag, it’s a fine time for shoppers to assess which “deals” they’ve been seeing are actually deals . Here are some takeaways from the latest 2016 holiday season pricing research—and some strategies bargain-seeking shoppers should use going forward. \nAmazon Has Most Deals & Highest Discounts \nData collected by the pricing and product insight firm 360pi shows that Amazon.com has dramatically ramped up the number of products sold on the site for the holiday season. The number of products in the computer/electronics category was up 75% in November compared to the previous May, for example, while listings under Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry were up 55%. Unsurprisingly, tons of these items have been discounted recently. \nOverall, Amazon seems to have had the most items on sale and the highest average discounts during the recent frenzied Thanksgiving-Cyber Monday period. The e-commerce analytics firm Clavis Insight reported that the average Black Friday discount at Amazon was 42% off , compared to 33% at Walmart , 35% at Target , and 36% at Best Buy . Clavis says that Amazon has consistently had roughly four times as many promotional offers as Walmart too. . @Walmart has seen minimal change across their self- styled #CyberWeek with . @Amazon having 4x as many offers vs. #Walmart on each day pic.twitter.com/bE3nZExnVn \n— Clavis Insight (@ClavisInsight) November 28, 2016 \nBut Amazon Isn’t Always Cheapest \nBased on the numbers above, Amazon appears to be e-retail’s low-price leader. But as we’ve already reported , a retailer other than Amazon had the best prices more than half the time in a recent study from 360pi . Researchers compared 750 of Amazon’s Best Sellers at Amazon and Google Shopping and found that Amazon had the lowest prices only 25% of the time. In nearly 60% of searches, meanwhile, another seller popped up on Google Shopping with a better price than Amazon. Walmart specifically beat Amazon with lower prices on 20% of the top-selling toys. \nRead Next: Everything You Need to Know About Hatchimals, The Hottest Toy for the Holidays \nAmazon Prime members are more likely than other shoppers to simply buy at Amazon without shopping around, because they know they get free two-day shipping on most Amazon purchases and they tend to think the site has prices that are competitive if not the absolute cheapest. But as one of the shopping experts (and an active Amazon Prime member) at BradsDeals.com recently pointed out, “Because it’s so easy to buy stuff on Amazon, I often end up spending more on items I could get for MUCH less elsewhere — if I ever bothered to do my homework before pressing the checkout button.” \nShoppers should be particularly wary of items sold not by Amazon directly but by one of the many third-party sellers on the site. The item highlighted in the post was a special “Avengers” edition of Monopoly, which was listed at $40 by a third-party seller at Amazon, $19 when sold directly by Amazon—and only $10 from other retailers that popped up in a Google Shopping search. “The message is clear,” the BradsDeal.com post explains. “Buying something on Amazon — especially from a seller you don’t recognize — without double checking whether the price is right is a big mistake.” \nEven Bigger Discounts—and What They Mean \nExperienced Black Friday-Cyber Monday shoppers may view the 35% to 45% discounts cited above as unimpressive, and they’d sorta be right. After all, a whole host of retailers, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Eddie Bauer, Gap, Hollister, and Talbots were offering 50% off everything on Cyber Monday . \nWhat’s more, if you simply want to know which stores have the biggest Black Friday discounts , you can check out the research at WalletHub . At seven different stores (Shopko, Kohl’s , Gordmans, Harbor Freight, J.C. Penney , Stage, and Macy’s), the average discount of Black Friday sale items was 55% or higher. Macy’s led the pack for Black Friday 2016 discounting, with the average item marked down 63.4%. \nRead Next: Why All Those Great Holiday Deals Aren’t Really Great Deals \nThe complication is that the stores with the biggest discounts also tend to have the most inflated list prices. And when a discount is based on an unrealistic original price that no one ever pays, it’s basically meaningless. Shoppers can be overpaying when they think they’re getting a “deal” at 60% or even 70% off. \nConsumers have even filed lawsuits against Macy’s and J.C. Penney , among others, arguing that inflated list prices are fraudulent and exist only to manipulate shoppers. It’s your job as a savvy shopper to see through such marketing tricks and make wise purchasing decisions. You can do this by ignoring percentage discounts and instead deciding to buy based on your sense of value and what’s a good price for the item at hand. \nAnd of course: Shop around! Use Google Shopping or one of the many price-comparison apps out there to find out what retailer has the best price in head-to-head matchups. Even when a certain brand or style is sold exclusively by one store, you can search for similar goods to get a sense of whether the item you’re considering is a steal or a rip-off. \nOh, and if you’re purchasing anything at stores like Macy’s, Kohl’s, and J.C. Penney, be sure that you’re paying less than half of whatever the original price is. If you’re not getting at least that big of a discount at this time of year, you’re all buy guaranteed to be paying too much. ",

      "title": "Netflix And Amazon Have A New Battleground",
      "text": "Netflix And Amazon Have A New Battleground Dec. 1.16 \nNetflix will finally launch a download option, like Amazon has offered for years. \nThe new capability will significantly enhance Netflix's appeal to subscribers. \nHowever, the apparent exclusion of Amazon Fire may hurt Netflix more than Amazon. Introduction I have been a loud proponent of downloadable streaming video for quite a while now, and also bullish on the video services - principally Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Prime Video - which offer them. After years of insisting that downloads were not needed, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) has just announced that it too will offer download capability, effective immediately. I have spent the day more or less playing with all the different variants of the feature. Including on several different brands of phones and tablets and on a few different WiFi networks. I reviewed the official blog post making the announcement, as well as the new articles in the Help Center outlining the new capability. My impression is generally positive, with one significant qualifier. The Value Of Downloads First, the good news. Netflix now offers downloads. As a feature that wasn't being offered before that is now, that is an unambiguous positive. It will allow Netflix customers to continue to enjoy their subscriptions on airplanes and subways, as well as on long road trips far away from cell towers and other dead zones. This can only enhance the appeal of a Netflix subscription. And by finally matching Amazon in this regard, it may also give those who were considering dumping Netflix for Amazon's cheaper Prime service - which also comes with music streaming and free shipping - one more reason to stay. It is true that not everything in the Netflix catalog is downloadable, but I do not regard that as a substantial impairment. Amazon also has certain \"download gaps\" in its answer to coverage gaps, and it does not appear to have hurt the service's appeal to consumers. Nor is there really any reason it should. With literally thousands of titles available consumers do not need the entire catalog to be downloadable. They just need enough downloadable titles that they have something to watch when they are offline. At over 60 hours per month , Netflix users clearly have no trouble finding several titles that interest them at any given time. If a subscriber is currently jumping between three different TV series they like, for example, they only need one of them to be downloadable to make Netflix much more valuable to them. They will simply catch up to the other two when they return to civilizat- I mean, broadband connection. International Progress This new option may be especially significant on the international front. Netflix's domestic DVD and streaming operations are both in the black, but its international segment continues to post losses. Some territories are already profitable, but many others are struggling. One reason, among others, has been that lower-income nations have far less developed broadband networks. This means more people have no internet access at home except for their mobile devices, which come with tight data caps that make video streaming infeasible, at least on a regular basis. But many of them can access Internet somewhere over the course of the day. A cafe, a library, a government building, etc. That does them no good to stream live at home, but if they can walk to a public place, download a few titles, and then return home, the international appeal of Netflix in lower-income countries may be greatly strengthened. This will allow Netflix to hit break-even in more territories faster and accelerate the company's journey to sustained profitability internationally. That Leaves Just A Few Questions… Despite this, the news could have been even better. Netflix has indeed created a download feature, but unlike Amazon, it does not appear to have lifted all strings with regards to downloads. After using the feature and reading about it I still have a few questions. First, the articles themselves give little clarity with regard to the accounting of downloads. Do downloads count against the streaming limit in any way? And is there a cap on total titles downloaded at one time? Is the cap the same for Premium and Standard accounts? At least one limitation is already clear, and it may hurt Netflix substantially. Netflix appears to have used its new download feature as a way to strike against Amazon. As I've said before , one of Amazon's advantages in the streaming video sphere is that it makes its own hardware, the Fire line of tablets. In fact, when Amazon first launched downloads you could only use it on Fire devices. That restriction has since been lifted, but the ability to design hardware and video software together is still an advantage for the company. As is the opportunity it gives Amazon to showcase its own service to Fire owners, front and center, while making them go digging for Netflix in the app store. Netflix Sparring With Amazon Netflix probably won't be building hardware anytime soon, but it still seems to be looking for a way to counter Amazon's Fire advantage. While the press release today said that the service applied to both Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Android (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) devices, Amazon's Fire, which runs a forked version of Android, has been excluded. I confirmed this twice by checking to see if the app update which was pushed to all iOS and Android devices today was pending on my Fire devices (I own no less than five of them.) It was not. This is a real limitation, not a detail. Amazon Fire is the only major tablet vendor which is still growing sales globally , outside of China where domestic manufacturers continue to be favored by the government. It is the device of choice for an increasing number of customers. While it is possible some customers will consider the lack of Netflix downloads a reason not to buy a Fire, it is also just as possible that customers will see less value in Netflix, especially since Amazon Prime Video's catalog is continuing to grow in caliber itself. Slow Or Sly? It is almost certain that this constraint was imposed by Netflix, not by Amazon. Starz, another competitor video service which recently cut the cord and began offering an online subscription offering without a cable subscription, also incorporates downloads into its service. And when they announced the new download option earlier this year Amazon voiced no objection to including it on Fire. It is true that when Starz launched their new app it wasn't ready day-and-date on Fire like it was for iOS and Android. So it's possible no one is excluding anyone; maybe the Fire app is just still in the works. But given the increasingly sharp competition between Amazon and Netflix, it is also very possible that this is Netflix trying to get a leg up on an increasingly dangerous competitor. In which case it may have shot itself in the foot, since customers will not appreciate having their choice of devices constrained by Netflix. The war with Amazon, if that's what it is, is particularly unhelpful. Netflix is already challenging Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) and Disney (NYSE: DIS ) to remake the TV ecosystem. Adding Amazon to the enemies list is nothing but counterproductive, especially since many Amazon Prime subscribers continue to subscribe to Netflix as well. Conclusion I see Netflix's download option as a substantial positive, regardless, but it would be even stronger if these constraints weren't present. More clarity is needed from the company to investors about how this will work, exactly, as well as on the company's future relationship with Amazon. Nevertheless, Netflix downloads are long overdue, and investors should welcome their arrival.

      "text": "Amazon Created a Snowmobile to Backup Your Data! posted by @kaneshow - share Amazon announced a new service called \" Snowmobile ,\" which transports all of your company's data and backups. Amazon is offering to tow a 45-foot-long trailer full of hard drives to your data center, plug in to your servers and take off up to 100 petabytes (a petabyte is 1 million gigabytes) of data. With the new service, Amazon could ship one exabyte (an exabyte is 1,000 petabytes) of data in about six months, which would take roughly 26 years over a normal dedicated connection. The trailer is then transported to an Amazon data center where all the data is uploaded Amazon's cloud data storage services. You most likely won't be able to ship all the photos stuck on your laptop or phone, but if your Wi-Fi at work is super slow, definitely consider bringing this up in the next meeting to speed it up!

      "text": "Target , Wal-Mart and Kohl's each set some sort of online record over the five-day shopping extravaganza that ended with Cyber Monday, but blockbuster digital growth for many bricks-and-mortar retailers wasn't enough to close the gap with Amazon . \nAccording to new data by Slice Intelligence, which scanned more than 1 million online shopping receipts from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Amazon accounted for 30.9 percent of sales. It was followed by Best Buy at 7.4 percent, Target at 4.4 percent, and Wal-Mart at 4.1 percent. \nBest Buy, which entered the weekend fresh off a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report , saw the biggest improvement of the top 10 retailers, growing its share of spending by 1.3 points over 2015. Apple also recorded a gain, closing the gap with larger chains like Nordstrom and Kohl's.\n\nBut Wal-Mart, which said it saw a record number of visits on its website from the start of Black Friday through Cyber Monday, fell back in the rankings, according to Slice. Whereas Wal-Mart's share of spend dipped 1 point to 4.1 percent, Target eked out a small gain, pushing it to 4.4 percent of spending.\nMacy's , which suffered a massive site outage for much of Black Friday, saw its share dip slightly. \nBroadly speaking, the larger bricks-and-mortar chains are the ones that are more effectively competing with Amazon, Adobe's Mickey Mericle told CNBC earlier this week . Over the five-day shopping stretch, those bigger chains grew their online sales at roughly 2½ times the rate of smaller players, Mericle said. \n\"They've figured out the key, which we're seeing is really the combination of social and mobile and email,\" she said.",

      "text": "Amazon Is it possible to outsmart Amazon this holiday season? The Verge’s Lauren Goode discusses with Recode ’s Jason Del Rey and Kara Swisher on Too Embarrassed to Ask . share Asa Mathat If you’re paying $99 a year for Amazon Prime, your may want to go there when you do your holiday shopping. But there are a couple things to keep in mind , Recode ’s Jason Del Rey says. “Amazon is super-aggressive on pricing around the most popular products,” Del Rey said on the latest episode of Too Embarrassed to Ask . “So they give the perception that they have the best prices around, and oftentimes they do. But when you get into the ‘longer-tail products,’ so maybe not as popular, not best-sellers, they often find time to make a profit margin there.” In other words: Shop around! Though even when you can find a cheaper price, you may find that the savings are not worth it to make the leap — which is all by design. “I think it’s the brilliance of Prime, the psychological lock-in that some people feel,” Del Rey said. “‘I’m already spending $99 a year, let me feel like I’m getting my money’s worth.’ An extra 99 cents here or there may not be enough to move away from them.” On the new podcast, he also talked with Recode ’s Kara Swisher and The Verge’s Lauren Goode about why he expects an increase to the Prime membership cost “in the next two years,” and why drone delivery is still a ways off. Later in the show, the trio chatted about what to do if you haven’t been able to snag an NES Classic and why Apple Pay and Android Pay are probably safer than credit cards when you’re buying in-store.

      "text": "Amazon introduces ‘Snowmobile’ to transfer petabytes of data faster than ever   14:34   \nAmazon has revealed a new service to transfer hundreds of petabytes of data as soon as possible to the cloud. The transfer is far from regular, the data doesn’t go over the usual DSL, cable or fiber connection, neither is it wirelessly transmitted. Amazon’s solution exists of specially equipped trucks which the company has named Snowmobiles. \nThe company already offered special hardware to ship data safely to the cloud through a special external storage device called Snowball. This allowed users to physically move 80 terabytes of data, in one time, to the cloud. \nWith the new Snowmobiles the amount of storage that can be transferred is greatly increased, a single truck can transfer up to 100 petabytes. \nAmazon developed the solution as uploading so much data takes way too much time. “It will take 26 years to move an exabyte to the cloud over a 10Gbps connection”, according to Andy Jassy, CEO Of Amazon Web Services. The Snowmobile can be filled up with data in 10 days when it’s offered with a maximum speed of 1 terabyte per second, which is possible through several 40Gbps glass fiber connections with the truck. \nData on the Snowmobile is protected by multiple layers of security. This includes dedicated security personnel, GPS tracking, alarm monitoring, 24/7 video surveillance, and an optional escort security vehicle while in transit. Besides that, all data is encrypted with 256-bit encryption keys. \nSnowmobile pricing is based on the amount of data stored on the truck per month (Amazon lists an indicative price of $0.005/GB per month for provisioned capacity) and the service is only available in the United States.

      "text": "Melvins, Los Campesinos! & more on new Amazon indie holiday music comp By Rob Sperry-Fromm December 2, 2016 9:34 AM \nWe’re fully in holiday season, and that means tons of holiday music. One of the compilations that the alternative rock fan may be looking forward to is Amazon’s Indie For the Holidays playlist, which returns this year after a solid outing in 2015 . Amazon has already shared a couple of the songs from this year’s edition. It’s out today on Prime Music , and it features songs by The Album Leaf, Dandy Warhols, Tennis, Chris Staples , and more. \nEven if you don’t have Amazon Prime, you can stream the contributions from the Melvins and Los Campesinos! right now. \nThe Melvins contribute a cover of the always-scary “Carol of the Bells,” which Buzzo and company supply with more than enough grandiosity and menace. The Los Camepsinos! song comes from their 2014 Christmas EP. It’s called “When Christmas Comes (Boxing Day Version).” \nProceeds from the EP go to the Women’s Aid Christmas Appeal . Los Campesinos! also have an album and tour on the way, and they hit NYC at Warsaw on March 10 with Crying . Tickets for that are on sale now. \n<a href=\"http://loscampesinos.bandcamp.com/album/a-los-campesinos-christmas\">A Los Campesinos! Christmas by Los Campesinos!</a> \nIndie for the Holidays 02 “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” – Savoir Adore 03 “When Christmas Comes (Boxing Day Version)” – Los Campesinos! 04 “Carol Of The Bells” – Melvins 05 “Hard Candy Christmas” – Inger Loree & the Nymphs 06 “Christmas (The Way It Was Back Then)” – Chris Staples 07 “Azusa” – The Album Leaf 08 “Plastic Mistletoe” – Glint 09 Santa, Baby” – Red Rosamond 10 “Holiday Road” – Tennis 11 “Headphones For The Holidays” – Blake Hazard 12 “Silver Bells” – Dandy Warhols 13 “Ritmo De Vida” – Nortec Collective Presents Bostich + Fussible 14 “Snow” – Sam Evian 15 “Come On Home (It’s Christmas)” – PINS",

Having inspired millions of readers around the world, it clearly spoke to an urgent need in an increasingly time-pressured society. Now, in the highly anticipated sequel Making It All Work, Allen unlocks the full power of his methods across the entire span of life and work. While Getting Things Done functioned as an essential tool kit, Making It All Work is an invaluable road map, providing both bearings to help you determine where you are in life and directions on how to get to where you want to go. \nAs you can see, it is intended to supplement rather than replace.",

      "title": "Amazon's Kindle now lets you read e-books in Indian languages",
      "text": "By James Walker 1 hour ago in Technology Amazon has finally added support for several Indian languages to its Kindle e-reader. For the first time, books written in languages including Hindi, Tamil and Marathi are available to purchase from the Kindle store. \"Thousands\" are available at launch. Amazon has not previously offered content in local Indian languages, restricting the reach of the Kindle in the country. However, the company is increasingly focusing on growing its sales in India as the nation emerges into the digital age. Amazon expects India to surpass the U.S. market for Kindle sales within the next few years, The Times of India reported today. As such, it's investing more resources into expanding the content available there. Amazon's low interest in India and the complex nature of the local languages has previously made it reluctant to build support for them in the past. The company has now taken the task to heart though, ensuring all the Kindle's features are available in other languages. Note-taking and personalisation options will be offered in the supported languages, complete with custom typesetting for a comfortable reading experience. \"We have been working on innovations to make the experience the same as that for English,\" Sanjeev Jha, Kindle's director for content in India, told the Times of India . \"We had also learnings from launching in other languages. This is day and we will gather feedback to improve the offerings.\" The Indian e-book market has been slow to take off because few titles in the country are available digitally. Amazon said it has been working with Indian publishers to digitize popular titles in local languages. It can't convert every book though so it's focusing on only the most \"relevant\" material. From today, \"thousands\" of e-books written in the Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati and Malayalam languages are available to download and purchase from the Kindle's online store. The immediate availability of the titles will help to increase the Kindle's growing popularity in India, making the digital reading platform more accessible to native speakers. The changes don't just affect Amazon's dedicated Kindle e-readers. The company is also launching an update for the Kindle app on Android and iOS that adds support for Indian-language content. It is rolling out through the app stores today. \"We are excited to offer readers the largest digital selection of best sellers in five Indian languages,\" Rajiv Mehta, Kindle India Country Manager, said to Mashable . \"All you need is an Android or iOS device, or a Kindle eReader to get started. This is another step in our ongoing work to provide more choice and selection to Indian readers.\" As Amazon has been making the headlines in India today, it's also been attracting attention for less positive reasons. The company has announced a recall of some Kindle Fire power adapters in the UK. Amazon said the adapter's assembly could detach and deliver an electric shock while being unplugged. Customers can exchange their power adapters for a free replacement. Devices including Amazon's child-friendly Fire Kids tablet are affected.",

      "title": "How to Delete Your Amazon Account",
      "text": "Deleting your Amazon account is the only way to completely erase your purchase history. If you want to delete your account for good, here’s how to give yourself a clean slate. What You Need to Know \nYour Amazon account is shared across Amazon’s websites, so if you delete it, you’ll lose access to Amazon.com as well as international stores like Amazon.co.uk and Amazon-owned sites like Audible.com. You won’t be able to sign into any website you use your Amazon account for. Your Amazon Payments account will also be shut down. \nYou’ll lose access to basically everything. Any open orders will be cancelled, subscriptions like Amazon Prime will immediately end, and you’ll lose any Amazon gift card balance in your account. You won’t be able to return purchased items for a refund or replacement. Digital content you purchased will be gone, and you won’t be able to redownload Kindle eBooks, Amazon videos, music, digital software and games, and whatever other digital content you might own. \nAmazon will also delete your account’s purchase history and customer data, so any reviews, discussion posts, and photos you’ve uploaded to Amazon’s website will also be erased. RELATED ARTICLE How to Archive and Better Manage Your Amazon Orders \nClosing your account and creating a new one is the only way to erase your Amazon purchase history. However, you can “archive” some of your orders to make them less visible in the list of previous purchases. \nThis is an unusual step to take. You don’t need to close your account if you just want to cancel Amazon Prime, change your email address, or remove a payment method. You can do this all without closing an account. But if you really want to, here’s what you’ll need to do. How to Close Your Amazon Account \nYou’ll need to contact Amazon customer support to close your account, but Amazon offers a streamlined process for doing so. \nVisit the Contact Us page on Amazon’s website to get started. Sign in with the Amazon account you want to close. \nClick “Prime or Something Else” at the top of the customer support page. \nUnder the “Tell us more about your issue” section, select “Account Settings” in the first box and “Close My Account” in the second box. \nYou’ll have to talk to Amazon’s customer support staff about this. Under the “How would you like to contact us?” section, choose either “Email”, “Phone”, or “Chat”. \nWe recommend selecting “E-mail”, which seems to be the quickest method. You’ll need to receive an email as part of the account deletion process, anyway. Amazon’s staff won’t immediately delete your account if you contact them over the phone or online chat. \nTell Amazon’s customer support staff you want to close your account and provide a reason. \nAmazon’s customer support staff will contact you by email with more warnings about what you’ll lose when you delete an account. They’ll also try to figure out what problem you’re having and offer other possible solutions. But, if you’re sure you do want to close your account, they’ll help you do so. \nFollow the instructions Amazon emails you to confirm you actually do want to close your account. Amazon will then close your account and you’ll be free to make a new one with a fresh purchase history, if you like.",

      "text": "Amazon’s cloud: Big and growing bigger by the day Originally published December 2, 2016 at 11:12 am A data point thrown out by one of Amazon’s tech gurus at its re:Invent conference testifies to the immense growth of its cloud operation. Share story Ángel González Seattle Times business reporter \nThe mass migration of data and computing power from privately owned data centers to those operated by Amazon.com, Microsoft and other competitors is one of the biggest business stories of our time. But sometimes the growth of the so-called “cloud” is hard to grasp. \nBut here’s one way to look at it: every single day, Amazon’s cloud computing business adds enough server capacity to support the data storage and computing needs the online tech giant had in 2005, when it had revenue of $8.49 billion. That’s about the revenue of a middling Fortune 500 company. \nThe figure comes from James Hamilton, a high-ranking tech guru at Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud computing unit. “This is a crazy number. Think what it means,” Hamilton told an audience of cloud enthusiasts and developers Tuesday at AWS’ re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. \nIt certainly means a lot of building or leasing of warehouses, shipping servers, consuming power and such. In other words, the cloud, esoteric as it seems, relies on a very brick-and-mortar reality that needs to be continually expanded, at a cost of billions. Most Read Stories",

Xbox gift cards are good for just about anything in the Xbox or Windows stores, including games, movies, TV shows and apps. Amazon even lets you get your Xbox cards in digital code form, so you can email the cards directly to the Halo fanatics in your life and let them get right to shopping. \nPlayStation Store Gift Card Picture 2 of 18 Few gifts are better than the gift of choice. A PlayStation Store gift card lets you buy not only hit games such as Uncharted 4 and No Man's Sky, but also the wealth of TV shows, movies and game add-ons available on Sony's online marketplace. PlayStation cards are available as digital codes, making them a good gift even if you wait until Christmas morning to buy one. \nSteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad Picture 3 of 18 No PC gaming setup is complete without a mouse pad to protect both your peripheral and your desk. The SteelSeries QcK is one of the simplest and most straightforward mouse pads on the market featuring a cloth front, a rubber back, and nothing else that could come between you and your games. The most common model is 12 x 10 inches, but you can get larger ones, if you need. Pokémon Sun and Moon Picture 4 of 18 Whether the gamer in your life is a diehard Pokémon fan or is hooked via Pokémon Go, the upcoming Sun and Moon installments for Nintendo 3DS make a great gift. This pair of new Pokémon games bring some exciting new wrinkles to the series' monster-catching gameplay, including four-way battles and a fresh tropical setting.\nLogitech G230 Stereo Headset Picture 5 of 18 Not all good gaming headsets cost hundreds of dollars. The budget-minded Logitech G230 offers great sound for its price, sweat-proof ear cups and a noise-cancelling boom microphone, making it ideal for long multiplayer sessions. And while the G230 is made for PC, its analog cable means it can work with PS4, Xbox One and even mobile devices. \nSteam Controller Picture 6 of 18 Shopping for gamers who do their PC gaming in the living room? The Steam Controller makes a perfect gift. This unique controller trades traditional joysticks for circular haptic pads, allowing you to perform mouse-and-keyboard functions without cluttering your lap. It's also highly programmable, so you can make all kinds of custom profiles for your favorite games.\nUncharted 4: A Thief's End Picture 7 of 18 Quite possibly the PS4's best game yet, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End wraps up the beloved action/adventure series with a gripping story and some of the most gorgeous visuals of any game on the console. If the gamer you're shopping for likes titles that are as cinematic as they are action-packed, Uncharted 4 is a no-brainer. \nNES Classic Picture 8 of 18 \n\nRelive the glory days of the Nintendo Entertainment System with the NES Classic . This miniature console comes preinstalled with 30 beloved Nintendo games, from Super Mario Bros. to Castlevania, and from The Legend of Zelda to Mega Man 2. While the system (and controller cords) are smaller than you remember, it comes with an HDMI hookup for modern TVs.\nDualShock 4 Wireless Controller Picture 9 of 18 PS4 players need extra controllers to enjoy local multiplayer hits like Rocket League and Street Fighter V. And if you're going to give someone a new DualShock 4, why not make it a stylish one? Sony's gamepad is available in white, red, blue and gorgeous gray-blue, as well as in extra-distinct urban camouflage. \nSeagate Backup Plus 1TB Hard Drive Picture 10 of 18 If you're an avid Xbox One gamer, the system's 500GB of storage will fill up with games fast. Fortunately, the system works with external hard drives, and Seagate's 1TB drive is a perfectly affordable way to store your favorite games (and take them with you). It also works perfectly well as an everyday storage drive for PC. \nXbox Design Lab Controller Picture 11 of 18 \n\nIf you want to give the Xbox fan in your life something truly special, why not order a custom controller? The Xbox Design Lab lets you create one of 8 million possible color combinations, whether you want to evoke your loved one's favorite sports team or just make something zany. Design Lab controllers also sport newly textured grips and Bluetooth support, making them great PC gaming pads. \nSamsung Gear VR Picture 12 of 18 The Oculus Rift and HTC Vive may be pricey, but if the virtual reality lover on your list has a Samsung phone, you can get a gift of one of the best headsets around for less than $100. Compatible with most of Samsung's newer handsets, the Gear VR offers a rich selection of fun games and immersive entertainment experiences, no fancy PC rig required.\nNew Nintendo 3DS (Super Mario 3D Land Edition) Picture 13 of 18 Don't let its cute looks deceive you — the Nintendo 3DS hosts some of the best games of this generation, including some of the top Zelda, Pokemon and Fire Emblem titles out there. This special New Nintendo 3DS bundle packs in the excellent Super Mario 3D Land, as well as two interchangeable cover plates that will let you show off your favorite Italian plumber in style.\nMerax Ergonomic High Back Reclining Chair Picture 14 of 18 Gaming all day sounds pretty relaxing, but it can lead to some serious back pain if you're not seated properly. The Merax Ergonomic reclining chair is perfect for the marathon gamer, with back, head and armrests as well as wheels that let you freely swivel around your command center. \nXbox One S Halo Collection Bundle Picture 15 of 18 The Xbox One S is a steal on its own at $299, thanks to its radically slimmed-down design and ability to play Blu-rays and streaming video in 4K. Throw in Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo 5, and you've got a must-have package that lets you play every core installment in Microsoft's beloved shooter series right out of the box. \nPlayStation VR Launch Bundle Picture 16 of 18 PlayStation VR is almost here, and the headset's launch bundle has everything you need to get started with virtual reality on your PS4. In addition to the headset, this package includes a motion-tracking PlayStation camera, two PlayStation Move controllers and a copy of PlayStation VR Worlds, which collects a bunch of exciting mini-games that showcase just how much fun Sony's VR headset can be.\nAlienware Alpha R2 Picture 17 of 18 If the console gamer in your life is looking to go PC, the Alienware Alpha offers the best of both worlds. This small desktop will look right at home in your living room, while benefitting from Steam's massive game library and also functioning as a dependable everyday Windows PC. The Alpha also supports Alienware's Graphics Amplifier for when you’re ready to game in virtual reality.\nXbox Gift Card PlayStation Store Gift Card SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad Pokémon Sun and Moon Logitech G230 Stereo Headset Steam Controller Uncharted 4: A Thief's End NES Classic DualShock 4 Wireless Controller Seagate Backup Plus 1TB Hard Drive Xbox Design Lab Controller Samsung Gear VR New Nintendo 3DS (Super Mario 3D Land Edition) Merax Ergonomic High Back Reclining Chair Xbox One S Halo Collection Bundle PlayStation VR Launch Bundle Alienware Alpha R2",

      "text": "Alexa, Tell Me Where You’re Going Next Amazon’s VP of Alexa talks about machine learning, chatbots, and whether industry is strip-mining AI talent from academia. In the Game of Thrones -like artificial intelligence competition between Houses Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, the company most reticent to speak about its technology has usually been the one that ships planeloads full of stuff to consumers, hosts thousands of companies in its data centers, greenlit Catastrophe , and has a breakaway hit product that answers questions, plays music, and 4,998 or so other things. Yes, for some time, Amazon has been even more shrouded than the famously secret Apple, which opened up about its machine learning programs earlier this year. Lately, however, Amazon’s head scientist and vice president of Alexa, Rohit Prasad, has been speaking up in public, making the case for his company’s prowess in voice recognition and natural language understanding. Alexa, of course, is the conversational platform that supports that aforementioned hit product, Echo .\nToday Prasad is giving an Alexa “State of the Union” address at the Amazon Web Services conference in Las Vegas, announcing an improved version of the Alexa Skills Kit , which helps developers create the equivalent of apps for the platform; a beefed-up Alexa Voice Service , which will make it easier to transform third-party devices like refrigerators and cars into Alexa bots; a partnership with Intel; and the Alexa Accelerator that, with the startup incubator Techstars , will run a 13-week program to help newcomers build Alexa skills. Prasad and Amazon haven’t revealed sales numbers, but industry experts have estimated that Amazon has sold over five million Echo devices so far.\nPrasad, who joined Amazon in 2013, spent some time with Backchannel before his talk today to illuminate the direction of Alexa and discuss how he’s recruiting for Jeff Bezos’s arsenal without drying up the AI pipeline. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nSteven Levy: You’re a VP of Alexa. Tell me where things stand with it in 2016. \nRohit Prasad Rohit Prasad: We’re excited about where things are. We did several device launches and also expanded internationally. And we’ve made huge progress in teaching Alexa to better understand you, both in terms of the surface area Alexa covers, as well as accuracy within search material. For instance, think about music as a domain: We have new capabilities [for] you [to be] able to search for or play a song, based on its lyrics. And lastly is the speed at which third-party skills are being built. Earlier this year we had only a few hundred, and now we are in the 5,000 range.\nWhat are the conversational aspirations for the Alexa platform? Are our Echos something we should be talking to, or talking with? \nAlexa is already providing a large set of utilities and experiences, where a few one-shot intents work with very high accuracy. From a conversational aspect, I think there a lot of trade-offs on doing it right. Alexa shouldn’t come back and ask you [needless] questions. That would be really frustrating. But Alexa should always ask a question when needed, and the ability to have a conversation is super important as well. Are you aware of the Alexa Prize competition?\nThis is the $2.5 million challenge to computer science students that you announced in September? \nYes. In academia it’s hard to do research in conversation areas because they don’t have a system like Alexa to work with. So we are making it easy to build new conversational capabilities with a modified version of the Alexa skills kit. This grand challenge is to create a social bot that can carry on a meaningful, coherent, and engaging conversation for 20 minutes.\nWould that be a Turing-level kind of conversation, do you think? \nNo, the Turing test comes down to human gullibility — can you fool an outsider into thinking it’s a human? If you think about certain tasks, Alexa is already better than a human. It’s super hard for a human to play a particular song out of millions of catalog entries within a second, right? If you ask Alexa to compute factorial of 60, that’s hard for a human. So we definitely did not want it to be like a Turing test. It’s more about coherence and engagement.\nWhat are people going to be talking about in these 20 minute conversations with Alexa? \nWe are giving topics. Like, “Can you talk on the trending topics in today’s newspaper?” We expect the social bot to be able to chat with you on topics like scientific inventions, or the financial crisis.\nHave you had a lot of responses to the challenge? \nWe got an overwhelming number of applications, hundreds and hundreds. We are providing funding to university students — these are grad students who are also taking time off from their research, or hopefully it’s very aligned with their research, so we wanted to make sure that they have sponsorship for the compelling application of speech. We got so many that we couldn’t decide on the original ten we had planned, and we ended up funding twelve teams .\nBecause of the huge demand in corporations for the best students in AI and machine learning, there’s worry that academia might lose its core talent. \nIt is a concern. This is one of the reasons that I was motivated to start the Alexa Prize. We want to build the next generation of machine learning and AI scientists, and academia plays an important role in that. I think it would be very myopic and very scary if every professor moved to companies like us.\nOn the other hand, you are obviously hiring AI talent, competing with with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and even traditional companies. What’s the pitch that you give potential recruits to come to Amazon? \nI don’t think I should answer that, because those other companies will copy it.\nActually, if you answer it well, those people might read it here and apply to work at Amazon .\nWhat’s unique about research in a company like Amazon is the combination of data, computing power, and the best minds in the world all coming together to solve a customer-facing problem. Working on a customer-facing problem doesn’t take away the innovation — it actually accelerates innovation. The problems we try to solve at Amazon are all super, super hard. When Alexa started, solving speech recognition and natural language understanding across many different domains was clearly a very, very hard problem.\nToday you are announcing new tools that will help developers, right? \nYes. One of the key things we want to make simple for developers is what we call “built-in intent” and “slot types.”\nExplain, please. \nIn most skills, people will want to say things like, “Alexa, stop.” Or “cancel.” You want those commands, or intents, to be exposed to the developer, rather than trying to tell developers to build customized versions of things like the cancel/stop intent. Slot types are things like city names, vocabulary items. We had previously done a handful of them, things developers use quite often — around 10 intents and 15 slot types. So as part of third-party skills we’re announcing a larger set of hundreds built-in functions — slot types — across different domains, like books, video, or local businesses. And also a large set of intents as well, which help answer queries that people ask Alexa.\nSo in other words, if I’m the developer, I can rely on your built-in vocabulary and your interpretation of synonyms, in order to make my skill smarter off the bat. And you’re doing more. \nExactly. It gives you a much better starting point for interaction with skills. We’re announcing this as a developer preview, because of two reasons. One is, we want to see how people use these in their intents, because we have a certain mindset of how these intents and types should be used. But the developer may have a slightly different mindset. And the customer may use it slightly differently as well. We want to make sure that we get some feedback from the developers and continually improve these, and we will keep adding more and more built-ins.\nRight now, when users invoke a skill on Echo, the mind of Alexa, to some degree, gets turned over to that developer. So what you’re implementing today is a step toward a standard Alexa vocabulary and means of execution that developers will plug into? \nYou’re absolutely right, this creates a common vocabulary which works for sharing and for helping Alexa itself to become better and better. Developers can integrate this new functionality so that they don’t have to recreate the same things.\nMy issue with Alexa is I’m just overwhelmed by what is available. Generally, you have to know that a skill exists in order to invoke it. Now that you are at 5,000 skills and counting, how can a user keep up? \nWe definitely want Alexa to tell you how to accomplish your query through a third-party skill, even if you don’t have knowledge of the skill. We haven’t done it yet, but definitely that’s something on our roadmap. Having a common vocabulary helps get us to that connection.\nAmazon is only one of several companies using AI to build a conversational interface. What’s unique about your approach? \nThe hands-free ability is key. That’s the killer application for speech. If you think about Alexa and Echo in particular, there was no cop-out in terms of solving the hard problem of interaction without a screen. So our thinking, from the get-go, was very different from other companies in terms of how conversation interface should be. It wasn’t like on a phone; it was a completely dedicated device which didn’t have a screen. We had to solve the hard problem.\nWhat about people who are concerned about having an open mic in the home? What can you tell people who are worried about, “Oh my god, Amazon is listening to me all the time!” \nPrivacy is important, and we are being very, very transparent about how we are approaching this. The cloud is not listening to you. It’s only on the device, acting as a detector, not a recognizer recognizing all words. It’s detecting whether Alexa is spoken versus something else. Once it determines Alexa was spoken to the device at a very high confidence, only then do we start streaming to the cloud.\nWill Alexa become proactive like Google Now or Apple notifications? Maybe telling me, if it hears me knocking around the house, that I should leave because I’m late for an appointment? \nWe’ve definitely thought about it. Because there’s no screen on Echo, there are some new [challenges] to it. We want to do things right with anything in terms of the kind of notifications you’re talking about. But right now I can’t reveal our exact approach to that.\nRight now, people pretty much have to choose one conversational interface for their assistant. Will we ever see some mashup where Alexa, Cortana, Google Home, or Samsung Viv, or whatever, all work together? \nIt’s very early days in these conversational settings. Having seen this for 20-plus years I still feel that the [intellectual property] of Alexa and Echo are revolutionary material, specifically in terms of interface. I think it remains to be seen; every company has a different set of offerings so you can imagine that there would be multiple AIs. But in terms of interoperation, it’s too early to tell.\nEcho, and the Alexa technology, seemed to come as a surprise to a lot of us, and at first people thought it was intended as a quick way to buy products from Amazon. Now it’s one of Amazon’s most popular products and a significant platform. Has your mission shifted? \nI wouldn’t say the mission has shifted. We are still very much doing things that we said three years back we should be doing. Right now there’s just a lot to do to make Alexa even more magical for our customers.",
