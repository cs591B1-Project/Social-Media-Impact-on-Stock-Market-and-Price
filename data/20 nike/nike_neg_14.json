      "text": "Under Armour Clinches First Pro-Sports Deal; Nike Gets Nod From HSBC (Investor's Business Daily) \nHSBC upgraded shares of Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) to Buy from Hold, saying the reality isn't that grim. In fact, the brokerage said Nike could be a good stock for 2017 and beyond. \nInvestors have become cautious on Nike due to concerns that the company is losing share to Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA ) in basketball to adidas AG (ADR) (OTC: ADDYY ) in lifestyle. Further, Nike has had to deal with excess inventory that should weigh on its second quarter, which will be reported on December 20. \n“Besides, visibility on mid- to high single-digit reported sales growth and limited margin compression we feel is very high for this year and beyond, and these are not exactly metrics to be ashamed of,” analyst Erwan Rambourg wrote in a note. \nRambourg noted that though alternative brands may be gaining share at times, Nike is set for superior growth and returns long term, with several margin driving levers to pull during lower growth times like now. \nOn the valuation front, the analyst now sees the stock trading below 20x forward PE, a level “we find very compelling given our bullish stance on the fundamentals of the sporting goods industry and the quality of Nike’s management team and track record in terms of growth, cash returns and communication.” \nFor the second quarter, Rambourg expects EPS of $0.41, and sales of $8.055 billion, below consensus estimate of $0.43/$8.108 billion. \nThe analyst increased his target price to $60 from $56. \nAt last check, shares of Nike rose 3.25 percent to $52.10.

      "text": "Under Armour is out to prove it’s playing in the big leagues. The Baltimore-based sporting goods company announced today that it has entered into a 10-year deal with Major League Baseball to be its official uniform provider, beginning in the 2020 season.\nThe partnership is the company’s first-ever professional league uniform deal (terms of which were not disclosed), and it’s a big one for Under Armour. It’s debatable how lucrative it will ultimately prove, given that baseball is currently struggling to attract a younger audience in the US. But it shows that Under Armour can play on the same field as its more-established rivals, Nike and Adidas.\nUnder Armour has taken off since Kevin Plank founded the company in 1996, starting with just a single sweat-wicking undershirt for athletes . It has steadily expanded despite the stiff competition, and enlisted global superstars such as Stephen Curry and Michael Phelps to help it build its brand. Beginning in early 2015, it even overtook Adidas for more than a year as the number two sportswear company behind Nike in the US, though Adidas reclaimed the position in October.\nRecently the company has been taking further steps to portray itself as a sportswear powerhouse on Nike’s and Adidas’ level. In July, for instance, it announced it would take over the former FAO Schwarz space on 5th Avenue in New York. It’s a roughly 53,000-square-foot space on the most expensive retail strip in the world.\n“The reason that we did that store was a lot of things,” Plank later explained at WWD’s Apparel & Retail CEO Summit in October. “First of all was to put a flag out there. You have to build product for the biggest and the best.”\nThe deal with MLB shows Under Armour planting another flag—one that could help raise its visibility. Admittedly, baseball, for various reasons , doesn’t have the television audience it once did, and doesn’t sell sneakers the way basketball does (though Under Armour does the bulk of its sales in apparel anyway). It’s not likely Nike or Adidas would have been interested in a similar deal. But for a company whose profile, while growing, isn’t yet at the level of Nike or Adidas, baseball’s still strong attendance record , and the fact that eventually everyone who watches a game will see jerseys “featuring prominent Under Armour branding,” is a strong plus.\nFanatics, a licensed sports merchandiser, was also involved in the transaction. It gets the licensing rights to manage the manufacturing and distribution of Under Armour fan gear, such as jerseys, which the two companies expect to have available prior to the 2020 season.",

      "text": "Getty/Justin Berl \nIn Under Armour's 20-year history, one milestone has eluded it: the coveted major-league wide endorsement deal.\nNo longer, as MLB and Under Armour just announced they entered into the a 10-year long exclusive deal to design and manufacture the uniforms for all 30 teams. In addition to on-field uniforms, the deal includes base layers and game day outerwear.\nThe deal will commence in 2020, and current MLB uniform maker Majestic Athletics's 5-year deal expires. Financial terms for the deal were not revealed. Also announced for the deal: ecommerce platform Fanatics will become official retailer and distributor for the MLB uniforms.\nUnder Armour previously had deals to provide base layers, cleats, and other equipment officially for the MLB uniform kits. \nDeals like these are increasingly important for sportswear makers looking to cash in on official replica uniform sales and the halo effect it creates. Increased competition has led to higher price tags on the deals, and the last major league endorsement deal — Nike's 8-year deal with the NBA signed in 2015 and taking over for Adidas in the 2017-18 season — was valued at more than $1 billion, sources told the Wall Street Journal .\nNike also has a exclusive deal with the NFL. Adidas-owned Reebok has an exclusive deal with NHL, while the mainline Adidas brand has a deal with Major League Soccer.\nThe MLB and Under Armour deal represents a shift in strategy for the brand, who previously focused on sponsoring NCAA teams and inking deals with athletes before they hit their prime.\nNOW WATCH: A style expert explains what 'business casual' actually means \n",

      "title": "UPDATE: Bill Gates reveals his favorite books of 2016",
      "text": "By Silvia Ascarelli, MarketWatch\nThe Microsoft co-founder on Nike, tennis, genes, political leadership and the power grid\nBill Gates is once again displaying his eclectic taste in books as he offers up his favorite reads of 2016, ranging from a book on tennis to another example of \"mundane stuff that are actually fascinating.\"\nThe Microsoft(MSFT) co-founder and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says the one common theme (http://b-gat.es/2gKVMwD) is \"they all dropped me down a rabbit hole of unexpected insights and pleasures.\"\nGates says he's been reading about a book a week since childhood. The typical American reads just four in a year (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/09/01/book-reading-2016/), according to Pew Research Center, and 26% of Americans haven't cracked open a book (including audio books and e-books) in the past year (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/).\nHere's what caught his attention this year:\n\"String Theory\" by David Foster Wallace\nConsider this one for your tennis-loving friends. The book, published is May, is a collection of five essays on the sport\n\"Here, as in his other brilliant works, Wallace found mind-blowing ways of bending language like a metal spoon,\" Gates says. Read more about why he likes the book here (http://b-gat.es/2gKNpRU).\n\"Shoe Dog\" by Phil Knight\nKnight is the co-founder of Nike Inc., and Gates describes the book, published in April, as \"a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like: messy, precarious and riddled with mistakes.\" Here's his full assessment (http://b-gat.es/2fQ7AJE).\n\"The Myth of the Strong Leader\" by Archie Brown\nThis book, published in 2014, focuses on political leadership, and Gates says he read it because of this year's election battle. Brown, he concludes, \"shows that the leaders who make the biggest contributions to history and humanity generally are not the ones we perceive to be 'strong leaders.' Instead, they tend to be the ones who collaborate, delegate and negotiate -- and recognize that no one person can or should have all the answers.\"\nHis full review is here (http://b-gat.es/2fPYFaZ).\n\"The Gene: An Intimate History\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee\nRead this to get a glimpse of the future of genome science, including the ethical questions it will bring. Genome-editing technologies will affect us all, and this Columbia University doctor has written the book for non-scientists.\n\"It's one thing to reprogram the code that runs our computers. Reprogramming the code that runs our species is a very different thing altogether,\" Gates wrote in a November blog post (https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Gene) that included this video interview:\n(https://youtu.be/yNlRE2WmcQc)\nHere's his full book review (http://b-gat.es/2fPXCb9).\n\"The Grid: The Fraying Wires Between Americans and Our Energy Future\" by Gretchen Bakke\nThis is the one on mundane but fascinating stuff, and Gates gives it an honorable mention.\nHere's his take: \"Even if you have never given a moment's thought to how electricity reaches your outlets, I think this book would convince you that the electrical grid is one of the greatest engineering wonders of the modern world. I think you would also come to see why modernizing the grid is so complex and so critical for building our clean-energy future.\"\nThere's no full review by Gates for this one. The book was published in July.\nGates recommended a different set of five books (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-books-bill-gates-wants-you-to-read-this-summer-2016-05-17) this summer. Here's his list of favorites from 2015 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-lists-the-best-books-hes-read-this-year-2015-12-07) and 2014 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-five-best-books-bill-gates-read-in-2014-2014-12-10).\n-Silvia Ascarelli; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nRELATED: 6 books that influence guru Robert Cialdini wants you to read (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-books-that-influence-guru-robert-cialdini-wants-you-to-read-2016-10-05)\nRELATED: 6 books recommended by Richard Thaler, a founding father of behavioral economics (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-books-recommended-by-richard-thaler-a-founding-father-of-behavioral-economics-2016-07-05)\nRELATED: 20 books that make Amazon's best of 2016--at midyear (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/20-books-that-make-amazons-best-of-2016so-far-2016-06-22)\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-05-16 1301ET\n ",

      "text": "Nike Will Win College Football Championship (NKE, UA) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 1:01 PM EST \nThe College Football Playoff had been determined, with the following four teams being selected: Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, and Washington. From an investment angle, what stands out about this list is that all four teams sport the NIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) swoosh. According to SB Nation, Washington will wear the Speed Machine Hypercool while the other three teams will wear the Nike Vapor Untouchable Speed uniform. The swoosh will be seen on the jersey and pants of all four teams, and for all viewers to see. \nAccording to The New York Times, the College Football Championship game last year, where Alabama beat Clemson 45-40, had 25.7 million viewers. This was a year-over-year decline of 23%, when Ohio State beat Oregon 42-20. That’s a substantial decline, but it relates to which teams make it to the championship game, not declining popularity in college football. Also consider that 25.7 million people is still a lot of viewers, and that the 25.7 million viewers for last year was just for the College Football Championship game and doesn’t include the semifinal games. \nUnder Armour, Inc. ( UA ) has been making strides in sponsorship deals with teams and athletes, but this story continues to repeat itself – just when Under Armour (or one of its peers) begins to gain ground on Nike, Nike funds a way to pull further ahead. The exposure Nike will gain from all four college football playoff teams wearing the swoosh will resonate with young consumers. Nike is likely rooting for Ohio State to make it to the championship game, simply because it draws the most viewers. However, Nike can’t really lose no matter how it plays out. Under Armour will continue to push for more exposure on the college gridiron, but it’s going to have to sit this year's postseason on the bench. \nNKE has depreciated 23.02% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.42.",

      "text": "Nike Trading Higher On Upgrade (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 11:02 AM EST \nNIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) just got a boost from Erwan Rambourg, Global Co-Head of Consumer and Retail Research at HSBC. Rambourg upgraded NKE to “buy” from “hold” and raised his price target to $60 from $56. NKE is currently trading at $51.86. This might represent the beginning of a shift in analyst opinions on Nike. FindTheCompany | Graphiq \nIn September, Nike was downgraded by Piper Jaffray to “neutral” from “overweight.” The primary reason for the downgrade was competition. Analyst Erinn Murphy stated, “We are downgrading our investment rating on NKE from OW to Neutral following our multi-market visits in Germany, UK & France this past week. While we believe in the brand long-term, the resurgence of Adidas has taken a toll on Nike's growth rate in the region. \nIf you pay attention to the footwear market, then you know things have changed, and fast. Nike’s launch of its HyperAdapt 1.0 has taken the media by storm. The self-lacing shoes are selling for $720, but Nike’s angle is likely to drive excitement now in order to lower the price on later versions and sell to a broader audience in the future. (See also, Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Gets Big Exposure on T.V. ) \nAdditionally, Nike has opened its tech-based 55,000-square-foot store in SoHo, New York City. This has been bad news for local residents because the crowds have been so large. One local resident told the New York Post: “The huge increase in crowds has an enormously negative affect on the neighborhood.” This is clear negative for residents, but it does indicate high demand for the Nike brand and the experiences it’s offering in that store. \nJust when Adidas was gaining ground, Nike has proved that it’s not going anywhere. NKE is up 2.64% intraday based on the upgrade, and if the broader market can stay afloat, then this could signal a reversal for the stock, which has depreciated 23.31% over the past 12 months. NKE currently offers a dividend yield of 1.43%. Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis Thanks for signing up to Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

      "title": "Nike Will Release Two Different Colorways Of The Nike Kyrie 2 What The",
      "text": "Nike will be doing something completely different when it comes to the upcoming What The colorway of the Nike Kyrie 2 . For starters, we’ll be seeing not one, but two different colorways release. The first is the tonal Green Glow pair that we recently took an official look at, and the second is this Sail pair.\nDifferentiating itself from prior “What The” releases, Nike decided to abandon the color mashup on the Kyrie 2 model and instead go with a material mash up. What do we mean? Well instead of combining together past colorways of the Kyrie 2, Nike decided to take a more monotone, sculptural, dimensional execution with very minimal color pops. The Nike team tells the story of the “What The” Kyrie 2 in a three dimensional fashion with textural graphics carefully molded on both shoes. This Sail colorway nods back to the debut “Dream” Kyrie 2, while the green glow edition acknowledges the “Kyrie-oke” edition.\nLook for this Sail colorway to release exclusively in North America while the Green Glow pair will be available in the rest of the world. Both pairs will release on December 12th 2016 for $120.\nvia: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I understand the switching up of the idea with this “What The” colorway since the color mash up thing was getting played out. I just don’t really see this as a “What The” colorway because from a distance you won’t be able to notice the different materials. I expect these to sit on shelves.\n\nThe post Nike Will Release Two Different Colorways Of The Nike Kyrie 2 What The appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "It’s been the worst performing stock this year on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but it led the index to new highs Monday.\nShares of Nike ended up 3% Monday, helping prolong the Dow’s rally since Donald Trump’s election in early November.\nShares of the sports apparel company jumped after HSBC analysts upgraded the stock from “Hold” to “Buy,” and gave it a 12-month price target of $60--a 18% upside from Monday’s open.\n“[W]e now see the stock trading below 20x forward price-to-earnings ratio, a level we find very compelling given our bullish stance on the fundamentals of the sporting goods industry and the quality of Nike's management team and track record in terms of growth, cash returns and communication,” the team wrote. “We also view that during lower growth times like now, Nike has many levers to pull to extract better margins.”\nBut the sports apparel maker has been a poor performer this year, with shares dropping 17% year to date as the company repeatedly missed Wall Street expectations in recent quarters.\nInvestors have also fretted about Nike’s competitors, Adidas and Under Armour. The latter company confirmed on Monday that it had entered a 10-year uniform partnership with Major League Baseball--Under Armour’s first ever deal with a major professional U.S. sports league.\nThe Dow ended the day up nearly 46 points, ending at 19,216.24. The index has risen 4.8% since Trump’s election , largely led by stocks in the financial sector.",

Smith / JR Smith Gets Another Nike LeBron 13 Low PE JR Smith Gets Another Nike LeBron 13 Low PE By NHHMS on December 5, 2016 Tweet \n\nWhen JR Smith isn’t dapping up opposing players on the bench while his man goes backdoor for a layup, he’s draining threes and helping the Cleveland Cavaliers win NBA championships. And often times, he’s wearing some variation of LeBron James’ signature sneaker collection. \nToday, Smith gets another Nike Lebron 13 Low player exclusive in his quest to help the Cavs repeat. The black, white and red shoe doesn’t necessarily scream team colors or tie in to Smith personally, but they have been labeled as an official JR PE. \nTake a closer look at the Nike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE below. \nNike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE Nike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE Nike LeBron 13 Low “JR Smith” PE",

In the future, this will be the soundtrack for putting on our shoes, thanks to the newest Nike creation — the first-ever “self-lacing” sneaker, the Nike HyperAdapt shoe.\nAlthough the sneaker is new, it’s not the first of its kind. The self-lacing Nike sneaker first appeared on Marty McFly’s feet in 1989’s Back to the Future Part II , when McFly steps into them in an imagined 2015. Someone smart at Nike clearly wrote “Make these a real thing someday and time them perfectly to the movie” on their vision board, because the timing of the HyperAdapt’s release seems prescient. Technology, fashion, and sneaker press all wrote excitedly anticipatory pieces about the sneaker prior to the launch and Wired even featured the sneaker on the cover of its coveted Design Issue .\nAt first glance, the HyperAdapt is more modern-looking than its 1989 prototype. While the 1989 version looks like a hi-top that would make any modern fuckboy happy, the HyperAdapt resembles a Nike Free or more traditional athletic shoe. But unlike traditional athletic laces that criss-cross across the tongue of the shoe and are tied by hand, the HyperAdapt has electro adaptive reactive lacing (EARL), which run across the shoe in parallel lines. A light-up panel goes under the instep of the shoe, and two small blue dots are located below the heel. Press one blue dot and laces tighten and coil like a snake around a stick, press the other and the laces instantly relax and loosen their grip.\nAccording to Tinker Hatfield, the Nike designer who conceived of 1989’s self-lacing sneaker, the shoes should “come alive” when you step into them. “It would sense you. It would become the shape of your foot, and when it came alive it would light up. Wouldn’t it be great if shoes could do that?” he told Wired he first imagined. The HyperAdapt fulfills that vision. Almost instantly after you put your foot into the shoe, the blue panel flashes, there’s a soft ri , as the sneaker and the laces grip your foot in a soft hug that it doesn’t loosen. In a missed opportunity, no one in the group of editors, including myself, exclaims, “No more laces, all right!” when this first happens. Tiffany Beers, a Nike engineer with gray-blue hair and a good black eyeliner game for 8 a.m., responsible for designing the shoes, looks at us all expectantly as we rock back and forth, Instagram, and try to feel what it’s like to wear a sneaker of the future.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Nike HyperAdapt feels not unlike any other sneaker Nike has designed, albeit a little stiffer, thanks to a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery in the heel of the shoe. It’s not uncomfortable, though. Over the next hour, the group of us literally run around the Nike store before opening hours, to put the sneaker to the test. We’re encouraged to slam the ground with our feet, pivot, do squat jumps, touchdown dances, shoot hoops, and run through a video simulation of Central Park, all to test how we feel in the sneakers. Unsurprisingly, thanks to over 5,000 hours of user-acceptance testing by actual athletes, none of the sneakers or their battery packs break. Everyone dutifully reports that the shoe “feels good.” The blue dots don’t perfectly match up with the button underneath the shoe that controls tightening and loosening, but everyone gets the hang of it and realizes that the key is to press slightly underneath the drawn-on-dot.\nNot since the age of 6 have I considered tying my sneakers to be a pain point (for now, the HyperAdapt comes in adult sizes only; kids everywhere still have to learn the life skill of tying their shoes), but having a mechanism that sets the tightness of my shoe is nice. Nike imagines that it will be more than “nice” for professional athletes whose performance depends on having a perfectly calibrated shoe, down to the laces. But a s the Adidas CEO snarkily asked of HyperAdapt , is it a “save-the-life product?” Probably not, for a normal person. But that’s a lofty expectation for a sneaker. No one thought much of the battery-powered vibrating mascara and automatic soap dispenser either, but our lives are arguably better with them in it (especially the mascara). Despite the $720 price tag, others seem to agree. After going on sale last Thursday, the Nike store has been fully booked with HyperAdapt appointments. “No more laces, all right.”\nTags: beauty health and wellness sneakers nike hyperadapt back to the future laces sneakerheads fuckboys sneaker don shoes omg shoes beauty section lede More   5:32 p.m. The  ",

      "text": "Adidas goes Midtown to compete with Nike in NYC KO By Kyle O'Brien - 05 December 2016 21:56pm \nBarely a month after Nike opened its Nike Soho store in lower Manhattan , Adidas has upped the competition by opening a Midtown feature store at 46th Street and Fifth Avenue , according to reports in Footwear News and Business Insider. The Turf area at the new NYC Adidas flagship store near Times Square / Courtesy of Adidas \nWith its massive 45,000-square-foot store just blocks from Times Square, the German sports retailer has shown a willingness not just to keep up with its Swoosh rival, but also to make a big statement in a sports shoe and apparel market that is swarming to Manhattan to grab attention. \nThe store is the largest Adidas shop in the world and it has a stadium retail vibe, inspired by high school stadiums. Shoppers enter through a football-style tunnel and the stands let people view the space stadium style. Plus, dressing rooms are locker rooms and there is an in-store track and turf area to let consumers wear test products. \nThe Adidas mega-store comes as other sportswear competitors are also trying to make a stamp on the Big Apple. The North Face recently opened a two-level, 20,000-square-foot store on Fifth Avenue, and Under Armour announced recently that it will take over the iconic FAO Schwartz building on Fifth Avenue, which will fill 53,000 square feet. It’s clear that all these brands want to use America’s biggest retail market as its competitive playground. \n“It’s our No. 1 global flagship; it’s the best articulation of our brand. When you think about everything that we’ve been doing to create what’s fresh and new about our brand, this is the first physical manifestation of everything that we’re about. In terms of size and scale, it’s the biggest global store that we’ve ever had,” Simon Atkins, brand director for Adidas America, told Footwear News. \nOther Adidas store features include juice and snacks stall, a personal fitness consultation area and a customization area for both shoes and clothing. \nThe customization at the opening comes through MiAdidas with customers able to personalize the popular Ultra Boost sneakers. \nThe Adidas store also opens as the company announced it is moving 150 jobs from its Boston-area offices to its North American headquarters in Portland, just miles from the Nike world headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon.",

The three-point marksman has been struggling in his past five games, but that hasn’t stopped him from hoisting up his signature long-range contested jumpers. It hasn’t stopped teammate LeBron James from gifting J.R. some brand new player exclusives either, as Smith will lace up this Nike LeBron 13 Low PE against the Toronto Raptors tonight. \nThis LeBron 13 Low PE features a simple black mesh and fuse construction with an eye-catching black to white gradient midsole complete with contrast speckling throughout. The outsole unit combines Nike’s signature LeBron Hexagonal Air units with an Air Max heel for a more traditional ride. Color pops of vibrant red hit the laces and lining to match the Cavaliers uniform kit. What do you think of J.R. Smith’s latest?

LeBron James, who had been practicing in the LeBron 14 , was finally spotted in his new shoe by the Cleveland Cavaliers Instagram account. The shoes feature a strap (as mentioned in our last report) and a much shorter cut than the previous LeBron signature installments and most certainly the high-rising LeBron Soldier 10. The soles appear to have Zoom pods in sections, similar to how the LeBron 12 featuring the Hex-Zoom for that distinct outsole design. \nThe Nike LeBron 14 is scheduled to release in the coming weeks with an MSRP of $175.

      "title": "Adidas CEO Has \"Words\" for Nike's HyperAdapt 1.0 (NKE, ADDYY)",
      "text": "Adidas CEO on Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 (NKE, ADDYY) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 9:02 PM EST \nIf you have ever run in a race, caught ground on the person leading that race, and then fell back into the pack again, then you know how frustrating this experience can be. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, catching that superior competitor is just not possible. Based on what Adidas AG (ADDYY) Chief Executive Officer Kasper Rorsted recently told The Wall Street Journal, this is how he must feel. Referring to NIKE, Inc.’s ( NKE ) new HyperAdapt 1.0, Rorsted stated, “I don't know if that's a save-the-world product.” \nPrior to the $720 self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0, Adidas had stolen Nike’s thunder thanks to its classic Stan Smith shoes becoming popular again. Consumers are currently finding style in simplicity. These same consumers aren’t likely to go out and buy the $720 HyperAdapt 1.0, which are obviously expensive as well as difficult to purchase. Rorsted’s comment didn’t indicate fear about the current version of the HyperAdapt, but the future versions of that shoe, which are highly likely to be more affordable in order to target the masses. Since Nike has been working on the technology for more than a decade, it would be nearly impossible for Adidas to catch up if self-lacing sneakers became a trend. (See also, Adidas Takes on Nike & Under Armour in U.S .) \nRorsted is also likely frustrated because Adidas is focused on sustainability . According to Business Insider, Adidas is making sneakers from ocean plastic and biodegradable silk. Sustainability will play a role in future consumer decisions, but it unfortunately will not be as impactful as a new technology like self-lacing shoes. Once a few young consumers sport the cheaper version of these shoes in the future, everyone else is going to want them. That’s not going to happen with shoes that are made from ocean plastic. If self-lacing shoes resonate with consumers over the next several years, then Nike will once again run far ahead of the competition. \nNKE has depreciated 23.31% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.43%. \nADDYY has appreciated 46.98% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.23%.

After news arrived last week about LeBron James wearing his next Nike sneakers in practice, the below video appears to depict just that. \nSunday morning workout # striveforgreatness A video posted by Cleveland Cavaliers ( @cavs ) on Dec 4, 2016 at 8: 18am PST \nUnsurprisingly, the video doesn't reveal too much of the design. What's more, it's in black and white so it's impossible to tell even the colorway on the sneaker. What's clearly visible is a hex-zoom arrangement on the sole and a strap (as described by the ESPN reporter who saw the shoes in practice), leading us to believe that this is indeed the LeBron 14. \nThe Nike LeBron 14 should be in stores by January, but don't be surprised if King James and Nike unveil the sneaker before then. \nRetail price on the Nike LeBron 14 should be set at $175 if news about the model's lower price holds.

      "text": "Close Tom Hauck \nArizona commit Greg Johnson at the 2016 Nike Football The Opening in Portland, Oregon. (Photo credit: Nike) Four-star athlete Greg Johnson decommits from Arizona Wildcats Zack Rosenblatt Arizona Daily Star Updated ( … ) Tom Hauck \nArizona commit Greg Johnson at the 2016 Nike Football The Opening in Portland, Oregon. (Photo credit: Nike) TownNews.com Content Exchange \nIt was assumed Arizona would feel the impact of Donte Williams ' likely impeding departure for Nebraska rather quickly, at least in recruiting. \nSunday, the Wildcats lost the centerpiece of their highly-regarded 2017 recruiting class, and it's likely connected to the Williams news. \nGreg Johnson announced on Twitter he \"decided to re-open my recruitment\" after being verbally committed to the Wildcats since March. Johnson surprised many when he made that early commitment ot the Wildcats, but Johnson picked the Wildcats primarily because of his relationship with Williams. \nWilliams' departure for Nebraska in particular is interesting because of how the Cornhuskers have been recruiting Johnson even as he was committed to Arizona. \nJohnson took an official visit to Nebraska late in the season and told the Star afterward: \"It was cool, just being out of California for a couple days. The atmosphere was cool, and they are cool people out there so I enjoyed it overall. It was a cool visit.\" \nWith Arizona out of the picture, Nebraska and USC are expected to be the leaders for Johnson, whose decision impacts Arizona's incoming class. \nFor one, Johnson is the recruit that started a flurry of commitments over the summer and into the season, helping the UA get its class as high as 27 players and for a while rated the top class in the Pac-12. Now, Arizona is down to just two four-star recruits committed to its 2017 class: quarterback Braxton Burmeister and running back Nathan Tilford . \nJohnson is rated the No. 2 athlete in the West, according to Scout.com , and was expected to play cornerback at Arizona. \nHis departure likely puts the death knell on Arizona's pursuit of five-star receiver Joseph Lewis , Johnson's teammate at Augustus Hawkins High School in Los Angeles. It's long been believed that Lewis and Johnson wanted to play together in college, and Williams was the primary recruiter on Lewis as well. Nebraska has been considered the favorite for Lewis for much of the recruiting cycle. \nIt's unclear how this impacts the rest of Arizona's 2017 class, but it's less likely to impact the players already committed as much as UA's targets for the next class or two, namely four-star cornerback Thomas Graham , recruited by Williams and from Rancho Cucamonga, California. \nArizona is still pulling out all the stops in its pursuit of Graham, also primarily considering Notre Dame, and defensive coordinator Marcel Yates will visit him in California this week. Yates will also check in with four-star cornerback Jaylon Redd, Graham's high school teammate, who is currently verbally committed to Oregon. The Ducks recently fired Mark Helfrich as its head coach and have yet to hire a replacement, so Redd's future status is unclear. \nToward the end of Arizona's season, the Star spoke with Johnson about Arizona's incoming recruiting class and his thoughts on Arizona's losing a lot of games this past year. Here's some of what he said. \n\"I’m pretty sure we’re all going to be successful there (Arizona) next year, and help Arizona get a lot of Ws.\" \"I’ve been watching the games, I know they’ve been dealing with a lot of injuries and stuff, but I’m pretty sure they’ll get a couple more Ws. I know that when myself and the rest of the 2017 class gets there we’re going to change a lot of that. We’re looking forward to getting a lot of wins and a lot of bowl wins.\" \"They’ve (Arizona's coaches) been saying they know what’s going on right now but they feel with the guys committed right now, they recruited them for a reason, and that’s to come in and change things. That’s what they talk about. This article originally ran on tucson.com .",

      "text": "Nike is 26% off its 52-week high. Disney recently gave investors a 10% dividend raise.\nAbbott has more than four decades of dividend growth.\nLike many of you, December means it is holiday shopping time. My wife has the innate ability to sniff out a good deal. Mrs. Dividend Bro zeros in on what she wants to buy and then shops around to make sure she is getting the best deal. She checks individual stores as well as online to make sure she isn't overpaying for something. Once she knows what she wants to purchase and where, she searches for coupons or promo codes for discounts as well as free shipping deals. By no means is she cheap. She really leaves no stone unturned in hopes of saving money that can be used to buy more gifts or another Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) beverage for herself.\nI try to apply this same mentality when I make a stock purchase. Because we are limited to a one, sometimes two, purchases per month, I find it very important to find undervalued stocks and purchase them at prices I want. Like my wife, I have a shopping list with price targets so that if the market gives me what I want, I am able to pull the trigger on a desired stock. I don't always buy from my watch list, see last month's purchase of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) as an example, but more often than not, I do select from this list. My investing guidelines are as follows:\nCore holdings are those that:\nHave at least 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. Are considered by S&P Capital/Morningstar to be no more than 5% overvalued. Are considered by F.A.S.T. Graphs to have a current price to earnings ratio that is no more than 5% overvalued when compared to the five-year average price to earnings ratio. Have a dividend yield above 2.0%. Dominate their sector of the economy. Supporting holdings are those that:\nHave five years of dividend growth or 10 years of paying uninterrupted dividends. Are considered by S&P Capital/Morningstar to be at least fair valued. Are considered by F.A.S.T. Graphs to have a current price to earnings ratio no more than 5% overvalued when compared to the five-year average price to earnings ratio. Have a dividend yield above 1.0%. Speculative holdings are those that:\nHave recently initiated a dividend. Or have an average dividend growth rate of at least 10% or higher for the life of the dividend. Are considered by S&P Capital/Morningstar/F.A.S.T. Graphs to be at least 5% undervalued. Without further ado, here is my shopping list for December:\nNike (NYSE: NKE ) \nCurrent Yield\n# Years div growth\n5-Year Div Growth Rate\n1.43%\n15\n14.9%\nS&P Capital 12-month price target\nS&P Capital Fair Value\nMorningstar Fair Value\n$63\n$53.80\n$57\nF.A.S.T Graphs Current PE\nF.A.S.T Graphs 5-Year Avg PE\nPrice Target\n22.2\n24.8\nUnder $65\nClick to enlarge According to Morningstar, Nike is the most dominant player in the athleisure space. The company ranks #1 in market share in sportswear, athletic shoes and training apparel. Nike is one of the most recognizable brands in the world. Interbrand.com says it is the 18th most valuable brand in the world while Branddirectory.com lists the company as the 29th most valuable brand in the world. Shares of Nike have really struggled this year, losing almost 20% year to date as competitors, such as Under Armour (NYSE: UA ), attempt to take market share from the shoe giant. The stock's 52-week high is $68.19. Based on Friday's closing price of $50.46, shares are 26% off of the high. Nike has raised dividends for the last 15 years and while shares yield just 1.43%, the company has an average annual raise over the past five years at just under 15%. On 11/17/2016, Nike gave investors a 12.5% dividend increase. To someone who likes to acquire shares of quality dividend-paying companies off their highs, this is all music to my ears.\nF.A.S.T. Graphs has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.2. The average PE over the past five years is 24.8. By this criteria, Nike is currently 11.71% undervalued. S&P Capital has a 12-month price target of $63 or almost 25% higher from the most recent close. Its fair value for the company is $53.80 or 6.62% higher from here. Morningstar lists fair value at $57, which would result in an almost 13% gain from the most recent price. Take the average of these numbers and I find shares to be 14% undervalued. Nike is one of the few companies I follow that is undervalued by all of my investing criteria. With 15 years of dividend growth, I'd be willing to pay 5% over fair value. Therefore, I would be fine buying Nike at prices under $65. Based on my investing criteria, Nike is the 11th most undervalued stock that I follow.\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) \nCurrent Yield\n# Years div growth\n5-Year Div Growth Rate\n1.58%\n7\n31%\nS&P Capital 12-month price target\nS&P Capital Fair Value\nMorningstar Fair Value\n$110\n$110.4\n$134\nF.A.S.T Graphs Current PE\nF.A.S.T Graphs 5-Year Avg PE\nPrice Target\n17.1\n18.6\nUnder $131\nClick to enlarge Entertainment and Media colossus Disney continues to have issues with ESPN subscription losses as people make the choice to cut the cable cord. Fears over these losses are justified, but the company continues to produce winner after winner in the movie space. Most people are familiar with Star Wars, Frozen and the Marvel Universe, but did you know that Mona made more than 80 million dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday? The company's theme parks are some of the most visited parks in the world each year. So while the subscription losses are still a problem for the company, the stock has many other drivers going for it that if/when Disney figures out how to improve this area, the stock is likely to skyrocket.\nLike with Nike, Disney's yield, just under 1.6%, isn't all that much to write home about. Dividend growth of more than 30% over the past five years, however, is. On 11/30/2016, the company gave investors a 10% dividend increase. Not as much as in the past, but a solid raise nonetheless.\nF.A.S.T Graphs lists the current PE at 17.1 and the five-year average ratio is 18.6, that is almost 9% of upside potential based on this guideline. S&P Capital has a 12-month price target and fair value at $110 or more than 11% upside from Friday's closing price of $98.50. Morningstar is the most bullish on Disney as it has a fair value of $134, or 36% higher from the most recent close. Altogether, I find Disney to be 17% undervalued. With seven consecutive years of dividend growth, I would be willing to pay 5% above what I find fair value to be. Anything under $131 would qualify Disney for purchase. By how I value stocks, Disney is the sixth most undervalued stock that I follow.\nAbbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT ) \nCurrent Yield\n# Years div growth\n5-Year Div Growth Rate\n2.74%\n44\n29.17%\nS&P Capital 12-month price target\nS&P Capital Fair Value\nMorningstar Fair Value\n$46\n$42.20\n$44\nF.A.S.T Graphs Current PE\nF.A.S.T Graphs 5-Year Avg PE\nPrice Target\n17.2\n18.9\nUnder $49\nClick to enlarge Abbott Laboratories made our watch list back in September, but we didn't make a purchase at that time. I detail many of the reasons why it was on our watch list here , but we used to own the company before it split from AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV ). I sold ABT to buy more ABBV, but I've always liked the company and wouldn't mind having it back in the portfolio. The stock has been on a roller coaster ride this year and is down more than 15% for 2016. Since the publication of my September watch list, Abbott has fallen another 10%. The company is also 18% off of its 52-week high of $46.22. While there is no guarantee that the stock will get back to that level anytime soon, Abbott has an outstanding track record of 44 years of dividend growth, if you include the years prior to the split of companies. Now could be a good opportunity to pick up a company that is well off of its highs that boasts an impressive history of dividend raises. Shares currently yield 2.74% and the company has given investors an average raise of more than 21% since the split in 2013.\nF.A.S.T. has a current PE of 17.2. This is almost 10% below the five-year average price to earnings ratio of 18.9. S&P Capital has a $46 price target on the stock, which would be good for a 21.37% gain based on Friday's closing price of $37.90. Its fair value is $42.20 or 11.35% higher from this closing price. Morningstar gives a fair value of $44. Reaching this price would give investors a 16% gain. Average these numbers together and I find that Abbott is trading almost 15% below fair value. Since the company has more than four decades of dividend growth behind it, any price under $49 would qualify it for purchase. Abbott is the 10th most undervalued stock that I follow.\nConclusion \nIf you're familiar with my articles on Seeking Alpha, you know how much emphasis I place on having a watch list of stocks. For this month, I'm looking strongly at Nike, Disney and Abbott Laboratories. All of these stocks are undervalued by all of my investing criteria. I can't say the same for too many of the stocks that I follow. What do you think of these three companies? Which ones are you focusing on?\nDisclosure: I am/we are long ABBV, DIS, KO, SBUX AND MAY INITIATE A POSITION IN NKE OR ABT IN THE NEXT 72 HOURS. \n \nAdditional disclosure: We are not investing professionals.

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of Nike ( NKE ) were higher in mid-afternoon trading on Monday, after the athletic retailer's stock rating was upgraded to \"buy\" from \"hold\" this morning at HSBC, despite being down about 17% YTD.\nNike is still the \"captain of the industry\" and has a \"pretty great underlying sector,\" HSBC Managing Director Erwan Rambourg said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Monday afternoon.\nThose who are weary of Nike are worried about market share loss to alternative players, but that's what happens when there's good growth in the sector, he noted. And these alternative players are going to have good and bad years too.\nFor example, Adidas has had a \"phenomenal\" year in soccer and \"quite a good year\" in lifestyle, so next year will most likely be more difficult, Rambourg claimed. As another example, Nike didn't really have a presence in soccer 15 years ago, but now it's co-head of the sector, he said.\nThis shows that the market share loss that Nike is experiencing now may just be a short-term issue, Rambourg said. \"This idea that they were somewhat half asleep at the wheel is completely false in my view,\" he added.\nNike was a \"buy\" in popular opinion just a year-and-a-half ago, but now it's become \"fashionable\" to have a more negative view on the stock, he said. However, the growth reality really hasn't changed in that time as the company is still showing mid-to-high single digit growth.\n\"Yes, the U.S. has been a bit disappointing. Yes, currency has been a bit of a drag. But the reality is you still have pretty good growth,\" Rambourg explained.",
