      "text": "Twittear La Gestion / AT&T permite a sus suscriptores de su servicio satelital DirecTV ver vĂ­deo en dispositivos mĂłviles sin descontarlo de su uso de datos inalĂĄmbrico, prĂĄctica que se conoce en la industria como\"tarifa cero\" Tweet Enviar En momentos en que AT&T Inc. y Time Warner Inc. confĂ­an en obtener la aprobaciĂłn gubernamental para su megaacuerdo por $85.000 millones, puede que algunas de sus negociaciones mĂĄs importantes ocurran en conversaciones privadas con ejecutivos rivales en vez de en la capital de la naciĂłn. La fusiĂłn representa para competidores y socios una rara oportunidad para obtener acuerdos mĂĄs favorables con ambas compaĂąĂ­as a cambio de su respaldo pĂşblico, que puede resultar valioso para lograr la aprobaciĂłn de los reguladores. En tanto, otros proveedores y programadores de TV pagada harĂĄn presiĂłn para bloquear el acuerdo o bien conseguir la imposiciĂłn de lĂ­mites a un imperio que serĂ­a dueĂąo de muchas de las pelĂ­culas y shows que distribuye a suscriptores inalĂĄmbricos, de internet y video.\"Lo que nunca se ve es quĂŠ piden los diversos actores detrĂĄs de escenas a fin de apoyar el acuerdo en Washington?, dijo Craig Moffett, analista en MoffettNathanson LLC .\"Todo tipo de programadores bĂĄsicamente exigirĂĄn su tajada. Todos quieren subir al carro de la victoria\"Hace dos aĂąos hubo un asomo de ese acuerdo tras bambalinas, cuando Discovery Communications Inc., dueĂąo de TLC y Animal Planet, objetĂł la compra de Time Warner por parte de Comcast Corp., seĂąalando que aprovecharĂ­a su mayor envergadura para perjudicar a las cadenas de televisiĂłn. En respuesta, Comcast afirmĂł que Discovery habĂ­a exigido\"concesiones comerciales no garantizadas?, como mayores tarifas de retransmisiĂłn y una mayor distribuciĂłn de sus canales a cambio de no oponerse a la fusiĂłn. En la ĂŠpoca, Discovery desmintiĂł la afirmaciĂłn de Comcast. La semana pasada, ambas compaĂąĂ­as declinaron comentar esa antigua disputa. ÂżHabrĂĄ apoyo de Netflix? La mayor interrogante es si Netflix estĂĄ a favor del acuerdo, dijo Moffett. El gigante de streaming de vĂ­deo se opuso a la oferta de Comcast para comprar Time Warner Cable y el acuerdo fue bloqueado. Posteriormente, Time Warner Cable fue adquirido por Charter Communications, con la anuencia de Netflix. Entre las principales prioridades de los reguladores figura la protecciĂłn del mercado de vĂ­deo en lĂ­nea. Han utilizado su supervisiĂłn sobre las grandes fusiones para para obtener compromisos de grandes proveedores de internet a fin de dejar a todos contentos en sus redes, incluidos los servicios de vĂ­deo en competencia.\"Para bien o para mal, Netflix terminarĂĄ abogando por toda una clase de potenciales competidores?, indicĂł Moffett,\"algo que les confiere un enorme poder de apalancamiento al declararse a favor del acuerdo\" Hasta ahora, Netflix se ha mostrado favorable a la oferta de AT&T por Time Warner, con ciertas condiciones.\"Queremos asegurarnos de que no le otorgue una ventaja injusta a HBO?, comentĂł el mĂĄximo ejecutivo de Netflix, Reed Hastings, en una conferencia el mes pasado.\"Nos gusta la competencia abierta\" Los programadores ya han pedido garantĂ­as sobre el streaming de vĂ­deo en lĂ­nea, dado que AT&T es uno de los mayores proveedores de servicio de internet inalĂĄmbrico y residencial, mientras que Time Warner es dueĂąo de redes de cable con amplia audiencia, como HBO y TNT . AT&T permite a sus suscriptores de su servicio satelital DirecTV ver vĂ­deo en dispositivos mĂłviles sin descontarlo de su uso de datos inalĂĄmbrico, prĂĄctica que se conoce en la industria como\"tarifa cero\" El carrier quiere introducir un servicio de web TV por US$35 al mes en las prĂłximas semanas que funcionarĂ­a parecido. Otras empresas de medios probablemente van a exigir que sus servicios en lĂ­nea, como All Access de CBR Corp., tambiĂŠn sean a tarifa cero.\"La idea de que DirectTV podrĂ­a salvarse de los lĂ­mites de uso mientras que Netflix aplicarĂ­a cargos por datos a clientes jamĂĄs verĂĄ la luz?, sentenciĂł Moffett.

      "text": "As AT&T and Time Warner Inc. seek government approval for their $85 billion megadeal, some of their most important negotiations may take place in private conversations with rival executives instead of in the nation's capital.\nThe merger offers competitors and partners a rare opportunity to cut more favorable deals with both companies in exchange for their public endorsement, which can be valuable in getting regulators to sign off.\nMeanwhile, other pay-TV providers and programmers will lobby to block the deal or place limits on an empire that would own many movies and shows it delivers to wireless, internet and video subscribers.\n\"The part you never see is what the various players demand behind the scenes in order to support the deal in Washington,\" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. \"You'll have all kinds of programmers essentially demanding a pound of flesh. It's a gravy train for everybody.\"\nA hint of that back-channel dealing popped up two years ago. Discovery Communications Inc., owner of TLC and Animal Planet, argued against Comcast Corp.'s purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc., saying it would use its bigger size to hurt TV networks. In response, Comcast claimed Discovery demanded \"unwarranted business concessions,\" such as higher carriage fees and greater distribution of its channels, in exchange for not opposing the merger.\nDiscovery denied Comcast's claim at the time. Both companies declined to comment last week on the old dispute.\nThe biggest question is whether Netflix backs the deal, Moffett said. The streaming-video giant opposed Comcast's bid to buy Time Warner Cable, and the deal was blocked. Time Warner Cable was later purchased by Charter Communications Inc., with Netflix's blessing.\nRegulators have made protecting the online video market a top priority. They've used their oversight over big mergers to win commitments from large internet providers to treat content equally on their networks, including competing video services.\n\"Netflix, for better or worse, will end up speaking on behalf of an entire class of would-be competitors,\" Moffett said. \"That gives them tremendous negotiating leverage for their support of the deal.\"\nSo far, Netflix has been conditionally in favor of the AT&T bid for Time Warner. \"We want to make sure it doesn't give an unfair advantage to HBO,\" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said at a conference last month. \"If it's open competition, we love that.\"\nProgrammers have already asked for assurances about video streamed online, since AT&T is one of the biggest providers of wireless and residential internet service and Time Warner owns widely viewed cable networks such as HBO and TNT.\nAT&T lets subscribers to its DirecTV satellite service watch video on mobile devices without it counting against their wireless-data use, a practice known as \"zero-rating.\" The carrier plans to introduce a $35-a-month web TV service that would work similarly.\nOther media companies will probably demand that their online services, such as CBS Corp.'s All Access, are zero-rated, too.\n\"The idea that DirecTV could avoid usage caps while Netflix would run up data charges for customers is never going to fly,\" Moffett said.\nSome media companies have expressed concerns about the AT&T deal. \"A transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\" Walt Disney Co. said shortly after the acquisition was announced.\nOthers have been silent. They may be waiting to see what regulators require or what AT&T and Time Warner offer on their own. Some will stay mum or back the deal rather than jeopardize their relationships.\nMore Coverage UPDATE 2-Comcast posts higher revenue, helped by Rio Olympics\nOct 26 - 6:36 PM Comcast posts higher revenue, helped by Rio Olympics\nOct 26 - 6:44 PM",

      "text": "Little did we know when it was announced that AT&T's ( T ) $85.4 billion deal to buy Time Warner ( TWX ) would kick off a wave of fall merger and acquisition activity by U.S. telecom companies. In each case, it looks as if the buyers want to use acquisitions to diminish the impact of intense top-line pressures facing their telecom and pay-TV businesses.\nConsidering how widespread those pressures are, and the cost and network synergies that can be obtained by rolling up smaller players, more deals might be in store.\nNine days after the AT&T/Time Warner deal was announced, CenturyLink ( CTL ) , perhaps the Rodney Dangerfield of large-cap American telcos, announced that it's buying fiber network owner Level 3 Communications ( LVLT ) in a $34 billion cash/stock deal. The companies declared that combining their fiber networks would yield superior efficiency and reach, and that the deal would also expand the scope and quality of CenturyLink's broadband and business network offerings.\nAnd on Monday, smaller peer Windstream ( WIN ) announced it's buying age-old ISP and business data service provider Earthlink ( ELNK ) in a $1.1 billion all-stock deal. Much like CenturyLink/Level 3, the companies claim the deal will yield a network of \"increased scale and scope\" that can deliver an expanded set of services to clients, as well as major cost and tax synergies.\nAT&T's deal coincided with the release of less-than-flattering third-quarter results, and so were CenturyLink and Windstream's . CenturyLink's business and residential segment revenues fell 1.1% and 2.5%, respectively, on an annual basis, thanks in large part to a 7.9% revenue drop for \"Legacy\" businesses such as landline phone connections.\nWindstream's adjusted service revenue fell 4%, and its total revenue 10%. A 6% drop in households served, together with substantial drops in small business accounts, more than offset a 2% increase in enterprise customers. In addition to landline disconnections, cord-cutting and tough pay-TV and broadband competition from cable providers are weighing on Windstream (AT&T can relate).\nThe future doesn't look much brighter: Analysts respectively forecast CenturyLink and Windstream's revenue to drop 1.6% and 1.7%. The estimates don't account for their recent deals.\nOne common financial thread between AT&T, CenturyLink and Windstream: They all have substantial dividends that they're looking to protect. AT&T's dividend yield stands at 5.4%, while CenturyLink and Windstream's are each at 8.9%. All three companies claim their purchases will improve their ability to support their large payouts.\nWhich other telcos facing similar top-line and dividend challenges might also turn to M&A?",

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo 1/2 left right An AT&T sign is seen outside a branch in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, U.S., October 24, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young 2/2 \nShares of telecommunications giant AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and media company Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) fell in premarket trading on Wednesday amid fears that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will hold good on his vow to block their proposed $85 billion merger. \nTrump, who had railed against the media during the fractious presidential election campaign, had said AT&T's proposal to buy the owner of CNN and the Warner Bros movie studio was an example of a \"power structure\" that was rigged against him and voters. \n\"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a rally on Oct. 22. \nAT&T's shares were down 1.2 percent at $36.55, while Time Warner's were down 3.1 percent at $85.11. \nS&P e-mini stock index futures were down 1.8 percent at 7 a.m. ET as global markets reacted nervously to Trump's surprise defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton. \nAT&T offered $107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract a growing number of online viewers. \nAT&T said the Department of Justice would review the deal, which is likely to face intense scrutiny given that lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast Corp's ( CMCSA.O ) $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal. \n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru) Next In Business News",

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo \nShares of telecommunications giant AT&T Inc and media company Time Warner Inc fell in premarket trading on Wednesday amid fears that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will hold good on his vow to block their proposed $85 billion merger. \nTrump, who had railed against the media during the fractious presidential election campaign, had said AT&T's proposal to buy the owner of CNN and the Warner Bros movie studio was an example of a \"power structure\" that was rigged against him and voters. \n\"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a rally on Oct. 22. \nAT&T's shares were down 1.2 percent at $36.55, while Time Warner's were down 3.1 percent at $85.11. \nS&P e-mini stock index futures were down 1.8 percent at 7 a.m. ET (1200 GMT) as global markets reacted nervously to Trump's surprise defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton. \nAT&T offered $107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract a growing number of online viewers. \nAT&T said the Department of Justice would review the deal, which is likely to face intense scrutiny given that lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast Corp's $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal. \n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru) Next In Money News",

      "text": "Shares of Time Warner Inc. TWX, +0.15% fell nearly 3% in premarket trade and AT&T Inc. shares T, +0.49% declined slightly in the wake of Donald Trump winning the 2016 presidential election. The two companies agreed to a $85.4 billion merger in October, which Donald Trump vowed to block if he won the presidency. A statement from his campaign at the time read: \"Donald Trump will break up the new media conglomerate oligopolies that have gained enormous control over our information... Donald Trump would never approve such a deal.\" The deal has already faced stark criticism and potentially rigorous regulatory review down the road. Time Warner shares are up nearly 36% in the year to date, outperforming AT&T shares, which are up 7.5% and the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.38% up nearly 5%.",

      "text": "Shares of media group Time Warner Inc fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will make good on his vow to block a proposed $85 billion acquisition by telecommunications giant AT&T Inc.\n\nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on Wednesday his company was looking forward to working with Trump and \"optimistic\" that regulators would approve the deal. Stephens spoke at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York.\n\nTrump had said AT&T's proposal to buy the owner of CNN and the Warner Bros movie studio was an example of a \"power structure\" that was rigged against him and voters.\n\n\"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a rally on Oct. 22.\n\nAT&T's shares were down 1.4 percent at $36.52, while Time Warner fell $1.80 at $85.87.\n\nThe Dow and S&P 500 were mixed in opening trading.\n\nAT&T offered $107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract a growing number of online customers.\n\nAT&T said the U.S. Department of Justice will review the deal, which is likely to face intense scrutiny since lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast Corp's $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal.",

Photo: Reuters Published: 9:20   Updated: 10:10   \nShares of telecommunications giant AT&T Inc <T.N> and media company Time Warner Inc <TWX.N> fell in premarket trading on Wednesday amid fears that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will hold good on his vow to block their proposed $85 billion merger. \nTrump, who had railed against the media during the fractious presidential election campaign, had said AT&T's proposal to buy the owner of CNN and the Warner Bros movie studio was an example of a \"power structure\" that was rigged against him and voters. \n\"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a rally on Oct. 22. \nAT&T's shares were down 1.2 percent at $36.55, while Time Warner's were down 3.1 percent at $85.11. \nS&P e-mini stock index futures were down 1.8 percent at 7 a.m. ET as global markets reacted nervously to Trump's surprise defeat of Democrat Hillary Clinton. \nAT&T offered $107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract a growing number of online viewers. \nAT&T said the Department of Justice would review the deal, which is likely to face intense scrutiny given that lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast Corp's <CMCSA.O> $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal.

Posted 09 Nov 2016 20:35 Updated 09 Nov 2016 23:10 Signage that reads Time Warner is seen at the Time Warner Center in New York City, U.S. on October 23, 2016. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo A \nREUTERS: Shares of media group Time Warner Inc fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will make good on his vow to block a proposed US$85 billion acquisition by AT&T Inc . \nTrump said in October that the telecommunication company's proposal to buy the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a \"power structure\" that was rigged against him and voters. \nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and \"optimistic\" regulators would approve the deal. Stephens spoke at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York. \nTime Warner's shares fell 2.1 percent to US$86.03, while AT&T shares were down 0.4 percent at US$36.88. The Dow and S&P 500 were both higher in early trading. \nThe election results mean \"increased risks\" for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said. \n\"At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,\" he added. \nAT&T offered US$107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract online customers. It has said the U.S. Department of Justice will review the deal, which likely faces intense scrutiny since lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast Corp's US$30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal. \nIt is \"too early to say\" that Trump will block the deal, Josh Duitz, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds that owns AT&T shares, said. \n\"Candidates say a lot to help them win election, and when reality sets in, you have to see what they do,\" Duitz said. \n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak in Washington and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Meredith Mazzilli) - Reuters",

      "title": "AT&T, Time Warner Deal Bad For Dividend Investors",
      "text": "Black Coral Research Summary \nAT&T hasn’t completed its acquisition of Time Warner yet but it’s already making concessions such as lowering its DirecTV subscription prices to get on the good side of regulators. \nIn our view, dividend investors should be wary of the Time Warner deal. The benefits of a combined entity are nebulous at this time but the costs are real. \nHigher debt servicing costs and the need to support a larger entity’s capital requirements are likely to prevent it from raising dividend payouts significantly anytime soon. \nWe believe that the transaction is a sideways move for dividend investors, and they should consider paring down their holdings during market highs. AT&T Might Sacrifice Margins Because of AT&T Merger As AT&T (NYSE: T ) seeks to have its acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) approved by, the company may already be starting to make nice with watchdogs by pricing its DirecTV Now streaming service at just $35. Ostensibly, the DirecTV pricing move will make regulators more comfortable with approving the mega-acquisition since it will show that AT&T won't leverage a strong position to raise prices on consumers. Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that a business has subsidized customer sales to get what it wants. However, in this case, AT&T margin on its DirecTV offering could be as slim as a dollar, as the analysts quoted in the Wall Street Journal article point out. For reference, AT&T overall gross margin was 89% in the third quarter, which was 6 points better than that of its industry peers. On the one hand, this could simply be a case of AT&T deciding to sacrifice some margin now in favor of a larger overall objective. On the other hand, depending on the regulatory and political climate post-acquisition, this could be a portent of things to come. Since the DirecTV service is likely to be a small portion of AT&T's business, we anticipate a 1% to 2% erosion in its margins. This isn't much - but it could be a portent to what happens if its deal with Time Warner is subject to onerous oversight. Like many Domestic Telecom plays, AT&T has a high dividend yield of nearly 5.4%. This puts it in the middle of the pack - but still around 40-basis points better than Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) and 120-basis points ahead of the industry average . This makes AT&T a very attractive stock to dividend investors - at 5.4%, an investor who buys $10,000 worth of AT&T shares can expect to receive around $540 in cumulative dividend payments each year - or over $300 better than what they're receive by investing an equivalent amount in the S&P 500 . As a stand-alone dividend stock with a high dividend yield, strong brand and over $160 Billion in annual revenues, many investors probably consider AT&T a portfolio staple. That being said, the question that many dividend investors have with respect to AT&T is whether the company can continue to sustain its dividend post-acquisition and what the impact will be on its prospects. Let's take a look. Loading Up on Debt Based on its disclosures , AT&T is paying nearly $109 Billion for Time Warner (which includes the assumption of its debt). Half the purchase price of $107.5 per share will be paid for in cash, with the other half in shares of the AT&T's stock. AT&T will be borrowing as much as $40 Billion to finance the cash portion of the purchase, which will only increase its already enormous debt burden of $125 Billion. AT&T is already the largest non-financial issuer of debt so adding another 30% to its debt inventory could result in critical tightness down the line. Given this, it's unsurprising that credit ratings agency Moody's gave notice of a possible ratings downgrade following the Time Warner announcement. How does this affect AT&T's shareholders? Beyond the obvious negative impact that a downgrade will have on its share price, it should be noted that AT&T anticipates that the deal would raise its post-merger Debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.5x by 2018 (i.e. \"by the end of the first year after close\") while Moody's believes that it will go to 3.5-times its consolidated EBITDA in the same period. Let's consider what this means. AT&T's EBITDA was at $39.8 Billion through the first nine months of 2016 - so its pre-Time Warner operations are tracking at a $53 Billion annualized EBITDA pace. Leaving aside the Time Warner acquisition and assuming steady-state debt, AT&T's Debt-to-EBITDA measure was trending towards 2.4x by the end of 2016 - so what AT&T is saying is that after increasing its debt burden by 30%, its overall debt burden wouldn't increase by much. Does that track with reality? Time Warner's EBITDA was trending at a $9 Billion annualized pace through the end of September while its debt was at approximately $24.5 Billion. Simply adding the numbers for the two entities gives us a Debt-to-EBITDA reading of 2.45x without considering the debt that AT&T would have to issue in order to pay for Time Warner. AT&T already has $40 Billion in available bridge financing for the deal so if we assume that it draws on all of this, but utilizes Time Warner's cash and receivables of $10 Billion to immediately retire some debt, its post-merger debt burden would still rise to around $180 Billion. AT&T expects $1 Billion in annualized cost-savings from the deal within 3 years, while around $9 Billion in debt will come off AT&T books by 2018. Assuming the $1 Billion in savings come in a straight line, AT&T is able to successfully retire its maturities with no further debt issuance and the combined entity's EBITDA grows by 3% a year, AT&T's Debt-to-EBITDA ratio would still come in at 2.61 times. Our assumptions are fairly conservative but assume that neither company will have to spin-off operating units (and therefore revenue and EBITDA) in order to appease government watchdogs. Should AT&T-Time Warner have to let go of EBITDA contributors for regulatory purposes, its Debt-to-EBITDA ratio would rise further. Pressure on the Dividend The rising of the Debt-to-EBITDA puts pressure on its dividend. Assuming there is no interruption in dividend payments - in fact, AT&T touts 'improved dividend coverage' as a benefit of the deal - the combined annual dividend from the companies would work out to $13.3 Billion a year - which should come out to 2/3 of the entity's combined free cash flow (basically its EBITDA less Capital Expenditures). However, with $170 Billion in combined debt, AT&T-Time Warner's annual interest expense would come in at around $6.7 Billion - or roughly half of its dividend, assuming the combined entity's debt pays 3.9%, as AT&T currently does. In short, most - if not all - of AT&T's free cash flow would go towards paying shareholders or creditors. Financing to grow the business - or to essentially revolve its debt - would become necessary for the company. As it stands, both businesses already spent a combined $37 Billion in capital expenditures in the last twelve months - a very sizable commitment even for an entity that larger. Given this, we don't believe that investors should expect AT&T quarterly dividend to rise by much in the future just because of the merger - we fully expect that these will grow in the 2-3% range as it recently did - since there will simply be too many outlets vying for capital. Indeed, with just the DirecTV acquisition to consider, AT&T already reduced its dividend coverage guidance for 2016 from 70% to 67%. AT&T anticipates the Time Warner deal will be accretive since there's little operational overlap between the two companies. Overall, diluted EPS should come in at around $3.65 per diluted share for the combined entity by 2018, assuming both operating units make the consensus forecast and that Time Warner's shareholders wind up owning 14.4% of it (i.e. along the lower range of AT&T expectations). Another $0.09 on top of this would come for the annualized cost savings forecasted by AT&T for total earnings of around $3.75 per share. This would be an improvement of $0.62 compared to the current consensus forecast for AT&T in that year, which doesn't yet consider the impact of the deal since it's still pending approval. Conclusion One can view the Time Warner as AT&T paying $109 Billion for an approximately 20% improvement in its per share earnings. The market clearly doesn't think much of the deal on AT&T's end - its stock is down by 1.3% since it was announced. This is understandable - at current prices, the combined entity's forward earnings estimate is 9.9-times earnings. That might look attractive - until one considers that Verizon , a similarly-sized company with a dividend that's very close to AT&T's, is trading at 11.5-times its 2018 earnings with overall debt that's around 30% less. The market basically seems to be saying that the deal won't add much to AT&T overall. All things considered, we're not convinced of the merits of the Time Warner acquisition from a dividend investors perspective. The numbers don't appear to add up - AT&T says that it will improve its dividend - but the even larger debt burden it will need to take on after the transaction closes makes it unlikely that its shareholders will enjoy sizable dividend increases. Moreover, it appears that this burden will only grow larger over time - unless AT&T decides to curtail its dividend payments - since it will need to take on more debt (or revolve existing debt) jut to support the capital expenditures necessary to grow both businesses. This doesn't even consider the margin sacrifice that AT&T will have to make on Time Warner media properties to assuage regulators' concerns on price hikes. In that sense, we would encourage investors to enjoy AT&T's dividend for now - but look to reduce their exposure in the stock beginning next year in the event that regulators lean towards approving the transaction.

      "text": "Harry Hamburg/AP \nTime Warner stock dipped 2% on Wednesday, with investors likely spooked that Donald Trump, the presumptive next president of the US, could move to block its $85 million acquisition by AT&T.\nWhen the deal was announced in October, Trump came out swinging against it, and vowed not to allow it through.\n“In an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said the day that the AT&T-Time Warner news came out. \nHe also said he would break up the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger for similar reasons. \nTrump's words, however, may not translate into action.\n“A Trump administration will be a wildcard for antitrust enforcement,” Gene Kimmelman, head of policy group Public Knowledge, and a former antitrust official himself, told Bloomberg . “Trump certainly railed against consolidation during the campaign, but we don’t know what kind of enforcers he’ll select to steer competition policy.”\nAT&T CFO John Stephens said Wednesday, at a conference, that he was looking forward to working with Trump and \"optimistic\" regulators would approve the Time Warner deal, according to Reuters . \nNet neutrality One Trump proclamation that could actually benefit AT&T is his stance against \"net neutrality,\" which requires all web data to be treated the same. \nAT&T and other mobile carriers have been criticized for trying to maneuver around net neutrality through policies like \"zero-rating.\" \nZero-rating is when wireless carriers don't count data used with certain streaming services against your data cap. For example, T-Mobile offers zero-rating for several popular services like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube. AT&T is planning on having its DirecTV Now streaming TV service, which the company thinks will be its main TV product by 2020, be totally zero-rated. That means you can stream all you want without worrying about your data usage.\nThis sounds great for customers, but critics say it runs afoul of net neutrality. Why? Because AT&T could potentially use zero-rating to hurt its competitors unfairly.\nHere's how:\nIf the AT&T-Time Warner deal goes through, AT&T would still likely make Time Warner pay a fee to have its content zero-rated. But since AT&T would own Time Warner, that money would just be shifting from one division of the company to another. That could give AT&T-Time Warner an unfair advantage over other content providers like Netflix, as they would have to pay that fee out of their own pocket.\nBut if Trump dismantled net neutrality, that argument might all be moot. The Wall Street Journal says it would be \" difficult, but not impossible\" for Trump to destroy the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules. \nAdditional reporting by Steve Kovach. \nNOW WATCH: Watch Donald Trump's full victory speech \n",

      "text": "Time Warner shares fall on concern Trump will block AT&T deal 9 Mins Ago Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Time Warner Inc. signage is displayed at the company's headquarters in New York. \nShares of media group Time Warner fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will make good on his vow to block a proposed $85 billion acquisition by AT&T . \nTrump said in October that the telecommunication company's proposal to buy the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a \"power structure\" that was rigged against him and voters. \nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and \"optimistic\" regulators would approve the deal. Stephens spoke at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York. \nTime Warner's shares fell 2.1 percent to $86.03, while AT&T shares were down 0.4 percent at $36.88. The Dow and S&P 500 were both higher in early trading. \nThe election results mean \"increased risks\" for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said. \n\"At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,\" he added. \nAT&T offered $107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract online customers. It has said the U.S. Department of Justice will review the deal, which likely faces intense scrutiny since lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast's $30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal. \nIt is \"too early to say\" that Trump will block the deal, Josh Duitz, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds that owns AT&T shares, said. \n\"Candidates say a lot to help them win election, and when reality sets in, you have to see what they do,\" Duitz said. \nDisclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

      "title": "AT&T's Stephens optimistic about Trump even as doubts arise on Time Warner tie-up",
      "text": "by Colin Gibbs | Nov 9, 2016 9:51am \nAT&T CFO John Stephens said all the right things about the incoming Donald Trump administration this morning. But the prospects of the carrier’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner have never been murkier. \nThe nation’s second-largest wireless network operator announced last month that it planned to buy Time Warner for a whopping $85.4 billion in a deal that includes content behemoths such as HBO, Turner Networks and Warner Bros. Pictures. The move comes as AT&T prepares to launch the OTT service DirecTV Now as it looks to expand aggressively into digital media and advertising. \n“From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team,” Stephens said at an investors conference this morning. “Policies and discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T’s goals…. We’ve been the leading investor in this country for more than five years running. We look forward with optimism to working with the leadership and providing benefits to our customers and shareholders.” \nAs Reuters noted , though, shares of both AT&T and Time Warner slid in premarket trading this morning amid fears the deal wouldn’t clear regulatory hurdles under a Trump White House. Trump said on the campaign trail last month that the acquisition was evidence of a “power structure” that stacked the cards against the American people and in favor of the media establishment. \n“It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” he said of the deal during a campaign event last month. Trump has also said he would try to block Comcast’s merger with NBC Universal. \nShares of AT&T were down 1.2 percent to $36.55 early today, Reuters reported, while Time Warner’s stock slid 3.1 percent to $85.11 per share. \nStephens’ remarks notwithstanding, Trump appears to be on shaky ground with the U.S. wireless industry even before he steps into office. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure held a fundraising dinner for Hillary Clinton at his Miami Beach home several weeks ago, saying the New York real estate developer was “ just too risky .” \nLate last year Trump got into a heated Twitter exchange with John Legere after the T-Mobile CEO responded to remarks Trump made toward UFC fighter Ronda Rousey. “John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers,” Trump tweeted. Read more on",

      "text": "International Business Time Warner shares fall on worries Trump may block AT&T deal; bankers see M&A pause Shares of Time Warner Inc fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will make good on his vow to block a proposed US$85 billion acquisition by AT&T Inc . Posted 09 Nov 2016 20:35 Updated 10 Nov 2016 01:05 Signage that reads Time Warner is seen at the Time Warner Center in New York City, U.S. on October 23, 2016. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File Photo A \nREUTERS: Shares of Time Warner Inc fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on concerns that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will make good on his vow to block a proposed US$85 billion acquisition by AT&T Inc . \nTrump said in October that the telecommunication company's proposal to buy the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a \"power structure\" rigged against him and voters. \nTime Warner shares were some 24.5 percent below the implied value of AT&T's US$107.50 per share cash-and-stock offer in early trading on Wednesday, compared to a just under 22 percent discount at Tuesday's close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction. \nDealmakers said there will be an immediate slowdown in mergers and acquisitions as companies and advisers seek clues on how Trump's antitrust enforcement policy will take shape and who he will choose to lead the Justice Department's antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission. \n\"I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,\" said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media. \n\"It's going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how behaves as a leader,\" the banker added. \nThe president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law and the job is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree. \nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and \"optimistic\" regulators would approve the deal. \n\"(Trump's) policies had his discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T's goals,\" Stephens said at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York. \nTime Warner's shares were last down 1 percent to US$86.98, after trading as low as US$85.60, while AT&T shares were up 1.2 percent at US$37.44. The Dow and S&P 500 were both higher in early trading. \nThe election results mean \"increased risks\" for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said. \n\"At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,\" he added. \nAT&T offered US$107.50 per share for Time Warner last month, aiming to acquire content to attract online customers. It has said the Department of Justice will review the deal, which likely faces intense scrutiny since lawmakers are already concerned about cable company Comcast Corp's US$30 billion acquisition of NBCUniversal. \nBut other investors said it is \"too early to say\" that Trump will block the deal. \n\"Candidates say a lot to help them win election, and when reality sets in, you have to see what they do,\" said Josh Duitz, portfolio manager at Alpine Funds that owns AT&T shares. \nOne arbitrage investor who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Trump’s position on the deal was not perceived to be worse than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s or President Barack Obama’s, noting the shares were already trading at levels that suggested a roughly 30 percent chance of success. \n“It was already pricing in a doomsday scenario,” the investor said. “The doomsday is here, but in terms of antitrust, Hillary versus Trump are equal.” \nOther big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in their spreads on Wednesday morning. \nThe spreads of three pharmaceutical or health care-related deals that have run into antitrust troubles, Aetna -Humana , Anthem -Cigna and Walgreens -Rite Aid , actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration. \n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak and Diane Bartz in Washington, Michael Erman in New York, Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru) - Reuters",

      "title": "Trump’s vow to block AT&T–Time Warner tie-up creates a cloud over M&A market - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Shares of Time Warner Inc. fell Wednesday as investors digested the news of Donald Trump’s election victory after he pledged to block the media giant’s planned takeover by AT&T Inc.\n“Donald Trump will break up the new media conglomerate oligopolies that have gained enormous control over our information ... Donald Trump would never approve such a deal,” Trump’s campaign said on Oct. 23, a day after the deal was confirmed.\nAnalysts said that sentiment has been weighing on Time Warner stock TWX, -1.59% , which has lagged the AT&T T, +0.85% offer price ever since.\n“This deal risk probably explains a decent portion of the spread between [Time Warner] currently at $88 and the $108 deal price,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note.\nAT&T–Time Warner deal could hinge on data caps (2:44) AT&T's rivals are likely to cry foul over the company's practice of \"zero rating,\" in which it exempts its own video services from data-usage limits. Shalini Ramachandran explains how this could impact the proposed AT&T–Time Warner merger.\nAnalysts said Trump’s election will likely cast a shadow over the broader mergers and acquisitions market, and especially over some of the megadeals that are currently in the approval stage. Irrespective of deal size, companies will wait for the initial negative market reaction to calm down before making new investing decisions.\n“The M&A boom that had been cresting will take a pause,” said analysts at CreditSights. “Share buybacks will buy a company a lot more than [they] would have on Tuesday.”\nAbove all, the uncertainty created by a president with no political experience who has spent months railing against trade and criticizing some of America’s most important trading partners is expected to hamper activity. His victory has surprised many and shows that the lessons from this summer’s Brexit, the U.K. vote to leave the European Union, were not learned and caused an outcome few had expected, they said.\nDon’t miss: We’ve never had an outsider president quite like Donald Trump\n“Whether this represents a mandate to govern — candidate Trump was often at loggerheads with his own party on policy issues after all — remains to be seen,” they said.\nOther megadeals in the works include British American Tobacco PLC’s BATS, +2.21% $47 billion offer to take full control of Reynolds American Inc. and the $39 billion combination of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI, -1.63% and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, -1.22% AT&T’s $85.5 billion deal for Time Warner was the biggest to be announced in October, and accounted for almost half that month’s total value, which was a record for October. (Sign up for Swerve, a newsletter from MarketWatch covering everything you need to know about AT&T, Time Warner and the future of media.)\nRead: October’s merger mania looks less impressive now final results are tallied\nCredit Suisse analysts said concerns about the deal’s being blocked are overdone, noting that if it is reviewed by the Justice Department, it stands a good chance of approval as it is a vertical transaction that does not remove any competitors.\n“Even if there is an FCC review, we also argue that given (i) the Comcast/NBCU transaction was allowed in 2011, establishing a vertically integrated content/distribution player; and (ii) strong “net neutrality” rules are now enshrined in law, which make it unlawful for ISPs to discriminate between “edge” providers; blocking AT&T/Time Warner on public interest grounds would also be very difficult to justify, in our view,” they wrote in a note published ahead of the election\nIt could even be argued that the deal increase competition instead of reducing it, as it would create a larger rival to Comcast CMCSA, +1.14% , said the note. To block a deal, the onus would be on government to prove it would lessen competition and there is little precedent after more than 100 years of antitrust law to support that thesis.\nIf the deal were to be subject to Federal Communications Commission review, which could happen if Time Warner’s broadcast and satellite transmission licenses were transferred to AT&T, that would shift the burden away from government and onto the companies to prove the deal was in the public interest.\n“The public interest test is broad and can take into consideration virtually any public policy concern that the incumbent Commissioners deem to be important.,” said the note. “This makes it easier, in theory, for the deal to be blocked — and the risk of an FCC review is one of the main reasons Time Warner’s stock price trades so far from the value of the AT&T offer.”\nStill, the current challenges to two big health-insurance mergers — Anthem Inc.’s ANTM, -0.24% acquisition of Cigna Corp. CI, +1.44% and Aetna Inc.’s AET, +2.64% deal with Humana Inc. HUM, +2.70% — illustrate the current mistrust and distaste for big deals is not just a Trump phenomenon.\nSee: Aetna warned DOJ it would withdraw from exchanges if Humana deal was blocked\nMore from MarketWatch 10 reasons Donald Trump could still win in November Carl Icahn loses $350 million bet to save the Trump Taj Mahal 'Gerries': The Case for Women Over 35 Having Children",

      "text": "Reprints \nAT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) shares both fell at the open Wednesday, but then were recovering, amid more uncertainty over regulatory approval of their proposed blockbuster merger in the wake of Republican Donald Trump's election as president. \nShares of Verizon Communications ( VZ ) also slipped, but shares of T-Mobile US ( TMUS ) and Sprint ( S ) were up in early trading Wednesday, with some observers speculating a Trump presidency might ease they way for any possible merger between the Nos. 3 and 4 U.S. wireless services providers. \nAT&T stock, down 1% at one point, was up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today . Time Warner stock, down as much as 2.8% at the open, was down 1.2% Wednesday morning, near 86.50. AT&T announced its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner on Oct. 24. \nWhile AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 per share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock has been trading far below that level amid uncertain regulatory approval. \nIBD'S TAKE: Some investors like telecom companies because many pay high dividends, but there are other options at IBD's Income Investor . \nRepublican Trump had voiced his opposition to the deal prior to the Oct. 24 announcement, saying the companies were part of the media \"power structure\" he's fighting against. Several high-ranking Democratic lawmakers also have raised doubts over the merger. \nTime Warner faces a potential $1.725 billion breakup fee if a new buyer surfaces, while AT&T's reverse breakup fee would be $500 million if the telecom conglomerate walks away. AT&T acquired satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV in 2015. \nAnalysts had expected the merger review to drag on into early 2018. Time Warner shareholders will own about 15% of the combined company. \nSprint stock was up 8% in early trading Wednesday, while T-Mobile stock was up nearly 2%. The Obama administration has been opposed to a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, which lag far behind AT&T and Verizon among wireless services providers. \nRELATED: ",

      "text": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Imperiled By Trump (T,TWX) By Donna Fuscaldo | November 9, 2016 — 9:34 AM EST \nAT&T Inc. ( T ) and Time Warner Inc. ( TWX ) shares were taking a hit in pre-market trading Wednesday as investors digested what a Donald Trump presidency could mean to their $85 billion deal. \nWhen the deal was announced a few weeks ago, the then Republican nominee said he would block the deal and now investors will be waiting to see if Trump follows through on his vow once he become president in January. ‘Too Much Concentration of Power’ \n\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said during a stump speech when the deal was being announced. \nTrump, who had railed against the media during the run up to election night also said he would look into breaking up Comcast and NBCUniversal’s merger, which was inked backed in 2011. Trump Isn’t Your Regular Republican \nTrump’s comments about AT&T and Time Warner fly n the face of the traditional stance of Republicans when it comes to mergers, but Trump isn’t a traditional Republican. Throughout his campaign he has redefined how to run and win the highest office in the land, often attacking the media as biased and the system as rigged against him. The deal between AT&T and Time Warner is already expected to undergo a long drawn-out review process that could include the Federal Communications Commission , which on Tuesday prompted Oppenheimer to downgraded its rating on AT&T to perform from outperform. \n\"We see the Time Warner merger as facing higher regulatory hurdles and taking more like 15 months to complete,” wrote Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan in a research note. “AT&T is also facing some wireless headwinds in the next year.\" Other Legal Issues Remain \nIn downgrading AT&T, Horan said the FCC may initiate a formal review focusing on AT&T’s Zero Rating policy. AT&T's upcoming DirecTV Now service, is an example of zero rating, a practice in which a network operator or internet service provider doesn’t charge customers for data used by a specific application, in this case DirecTV. Opponents of zero-rating claim it violates the principle of net neutrality, which is the idea that all internet traffic should be treated equally. (See also: Net Neutrality: Pros and Cons .) \nOn top of the FCC, Horan says the Department of Justice’s move last week to sue DirecTV for what the government agency said was illegal sharing of information with competing pay-TV providers when negotiating the airing of Dodgers baseball games in Los Angeles. The DOJ is contending DirecTV was the “ringleader” in the scheme. (See also: DOJ Sues DirecTV Over Dodgers Baseball .) \nWith Trump as president more uncertainty is baked into the deal’s prospects.

      "text": "Print \nAT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) executives were pretty enthusiastic when they announced their $85 billion mega media deal last month. The challenge then was selling it to investors. The challenge now is to convince skeptical president-elect Donald Trump that it should prevail. \nContinue Reading Below \n“We look forward to working with president-elect Trump and his transition team,” said AT&T CFO John Stephens Wednesday while speaking to investors at a Wells Fargo ( WFC ) conference. He added: “We’ve been the leading investor in this country for the last five years running and our Time Warner transaction is all about innovation, economic development, consumer choice and investment in infrastructure…”Ironically, Trump, who authored the best-selling business book with Tony Schwartz, “Trump: Art of the Deal,” doesn’t like this one despite having largely pro-business economic policies. \n“AT&T is buying Time Warner, a deal that we will not approve,” he said during a speech last month in Gettysburg, PA. “It is too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” he added.

It may have just been a stray comment made in the context of his anger about CNN's coverage of his campaign. \nStill, it is enough for Wall Street analysts to raise alarms. \nBTIG analyst Rich Greenfield said in a Wednesday blog post that \"the Trump Presidency adds to the risk surrounding regulatory approval of AT&T ( T , Tech30 ) Time Warner ( TWX ) .\" \nAt an investors conference on Wednesday, AT&T's chief financial officer John Stephens struck a confident pose, saying, \"From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team.\" \nRelated: Justice files antitrust suit against DirecTV over Dodgers broadcasts \nStephens added, \"Our Time Warner transaction is all about innovation and economic development, consumer choice, and investment in infrastructure with regard to providing a great 5G mobile broadband experience. So we look forward with optimism to working with the leadership and providing benefits to consumers and to our shareholders.\" \nTime Warner declined to comment. \nBoth stocks dropped on Wednesday morning following Trump's Tuesday night triumph, but by the end of the day had returned to their previous day prices. \nThe Time Warner-AT&T deal was announced on October 22. Trump called the combination of the two companies \"an example of the power structure I'm fighting.\" \nRelated: Time Warner posts strong results as AT&T deal looms \nHe also criticized Comcast's 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal and said, \"We'll look at breaking that deal up, and other deals like that.\" \nTrump said \"deals like this destroy democracy.\" \nTrump's pledge placed him far to the left of President Obama, whose administration approved the Comcast deal with numerous conditions. \nThe AT&T-Time Warner deal will also have to be approved by federal antitrust regulators. \nPresidents generally let the regulators make antitrust determinations without weighing in publicly, so Trump's pledge broke with precedent. \nAt the time many media insiders waved off the threat, citing the likelihood of a Hillary Clinton presidency and Trump's reputation for blustery rhetoric. \nHis comments were made in the heat of a campaign on a day when Trump bashed the media for giving too much attention to the women who accused him of unwanted advances and sexual assault. \nNormally Republican administrations are more amenable to mergers and acquisitions than Democratic administrations. \nBut this moment in time is not normal. \nCNNMoney (New York)   3:49 PM ET",

      "text": "Donald Trump 's stance against AT&T's takeover of Time Warner may herald a broader intervention in mega-mergers under the next U.S. administration.\nTrump, who defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's presidential election, has vowed to block the $85.4 billion transaction — the largest deal announced globally this year — calling it \"poison\" to democracy.\n\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said in an Oct. 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pa. — the same day the deal was announced.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump took aim at the media, repeatedly calling the election \"rigged\" and singling out major outlets like The New York Times and Time Warner's CNN. He said he would push for a breakup of NBCUniversal and Comcast , which merged in 2013.\nA merged AT&T-Time Warner may not do consumers much good Tribune news services AT&T and Time Warner are playing up how their $85.4 billion merger will lead to innovative new experiences for customers.

But analysts, public-interest groups and some politicians are far from convinced.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump said it should be killed. Tim Kaine , the Democratic...\n(Tribune news services) That stance casts a cloud over a potential round of media mergers that analysts have predicted as content-creators position themselves for mobile by combining, as Lions Gate Entertainment and John Malone 's Starz are doing, or teaming up with distributors, like Time Warner is doing with AT&T.\n\"A Trump administration will be a wildcard for antitrust enforcement,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the Washington-based policy group Public Knowledge and a former U.S. antitrust official. \"Trump certainly railed against consolidation during the campaign, but we don't know what kind of enforcers he'll select to steer competition policy.\"\nWhile it's unclear whether a Trump administration would oppose M&A more broadly, he has given some signals: He's excoriated free-trade pacts, saying they sent jobs to China and Mexico, and pledged to increase the repatriation of cash held by U.S. companies overseas at a much lower tax rate, making acquisitions by American companies abroad less attractive.\nIn a survey by Intralinks Holdings Inc. before the election, 56 percent of global deal-making executives said a President Trump would be bad for M&A — though only 15 percent foresaw him winning.\n\"Much will depend on the extent to which President-elect Trump's campaign positioning translates to policy,\" said Mike Flockhart, a corporate partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills in London. \"But if the U.S. moves in a more protectionist direction, we could see an impact on cross-border deal activity.\"\nWhy AT&T's play for Time Warner makes sense Editorial Board To get a sense of why AT&T wants to buy Time Warner for $85 billion (and why the deal makes sense), consider how your screen-watching habits have changed over the past decade: You've progressed from staring at the television to consuming all kinds of media wherever you go.\nLots of people still...\nTo get a sense of why AT&T wants to buy Time Warner for $85 billion (and why the deal makes sense), consider how your screen-watching habits have changed over the past decade: You've progressed from staring at the television to consuming all kinds of media wherever you go.\nLots of people still...\n(Editorial Board) The general uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies following his historic upset of Clinton initially sent financial markets reeling, though S&P 500 Index futures have since pared losses along with European equities. Mexico's peso led emerging-market currencies lower amid concern U.S. trade policies will become more protectionist.\nStill, Jean-Francois Comte, co-founder of Lutetia Capital, whose investment strategies include merger arbitrage, said he didn't expect the Trump administration to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, despite the rhetoric. The outcome of the election could even be a positive for pending combinations of U.S. health insurers, which faced criticism from Clinton, he said.\n\"There might be some stress short term because of these statements, but let the dust settle,\" Comte said.\nAT&T looks forward to working with Trump when he becomes president and remains optimistic about the Time Warner deal, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said Wednesday at an investor conference. Time Warner declined to comment.\nOther big pending deals include Dow Chemical Co.'s $59 billion merger with DuPont Co., Bayer AG's combination with Monsanto Co., and the two health insurance megadeals — Anthem Inc.'s bid for Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc.'s offer for Humana Inc.\nEverything you need to know about AT&T's deal with Time Warner You may have heard that AT&T is buying Time Warner for a whopping $85.4 billion, in a deal that could bring sweeping changes to the information and entertainment economies. If you're just catching up on the news, here's a short rundown, in plain English, that'll get you up to speed. Q: Back up...\nYou may have heard that AT&T is buying Time Warner for a whopping $85.4 billion, in a deal that could bring sweeping changes to the information and entertainment economies. If you're just catching up on the news, here's a short rundown, in plain English, that'll get you up to speed. Q: Back up...\nRead the story Overall, Comte said he didn't expect a negative impact on M&A. In fact, the prospect of the White House and Congress under Republican control creates greater certainty, and \"historically, Republicans have not been bad for M&A,\" he said.\nNot everyone is so sanguine. Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Securities LLP in London, said Qualcomm Inc.'s $47-billion purchase of Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors NV, announced last month, could be at risk under Trump.\nThere's also been a wave of Chinese investors buying U.S. technology companies in recent years and that could slow if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States takes a tougher stance under Trump, Campling said.\nInvestors in Syngenta AG may breathe a sigh of relief that ChemChina's $43 billion takeover of the Swiss pesticides-maker has already been cleared by the committee. The probe by U.S. national security officials had been considered a potential stumbling block for the deal, which is still subject to antitrust review by regulators in a number of countries.\nWhile Syngenta shares may fall in the short term should the U.S. dollar — the currency in which the Chemchina offer is priced — come under pressure, Trump's victory is unlikely to derail the takeover, according to Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Philipp Gamper.\n\"The Syngenta-ChemChina deal is basically over the line,\" Gamper said by telephone.\nWith assistance from Alice Baghdjian Scott Moritz Todd Shields Gerry Smith and Crayton Harrison",

      "text": "Search 7 Ways a Trump Presidency Could Hit Hollywood’s Bottom Line \nFrom the AT&T-Time Warner deal to net neutrality, the business of entertainment might face some blowback Matt Pressberg | November 9, 2016 @ 4:39 PM Vince Bucci/Getty Images \nLast night, America voted to elect Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States. Hollywood chose otherwise — even if the president-elect’s highest profile prior his executive role was presiding over “The Apprentice.” \nBut now that Trump’s America is imminent, it’s going to affect the entertainment industry’s bottom line. Here are seven areas to watch: Also Read: Why Donald Trump's Win Is a Rejection of Hollywood \n1. China Chinese companies, particularly the Dalian Wanda Group, have been scooping up Hollywood assets like Legendary Entertainment and Dick Clark Productions by the billion — which has recently got some attention from legislators in D.C. concerned about national security implications of China-owned content producers. \nTrump made China one of his main campaign targets, promising high tariffs and to name the country a currency manipulator. His tough talk on the Middle Kingdom is a concern to Hollywood, not just because it may scare away deep-pocketed buyers, but because it threatens their access to the lucrative Chinese box office, which could be the world’s largest by the end of the decade. \n“For our movies, China is a huge component,” a Hollywood producer told TheWrap. “If the election ultimately diminishes our ability to get movies into China, it’s very detrimental to all big tentpole movies.” Also Read: Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Other Superheroes React in Horror to Trump Victory (Video) \n2. AT&T-Time Warner deal Trump has already promised his supporters that he won’t allow AT&T’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which would be the biggest media deal in 16 years. That stance put Trump in agreement with former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who called on the Justice Department to block the deal. Hillary Clinton took a more nuanced approach, calling for it to be “looked into.” \nAT&T’s bull case for the megadeal was that combining its distribution might and data analytics with Time Warner’s content, it could develop competitively priced and compelling streaming services to position itself as television moves from cable to the internet. Time Warner’s stock dropped just 1 percent Wednesday, but at $86.60, it remains well below AT&T’s acquisition price of $107.50 a share, indicating skepticism regardless of the outcome. But the election of Trump isn’t likely to improve its chances. Also Read: A Pep Talk to America From California, Where We've Been Through This Nightmare Before \n3. Press freedoms The president-elect has promised to “open up the libel laws” and taken aim at journalists — sometimes by name — at rallies across the country. While a free press is protected by the First Amendment, a Trump administration could make it easier for aggrieved parties to sue media outlets, like the Hulk Hogan trial that brought down Gawker — funded by Trump donor and Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel. \n4. Facebook Trump-related articles dominated Facebook, which is getting plenty of criticism for its role in facilitating a fake news misinformation bubble — and impacting the election . President Obama even called it a “dust cloud of nonsense.” Also Read: Alec Baldwin Says 'American Political System Is Broken' After Donald Trump Win \nWith the social networking giant vacuuming up the media industry’s traditional sources of ad revenue, media companies have earnestly partnered with Facebook — some might argue, out of desperation. But with its valuing of engagement and shareability over veracity seeming to have had an impact on this election — and the company recently overstating video views — the media and entertainment world could seriously re-evaluate its relationship with Facebook. \n5. Net neutrality In 2014, Trump tweeted his opposition to President Obama’s support of net neutrality — not allowing internet providers to throttle data or provide “fast lanes” for preferred content — which was codified in 2015 with new FCC rules. Media companies are lamenting the likely curbing of the open internet, and content companies investing heavily in streaming video are also facing headwinds. \n“We have to imagine anyone focused on over-the-top video would view a repeal of net neutrality as a meaningful negative,” media analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a Wednesday note. \n6. Labor unions International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States President Matthew D. Loeb issued a statement Wednesday saying that Trump’s “anti-union statements virtually guarantee a rough road ahead for unions and the members they represent.” \nTrump did well among union members this election, especially in the industrial Midwest, but he has endorsed the mainstream Republican position on organized labor, which supports anti-union policies like “right to work.” Hollywood has a substantial group of well-paid union workers who now face a Republican-controlled government that threatens to pull back organized labor protections. Also Read: Hollywood Stars Freak Out Over Prospect of Trump Win \n7. Piracy Trump, Bernie Sanders and eventually Hillary Clinton — but not Obama — oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries — but not China. Trump’s most consistent political position is probably his strong distaste for free trade, which he has argued ad nauseam is ripping Americans off. \nHowever, the TPP also includes tough anti-piracy protections , crucially important to the content creation industry. Obama will almost certainly try to pass the TPP during the lame-duck session in Congress, but if he can’t — and it definitely seems the national mood is against it — it’s almost certainly dead in the water in a Trump administration. 5 Historic Elections Crazier Than This One (Photos) \nThe 2016 election will be over in just a few hours. But if you think the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton race is the craziest in our history, you'll be relieved or horrified to learn that we've survived even crazier ones... as the following examples show. \nThe 1824 presidential election was a four-way race (are you kidding me) between members of the same party (no, seriously). Andrew Jackson won the most Electoral College and popular votes, but because no one had a plurality, the House of Representatives got to choose the president. Ridiculous. \nIn what Jackson supporters called the \"corrupt bargain,\" the House chose John Quincy Adams, the first son of a president to become president himself. History would repeat itself in 2000, when another mess of a vote would result in a presidential son becoming president. Jackson's supporters' rage helped fuel his 1828 victory and 1832 re-election. \nIn the 1912 election, the incumbent, William Howard Taft, got fewer Electoral College votes than former president-turned-third-party candidate Teddy Roosevelt. Taft had been Roosevelt's War Secretary, and Roosevelt supported Taft as his successor in 1908, but he quickly regretted that and ran against Taft as the leader of the \"Bull Moose\" party. One more twist: They both lost to Woodrow Wilson. I'm not bull moose-ing you. \nIn 1940, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt did something no one had done before when he ran for a third term. (He won, and died in office during his fourth.) \nBefore you get any ideas, President Obama can't run again, because after Roosevelt, we passed the Twenty-Second Amendment, which sets presidential term limits. That means Roosevelt will be the first and last president to serve more than two terms. \nIn 1968, Democrat frontrunner Robert F. Kennedy was shot and killed. Crazy, and horrible. For all Donald Trump's talk about Hillary Clinton getting shot , this election has been mercifully free of actual shootings. \nIn 1972, just four years after Kennedy, segregationist Democratic candidate George Wallace was shot and paralyzed. Wallace survived and later made peace with some of the Civil Rights leaders he bedeviled in the 1960s, but too late, alas, to change his historic reputation as a champion of racism. \nThe 1972 election was bananas. Like Banana Republic bananas. Thomas Eagleton had to step down as George McGovern's veep nominee after it was revealed he had been hospitalized for depression. McGovern went on to lose, badly, to President Nixon, who would go on to resign in the Watergate scandal in 1974. \nA positive aside: 1972 also included an African-American woman candidate, Shirley Chisholm. She was the first black candidate for a major party's nomination, and the first woman to run for the Democratic nod. A progressive hero, she paved the way for both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. \nDishonorable mention: Let's not forget that for more than a month after the 2000 election, we had no idea who the next president would be, thanks to the farcical Florida recount. Embarrassing. \nGeorge W. Bush only got the nomination after a whispering campaign that his Republican rival, John McCain, had fathered a black love child . I know that sounds like something that would happen in an election in the 1850s, but no, it was just 16 years ago. You can read all about it here. Previous Slide Next Slide 1 of 12 \nWhatever happens at the polls today, it won’t be crazier than what happened in 1824 \nThe 2016 election will be over in just a few hours. But if you think the Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton race is the craziest in our history, you'll be relieved or horrified to learn that we've survived even crazier ones... as the following examples show.",

      "text": "U.S. corporate dealmakers were likely to put major merger plans on hold as they assess whether U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his populist promises and a threat to block AT&T Inc’s purchase of Time Warner Inc, or act more like traditional business-friendly Republican administrations. Trump’s rhetoric and the personal nature of the campaign, which included little discussion of policy, left many uncertain about the new U.S. leader’s plans, including how his administration will handle mega-mergers.\nWall Street braced for a drop in deals, with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday projecting a 20 to 30 percent downside for earnings of banks that focus on merger and acquisition advice, and Jefferies saying that uncertainty about Trump’s policy on trade, healthcare, taxes and energy could hamper underwriting activity and M&A globally.\n“I think a lot of deals will hit the pause button for a bit until we get some clarity on whether President Trump will moderate or be as disruptive as some expect,” said a senior Wall Street banker who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with the media. “It’s going to be a tough environment for everything until we see how [Trump] behaves as a leader,” the banker added.\nTrump said in October that AT&T’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio was an example of a “power structure” rigged against him and voters, and that he would block a deal.\nThe gap between Time Warner shares and the implied value of AT&T’s cash and stock bid was over 23 percent in afternoon trading on Wednesday, compared to around 22 percent at Tuesday’s close, indicating greater investor skepticism that the companies will be able to complete the transaction.\nStill, some investors believed the man who considers himself business friendly would take a more moderate tone than in the campaign once he assumes office, as he did on Tuesday night in his acceptance speech. “We think Trump will be pretty good for merger and acquisition activity. As a general proposition, he is pro-business and pro-free market,” said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management.\nOther big pending U.S. deals also did not see sharp changes in their spreads on Wednesday morning, and the spreads of three pharmaceutical or health care-related deals that have encountered antitrust troubles, Aetna-Humana, Anthem-Cigna and Walgreens-Rite Aid, actually narrowed, signaling investors may think they are more likely to close under a Trump administration.\nThe president does not directly decide if a merger is illegal under antitrust law and the job is done by the U.S. Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission, which divide up the work of assessing mergers. If one of the agencies decides to stop a deal, it must convince a judge to agree.\nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens on Wednesday said his company was looking forward to working with Trump and “optimistic” regulators would approve the deal. Trump’s policies and discussions “about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T’s goals,” Stephens said at the Wells Fargo technology, media and telecoms conference in New York.\nTime Warner’s shares were last down 1 percent to $86.71, after trading as low as $85.60, while AT&T shares were up just under 1 percent at $37.24. The Dow and S&P 500 were both over 1 percent higher in late afternoon trading. The election results mean “increased risks” for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research, said.\n“At the very least, there are going to be individuals put in place (by a Trump administration) that are going to make the deal a lot more challenging to complete,” he added. Trump’s protectionist stance also raises the risk that some foreign corporations, including from China, may face higher hurdles in trying to take over American companies, dealmakers said.\n“If you were thinking about doing a cross-border deal six months ago you weren’t considering things like potential trade barriers, protectionism and tariffs. These are things you have to at least develop a view on and factor into the risk assessment of doing an overseas deal now,” said Johs Worsoe, MUFG’s head of investment banking & markets in the Americas.\nReuters \nThe post US Elections results push AT&T-Time Warner and other mergers in a limbo appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Donald Trumps Views on AT&T-Time Warner Deal Endanger Future Big Mega-Deals Reddit \nDonald Trump's stance against AT&T Inc.'s takeover of Time Warner Inc. may herald a broader intervention in mega-mergers under the next US administration. \nTrump, who defeated Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's presidential election, has vowed to block the $85.4 billion transaction - the largest deal announced globally this year - calling it \"poison\" to democracy. \n\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN - a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" Trump said in an October 22 speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania - the same day the deal was announced. \nAT&T shares closed 1.2 percent higher Wednesday at $37.44, while Time Warner fell 1.5 percent to $86.60 in New York. That sent the spread on the deal - the difference between the offer price and the target's current trading - to the widest gap since the transaction was announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the campaign trail, Trump took aim at the media, repeatedly calling the election \"rigged\" and singling out major outlets like the New York Times and Time Warner's CNN. He said he would push for a breakup of NBCUniversal and Comcast Corp., which merged in 2013.\n( Also see: Donald Trump's Stunning Victory Leaves Silicon Valley in Shock ) \nThat stance casts a cloud over a potential round of media mergers that analysts are predicting. Content creators are positioning themselves for mobile by combining - as Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. and John Malone's Starz are doing - or by teaming up with distributors, like Time Warner is doing with AT&T. \n\"A Trump administration will be a wildcard for antitrust enforcement,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the Washington-based policy group Public Knowledge and a former US antitrust official. \"Trump certainly railed against consolidation during the campaign, but we don't know what kind of enforcers he'll select to steer competition policy.\" \nWhile it's unclear whether a Trump administration would oppose M&A more broadly, he has given some signals: He's excoriated free-trade pacts, saying they sent jobs to China and Mexico, and pledged to increase the repatriation of cash held by US companies overseas at a much lower tax rate, making acquisitions by American companies abroad less attractive. \nIn a survey by Intralinks Holdings Inc. before the election, 56 percent of global deal-making executives said a President Trump would be bad for M&A - though only 15 percent foresaw him winning. \n\"Much will depend on the extent to which President-elect Trump's campaign positioning translates to policy,\" said Mike Flockhart, a corporate partner at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills in London. \"But if the US moves in a more protectionist direction, we could see an impact on cross-border deal activity.\" \nWhile the general uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies following his historic upset of Clinton initially sent financial markets reeling, U.S. stocks and the dollar closed higher amid speculation Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will pursue business-friendly policies. \nShort-term stress Still, Jean-Francois Comte, co-founder of Lutetia Capital, whose investment strategies include merger arbitrage, said he didn't expect the Trump administration to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal, despite the rhetoric. The outcome of the election could even be a positive for pending combinations of US health insurers, which faced criticism from Clinton, he said. \n\"There might be some stress short term because of these statements, but let the dust settle,\" Comte said. \nAT&T looks forward to working with Trump when he becomes president and remains optimistic about the Time Warner deal, Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said Wednesday at an investor conference. Time Warner declined to comment. \n( Also see: How Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella Reacted to Donald Trump's Victory ) \nOther big pending deals include Dow Chemical Co.'s $59 billion merger with DuPont Co., Bayer AG's combination with Monsanto Co., and the two health insurance megadeals - Anthem Inc.'s bid for Cigna Corp. and Aetna Inc.'s offer for Humana Inc. \nShares in Aetna and Humana, both of which have scaled back their Obamacare coverage offerings in recent months, climbed Wednesday. \nOverall, Comte said he didn't expect a negative impact on M&A. In fact, the prospect of the White House and Congress under Republican control creates greater certainty, and \"historically, Republicans have not been bad for M&A,\" he said. \nChinese wave Not everyone is so sanguine. Neil Campling, an analyst at Northern Trust Securities LLP in London, said Qualcomm Inc.'s $47-billion purchase of Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors NV, announced last month, could be at risk under Trump. \nThere's also been a wave of Chinese investors buying US technology companies in recent years and that could slow if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States takes a tougher view under Trump, Campling said. \nThe committee, whose chairman is the Treasury Secretary, is made up of senior officials from Homeland Security and other government departments. This year it's blocked or sought changes to a number of high-profile Chinese deals, including the purchases of Royal Philips NV's Lumileds lighting-components business and printer maker Lexmark International Inc. \n\"It's one of the tools that Trump has that is perhaps less blunt than all-out tariffs. It's one of the things that could change within a relatively short timetable,\" said Annabella Fu van Bijnen, a partner at Linklaters LLP in Hong Kong. \"How would they do it is an open question. Is it a broadening of their mandate, or is it a tougher stance?\" \nInvestors in Syngenta AG may breathe a sigh of relief that China National Chemical Corp.'s $43 billion takeover of the Swiss pesticides maker has already been cleared by the committee. The probe by U.S. national security officials had been considered a potential stumbling block for the deal, which is still subject to antitrust review by regulators in a number of countries. \nWhile Syngenta shares may fall in the short term should the U.S. dollar -- the currency in which the ChemChina offer is priced -- come under pressure, Trump's victory is unlikely to derail the takeover, according to Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Philipp Gamper. \n\"The Syngenta-ChemChina deal is basically over the line,\" Gamper said by telephone. \n© 2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "Michael Kovac | Getty Images Liberty Media's John Malone The AT&T - Time Warner deal is a great move for both parties especially in a world increasingly cutting the cord, said Liberty Media chairman John Malone. \n\"The bigger opportunity is to make the content businesses more profitable and more certain,\" Malone told CNBC. \nThe telecommunications executive said the deal provides AT&T with \"substantial diversification\" to its core business. Even if people decide to buy content a la carte through over-the-top streaming plans, Time Warner's channels and shows would be in demand for these smaller services, he said. AT&T would also benefit from getting the lowest possible transfer prices for Time Warner's portfolio. \n\"There is definite synergy between owning the content and having the largest distributor,\" Malone said. \nAT&T announced in October that it was purchasing Time Warner for more than $85 billion. The deal still has to pass U.S. regulators, and Donald Trump has previously said as president he would block the dea l. However, since it is a regulatory issue, it is unclear how much power the president-elect would have in the matter. \nContent is becoming more valuable as consumers move away from standard cable and satellite packages and towards other digital content providers like Netflix or stand-alone services like HBO. By purchasing Time Warner, AT&T has a better foothold not only in the content, but can bolster its digital advertising business. The company is one of the leaders in cross-screen advertising, and having content that people want to watch could potentially draw in advertisers who want to reach these people on mobile and on TV.",

No buyer has stepped up for the social media company despite a record month in October for U.S. merger and acquisition announcements by value. The month saw the biggest tie-up proposal of the year in AT&T 's more than $85 billion tie-up with Time Warner. \n\"It's going to go through a lot of regulatory screening. It's beyond just Mr. [Donald] Trump. And the market expectation that this deal may or may not happen, materialize, is not very high,\" Alwaleed said. \n\"I understand it's a vertical integration, not horizontal, but still, I think it's going to go some deep scrutiny by the regulators in the United States,\" he said. \nAlwaleed is chairman of Kingdom Holding, whose top investments include Time Warner , Twitter , Citi , Apple and eBay , according to the firm's website. \nThe Saudi prince also told CNBC he was more positive about Trump , saying the real estate mogul would likely be different in office than as a candidate. \nOf his other investments, Alwaleed said Apple \"delivered very good results,\" but the market wants more from its management. \n\nHe said Citi is back to becoming \"a money-making machine\" given \"capable\" management and the potential for rising interest rates, adding the stock could rise to $60 or $70 a share. Shares of the bank were 2.4 percent higher, above $52 a share, in midday trading. \nThe Saudi billionaire also said \"Snapchat is a very good company.\" But at least for now, he said, \"I don't use Facebook or Snapchat. I only use Twitter.\"\n\nMorning Squawk: CNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.

      "text": "UPDATE 1-Altice sees more U.S. deals if AT&T-Time Warner merger goes through Updated: November 10, 2016 — 1:14 PM EST Share \n* An AT&T-Time Warner merger may trigger more deals-exec \n* Altice third-quarter results beat estimates \n* Group focused on integration of U.S. businesses (Recasts story, adds executive quotes, details) \nBy Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic \nPARIS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Altice, the fourth-biggest cable operator in the United States, sees more deals between media and telecoms operators in the country if AT&T Inc's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc eventually goes through under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. \nTrump said in October that AT&T's proposed acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio would put too much power in the hands of one company, and he would block a deal, raising doubts among investors about potential deals in the sector. \nThe failure of such a mega-deal would challenge the strategy of Altice's owner, billionaire Patrick Drahi, who is also betting on the convergence between content providers and telecommunications operators. \n\"There was a lot said during the campaign which people don't necessarily expect to occur during the administration,\" said Dexter Goei, Altice USA chief, on Thursday. \n\"I do think that to the extent that the AT&T - Time Warner transaction gets approved, it may trigger more consolidation over the next few years here as people start to continue to look to position themselves on the convergence.\" \nCable entrepreneur Drahi made his fortune through debt-fueled acquisitions that are swiftly followed by cost cutting to boost profits. \nHe recently entered the United States market via the takeovers of regional player Suddenlink and New-York-based Cablevision. \nAltice reported on Thursday a better-than-expected core operating profit for the three months ended Sept. 30, driven by the strong performance of recently-acquired U.S. businesses. \nIts third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose by 8.3 percent from a year ago on a comparable basis to 2.33 billion euros ($2.53 billion). \nThis beat analysts' average forecast of 2.27 billion euros in a Reuters poll. \nThird-quarter group revenue was flat at 5.89 billion euros. \nThe group's U.S. businesses, put together under business unit Altice USA, saw their core operating profit jump by more than 20 percent in the quarter. \nAltice USA is drawing up plans for a potential initial public offering to expand Drahi's U.S. cable empire, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. \nThe group is focused on its U.S. operations and does not plan any big acquisition for now, Goei said. \nAltice's French telecoms business, SFR Group, continued to lose customers and revenue in the third quarter but posted an increase of 0.6 percent of its core operating profit to 1.04 billion euros. \n($1 = Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate Commenting policy | ",

      "text": "Report: FCC Raises Concerns Over AT&T’s DIRECTV Now Service   John Anon \nAT&T is buying Time Warner and reportedly for a price which exceeds $80 billion. At least, that is the plan. AT&T made the announcement on their intent to buy back towards the end of October and ever since, debate has raged over whether the deal will be able to go through. Such a merger would give AT&T a clear route into the TV market, which is something that the company clearly seems intent on and especially following their subsequent announcement detailing their plan to offer a new DIRECTV service for $35 per month , which gives the customers access to more than 100 channels. Needless to say, the assumption is that many of the tier 1 channels could come as a result of that purchase of Time Warner. \nWell, it now as looks as though there are some official complaints starting to surface over AT&T’s plans as a new report out of Reuters today, details that they have seen a letter sent from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to AT&T. While the bulk of the contents of the letter have not been revealed, the important bits have and that is that the FCC has “ serious concerns ” over the $35 per month DIRECTV service. The reason being, it could price competitors out of offering competing services. \nAs you might expect, the logic behind this is that the new AT&T service could be falling foul of the FCC’s net neutrality regulations. What the FCC particularly are concerned about is whether the service (which will also be accessible via a free and zero-rated app) will prove to be significantly more affordably than competing services. While that sounds good from the consumer point of view, as cheaper is better, the issue is that if other companies cannot compete, then the market no longer remains ‘fair’. As the current reports notes, the letter is said to state that the service “ may obstruct competition and harm consumers “. As a result, it also seems to be the case that the FCC has given AT&T until November 21 to reply to the letter and its criticisms and presumably, explain how the service will not be in breach of those net neutrality regulations.

      "text": "October 23, 2016 A merged AT&T-Time Warner may not do consumers much good AT&T, which plans to launch DirecTV Now later this month, said Thursday that consumers gain from watching video without using up their data — a practice known as zero rating. Any video provider can pay AT&T, “at our lowest wholesale rates,” to let customers watch without using up their AT&T data, said AT&T executive Bob Quinn in an emailed statement.\nThe FCC has looked at other companies’ zero-rating practices as well. In its letter to AT&T, the FCC said that its concern was “not with zero-rating per se,” which the agency has said may have some consumer benefits, but about using it to hurt competition. \nThe FCC says that AT&T’s approach is problematic because a rival streaming video provider could find it “infeasible” to compete with DirecTV Now’s $35-a-month price if this competitor also had to pay AT&T to exempt its customers from data caps. And not paying AT&T could make a competitor’s video service less attractive to customers, the FCC said. \nConsumer advocates have also raised concerns about zero rating with regards to AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner Inc., which owns HBO, CNN and TBS. They have said that if the deal goes through, the telecom giant could try to favor its own Time Warner content and disadvantage other video providers. \nOther phone or cable companies that apply zero rating include Verizon, which exempts its go90 video app and football games streamed from its NFL Mobile app from wireless data caps, and Comcast, which lets customers of its Stream cable-replacement service watch without it counting against a home internet meter.

      "text": "Altice, the European cable and telecom giant that recently acquired Cablevision Systems in a $17.7 billion deal, reported on Thursday that Cablevision lost fewer pay TV subscribers in the third quarter than in the year-ago period.\nAltice USA CEO Dexter Goei on the earnings conference call was asked about AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it follows the trend of full convergence. When big deals like that happen, the industry tends to \"start focusing on figuring out where all the different pieces end up,\" he added. \"We obviously are going to pay attention. We are very focused on the operational side still here in the U.S., but we will pay attention to if there is any opportunity for us to do anything in the next couple of years.\"\nAltice management previously said it expects to mostly keep its head down this year after buying Cablevision and Suddenlink, with Goei calling it \"a year of integration and operation.\" But analysts have suggested 2017 could see Altice USA look for more acquisitions in the cable sector.\nAsked what the election outcome would mean for the industry, Goei said it was \"too early,\" because there has been no indication of president-elect Donald Trump's policies. But he said that the stock market seems to have reacted \"nicely, particularly in our sector.\"\nRead more: Europe's Altice Closes Cablevision Acquisition, Expanding U.S. Presence\nAnd citing the future Republican dominated Congress, Goei argued that \"on balance … for cable operators, it is probably flat to positive.\"\nAsked about upcoming new streaming services from DirecTV, namely DirecTV Now, and Hulu, Goei said: \"This is one of the reasons why we are so focused on delivering our Home Hub Center\" as quickly as possible. A great user interface and an overall better service experience is key, he explained. \"If we continue to focus on ... a superior customer experience,\" the company will continue to do \"fine,\" he said.\nCablevision, now called Optimum, ended September with around 2.55 million pay TV subscribers after losing 28,000 in the third quarter, down from a year-ago drop of 33,000. Quarterly revenue grew 2.2 percent, or 2.7 percent on a constant currency basis. Adjusted quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 33.1 percent on that basis.\nSmall U.S. cable operator Suddenlink, in which Altice acquired a 70 percent stake in a $9.1 billion deal late last year, lost 12,000 video subscribers in the latest quarter, compared with a loss of 9,000 in the year-ago period, to end September with 1.05 million.\nSuddenlink revenue grew 6.2 percent, or 6.7 percent on a constant currency basis, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization jumped 20.8 percent on that basis.\nAltice, founded by billionaire Patrick Drahi, lauded the performance of its U.S. business as \"better-than-expected\" and said it was building a \"best-in-class U.S. cable system to sustain growth.\"\nThe company on Thursday also reported an 8.3 percent gain in its quarterly adjusting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $2.54 billion (2.33 billion euros) helped by the U.S. assets. Third-quarter revenue stayed unchanged at $6.41 billion (5.89 billion euros), with U.S. revenue up, while French revenue declined 2.4 percent.\nSaid Altice CEO Michel Combes: \"Altice USA with Optimum and Suddenlink has seen a further acceleration in revenue growth while simultaneously improving margins materially, driven by accelerated investments in upgrading our networks and services.\"\nRead more: Cablevision Owner Altice USA Eyes Possible IPO (Report)",

      "text": "As people across the U.S. assess what Donald Trump's upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election means for them, Hollywood and Washington, D.C., woke up Wednesday thinking about the impact the new man in the White House will have on the biggest media deal in years: AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner.\nAT&T CFO John Stephens at a Wells Fargo investor conference on Wednesday was asked about just that, saying: \"From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with president-elect Trump and his transition team.\"\nHe said Trump's campaign talk about infrastructure investment, innovation and economic development \"all fit right in with AT&T's goals.\" And he said: \"We have been the leading investor in this country for more than five years running. And our Time Warner transaction is all about innovation, economic development, consumer choice and investment in infrastructure with regard to providing a great 5G mobile broadband experience. So we look forward with optimism to working with the leadership.\"\nAsked about the likelihood of getting regulatory approval for the deal, Stephens said: \"With regard to a vertical integration transaction like this, … the history is pretty clear. In our industry, there is nothing that we can find on record with the [Department of Justice] ever denying one of these mergers. And quite frankly there is good reason for that, because it brings consumer choice, it brings innovation and it will benefit consumers. So from that perspective, we are optimistic, we look forward to working through the process.\"\nAn AT&T spokesman and Time Warner didn't comment further.\nRead more: Which Hollywood Stars are Voting for Third-Party Candidates?\nIn a sign of Wall Street concern about the Trump win's impact on the deal, Time Warner shares in early Wednesday trading dropped more than those of peers. As of 10:30 a.m. ET, the stock was down 1.4 percent after earlier falling more than 2 percent. AT&T's stock was up 0.8 percent.\nAnalysts, meanwhile, also started discussing what a Trump presidency would mean for the FCC, DOJ, the Time Warner deal and other possible media M&A.\n\"It's about the FCC and the bully pulpit,\" said Steve Birenberg of Northlake Capital Management. \"Trump is good for cable and telco, because the FCC will shift dramatically. Net neutrality likely goes out the window.\"\nBut he also acknowledged: \"Trump's bully pulpit is, well, unpredictable. Given his relationship with media, it seems he would be less friendly as his initial comments on Time Warner-AT&T may suggest.\"\nMoody's Investors Service analyst Neil Begley, meanwhile, argued that the Trump presidency would mean \"less regulatory interference and a more laissez-faire environment.\" He said he had expected \"less rule creation from [a possible] Clinton FCC than the Obama FCC and [expects] far less under a Trump FCC.\"\nRead more: What AT&T Might Do to Convince Regulators to Bless the Time Warner Deal\nTrump recently said that he would not approve the AT&T and Time Warner combination if he wins the election. \"Deals like this destroy democracy,\" he said during a rally in Gettysburg, Pa., where he discussed what he would do in the first 100 days of his presidency.\nSpeaking about his battle with the \"dishonest mainstream media,\" he explained: \"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" Trump also said he would like to break up Comcast-NBCUniversal.\nThe Time Warner acquisition, which follows AT&T's takeover of satellite TV giant DirecTV, immediately became a political football for people across political party lines, with Trump and Bernie Sanders both urging regulators to reject the deal. Even middle-of-the-political spectrum reps, such as Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, voiced concern. The U.S. Senate's antitrust subcommittee has said it will hold hearings on the deal soon.\n\"I'm not surprised. They are uninformed comments,\" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said at a recent conference when asked about the remarks from Trump and Kaine. \"Anybody who characterizes this as a means to raise prices is ignoring the basic premise of what we're trying to do here.\"\nRead More As evidence, he announced that upcoming streaming service DirecTV Now would launch with a price of only $35 per month. \"That's not a medium for raising prices,\" Stephenson said.\nBut some observers said Trump's softer tone in his victory speech could well be the start of a change in rhetoric. \"It will be very interesting to see how all his campaign rhetoric plays at now that he will actually be president,\" MLM Partners analyst Eric Handler tells THR. \"I think there will be a lot of things where we will have to wait and see how Trump the president differs from Trump the candidate.\"\nEven if a Trump administration ultimately decides to reject AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, that doesn't necessarily spell the end of the nuptials. Although most companies abandon proposed mergers or settle upon government objection, there have been plenty of instances when corporations fight in federal court. For instance, medical technology provider Steris Corp. was able to complete an acquisition of U.K.'s Synergy Health PLC after a Ohio judge in September 2015 refused the Federal Trade Commission's injunction demand. Nevertheless, the government is often successful in getting its way in court as demonstrated by the D.C. federal judge who agreed to block the Staples-Office Depot merger in May.\nAT&T has some legal advantages, including possibly sidestepping the FCC. The merger is also a vertical integration between a distributor and supplier rather than a horizontal one between two competitors in the more classical sense. The latter typically gets a much tougher review by courts. Additionally, if a fight makes it that far, the ninth Supreme Court justice expected to be appointed by Trump is likely to be a business-friendly conservative. On the other hand, given all the political rhetoric, the atmosphere for mergers could become increasingly inhospitable, potentially impacting not just AT&T-Time Warner, but also discussions between CBS and Viacom on a discussed reunion.\nStephenson has acknowledged challenges, but said the deal should be approved. \"What this is, is a vertical merger in its purest sense,\" he said in announcing the takeover. \"Time Warner is a supplier to AT&T, and we are combining with a supplier. It is a classic vertical merger. And I think you are hard-pressed to find many instances in the United States where the only remedy for the government if they had concerns was to block them. They are typically always dealt with by remedies - concessions, if you will - and conditions imposed on a combination. That's what we anticipate happening here.\"\nMoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett tells THR that much will depend on who Trump picks as heads of the Department of Justice and FCC. \"Policy is people,\" he says. \"It's all about who gets appointed to the key positions at the FCC and DOJ.\"\nIf AT&T decides the fight is too heavy a lift, or if the merger is blocked by the government, the agreement between the two companies calls for a $500 million break-up fee by AT&T to Time Warner.\nRead more: AT&T CEO Calls Donald Trump and Tim Kaine \"Uninformed\" About Time Warner Merger",

Stephens didn't indicate any worries after the election.\n\"From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team,\" Stephens told an investor conference Wednesday.\nAT&T is bullish on Justice Department approval, Stephens said, because of the history of regulatory reviews involving a \"vertical integration\" of companies that don't directly compete against each other instead of a horizontal merger of rivals.\n\"In our industry, there is nothing that we can find on record of the DOJ ever denying one of these mergers,\" Stephens said. \"And quite frankly, there's good reason for that because it brings consumer choice, it brings innovation and it will benefit consumers. So from that perspective, we're optimistic.\"\nThe deal also would require approval from the Federal Communications Commission if the companies decide to include Time Warner's communications licenses in the deal. Time Warner has a broadcast TV station and several licenses to transmit video signals to satellites.\nStephens said the companies haven't determined yet if the deal would include the licenses.\nFCC approval had been viewed as difficult if Democrat Hillary Clinton had won the election and her party retained the majority on the commission.\nBut Trump will get to appoint a Republican to head the FCC after he takes office Jan. 20. Republicans generally have been much friendlier to industry mergers.\nAndrew Jay Schwartzman, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on media industry regulation, said Trump's victory means that AT&T and Time Warner would have less concern about an FCC review.\nBut until Trump makes appointments to the FCC and names a new attorney general, it's too early to tell if the deal will be approved, Schwartzman said.\n\"A Trump Department of Justice, which is going to have a more pro-business view, may have a hard time coming up with a rationale to block that deal that wouldn't undermine their broader philosophical goals,\" he said.\nAlthough the FCC can simply vote to stop a deal, the Justice Department must seek a court injunction to stop a merger. That requires a legal argument that can sway a judge or convince the companies to give up because they stand little chance of winning in court.\n\"This idea that (Trump) can unilaterally block it is false,\" said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center. \"The question is: Is he willing to go through the motions in kind of a game of chicken?\"\nTrump's tough talk on the deal might have been campaign rhetoric, or his view could be swayed by his attorney general and other advisors, Singer said.\nBased on the mainstream conservatives Trump has on his transition team, \"I think that he was not sincere\" in his opposition to the deal, Singer said.\nAlthough Trump is a billionaire real estate mogul who wants to cut business taxes, he ran a populist campaign and often railed against corporate power. He also charged that CNN and other media elites were trying to rig the election against him.\n\"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner, and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" he told an Oct. 22 campaign crowd, which responded with applause.\nHe went on to complain about Comcast Corp.'s 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal.\n\"Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that,\" Trump said. \"This should never ever have been approved in the first place.\"\n(c)2016 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\n ",

      "text": "WASHINGTON -- Republican Donald Trump ran a business-friendly presidential campaign, but he was anything but amiable toward AT&T Inc.'s proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner Inc. And his victory could spell big trouble for the deal.\nAs news of the mega-merger broke last month, Trump declared that it was \"a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nWith Trump poised to enter the White House in January, AT&T and Time Warner have a significant -- although not insurmountable -- hurdle to getting Washington's blessing unless he changes his position.\n\"Given Trump's campaign rhetoric and his distaste for Time Warner's CNN division throughout the campaign, the odds of regulatory approval appear to have dropped,\" Richard Greenfield, a media industry analyst with BTIG Research, wrote in the wake of the election.\nInvestors appeared to agree, given that regulatory approval already was a concern before the election.\nAT&T shares dropped 2.3 percent on Thursday to $35.57. Time Warner stock was down 0.3 percent to $86.33.\nThe deal would transform telecommunications giant AT&T, which bought DirecTV last year, into the nation's largest entertainment company. Time Warner would bring a stable of premium content, including HBO, CNN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros. TV and film studio.\nDespite Trump's vow to block the deal, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer John J.

Giovanni Bruno Nov11,20169:38AMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) --Last month AT&T ( T ) announced its intention to acquire Time Warner (TWX) for the price of $85.4 billion. The deal is pending as regulators still need to give it the go ahead. GAMCO Investment CEO Mario Gabelli gives it a 70% chance of being approved. \n\"With [Tom] Wheeler (exiting chairman of the FCC ) gone I don't think the FCC will look into this one, or they'll spinoff the TV stations or some ground stations. I think I've gone from 40% probability to 70%,\" Gabelli said on CNBC 's \"Squawk Box\" this morning. \n\"The free market system should allow CEOs to go in and make their bets,\" he continued. \nHe noted the support AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has received from his board of directors, and thinks regardless whether or not the deal is ultimately approved the company will be \"fine.\" \n\"From my point of view, I have no problem in making that bet,\" Gabelli stated. \n(AT&T is a holding in David Peltier's Dividend Stock Advisor portfolio.)

      "text": "(Drew Angerer/Bloomberg) Despite his campaign vows to block the deal, President-elect Donald Trump could be forced to take a friendlier stance on AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner than he initially laid out, analysts say — potentially disappointing supporters who were hoping for a big showdown with the company.\nRegulators at the Justice Department are likely to examine the proposed deal closely no matter what happens. But a constellation of factors, from the makeup of Trump's transition team to the mundane details of antitrust law, may make it difficult for Trump to oppose the tie-up once he is in office. As a result, one of the earliest decisions to occur on Trump's watch may be the regulators' approval of the massive acquisition.\nTrump blasted the merger at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last month. \"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting,\" he said, \"AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\n[ How Donald Trump could dismantle net neutrality and the rest of Obama’s Internet legacy ]\nTrump's critique of media consolidation is stoked by fears that the trend may suppress conservative voices. Trump has clashed repeatedly with CNN over its coverage of him, at one point calling the channel \"an arm of the Clinton campaign.\" He derided a CNN documentary about himself as a \"total waste of time\" and \"a joke.\" But by highlighting CNN — which is owned by Time Warner — as a reason to oppose the AT&T deal, Trump risks revealing a personal grudge against CNN's coverage that will not help his administration make an antitrust case, economists say.\n\"Personal vendettas can't be the basis that you take a case to court,\" said Hal Singer, an economist and senior fellow at the George Washington Institute for Public Policy.\nTrump has targeted other media companies, as well. On the campaign trail, Trump accused Comcast-NBCUniversal of \"trying to poison the mind of the American voter,\" adding that he believes the two companies should never have been allowed to combine. He has also said that Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and owner of The Washington Post, faces \"a huge antitrust problem,\" complaining of The Post's critical coverage and accusing Bezos of using the newspaper to benefit Amazon politically in Washington.\n[ AT&T and DirecTV colluded in an illegal plot that kept Dodgers games off the air, DOJ lawsuit alleges ]\nAntitrust experts say these objections do not constitute a compelling antitrust case. In order to challenge AT&T-Time Warner, regulators would need to demonstrate that the transaction poses significant harms to the economy and to competition.\nBut Trump advisers charged with handling tech policy may not view the AT&T deal in a negative light — highlighting tensions to come between an outsider candidate and the countless insiders who would likely staff the majority of Trump's administration.\n\"A lot of these jobs are going to go to establishment Republican types who, ironically, are probably going to just be a continuation of everything he's railed against,\" said one tech industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely.\n[ Everything you need to know about AT&T’s deal with Time Warner ]\nOne of Trump's earliest hires on tech, Jeffrey Eisenach , is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, an elite Republican think tank in Washington. Eisenach's role on Trump's transition team gives him notable sway over the future of the administration's tech policies. The economic researcher's previous clients include the country's largest wireless carrier, Verizon, among others.\nAnalysts say he has spoken approvingly of big mergers in the past. Eisenach \"has been supportive of all the deals in the last few years, including the AT&T/[T-Mobile] and Comcast/Time Warner Cable deals,\" according to a recent investor note from the analyst firm New Street Research.\nThat could suggest Eisenach takes a similar view of the AT&T deal, though Eisenach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\"Either there's going to be mass tension within his team, or he's going to sit back and let the [establishment conservatives] have their way — in which case, all of his campaign rhetoric on blowing up Comcast and AT&T was just cheap talk,\" said Singer.\nAnalysts say AT&T was likely caught off-guard by Trump's victory. \"They made a calculated bet with the Hillary administration — this is not what they expected,\" said Frank Louthan, an industry analyst at Raymond James. \"They may still prevail, but that was a shock.\"\nAT&T has said it stands ready to work with the incoming Trump administration and that their priorities appear aligned. \"We really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team,\" AT&T chief financial officer John Stephens said at an investor conference Wednesday. \"His policies and his discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T's goals.\"",

      "text": "\n* An AT&T-Time Warner merger may trigger more deals-exec \n* Altice third-quarter results beat estimates \n* Group focused on integration of U.S. businesses (Recasts story, adds executive quotes, details) \nBy Mathieu Rosemain and Gwénaëlle Barzic \nPARIS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Altice, the fourth-biggest cable operator in the United States, sees more deals between media and telecoms operators in the country if AT&T Inc's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc eventually goes through under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. \nTrump said in October that AT&T's proposed acquisition of the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros film studio would put too much power in the hands of one company, and he would block a deal, raising doubts among investors about potential deals in the sector. \nThe failure of such a mega-deal would challenge the strategy of Altice's owner, billionaire Patrick Drahi, who is also betting on the convergence between content providers and telecommunications operators. \n\"There was a lot said during the campaign which people don't necessarily expect to occur during the administration,\" said Dexter Goei, Altice USA chief, on Thursday. \n\"I do think that to the extent that the AT&T - Time Warner transaction gets approved, it may trigger more consolidation over the next few years here as people start to continue to look to position themselves on the convergence.\" \nCable entrepreneur Drahi made his fortune through debt-fuelled acquisitions that are swiftly followed by cost cutting to boost profits. \nHe recently entered the United States market via the takeovers of regional player Suddenlink and New-York-based Cablevision. \nAltice reported on Thursday a better-than-expected core operating profit for the three months ended Sept. 30, driven by the strong performance of recently-acquired U.S. businesses. \nIts third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose by 8.3 percent from a year ago on a comparable basis to 2.33 billion euros ($2.53 billion). \nThis beat analysts' average forecast of 2.27 billion euros in a Reuters poll. \nThird-quarter group revenue was flat at 5.89 billion euros. \nThe group's U.S. businesses, put together under business unit Altice USA, saw their core operating profit jump by more than 20 percent in the quarter. \nAltice USA is drawing up plans for a potential initial public offering to expand Drahi's U.S. cable empire, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. \nThe group is focused on its U.S. operations and does not plan any big acquisition for now, Goei said. \nAltice's French telecoms business, SFR Group, continued to lose customers and revenue in the third quarter but posted an increase of 0.6 percent of its core operating profit to 1.04 billion euros. \n($1 = 0.9197 euros) (Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Mark Potter) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "title": "What Donald Trump as President Could Mean for AT&T-Time Warner",
      "text": "As people across the U.S. assess what Donald Trump's upset victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election means for them, Hollywood and Washington, D.C., woke up Wednesday thinking about the impact the new man in the White House will have on the biggest media deal in years: AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner.\nAT&T CFO John Stephens at a Wells Fargo investor conference on Wednesday was asked about just that, saying: \"From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with president-elect Trump and his transition team.\"\nHe said Trump's campaign talk about infrastructure investment, innovation and economic development \"all fit right in with AT&T's goals.\" And he said: \"We have been the leading investor in this country for more than five years running. And our Time Warner transaction is all about innovation, economic development, consumer choice and investment in infrastructure with regard to providing a great 5G mobile broadband experience. So we look forward with optimism to working with the leadership.\"\nAsked about the likelihood of getting regulatory approval for the deal, Stephens said: \"With regard to a vertical integration transaction like this … the history is pretty clear. In our industry, there is nothing that we can find on record with the [Department of Justice] ever denying one of these mergers. And quite frankly there is good reason for that, because it brings consumer choice, it brings innovation and it will benefit consumers. So from that perspective, we are optimistic, we look forward to working through the process.\"\nAn AT&T spokesman and Time Warner didn't comment further.\nRead more: Which Hollywood Stars are Voting for Third-Party Candidates?\nIn a sign of Wall Street concern about the Trump win's impact on the deal, Time Warner shares in early Wednesday trading dropped more than those of its peers. As of 10:30 a.m. ET, the stock was down 1.4 percent after earlier falling more than 2 percent. AT&T's stock was up 0.8 percent.\nAnalysts, meanwhile, also started discussing what a Trump presidency would mean for the FCC, DOJ, the Time Warner deal and other possible media M&A.\n\"It's about the FCC and the bully pulpit,\" said Steve Birenberg of Northlake Capital Management. \"Trump is good for cable and telco, because the FCC will shift dramatically. Net neutrality likely goes out the window.\"\nBut he also acknowledged: \"Trump's bully pulpit is, well, unpredictable. Given his relationship with media, it seems he would be less friendly as his initial comments on Time Warner-AT&T may suggest.\"\nMoody's Investors Service analyst Neil Begley, meanwhile, argued that the Trump presidency would mean \"less regulatory interference and a more laissez-faire environment.\" He said he had expected \"less rule creation from [a possible] Clinton FCC than the Obama FCC and [expects] far less under a Trump FCC.\"\nRead more: What AT&T Might Do to Convince Regulators to Bless the Time Warner Deal\nTrump recently said that he would not approve the AT&T and Time Warner combination if he wins the election. \"Deals like this destroy democracy,\" he said during a rally in Gettysburg, Pa., where he discussed what he would do in the first 100 days of his presidency.\nSpeaking about his battle with the \"dishonest mainstream media,\" Trump explained: \"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" He also said he would like to break up Comcast-NBCUniversal.\nThe Time Warner acquisition, which follows AT&T's takeover of satellite TV giant DirecTV, immediately became a political football for people across political party lines, with Trump and Bernie Sanders both urging regulators to reject the deal. Even middle-of-the-political spectrum reps, such as Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, voiced concern. The U.S. Senate's antitrust subcommittee has said it will hold hearings on the deal soon.\n\"I'm not surprised. They are uninformed comments,\" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said at a recent conference when asked about the remarks from Trump and Kaine. \"Anybody who characterizes this as a means to raise prices is ignoring the basic premise of what we're trying to do here.\"\nRead More As evidence, he announced that upcoming streaming service DirecTV Now would launch with a price of only $35 per month. \"That's not a medium for raising prices,\" Stephenson said.\nBut some observers said Trump's softer tone in his victory speech could well be the start of a change in rhetoric. \"It will be very interesting to see how all his campaign rhetoric plays at now that he will actually be president,\" MLM Partners analyst Eric Handler tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"I think there will be a lot of things where we will have to wait and see how Trump the president differs from Trump the candidate.\"\nEven if a Trump administration ultimately decides to reject AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, that doesn't necessarily spell the end of the nuptials. Although most companies abandon proposed mergers or settle upon government objection, there have been plenty of instances when corporations fight in federal court. For instance, medical technology provider Steris Corp. was able to complete an acquisition of U.K.'s Synergy Health PLC after a Ohio judge in September 2015 refused the Federal Trade Commission's injunction demand. Nevertheless, the government is often successful in getting its way in court as demonstrated by the D.C. federal judge who agreed to block the Staples-Office Depot merger in May.\nAT&T has some legal advantages, including possibly sidestepping the FCC. The merger is also a vertical integration between a distributor and supplier rather than a horizontal one between two competitors in the more classical sense. The latter typically gets a much tougher review by courts. Additionally, if a fight makes it that far, the ninth Supreme Court justice expected to be appointed by Trump is likely to be a business-friendly conservative. On the other hand, given all the political rhetoric, the atmosphere for mergers could become increasingly inhospitable, potentially impacting not just AT&T-Time Warner, but also discussions between CBS and Viacom on a reunion.\nStephenson has acknowledged challenges, but said the deal should be approved. \"What this is, is a vertical merger in its purest sense,\" he said in announcing the takeover. \"Time Warner is a supplier to AT&T, and we are combining with a supplier. It is a classic vertical merger. And I think you are hard-pressed to find many instances in the United States where the only remedy for the government if they had concerns was to block them. They are typically always dealt with by remedies - concessions, if you will - and conditions imposed on a combination. That's what we anticipate happening here.\"\nMoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett tells THR that much will depend on who Trump picks as heads of the Department of Justice and FCC. \"Policy is people,\" he says. \"It's all about who gets appointed to the key positions at the FCC and DOJ.\"\nIf AT&T decides the fight is too heavy a lift, or if the merger is blocked by the government, the agreement between the two companies calls for a $500 million break-up fee by AT&T to Time Warner.\nRead more: AT&T CEO Calls Donald Trump and Tim Kaine \"Uninformed\" About Time Warner Merger",

      "text": "TV: SEC Network Alternate (Time Warner Cable/Spectrum Channel 385) \nRadio: 107.5 FM Three Story Lines \n1. Going bowling: It’s pretty simple. If South Carolina wins, it’s heading to the postseason for the 10th time in 12 years. Considering how young the Gamecocks are and the state of their roster, that would be a big step in the first year of the Will Muschamp era. \n2. Bad memories: The lowest point of last year’s 3-9 season came this week in the pre-Clemson FCS tuneup. That game saw The Citadel embarrass the Gamecocks defense with an option attack and wall up USC’s running game. Western Carolina is a different challenge, but those memories still loom. \n3. Strength vs. Strength: The Gamecocks have been led by a decent defense with the offense coming along with infusions of youth. Western Carolina is simply a bad defensive team, even for the FCS level, but the offense has pretty decent pop. Three Players to Watch \n1. Quarterback Tyrie Adams is a high-usage trigger man at the heart of the Catamount attack. He’s thrown for 2,437 yards, 15 scores and nine interceptions on 32-plus attempts a game, while carrying the ball 110 times for 265 yards (451 discounting sacks). \n2. Running back Detrez Newsome is a workhorse back who provides a lot each time he gets the ball. His 135 carries are 100 more than any other runner beside Adams and have produced 916 yards (6.8 per carry) and nine scores. He’s also the team’s No. 3 reviver with 30 catches and 332 yards. \n3. Wide receiver Terryon Robinson isn’t a big guy (5-foot-11, 190 pounds), but he carries the load with 70 catches, 25 more than anyone else, and 729 yards. He’s complemented by 6-foot-4 Spearman Robinson, a Greenwood, S.C., product. Scouting report \n▪ The Catamounts rely heavily on a three-receiver, one-tight end group, often moving the tight end around as a receiver or fullback. \n▪ Although the run-pass balance has been even, the offense still leads with a running game built on a wide array of concepts, especially counter. The passing game doesn’t involve many straight dropbacks, relying much more heavily on run-pass option plays. \n▪ At times, the Catamounts can play extremely fast, but they still only average 65.9 plays a game, a relatively low total. \n▪ Western’s defense has a listed 4-3 base, but it doesn’t play that way. The front is far more amorphous, playing three-down and occasionally two-down looks. \n▪ WCU has OK, but not great, size on defense, yet they aren’t very good tacklers. \n▪ The Catamounts also struggle to generate big plays, with just nine sacks, six interceptions and six forced fumbles.

      "text": "Getty/Alex Wong \nAT&T wants to buy Time Warner in a monster $85 billion deal, but some are concerned the government, particularly under Donald Trump, will move to block it.\n“In an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said while campaigning. \nAT&T, however, is telling Wall Street not to worry.\nAt RBC's recent Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications (TIMT) Conference in New York, AT&T management suggested  there wouldn't be any trouble with the merger. \nThe FCC question One big reason AT&T is smiling is because the company believes the merger won't be under the jurisdiction of the FCC. \n\"The only scenario in which the FCC would have jurisdiction is if Time Warner transfers certain broadcast licenses to AT&T,\" RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who viewed the presentation by AT&T's Chris Womack and Michael Black, wrote. \"The company believes these licenses (primarily business radio licenses and licenses related to Time Warner’s ownership of the WPCN superstation) can be offloaded easily, obviating the need for an FCC review.\" \nThat would mean the merger would only need to clear the Department of Justice, which AT&T is optimistic about. \n\"The major difference between an FCC and DOJ review is that a DOJ review provides AT&T legal recourse while the FCC, if it chooses not to support the deal can defer the issue to an administrative law judge, a process that can last upwards of three years, usually resulting in the dissolution of the deal,\" Atkin wrote.\nAT&T likes its odds, and expects the timeline on the merger to be 12-14 months.\nWhy Time Warner? In the presentation, AT&T also outlined some of the rationale for the Time Warner deal. \nHere's the most interesting bit: \"AT&T hopes to strengthen its quad-play offering by zero-rating Time Warner content, which the company believes will provide consumers an incentive to adopt the AT&T bundle,\" Atkin wrote.  \n\"Zero-rating\" is when wireless carriers don't count data used with certain streaming services against your data cap. So for AT&T-Time Warner, it could mean that you never have to pay for data to watch HBO. You won't have to worry about data overages when you're watching \"Game of Thrones.\" \nThis sounds great for the customer on the surface, but the FCC has said it has \" serious concerns \" about the way AT&T is using zero-rating, particularly with regards to its upcoming DirecTV Now streaming TV service. \nWhy? \nAT&T has said it will treat its rivals (and friends) equally when it comes to zero-rating. That likely means that every company, from Netflix to Showtime, will have to pay a certain fee to have their video zero-rated. No freebies for HBO.  But since AT&T would own HBO, that \"fee\" money would just be shifting from one pocket of AT&T to another. That's a place AT&T could potentially act anti-competitively. \nAT&T provided a few other reasons for the Time Warner merger, as well. Here they are: \nAT&T thinks it could help reduce churn (cancellations) in its wireless business. It could help AT&T maintain control of content distribution in the face of potential rivals like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as video shifts toward over-the-top (OTT) delivery. AT&T thinks it can boost ad revenue. \" In internal trials, the company has successfully increased sales of certain products by as much as 80% through targeted advertising,\" Atkin wrote.

      "text": "Surveillance \nBy now you’ve probably heard that AT&T bid $85 billion dollars to acquire Time Warner in the United States, in a merger that joins a service provider (distribution network) and content company. As company that advocates for privacy, the merger causes concern. Here’s why: \nAT&T gets more data…and more opportunity to misuse it \nThe merger raises some large privacy concerns. By expanding their already massive customer base to also include Time Warner’s customers, AT&T will have access to a huge amount of consumer data. With the availability of content across devices like smartphones and tablets, this data will include revealing details including content watched, duration of viewing and even location watched from. This, as AT&T has openly admitted, will allow them to better target their users – all at the expense of consumer privacy. As a representative at CDT described, what they’ll be able to do is in effect “commercial surveillance.” \nIt exposes more people to AT&T’s surveillance practices \nAT&T is not a friend of privacy. They’ve repeatedly conducted mass surveillance on citizens, with no transparency into their sweeping programs. AT&T first allowed the government to surveil citizens by tapping into their network in the now-infamous Room 641a in San Francisco – an incident which was actually the impetus for Golden Frog’s founding . Last year, it was revealed that AT&T had been helping the NSA spy on users for over 10 years, engaging in a willing partnership to conduct warrantless surveillance over their network. Then, just before the merger was announced this month, it was revealed that AT&T actually built their own surveillance network – an initiative called Project Hemisphere – that secretly searches “trillions of call records and analyzes cellular data to determine where a target is located, with whom he speaks, and potentially why.” This product was created by AT&T, does not ask law enforcement for a warrant to access data and is used for profit. \nConclusion \nAT&T is a giant company, whose record does not demonstrate respect for consumer privacy. It only seems logical they’ll continue and increase privacy violations if a large-scale merger takes place. AT&T has a huge consumer base, ownership of over 3/4 of landline switches in the United States and a record of retaining metadata substantially longer than their competitors. Despite all the consumer “benefits” being advertised in association with the merger, it can only result in a further loss of privacy for consumers, and an increase in surveillance.

      "text": "print Getty/Alex Wong \nAT&T wants to buy Time Warner in a monster $85 billion deal, but some are concerned the government, particularly under Donald Trump, will move to block it. \n“In an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said while campaigning. \nAT&T, however, is telling Wall Street not to worry. \nAt RBC's recent Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications (TIMT) Conference in New York, AT&T management suggested there wouldn't be any trouble with the merger. The FCC question \nOne big reason AT&T is smiling is because the company believes the merger won't be under the jurisdiction of the FCC. \n\"The only scenario in which the FCC would have jurisdiction is if Time Warner transfers certain broadcast licenses to AT&T,\" RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who viewed the presentation by AT&T's Chris Womack and Michael Black, wrote. \"The company believes these licenses (primarily business radio licenses and licenses related to Time Warner’s ownership of the WPCN superstation) can be offloaded easily, obviating the need for an FCC review.\" \nThat would mean the merger would only need to clear the Department of Justice, which AT&T is optimistic about. \n\"The major difference between an FCC and DOJ review is that a DOJ review provides AT&T legal recourse while the FCC, if it chooses not to support the deal can defer the issue to an administrative law judge, a process that can last upwards of three years, usually resulting in the dissolution of the deal,\" Atkin wrote. \nAT&T likes its odds, and expects the timeline on the merger to be 12-14 months. Why Time Warner? \nIn the presentation, AT&T also outlined some of the rationale for the Time Warner deal. \nHere's the most interesting bit: \"AT&T hopes to strengthen its quad-play offering by zero-rating Time Warner content, which the company believes will provide consumers an incentive to adopt the AT&T bundle,\" Atkin wrote. \n\"Zero-rating\" is when wireless carriers don't count data used with certain streaming services against your data cap. So for AT&T-Time Warner, it could mean that you never have to pay for data to watch HBO. You won't have to worry about data overages when you're watching \"Game of Thrones.\" \nThis sounds great for the customer on the surface, but the FCC has said it has \" serious concerns \" about the way AT&T is using zero-rating, particularly with regards to its upcoming DirecTV Now streaming TV service. \nWhy? \nAT&T has said it will treat its rivals (and friends) equally when it comes to zero-rating. That likely means that every company, from Netflix to Showtime, will have to pay a certain fee to have their video zero-rated. No freebies for HBO. But since AT&T would own HBO, that \"fee\" money would just be shifting from one pocket of AT&T to another. That's a place AT&T could potentially act anti-competitively. \nThat said, there have been some indications that a Trump administration might be very friendly to zero-rating, so AT&T might have a clearer path moving forward. \nAt the conference, AT&T provided a few other reasons for the Time Warner merger, as well. Here they are: AT&T thinks it could help reduce churn (cancellations) in its wireless business. It could help AT&T maintain control of content distribution in the face of potential rivals like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as video shifts toward over-the-top (OTT) delivery. AT&T thinks it can boost ad revenue. \" In internal trials, the company has successfully increased sales of certain products by as much as 80% through targeted advertising,\" Atkin wrote.",

      "title": "Altice USA CEO Talks Election, AT&T-Time Warner as Former Cablevision Markets Lose Fewer TV Subs",
      "text": "Altice, the European cable and telecom giant that recently acquired Cablevision Systems in a $17.7 billion deal, reported on Thursday that Cablevision lost fewer pay TV subscribers in the third quarter than in the year-ago period.\nAltice USA CEO Dexter Goei on the earnings conference call was asked about AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, saying it follows the trend of full convergence. When big deals like that happen, the industry tends to \"start focusing on figuring out where all the different pieces end up,\" he added. \"We obviously are going to pay attention. We are very focused on the operational side still here in the U.S., but we will pay attention to if there is any opportunity for us to do anything in the next couple of years.\"\nAltice management previously said it expects to mostly keep its head down this year after buying Cablevision and Suddenlink, with Goei calling it \"a year of integration and operation.\" But analysts have suggested 2017 could see Altice USA look for more acquisitions in the cable sector.\nAsked what the presidential election outcome would mean for the industry, Goei said it was \"too early,\" because there has been no indication of President-elect Donald Trump's policies. But he said that the stock market seems to have reacted \"nicely, particularly in our sector.\"\nRead more: Europe's Altice Closes Cablevision Acquisition, Expanding U.S. Presence\nCiting the future Republican-dominated Congress, Goei argued that \"on balance … for cable operators, it is probably flat to positive.\"\nAsked about upcoming new streaming services from DirecTV, namely DirecTV Now, and Hulu, Goei said: \"This is one of the reasons why we are so focused on delivering our [new] Home Hub Center\" as quickly as possible. A great user interface and an overall better service experience is key, he explained. \"If we continue to focus on ... a superior customer experience,\" the company will continue to do \"fine,\" he said.\nGoei also discussed continuing increases in programming costs for pay TV operators in the U.S., saying they were \"under siege by content providers\" that are asking for increasing carriage fees. He said \"we do not pass on that entire amount ... on average 10 percent,\" but has passed on 3.4 percent, while \"we continue to bear the burden of the remainder of that.\"\nAsked about possible further acquisitions and their benefit, he said that, yes, \"you typically do benefit from increased scale,\" but added that \"some of it is just dumb luck.\" He also said that the company had no acquisitions on its radar right now.\nCablevision, now called Optimum, ended September with around 2.55 million pay TV subscribers after losing 28,000 in the third quarter, down from a year-ago drop of 33,000. Quarterly revenue grew 2.2 percent, or 2.7 percent on a constant currency basis. Adjusted quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 33.1 percent on that basis.\nSmall U.S. cable operator Suddenlink, in which Altice acquired a 70 percent stake in a $9.1 billion deal late last year, lost 12,000 video subscribers in the latest quarter, compared with a loss of 9,000 subs in the year-ago period, to end September with 1.05 million.\nSuddenlink revenue grew 6.2 percent, or 6.7 percent on a constant currency basis, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization jumped 20.8 percent on that basis.\nAltice, founded by billionaire Patrick Drahi, lauded the performance of its U.S. business as \"better-than-expected\" and said it was building a \"best-in-class U.S. cable system to sustain growth.\"\nThe company on Thursday also reported an 8.3 percent gain in its quarterly adjusting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to 2.33 billion euros ($2.54 billion) helped by the U.S. assets. Third-quarter revenue stayed unchanged at 5.89 billion euros ($6.41 billion), with U.S. revenue up, while French revenue declined 2.4 percent.\nSaid Altice CEO Michel Combes: \"Altice USA with Optimum and Suddenlink has seen a further acceleration in revenue growth while simultaneously improving margins materially, driven by accelerated investments in upgrading our networks and services.\"\nRead more: Cablevision Owner Altice USA Eyes Possible IPO (Report)",

Judy Chu, D, Calif., speaks during day two of the Democratic National Convention at Time Warner Cable Arena on September 5, 2012 in Charlotte. (Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \nWith President-elect Donald Trump vowing to deport thousands of people in the country illegally, Rep. Judy Chu on Tuesday urged the Obama administration to protect the names of “Dreamers,” people brought to the country illegally as children who applied for temporary status in the United States. \nTrump is expected to unwind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created by President Obama that gave temporary legal status to Dreamers. \nOf the 742,000 people across the country protected under DACA, about one in three are estimated to live in California and state officials are already gearing up for a fight over immigration with the Trump administration. \n“These children and families provided extensive amounts of sensitive information to their government, including fingerprints and relatives’ home addresses, with the understanding that it would not be used against them. We promised them security,” Chu said in a statement. “Now they are facing a nightmare. When we asked immigrants to come out of the shadows, we never imagined the election of a candidate who ran on a policy of mass deportation.” \nClick here to read the full story on LATimes.com. 36.778261 -119.417932 ",

      "title": "Liberty Media CEO Says Trump Likely \"Positive\" for Cable Regulation, Sees Time Warner Deal Approval",
      "text": "The regulatory environment for cable operators will likely be more favorable under president-elect Donald Trump's administration, Liberty Media president and CEO Greg Maffei said Wednesday.\n\"It's hard to see how the regulatory environment will get worse under president-elect Trump than it was under the Obama administration and the FCC to date,\" he said at the Morgan Stanley European Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in Barcelona in a session that was webcast. \"We were constricted around net neutrality, we were constricted around usage-based pricing. It's hard to imagine that theirs is going to be quite as onerous in a go-forward world. So I think there is upside.\"\nHe added that the stock of Charter Communications, in which Liberty owns a big stake, traded up \"nicely\" on the news. And Maffei said: \"The tech companies have had an enormous influence on the FCC and on...what they perceived were positive changes, but in the main were not positive for cable.\"\nHe concluded: \"So I think there is likely to be a swing back the other way, and that's probably a positive on the regulatory front.\"\nLiberty Media chairman John Malone had told investors last week: \"The deregulatory aspects of a Republican administration will be favorable. I think the likelihood you will see government intervening to support one particular industry's goals, relative to another's, is probably less risky today.\"\nDiscussing AT&T's planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which Trump has spoken out against, Maffei said: \"I assume the AT&T Time Warner deal gets done. I think president-elect Trump has shown he is a great negotiator, likes to make those statements.\" He predicted there would likely be a series of conditions put on the deal though.\nRead more: Liberty's John Malone Talks Netflix, Donald Trump, Likens Sports to Cocaine\nAsked about the broader impact of the mega-deal, Maffei also said, \"I am less fearful in some ways than John [Malone] is,\" adding, \"I don't suspect it's going to lead to as much of a round of M&A as John does.\"\nAsked about the outlook for additional major cable M&A, including for Charter, Maffei said: \"There's not that much left out there to buy.\" The only company with real scale is Cox Communications, with roughly 4 million subscribers, whose owners seem to remain \"very happy being independent.\" He concluded: \"There's just not enough cable left to buy.\"\nMaffei on Wednesday also touted Liberty's planned acquisition of Formula One and the upside for Liberty's music-related businesses. With its stakes in SiriusXM and Live Nation, the company is \"positioned to benefit from growth of global music,\" he said.\nLiberty in September agreed to acquire global motor sports business Formula One in a deal that values it at $4.4 billion and will occur in stages, with an initial purchase of $746 million for an 18.7 percent minority stake. The enterprise value for the racing circuit per the deal is $8 billion. Maffei touted upside from the likes of better TV rights deals and a planned OTT service for Formula One fans, as well as an increase in the number of races.\nFormer 21st Century Fox president and COO Chase Carey will become chairman of F1, replacing Nestle chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe. The 85-year-old Bernie Ecclestone will remain CEO.\nRead more: John Malone's Liberty to Acquire Formula One, Chase Carey to Become Chairman",

Results And Guidance \nNetApp reported Q2 revenue at $1.34 billion, versus Goldman Sachs’ estimate of $1.38 billion and the Street’s $1.35 billion.

      "text": "Microsoft, Time Warner, NetApp Upgraded; Cisco PT Sliced (Investor's Business Daily) \nNetApp Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP ) reported Q2 results and Q3 guidance ahead of expectations on the back of “yet another round of cost cuts and restructuring measures.” \nBarclays’ Mark Moskowitz maintained an Underweight rating on NetApp, while raising the price target from $25 to $27. \nNetApp’s shares recorded strong gains, which was surprising, although the company’s strategic revenue growth slowed significantly and storage system revenue declined nearly 13 percent “after almost flattening last quarter,” Moskowitz commented. Strategic Revenue Growth \nWhile NetApp’s successful turnaround is based on “consistent, strong growth from strategic revenue” and a slowdown in legacy revenue declines, neither occurred during the quarter, Moskowitz pointed out. Strategic revenue came in at $439 million, representing merely 1 percent year-over-year growth. “Even when considering relative comps, trends seem concerning.” \nThe decline in legacy revenue accelerated to -29 percent year-over-year from -24 year-over-year in the prior quarter. Storage System Revenue \nStorage system revenue fell back “into old habits,” the analyst mentioned. The reported figure of $1.34 billion was significantly short of Barclays’ estimate of $1.39 billion and the Street’s $1.36 billion. Storage system revenue declined by 12.9 percent year-over-year, “a dramatic shift after storage system revenue almost flattened in Jul-Q (i.e., declining 0.6% Y/Y).” \n“We understand that both of these declines were impacted by difficult, but in our view, manageable comps,” Moskowitz added.

      "text": "November 16, 2016 1:02 PM Frontier rolls out Vantage TV to compete with Time Warner, AT&T, Google \nBy John Murawski Order Reprint of this Story \nFrontier Communications said Wednesday it’s introducing Vantage TV, a high-speed internet and phone service that will further expand competitive choices in the Triangle. \nThe service, which Frontier expects to expand over time, will provide Triangle residents with broadband options beyond current providers: Time Warner Cable, AT&T’s U-verse and Google Fiber. TWC is the area’s dominant provider but AT&T is continually expanding its U-verse service in the Triangle, where it’s offered in 10 municipalities. Google Fiber is available in parts of Morrisville and is planned for Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Cary, Carrboro and Garner. \nVantage TV is being selectively introduced to nearly 75,000 households, representing about a third of Frontier’s North Carolina service area that covers 275,000 households in 16 counties. The company said it has about 130,000 customers in the state now subscribing to one or more of its services, which includes Dish satellite TV service, as well as Vantage TV, which has been tested in Durham since February as a pilot project. \nVantage TV is being offered primarily in Durham but also in pockets of Raleigh, Creedmoor, Wake Forest, Franklinton, Rougemont, Bahama and other municipalities. \nVantage TV is also offered in parts of South Carolina, Minnesota and Connecticut, home to Frontier’s corporate headquarters. \n“We will add Vantage availability wherever it is possible and dependent on how the market responds to this intial offering,” Frontier said in a statement. “It is also dependent on broadband capacity in the network.” \nFrontier’s service includes more than 400 TV channels, video on demand, and viewing on up to eight TV screens, as well as bundled services. Frontier’s voice over internet protocol, or VOIP, phone service is also called Vantage, as is the broadband internet service. Previously those services were branded as Frontier. \nFrontier entered the North Carolina telecom market in 2010 as part of an asset purchase from Verizon in 13 states. ",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nEditor’s Note : And AT&T just bought out Time Warner and Time Warner’s name just got changed to “Spectrum”… Essentially, the NSA is in everyone’s home at this point.\nby Justin Gardner\nFor many New Yorkers, 33 Thomas Street — known as the “Long Lines Building” — has been a source of mystery for years. It has been labeled one of the city’s weirdest and most iconic skyscrapers, but little information has ever been published about its purpose. (Image: Screenshot/The Intercept/Project X)\nA menacing gray skyscraper, known as the Long Lines Building to New Yorkers, assumed to be nothing more than an AT&T hub, is one of the most important surveillance facilities of the National Security Agency (NSA).\nAn investigation by The Intercept found that the “Project X” building – constructed to withstand an atomic blast and house and feed 1,500 people for two weeks – is host to the NSA as it works with AT&T conducting mass surveillance.\n“Documents obtained by The Intercept from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden do not explicitly name 33 Thomas Street as a surveillance facility. However — taken together with architectural plans, public records, and interviews with former AT&T employees conducted for this article — they provide compelling evidence that 33 Thomas Street has served as an NSA surveillance site, code-named TITANPOINTE.\nInside 33 Thomas Street there is a major international “gateway switch,” according to a former AT&T engineer, which routes phone calls between the United States and countries across the world. A series of top-secret NSA memos suggest that the agency has tapped into these calls from a secure facility within the AT&T building. The Manhattan skyscraper appears to be a core location used for a controversial NSA surveillance program that has targeted the communications of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and at least 38 countries, including close U.S. allies such as Germany, Japan, and France.”\nThe skyscraper, which is a looming dark shadow unlit at night, was designed by John Carl Warnecke, a prominent architect in government circles, including the U.S. Navy and embassy complexes.\nWarnecke’s Project X was borne of a secret program code-named BLARNEY that began in the 1970s, where NSA began developing “commercial partnerships” for spying activities, according to a newly published Snowden document.\nIt was likely used to target anti-Vietnam War activists and a host of “domestic terrorist and foreign radical” suspects such as Martin Luther King and certain American journalists. A Congressional inquiry in 1975 found the NSA invaded privacy and violated Constitutional rights, which resulted in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act meant to rein in the agency’s abuses.\nBLARNEY remained a critical part of NSA’s electronic intercept capabilities at least into 2013, when Snowden revealed the program.\n“BLARNEY leverages ‘commercial partnerships’ in order to ‘gain access and exploit foreign intelligence obtained from global networks,’ the document states. It carries out full take surveillance — a term that refers to the bulk collection of both content and metadata — under six different categories: counterproliferation, counterterrorism, diplomatic, economic, military, and political.”\nTITANPOINTE is one of three “core sites” of the BLARNEY program. There it links to AT&T routers and operates powerful satellite antennae on the roof, which vacuum up internet data passing through foreign satellites in another secret programs known as SKIDROWE.\nIt is unclear whether NSA can directly tap in to AT&T’s communications at will, but the telecom giant has long been a willing partner to the surveillance state. As early as 1976, AT&T was shielded from scrutiny by President Ford, who called the company “an agent of the United States acting under contract with the Executive Branch.”\nThe NSA talked of AT&T’s “extreme willingness to help” in collecting billions of emails, at a time when revelations of domestic surveillance and warrantless wiretapping gripped the nation.\n“This is yet more proof that our communications service providers have become, whether willingly or unwillingly, an arm of the surveillance state,” said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice. “The NSA is presumably operating under authorities that enable it to target foreigners, but the fact that it is so deeply embedded in our domestic communications infrastructure should tip people off that the effects of this kind of surveillance cannot be neatly limited to non-Americans.”\nThe dark, foreboding look of TITANPOINTE fits well with its long history of rights violations, in the name of advancing U.S. hegemony through war-making and economic and political sabotage.\nDelivered by The Daily Sheeple\nWe encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos ( Click for details ).",

      "title": "Satellite dishes that power Time Warner imperil merger with AT&T",
      "text": "Behind the Time Warner Inc. campus in Atlanta, more than a dozen massive dishes silently stream CNN newscasts, Cartoon Network shows and Turner Sports games to satellites in outer space.\nThey're a vital link in the media giant's global news and entertainment business. But they operate under licenses from the Federal Communications Commission , which means they also could be the biggest threat to Time Warner's aspirations to merge with AT&T Inc.\nTime Warner has dozens of FCC licenses, according to a Bloomberg review of FCC databases. Transferring them to AT&T would trigger a review by the agency, and the company is looking for ways to avoid that, according to a person familiar with the situation. Otherwise, the $85.4 billion deal could be exposed to an agency that's been a graveyard for mergers.\nIn theory, Time Warner could sell its dishes to an unaffiliated third party and enter into a contract with them for the same services -- but in that case, the buyer would need to ask the FCC for a license to provide services in the same location over the same airwaves, said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.\nIt's possible the FCC would accept the application without a fuss, Schwartzman said. But, he said, FCC officials also might say, \"Wait a minute! We're not stupid -- you are evading this review.\"\nAT&T and Time Warner hope to break the cycle of failed mergers Meg James AT&T’s blockbuster bid for Time Warner Inc. might be a boon for investment bankers, lawyers and lobbyists, but it is anyone’s guess whether investors, employees and consumers ultimately would benefit from the combination.\nSince the $85.4-billion deal was unveiled last weekend, AT&T Chief Executive...\nAT&T’s blockbuster bid for Time Warner Inc. might be a boon for investment bankers, lawyers and lobbyists, but it is anyone’s guess whether investors, employees and consumers ultimately would benefit from the combination.\nSince the $85.4-billion deal was unveiled last weekend, AT&T Chief Executive...\n(Meg James) In that case, the FCC, which regulates airwaves use, could insist on a thorough public hearing for the new license application, Schwartzman said.\nThe likely outcome? \"Maybe, maybe not, is the bottom line,\" he said.\nAT&T believes it can \"offload\" licenses that would trigger an FCC review, RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin said in a note summarizing a Nov. 10 presentation by company executives to RBC's Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications Conference.\nTime Warner also holds a license for a television station, WPCH in Atlanta. There are well-established procedures to place such licenses into a trust while potential buyers are found, in effect removing them from a review, Schwartzman said.\nAccording to Fred Campbell, a former chief of the FCC's wireless bureau, the company could simply surrender the TV license.\nKeith Cocozza, a spokesman for New York-based Time Warner, declined to comment.\nAT&T General Counsel David McAtee said \"AT&T and Time Warner are currently determining which FCC licenses, if any, will be transferred to AT&T.\" \"To the extent that one or more licenses are to be transferred, those transfers are subject to FCC review,\" McAtee said in an email. \"We take a very simple approach here: we follow the law and so whatever the law requires that's always what we'll do.\"\nAT&T says the Justice Department , which also will review the merger, has never denied a transaction that joins companies from different industries on antitrust grounds. \"So from that perspective, we're optimistic,\" AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told investors Nov. 9.\nThe FCC's review is broader, and includes an assessment of whether a deal is in the public interest. In past deals it has weighed such factors as accelerating deployment of advanced services, ensuring a diversity of information sources, and managing airwaves.\nIn addition the FCC can send deals to a lengthy public hearing, essentially killing a deal through delay. FCC plans for a hearing helped to kill AT&T's bid to buy smaller T-Mobile US Inc. in 2011, and to end top U.S. cable provider Comcast Corp. 's deal for Time Warner Cable last year.\n\"There is a very big political component that lies beyond the facts,\" said Jim Kahan, a former AT&T strategy chief. \"Nobody likes big companies. It's easy for politicians to be anti-big business, and Washington's philosophy has been moving away from big deals like this.\"\nAs a candidate, President-elect Donald Trump said he would block the deal. Still it's not clear an FCC with his appointees would move to do so, as power shifts to Republicans who generally view mergers less skeptically than Democrats.\n\"There could be a good shot at avoiding FCC review,\" John Nakahata, an attorney at Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis and former FCC chief of staff. \"But that comes with a big caveat: What signals does the Trump administration send to the FCC on how it wants it to proceed?\"\nJeffrey Eisenach, who is working with Trump's FCC transition team, has proposed stripping the FCC of merger review power, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Schettenhelm said in a Nov. 15 note. FCC Republicans haven't scrutinized deals as closely as Democrats, and only Trump's negative comment about the AT&T-Time Warner merger points in the opposite direction, Schettenhelm said. Eisenach declined to comment.\nBoth current Republican members of the FCC have time remaining in their terms and are likely to serve under Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. The senior Republican commissioner, Ajit Pai, has criticized the Democratic-led FCC for demanding too much from merging companies.\nLast year Pai criticized requirements placed upon AT&T to allow its purchase of DirecTV, calling it \"forced tribute\" like the mortal combat demanded by the despotic Capitol in \"The Hunger Games\" movie. Fellow Republican Michael O'Rielly faulted the same review for taking more than a year, and for imposing requirements \"outside the scope of our proper role,\" such as having AT&T expand broadband service to more U.S. cities.\nThe FCC routinely grants satellite earth-station licenses, placing them on public notice and giving the public 30 days to object, said Campbell, the former wireless bureau chief.\nIf Time Warner is able to spin off its licenses, \"I don't see how the FCC reviews,\" he said.\nBloomberg's Joshua Fineman contributed.",

      "text": "How the Time Warner Acquisition Could Benefit AT&T PART 3 OF 13 Why Time Warner Is Focusing on Targeted Advertising By Shirley Pelts | Nov 17, 2016 3:18 pm EST Advertising technology products \nTime Warner ( TWX ) is increasingly investing in advertising technology to increase user engagement for its advertisers. The company’s new products regarding data analytics include Targeting Now, Audience Now, ROI Now, and Provable ROI. The company stores all consumer information on its Turner Data Cloud and through data integration with Oracle ( ORCL ). \nTime Warner stated at the company’s fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that targeted advertising helps an advertiser to effectively reach their target audience not only through television but across multiple platforms including mobile and through Time Warner’s direct-to-consumer services like HBO Now. \nTime Warner also intends to provide targeted advertising with its investment in Hulu. In an earlier earnings call, the company had stated the following: “Everything that’s happening at Hulu is moving in the same direction as to what we’re doing on our traditional ad-supported cable networks, which is trying to improve the consumer experience with less overall advertising, but now we’ve got our Turner Data Cloud built out full capacity.” Facebook’s focus on targeted advertising \nFacebook ( FB ) is another company that is also focusing on targeted advertising. The company has been focusing on ad technology to improve the relevancy of ads. It has improved its ad technology to understand users’ interests, which is a critical component of providing relevant ads. Last year, it entered a partnership with IBM ( IBM ), which uses its data analytics programs to provide insights on Facebook users. These insights will help Facebook understand users’ interests, which will help it provide relevant ads. \nUsers, advertisers, and Internet companies all benefit from relevant ads. Providing relevant ads to users helps them have a better experience and also gives advertisers a higher return on investment because users are more likely to click on ads. Relevant ads also help companies such as Facebook, Twitter ( TWTR ), and Google ( GOOG ) monetize ads better. \nAccording to a report from eMarketer and as the chart above shows, programmatic ad spending in the United States will more than double in two years from $10.3 billion in 2014 to $27.5 billion in 2017. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"TWX\",\"TWTR\",\"GOOG\",\"IBM\",\"FB\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Time Warner Inc.\",\"Twitter Inc.\",\"Google Inc\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Facebook Inc\"]} X",
