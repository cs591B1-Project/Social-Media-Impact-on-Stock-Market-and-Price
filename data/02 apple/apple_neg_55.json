      "text": "BI Intelligence \n\nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple's rumored plans to use drones to bolster its Maps service could face obstacles from the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), according to Recode .\nThe news reflects the idea that the biggest barrier to enterprise drone adoption, which is on the rise, continues to be regulation from local and national governments. \nAs it currently stands, the FAA prohibits drones from flying over airports and densely populated areas. It's possible for companies to request waivers to bypass these rules — Alphabet has done so, for example — but operators are then still only allowed to fly the drones on private property. That could pose a major problem for companies like Apple, which would need to seek numerous exemptions from the agency in order to map out urban centers across the US. \nThis is a high-profile example of some of the issues companies face trying to employ drones in the current regulatory environment. The FAA maintains authority over commercial and enterprise drones in the US. But as an increasingly large number of major companies like Apple hope to use drones to enhance their operations, products, and services, the agency might need to consider updating its policies. It's possible that shift could begin in 2018, when the expected release of commercial drone delivery policies could begin to change the regulatory environment around enterprise drone usage.\nDrones turned the corner in 2015 to become a popular consumer device, while a framework for regulation that legitimizes drones in the US began to take shape. Technological and regulatory barriers still exist to further drone adoption.\nDrone manufacturers and software providers are quickly developing technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance that will make flying drones safer. The accelerating pace of drone adoption is also pushing governments to create new regulations that balance safety and innovation.\nSafer technology and better regulation will open up new applications for drones in the commercial sector, including drone delivery programs like Amazon’s Prime Air and Google’s Project Wing initiatives.\nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed drones report that forecasts sales revenues for consumer, enterprise, and military drones. It also projects the growth of drone shipments for consumers and enterprises.\nThe report details several of world’s major drone suppliers and examines trends in drone adoption among several leading industries. Finally, it examines the regulatory landscape in several markets and explains how technologies like obstacle avoidance and drone-to-drone communications will impact drone adoption.\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report: \nWe project revenues from drones sales to top $12 billion in 2021, up from just over $8 billion last year. Shipments of consumer drones will more than quadruple over the next five years, fueled by increasing price competition and new technologies that make flying drones easier for beginners. Growth in the enterprise sector will outpace the consumer sector in both shipments and revenues as regulations open up new use cases in the US and EU, the two biggest potential markets for enterprise drones. Technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance will make flying drones safer and make regulators feel more comfortable with larger numbers of drones taking to the skies. Right now FAA regulations have limited commercial drones to a select few industries and applications like aerial surveying in the agriculture, mining, and oil and gas sectors. The military sector will continue to lead all other sectors in drone spending during our forecast period thanks to the high cost of military drones and the growing number of countries seeking to acquire them. In full, the report: \nCompares drone adoption across the consumer, enterprise, and government sectors. Breaks down drone regulations across several key markets and explains how they’ve impacted adoption. Discusses popular use cases for drones in the enterprise sector, as well as nascent use case that are on the rise. Analyzes how different drone manufacturers are trying to differentiate their offerings with better hardware and software components. Explains how drone manufacturers are quickly enabling autonomous flight in their products that will be a major boon for drone adoption. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options:\nSubscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

      "text": "Photo by Hyper It's dongle city. That's how you can describe Apple 's new MacBook Pro .\nThe company's decision to include only two USB-C ports (four on the more expensive Touch Bar model ) have forced users to rely on expensive and clunky dongles to connect an external hard drive, access an SD card or even charge their iPhone .\nA new accessory is looking to fix this. The HyperDrive adds a variety useful ports to the MacBook Pro, including both an SD and microSD card slot, HDMI output and two USB 3.1 ports. Aside from an Ethernet port, the HyperDrive restores virtually all of the ports found on the previous MacBook Pro from 2015 .\nPhoto by Hyper The HyperDrive is available through a Kickstarter campaign . The hub is priced at $100, but is being offered to Kickstarter backers for $70. It works with both the 13-inch and 15-inch 2016 MacBook models, and is offered in either space gray or silver. The campaign ends on January 16, 2017. The company has said it plans to begin shipping the HyperDrive in February.\nAs always, please note that CNET's reporting on crowdfunding campaigns is not an endorsement of the project or its creators.

Which Apple Watch should you get? How to pick an Apple Watch, and why Series 1 is probably the best bet. by Scott Stein Close Drag \nYou probably already know that you can use your Apple Watch to ping your iPhone as long as they're close to each other. (Open Control Center on your Watch and tap on the Ping icon, the button with the iPhone and sound waves coming out of it.) Your iPhone will beep a few times; you then repeat the process until you find your phone. \nBut wait, there's more. Enlarge Image Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET \nAs explained by a Reddit post from late 2015 I stumbled across by accident last week, if you long-press on the Ping icon the iPhone will not only play a sound, but the flash will blink several times to help you find your iPhone in the dark. \nYour iPhone's screen will need to be off for this to work, and as you can see it's bright enough to grab your attention even in a well-lit room.

Apple's Hidden Return Policy Could Allow Abuse, Harm Developers A group of developers think it's harming their bottom line by Rob LeFebvre December 5, 2016 \nA group of App Store sellers spoke to the Korea Times about Apple’s black hole of return policy. \nApple’s app return policy is opaque, at best, and may in fact be harming developers as unscrupulous App Store gamers purchase games, then return them after playing through. Some users may do this several times, essentially getting a game or app for free. \nOne development studio, Flint ( Dragon Blaze ) took to the press via the Korea Times to plead its case this weekend. \n“By analyzing all payment data and logs, we have tracked down about 300 users who are suspected of abusing Appstore’s refund policy.” - Flint CEO Kim Young-mo \nAccording to the Korea Times , other studios, including Nexon, Longtu Korea, and Next Floor, are similarly engaged in rooting out abuse due to the loophole in Apple’s return policy. \nWhen users purchase a game, then request a refund from Apple, the developer is not notified by Apple, who claims this is a privacy issue. The onus is left on developers, who must manually track users to see if they are using the content they’ve gotten refunds for. \nNext Floor told the Times that they are working to regulate the abuse, which only occurs in the Apple-branded App Store. \n“We are regulating those who abuse the payment process and damage other users under our management policy. Unlike other application stores, Apple does not provide refund information to the game companies and we are having difficulties in promptly counteracting the problem.” \nApple’s return policy is laid out in its Terms of Service , which basically says that while all sales are final, it may issue a refund if there are technical problems or a delay in delivery of the app content. \nIn other words, Apple is the final arbiter of who gets a refund or not. \nIn contrast, Google allows refunds only once and only within two hours of paying for an app, which makes it so users cannot play a game fully, then return it for a full refund.",

      "text": "Apple's Letter to NHTSA Hints at Autonomous Car Project (AAPL, TSLA) By Richard Saintvilus | December 5, 2016 — 7:20 AM EST \nEarlier reports suggesting that Apple, Inc. ( AAPL ) had given up on its self-driving car initiative, dubbed Project Titan, might have been too premature. \nAccording to a letter that came to light late Friday, the Cupertino-based tech giant's car ambitions remain in high gear. The Wall Street Journal noted that Apple has written a letter to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) offering feedback on proposed guidelines for autonomous vehicles. \nThe letter to the NHTSA, which came from Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, states that Apple “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" \nDespite plenty of rumors and many more hints of interest, Apple has never stated publicly that it is working on a car or self-driving software. Analysts nonetheless believe that Project Titan is, in fact, Apple's secret self-driving car program. Apple has also reportedly made several car-related hires, including accusations it has poached engineers from Tesla Motors, Inc. ( TSLA ). Earlier this year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called Apple's car plans an \" open secret ,\" saying, \"It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it.\" \n“We’ve provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” confirmed Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr on Friday. \nAmid recent accidents involving Tesla vehicles believed to have been linked to self-driving technology, the Obama administration has imposed guidelines to help guide self-driving development. The Journal noted that Alphabet Inc. ( GOOGL ) subsidiary Google had already collected more than 2 million miles of public-roadway testing for its vehicles, while General Motors Co. ( GM ) has completed a $1 billion deal to acquire Cruise Automation to jump start its autonomous vehicle program. \nIn that regard, it seems Apple has finally acknowledged that it is too far behind in the auto race to remains secretive indefinitely. To project what course it has left behind the likes of Tesla, Google or GM, Apple has to lobby for what it needs or risk getting left further behind.

      "text": "When Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro lineup in October, the company made it clear that these machines are meant for so-called “creatives,” or people working in design, advertising, music, and so on. The standout feature is a new interface called the Touch Bar, a touchscreen panel that sits above the keyboard and changes functions based on what software is running at a given moment.\nThe day before Apple introduced its latest high-powered laptops, Microsoft unveiled new hardware of its own: A revamped Surface Book laptop and the new Microsoft Studio, a touchscreen desktop also designed for “creatives.”\nBoth companies’ new machines are priced at the high end of the market, further cementing the fact that they’re for professionals, not everyday users.\nTaken together, Apple and Microsoft’s latest computers remind me of something the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs said while introducing the iPad in 2010. Jobs believed that PCs are like trucks designed for specific uses, but the iPad and tablets in general are more like everyday cars — and that’s where the growth will be.\nAlthough I believe Apple will always make Macs, which represent about 12% of its quarterly revenue, it’s the iPad that’s more vital for Apple’s vision of computing’s future. Current Apple CEO Tim Cook was a disciple of Jobs, learning a great deal from him. We’re now seeing Cook use Jobs’ playbook more aggressively as he encourages many users to move from Macs to the iPad lineup and its mobile operating system, iOS. Apple’s desktop-and-laptop macOS software will always be important, but as Jobs believed, PCs will increasingly be tools for professionals and creatives rather than everyday computer users. .\nFor some time, many people thought Apple might merge macOS and iOS. But it seems clear to me that this will not be the case. Instead, I believe macOS will be pushed to those who need the Mac as a “truck” while iOS will evolve to become Apple’s mainstream computing software in the form of iPads. Over the last five years, Apple has developed a serious services business that now brings in upwards of $20 billion a year. While macOS contributes to some of these services earnings, I venture to guess that iOS accounts for at least 80% of that services revenue, making it even more critical to Apple’s financial future.\nKeeping two separate operating systems makes sense for Apple, enabling the company to offer a more basic and approachable OS for mobile users, with more powerful software for pro buyers. Still, I believe both everyday consumers and business users will embrace so-called “2-in-1” computers, which can function as both a tablet and a laptop-with-keyboard. These machines offer highly versatile computing experiences, giving users better options for access to all types of apps and services. Given that, I believe iOS will be more important to Apple’s future than its desktop cousin, macOS.\nBen Bajarin is the Director of Consumer Technology at Creative Strategies, Inc., a market intelligence and research firm.

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nDespite the release of a zippy new model, the Apple Watch may be doomed for tepid sales, based on new data. \nEight-five percent of the wearable technology market is comprised of \"basic\" devices that don't run third-party apps, according to quarterly data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). Simple wearables saw double-digit growth during the third quarter, IDC said, but when smartwatches were added to the mix, the market grew only 3.1 percent from a year ago. \nThat was bad news for Apple, who saw wearable shipments fall 71 percent year-over-year in the quarter, to 1.1 million units. Apple does not break out its Apple Watch sales. Andrew Kelly | Reuters The Apple Watch displayed in an Apple Store. \nThe results are somewhat expected, since the release of the company's highly-anticipated Apple Watch Series 2 was near the end of the quarter, and consumers may have waited to make their purchase. But the trend toward simpler wearables may not bode well for Apple's new device headed into the holiday season, IDC said. \n\"The primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface,\" IDC said. \"Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.\" \nApple was the only major wearable vendor to see a decline in growth, bested by Samsung, Fitbit, China's Xiaomi and Garmin, according to IDC. But that doesn't mean others have unlocked the market, either. \nXiaomi's market share eroded as it failed to make inroads outside of China. Fitbit, meanwhile, has seen its shares fall 45 percent over the past 6 months, after giving fourth-quarter guidance that was well below estimates. Samsung's share of wearables was also boosted by one-time bundling it with its phones. \nFans of the Apple Watch, like former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, have said that Apple's playing the long game , continuously improving an aspirational product. Still, while Apple has focused on upgrading its technology — adding a brighter display, dual-core processor and water resistance — it doesn't have many lower-end options for impulse buyers, IDC notes. \n\"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst at IDC said in a statement. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\"",

      "text": "Samantha Lee/Business Insider \nClues that Apple might be developing self-driving car technology has emerged in a letter sent by the tech giant to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal , was sent by Apple’s head of product integrity Steve Kenner and included feedback on proposed guidelines for self-driving cars.\nSpecifically, there was a paragraph stating that Apple “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\nThere have been rumors of Apple developing self-driving car technology for years and until recently it was thought that Apple would use the technology for its own car. The thinking changed in October when reports emerged claiming Apple had abandoned plans to launch its own car and would instead focus on self-driving technology. The reports were backed up by the downsizing of staff working on Apple’s car project, code-named Project Titan.   \nThe government is in the process of establishing rules for the safe testing and deployment of autonomous cars. In September, it presented initial guidelines that included a 15-point design and development checklist , targeted primarily at automakers.  \nIn its letter to NHTSA, Apple called on the government to accelerate the establishment of rules for self-driving cars and to work with groups outside the United States to harmonize the “approach to automated vehicles .” Apple also asked the government to be more flexible regarding the rules, in order to foster innovation in a technology the tech giant sees as “life-saving.”\nNOW WATCH: Here's how much you need to make to be in the top 1% of every state \n",

      "text": "Next Prev Wireless charging? \nSamsung does it, and Apple is starting to, too. The wireless AirPods headphones may have been just the beginning. Next year's iPhone could do away with the last physical wire: the Lightning cable needed for charging. Earlier this year, Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz predicted that Apple would reserve this innovation for the iPhone 8; The Verge reported that Apple has been staffing up on wireless charging experts; and in November, Nikkei Asian Review reported that Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturing partners, is making wireless charging modules for the 2017 iPhone. Most recently, veteran Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that the forthcoming 4.7-inch iPhone will come equipped with wireless charging. \nThe Apple Watch already uses a form of wireless charging. And the Qi standard, embraced by the likes of Samsung, already drives wireless charging stations in thousands of public spaces and 50 models of cars. Those stations are just waiting for an iPhone. \nSamsung has made phones with slightly curved faces before, but we haven't seen anything like the Samsung Galaxy Round , which bends the actual AMOLED display technology lengthwise beneath the glass. Sarah Tew/CNET Cameras \nDual-lens cameras like the one found in the iPhone 7 Plus and other phones aren't just for zoom photos. Two cameras mean depth sensing, 3D and a lot more -- like enabling cool things with augmented reality. \nApple CEO Tim Cook keeps talking up the feature, which can place virtual things in your real-world view, saying it's more important than virtual reality , which immerses you completely in a digital world. It's possible that the next iPhone (or maybe an \"iPhone 8 Plus\") might have a dual-lens camera that could scan the world and overlay 3D objects onto it with high accuracy. Display \nFor a long time, rumors suggested that Apple would give the iPhone a sapphire display , which would offer a higher degree of scratch and shatter-resistance than the current models' Gorilla Glass. Makes sense, since Apple already uses the material on the higher-end Apple Watch. Sapphire is expensive, though, and Apple won't want to tremendously raise prices in its base model phone. There's definitely a question mark hanging over this one. \nIt's also being said that the iPhone will become curved. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities has predicted that Apple will introduce a new curved AMOLED display in 2017. That'd be a big change from the LCD screens in today's iPhones -- AMOLED is thinner, lighter, more flexible, and more power efficient. And in November, Sharp President Tai Jeng-wu mentioned that the next iPhone would have this OLED screen ; of course, Apple hasn't confirmed it. \nWith months to go before an official announcement, we'll keep an eye on how the iPhone 7's static \"button,\" dual-lens Plus camera and absent headphone jack may have set the stage for even bigger changes ahead. \nScroll down for a reverse-chronological look at the latest rumors. November 28, 2016 \nApple is rumored to release new iPad tablets in the spring, and a Japanese report claims they will be nearly bezel-less. November 28, 2016 \nReports say the tech giant is asking its Asia-based suppliers for increased production of OLED screens. November 2, 2016 \nApple manufacturing partner Foxconn is reportedly testing wireless charging for the next iPhone. September 28, 2016 \nThe next iPhone is being developed at offices in Israel and will feature a \"radical redesign,\" reports Business Insider. September 17, 2016 \nApple has shown that a series of little upgrades over time adds up to big changes in the future. So what's on tap for the iPhone's 10th anniversary? Hot Products",

Latest Australian news Uber compensation package approved by Queensland government \nAccording to Xero, businesses that take payments via Stripe and Apple Pay have an extra level of security, as all payments made require a fingerprint or passcode, which Xero said decreases fraud as well as chargebacks. \n\"Mobile payments are the way of the future,\" Xero chief technology officer Craig Walker said. \"Attaching a payment option to online invoices helps Xero customers get paid almost 80 percent faster than invoices that don't use a payment service -- so they spend less time chasing unpaid invoices for a more productive and cash healthy business. \n\"By enabling these connections with payment services, small businesses are able to offer multiple payment options on an invoice, giving them and their customers choice of payment and also the ability to pay the invoice as soon as it arrives, ensuring they get paid faster.\" \nApple Pay was launched in Australia in November , with American Express the only financial institution partner joining the iPhone maker's near-field communication (NFC) payments at the time. \nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) was then the first bank in Australia -- and the only financial institution in New Zealand -- to integrate Apple Pay, with ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott admitting in April that the launch was in direct response to the \"hounding\" he received from customers on Twitter and via email. \nANZ is the only member of Australia's big four to embrace Apple Pay; however, member-owned financial services provider CUA made the service available to its members last month, along with Woolworths Employees' Credit Union, Defence Bank, Bank Australia, Police Bank, and others. \nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Westpac Banking Corporation, the National Australia Bank (NAB), and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have been seeking regulatory approval to collectively negotiate with third-party mobile providers such as Apple on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency. \nThe banks want access to the NFC controller in iPhones, as Apple currently does not allow any entity direct access. The group has been arguing that access would enable the banks to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers in competition with Apple's digital wallet without using Apple Pay -- which is what Apple wants to avoid. \nAdditionally, the banks want the removal of the restriction Apple imposes on banks, preventing them from passing on fees that Apple charges for the use of its digital wallet. \nHowever last week, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) issued a draft determination proposing to deny authorisation for the banking consortium to collectively bargain with Apple.

      "text": "Machines with Brains 1 hour ago \nOver the weekend, it was reported (paywall) that Apple had tacitly admitted it was working on a long-rumored self-driving car. The admittance, inasmuch as there was one, came in the form of a letter from Apple sent to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Nov. 22 in response to the government agency’s recent announcement of rules for companies looking to develop self-driving cars for US roads. \nThere were two paragraphs in Apple’s five-page letter that more-or-less solidify the belief that Apple is working on an autonomous vehicle (the emphasis is ours). Here’s the first paragraph: \nApple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation . \nTo date, the majority of Apple’s work with machine learning has manifested itself in software for the iPhone or other existing Apple products. That includes object-recognition software in its Photos app, natural-language understanding for transcribing voicemails, and the backbone of Apple’s digital assistant, Siri. (Hopefully its cars will drive a lot better than Siri understands.) \nAnd the second paragraph: \nBoth Congress and NHTSA have long recognized that manufacturers need to conduct limited and controlled testing on public roads. In fact, Congress recently enacted a provision in the FAST Act explicitly allowing established manufacturers to test on public roads without pursuing exemptions from FMVSS.10 But the FAST Act does not provide the same opportunity to new entrants . To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally . \nHere it seems to imply that Apple considers itself a “new entrant” in the automotive industry. It has been working for years on in-car technology in the form of Apple CarPlay , a simplified iOS operating system that runs through a car’s onboard entertainment system when an iPhone is connected. But it seems to be suggesting that what it’s working on extends far beyond car software. The company made specific suggestions about changes it would make to the NHTSA’s proposed rules, including the open-sourcing of anonymized crash data, so that car companies aiming to build autonomous cars could share data to protect against rare accidents that are difficult to replicate in simulations. \nAt the same time, it was recently reported that Apple laid off or reassigned a large portion of its self-driving car team, or had them work on just specific aspects of a car, like advanced battery technology . At one point, it was estimated that over 1,000 people were secretly working on Apple’s car project, including a team dedicated solely to autonomous driving software, and designers with luxury car experience. In September, The New York Times reported that that number has since dwindled. \nApple wasn’t immediately available to comment on its plans for a car, or what its letter to the NHTSA actually signaled. \nRegardless, Apple is spending a lot of money (even if it’s still a relatively small portion of its overall revenue) on research and development. In 2015, it spent over $8 billion on R&D, compared with around $500 million per year in the years leading up to the development of the iPhone. Apple’s recent consumer electronics products may have underwhelmed, but it’s highly unlikely that it’s spending that much cash to reinvigorate its phone or computer lines, or even to develop new products, such as the rumored smart glasses. That amount of money is likely being spent on something far larger, such as a car. For comparison, Alphabet has spent $7.1 billion, $9.8 billion, and $12.3 billion in the last three years on R&D, and it publicly announced its self-driving car program (along with myriad other capital-intensive “moonshots” ) roughly six years ago . \nApple appears to be building up to something big. The letter to the NHTSA is the clearest indication yet that it is indeed working on a self-driving vehicle, even if that letter is rather vague. Read full story",

      "text": "0 Comments \nFor those using an iPhone or iPad running one of the beta versions of iOS 10.2 , Apple has started populating special pages on the App Store that are meant to work with the update's Single Sign-On feature for cable logins. These sections are tailored for use with your particular provider, and will only show apps that work with that subscription. \nThe change was first noted by a poster on Reddit : \nUp until today if you were on the beta and signed into SSO there was a button that said \"Find More Apps\" that would send you the app store but would never populate. As of today it is now populating with apps compatible to your cable subscription. \nIf you're on the beta, simply head to Settings > General > TV Provider. If you're signed in with your cable account, tap the Find More Apps button to head to the App Store page. Note that some providers, like Sling TV, currently have empty pages. When you download and use an app that supports Single Sign-On, you'll evidently need to give permission for your login credentials to be used, much as you would if the app was asking for microphone, camera, or location data access. \nSingle Sign-On, which is set to arrive with iOS 10.2 , along with tvOS 10.1 on the Apple TV, will allow you to sign in once with your cable login information, with apps that require a cable login pulling those credentials from iOS or tvOS, rather than requiring your to enter them again and again. While the feature is still in beta, only a handful of cable companies are supported, including Dish, DirecTV, and Sling TV. Like us!",

      "text": "When Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro lineup in October, the company made it clear that these machines are meant for so-called \"creatives,\" or people working in design, advertising, music, and so on. The standout feature is a new interface called the Touch Bar, a touchscreen panel that sits above the keyboard and changes functions based on what software is running at a given moment.\nThe day before Apple introduced its latest high-powered laptops, Microsoft unveiled new hardware of its own: A revamped Surface Book laptop and the new Microsoft Studio, a touchscreen desktop also designed for \"creatives.\"\nBoth companies' new machines are priced at the high end of the market, further cementing the fact that they're for professionals, not everyday users. Taken together, Apple and Microsoft's latest computers remind me of something the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs said while introducing the iPad in 2010. Jobs believed that PCs are like trucks designed for specific uses, but the iPad and tablets in general are more like everyday cars -- and that's where the growth will be.\nAlthough I believe Apple will always make Macs, which represent about 12% of its quarterly revenue, it's the iPad that's more vital for Apple's vision of computing's future. Current Apple CEO Tim Cook was a disciple of Jobs, learning a great deal from him. We're now seeing Cook use Jobs' playbook more aggressively as he encourages many users to move from Macs to the iPad lineup and its mobile operating system, iOS. Apple's desktop-and-laptop macOS software will always be important, but as Jobs believed, PCs will increasingly be tools for professionals and creatives rather than everyday computer users. .\nFor some time, many people thought Apple might merge macOS and iOS. But it seems clear to me that this will not be the case. Instead, I believe macOS will be pushed to those who need the Mac as a \"truck\" while iOS will evolve to become Apple's mainstream computing software in the form of iPads. Over the last five years, Apple has developed a serious services business that now brings in upwards of $20 billion a year. While macOS contributes to some of these services earnings, I venture to guess that iOS accounts for at least 80% of that services revenue, making it even more critical to Apple's financial future.\nFor more about Apple, watch: \nKeeping two separate operating systems makes sense for Apple, enabling the company to offer a more basic and approachable OS for mobile users, with more powerful software for pro buyers. Still, I believe both everyday consumers and business users will embrace so-called \"2-in-1\" computers, which can function as both a tablet and a laptop-with-keyboard. These machines offer highly versatile computing experiences, giving users better options for access to all types of apps and services. Given that, I believe iOS will be more important to Apple's future than its desktop cousin, macOS.\nTim Bajarin is recognized as one of the leading industry consultants, analysts and futurists, covering the field of personal computers and consumer technology.

      "text": "Apple's iCloud Service Down for Some Users Monday December 5, 2016 1:12 PM PST by Juli Clover Apple's iCloud service appears to be down or working slowly for many users, according to reports sent in by MacRumors readers and comments on Twitter. Customers who are affected by the outage are not able to log into the iCloud website and are receiving server error messages. iCloud features like Calendar and mail are also not working for users in areas where iCloud is down. Apple's System Status page is not currently reporting an iCloud outage, but Apple often does not update the page until outages are resolved or close to being cleared up. There's no word on how long the outage might last, but most of the time, connection issues are resolved quickly. Update: Apple's System Status page is now reporting an issue with iCloud Web Apps, which appear to have been unavailable for some users since 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time.",

      "text": "Samantha Lee/Business Insider\nClues that Apple might be developing self-driving car technology has emerged in a letter sent by the tech giant to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal , was sent by Apple’s head of product integrity Steve Kenner and included feedback on proposed guidelines for self-driving cars.\nSpecifically, there was a paragraph stating that Apple “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\nThere have been rumors of Apple developing self-driving car technology for years and until recently it was thought that Apple would use the technology for its own car. The thinking changed in October when reports emerged claiming Apple had abandoned plans to launch its own car and would instead focus on self-driving technology. The reports were backed up by the downsizing of staff working on Apple’s car project, code-named Project Titan.\nThe government is in the process of establishing rules for the safe testing and deployment of autonomous cars. In September, it presented initial guidelines that included a 15-point design and development checklist , targeted primarily at automakers.\nIn its letter to NHTSA, Apple called on the government to accelerate the establishment of rules for self-driving cars and to work with groups outside the United States to harmonize the “approach to automated vehicles .” Apple also asked the government to be more flexible regarding the rules, in order to foster innovation in a technology the tech giant sees as “life-saving.”\nMore from Motor Authority: Stolen 1964 Chevrolet Corvette recovered 40 years later Jeff Gordon unretiring to pilot Cadillac's Daytona Prototype 800-hp turbocharged and supercharged Challenger SRT Hellcat X hits the road NextEV SUV to offer Model X performance for Toyota price, says founder 2017 Ferrari 488 Challenge race car revealed NOW WATCH: It’s surreal to watch this 2011 video of Obama and Seth Meyers taunting Trump about a presidential run BITranspo Motor Authority Apple Self-Driving Car NHTSA",

      "text": "Getty Images A customer checks an iPhone 6S at an Apple store. \nThere are no safety issues involved in Apple 's battery replacement program, according to a statement on the company's China website . \nApple has offered replacement batteries to qualifying iPhone 6S owners after a small number began to shut down unexpectedly. But as of now, there seems to be no risk of repeating the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 debacle, where phones were recalled on risk of catching fire. \nInstead, a battery component used in September and October 2015 was exposed to air for longer than usual in the iPhone 6S models, triggering a feature that causes the iPhone to shut down automatically under certain conditions, such as extreme cold. \nWhile Apple has said the battery issues only affect a small number of iPhone 6S users, others have also complained. Most notable? Tony Fadell, who helped invent the iPhone and currently owns an iPhone 6S Plus. Tweet: It's happening to me every other day - especially while using any mapping app. Have to always carry an external battery to revive it. \nThere have also been isolated reports of fires connected to iPhones, although there's no evidence these incidents are widespread. \n\"We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly. After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified,\" Apple said. \"We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.\"",

      "text": "12/05/16 AT 4:46 PM Close \nThere has been a considerable amount of speculation surrounding Apple's interest in creating a car and while the company has largely been silent about the venture, a letter from Apple to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) appears to confirm its exploration of the idea. \nThe five-page letter , from Apple director of product integrity Steve Kenner, was sent to offer comment on the United States government's attempts to lay a policy foundation for self-driving cars on roads across the country. Also revealed in the letter, though, is the strongest clue yet that Apple is planning to get into the car business. \n“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,” Kenner wrote . \nThere is little detail in the letter in terms of Apple's future plans, but it does mark a rare public acknowledgement of the company's long-rumored interest in automotives. \nApple has ramped up what appears to be its efforts to either build a car or create its own autonomous system for vehicles. The company began building a “software core\" that will act as the basis for a car's self-driving functionality. Related Stories The Apple Car May Have A German, Austrian Feel \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Apple has hundreds of engineers working on a vehicle, dubbed Project Titan, in an effort to challenge Tesla in the electric car market. The Cupertino company also reportedly hired a former Tesla executive to lead its automotive initiative. \nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla, called Apple's project an \"open secret\" earlier this year and said it would be a \"more direct\" challenge to Tesla than other tech companies exploring self-driving vehicle technology, indicating Apple is building its own vehicle and not just an autonomous system. \nApple encouraged the NHTSA to implement guidance for self-driving vehicles, both in hopes of providing rigorous safety principles for design and production as well as to expedite the process of getting the cars on roadways. The company asked for the regulatory body to work toward the goal of \"fostering innovation, improving regulatory flexibility, and encouraging the development of life-saving technology\" in its decision-making. \nThe friendlier those rules are toward autonomous vehicles, the sooner one with an Apple logo on it may be on the road.

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 December 5, 2016, 9:45 A.M. ET Tech Today: Going ‘Cautious’ on Apple, Amazon ‘Go,’ Fitbit #1 By Tiernan Ray \nHere some things going on today in your world of tech : \nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down $1.50, or 1.3%, at $108.40, amidst news of both its rumored ambition in driverless vehicles , and more spot checks of the health of iPhone . \nOn the latter score, boutique house BlueFin moves to a “cautious” rating on the stock, from “positive,” after “supply chain checks” make the analysts, John Donovan and Steve Mullane worried that March quarter iPhone sales will be “well below Wall Street consensus.” \nPacific Crest ’s Andy Hargreaves , who has an Overweight rating, cuts his price target to $127 from $129, after cutting his estimates to “roughly in line with consensus” for December and for all of fiscal 2017. \nOn the matter of self-driving vehicles, Reuters ’s David Shepardson reported Saturday that a five-page letter from from the head of Apple’s “product integrity,” Steve Kenner, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dropped hints about the company’s interest in things like “ machine learning ” related to transportation. \nJ.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall writes “we like the fact that Apple is clearly working on auto software though it is likely a few years down the road before the company is able to realize any revenue from these projects.” \n“More importantly, we see Apple’s focus on machine learning as critical to the future of the company given the importance of these systems in the future.” \nShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) are up 14 cents, or 0.6%$, at $23.99, after Gabelli & Co .’s Hendi Susanto started coverage of the stock wth a Buy rating, and a $29 price target,” writing that “ CEO [Meg] Whitman has successfully led strategic initiatives to lower costs, improve the company’s performance, engage in transformative transactions, unlock value and strengthen the product portfolio.” \nShares of Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL ) are down 19 cents, or 1.4%, at $13.83, after Goldman Sachs ’s Mark Delaney cut his rating on the stock to Sell from Neutral, writing that “most of the positive catalysts investors were looking for are now priced in.” \nShares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are up $6.50, or 0.8%, at $746.84, after the company this morning unveiled “ Amazon Go ,” which lets you walk into retail outlets and take things off the shelf without having to stop to pay for them. “No lines, no checkouts,” says an Amazon video on the matter . Items are automatically added to an electronic payment system via an app. The technology is currently featured at Amazon’s brick-and-mortar store in Seattle. \nResearch firm IDC this morning reports that wearables technology shipments rose by 3% in Q3, to 23 million units, with most of it, 85%, being fitness devices. Fitbit ( FIT ) had 23% market share, up from 21% a year earlier, while China’s Xiaomi held second place at 16.5%. Garmin ( GRMN ) was in third place, and Apple at 4th place. Apple fell to 4.9% from 17.5% a year earlier, a 71% decline. \nFitbit shares are down 4 cents, or half a percent, at $8.10. ",

      "text": "Apple and Google are just two of the companies with heavy music interests that earned a perfect score in the Human Rights Campaign’s annual report assessing LGBT inclusion among major American companies.\nThe HRC’s 2017 Corporate Equality Index, released on Monday , found that 517 businesses/law firms out of 887 earned a 100 percent score based on criteria covering non-discrimination policies, benefits, accountability, a public commitment to LGBT equality and responsible citizenship.\nThe CEI includes several companies whose core business is music, but most are major corporations who have subsidiaries that do so. Pandora, Sirius XM, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft all earned the top score of 100. As for the major labels, Sony Music parent Sony Corporation of America also scored 100. (Warner Music’s NYC-based parent Access Industries was not rated, and Universal Music is owned by French conglomerate Vivendi.) Hollywood Records parent Walt Disney Co. was at the top of the class, as were most telecom companies, including AT&T, Charter, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon.\nRead more: 50 Top Gay Anthems to Celebrate LGBT Pride Month: Critics' Picks\nAs for brick-and-mortar stores where music is still sold, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart all scored 100. Stores where you may often find a CD (or vinyl LP) being sold among totally unrelated items include Starbucks, 100, and Whole Foods, which garnered an 85 in the survey because it does not offer transgender-inclusive health insurance coverage. Cracker Barrel, which sells country music CDs and DVDs in its 639 locations, earned a mere 55 points. (According to the CEI, Cracker Barrel doesn't sufficiently prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.)\nOnline retail king Amazon earned 90 points out of 100 because HRC found it lacked \"Firm-wide Organizational Competency Programs.\"\niHeartMedia was docked five points because it did not positively engage the external LGBT community enough, according to the criteria. Live Nation was scored at only 75 for various reasons, including the lack of coverage options for transgender employees. IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns Vimeo, CollegeHumor and The Daily Beas t, among other web properties, earned 80 for lacking firm-wide competency programs.\nMega corps including Viacom and Time Warner scored 100.\nSeveral law firms featured in Billboard ’s recent list of top music attorneys were also graded in this year’s index. Greenburg Traurig, Jenner & Block, Gibson, Dun & Crutcher and Carlton Fields all received perfect scores. Manatt, Phelps & Phillips earned 90, while Loeb & Loeb came in at 50 points.\nAccording HRC, 517 companies earned a 100 percent in the 2017 CEI, up from 407 in the 2016 report. Of the 887 companies when participated, 647 now offer transgender workers at least one health care plan that has transgender-inclusive coverage, a 314 percent increase since 2012. The report also found that gender identity is now part of non-discrimination policies at 82 percent of Fortune 500 companies, up from just 3 percent in 2002.\n\"Even in the face of relentless attempts to undermine equality, America’s leading companies and law firms remain steadfast and committed to supporting and defending the rights and dignity of LGBTQ people,”said HRC President Chad Griffin in a statement. \"The unprecedented expansion of inclusive workplaces across the country and around the globe not only reflects our progress, it helps drive it. As we enter a new chapter in our fight for equality, support from the business community will be more critical than ever to protect our historic advancements over the last decade and to continue to push equality forward for workers, customers, and families around the world.”\nRead the full report here .",

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 December 5, 2016, 4:18 P.M. ET Apple, Amazon, Sony Tops in Barclays Holiday Gadget List By Tiernan Ray \nWorried about what to get the loved ones this holiday from the tech world? \nBarclays analysts Blayne Curtis and company are here to help. \nHe and his colleagues today offered up a note on what gadgets are hot this season, and what to look forward to in the upcoming CES gadget fest that kicks off in Las Vegas on January 3rd. \nThe point of the exercise, from an investment standpoint, is to show off companies the analysts cover, such as Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), and the chip companies that supply them, such as Cirrus Logic ( CRUS ) and Silicon Labs ( SLAB ). \nFor each category of gadget, the analysts offer a summation of where the market stands. \nIn the area of audio gadgets , the authors see Cirrus as a should-have-been winner, but one that missed out amidst an onslaught of wireless headsets and wireless speakers : CRUS is an early enabler of lightning and USB-C noise cancelling headphones, but they missed our list this year given the delays in manufacturing, which pushed the launches into Q1:17. Instead we focused on the wireless audio side, which Apple championed with its AirPod release. Unfortunately, Apple is also seeing manufacturing delays and we left the AirPods off the list as well, but we are hopeful they are available by late December as the product appears very compelling based on announced features. What we did include is two categories – Bluetooth (BT) wireless headphones and BT speakers. The BT speakers offer a fun portable way to project sound and increasingly they are linked to the Internet, which starts to blend this category with IoT/home automation. We ultimately chose the wireless Bose headset for this category given it’s still the de facto standard for noise cancelling headphones, and this is the company’s wireless version of a very popular product line. We see the launch of the AirPods as the next milestone for wireless audio as it utilizes a proprietary wireless technology to deliver independent stereo sound while the rest of the world will have to wait for BT LE to arrive. \nThe authors single out for special mention products such as the Bose “QuietComfort 35” headphones; the Jaybird “ X3 ” headphones; the JBL “ Pulse 2 ” wireless speaker; and Sonos ’s “ Play 1 ” \nThe Internet of Things “is a product category that has received a lot of hype in recent years but has largely failed to deliver on its promise.” \n“It seems like that is finally beginning to change,” write the analysts. \nThey highlight five products in IoT, including Amazon’s “ Echo ” appliance; the Philips “ Hue ” LED lights; Rachio ’s “ Smart Sprinkler Controller 2 ”; Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) “ Nest ” security cam; and the Kwikset “ Kevo ” “ touch-to-open smart lock .” \nThey seem to zero in on Amazon as the category winner: Amazon’s Echo products are the first devices to really deliver on the promise of home automation. The Alexa enabled speakers allow you to seamlessly stream music throughout your home while also controlling your Thermostat, Lights, AV equipment, and other devices with natural language voice commands. We like the Dot for the low price and ability to connect to discrete speakers. \nIn the category of wearables , they highlight Apple’s “ Watch Nike+ ,” a special version of the new second-gem device developed with Nike ( NKE ); Garmin ’s ( GRMN ) “ Vivosmart HR+ ”; Fitbit ’s ( FIT ) “ Charge 2 ,” and privately held China telecom giant Huawei ’s “Huawei Watch.” \nThe authors write that wearables are “ currently still clearly finding their way ” as a category. Curtis’s colleague, Mark Moskowitz , follows Apple, and the firm’s opinion is that the company is “a clear leader in the high end of the market even though the product has been less successful to date than many hoped,” and they add, “We chose the Apple Watch Nike+ based on high build quality, tight integration with the iPhone, clear focus on fitness applications.” \nFor smartphones , they choose Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7-Plus, Samsung’s “ Galaxy S7 ,” Google’s “ Pixel ,” and Lenovo Group ’s ( 0992HK ) Motorola unit’s “ Moto Z .” \nThe authors offer that suppliers to watch most in smartphones are Broadcom ( AVGO ), Skyworks Solutions ( SWKS ), Qorvo ( QRVO ), “with additional effects on Intel ( INTC ), CRUS, and Texas Instruments ( TXN ).” \nIn the category of drones , products to watch are DJI ’s “ Mavic Pro ” and Parrot ’s “ Bebop 2 .” \nFor virtual reality gaming stuff, you know the suspects: HTC ’s “ Vive ” and Facebook ’s ( FB ) Oculus unit’s “ Rift ,” and also Sony ’s ( SNE ) “ PlayStation VR .” \nThey also note the Nintendo ( 7974JP ) “ NES Classic Edition ” console and the Sony PS4 Pro update to the console.

      "text": "Self-driving car prototypes should not be subject to the same safety regulations as production vehicles, Apple argued in a letter last month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe letter commends many other aspects of the agency's proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (FAV), but it offers few clarifications to the rumors that have been swirling in recent months about Apple's own self-driving car ambitions.\nFrom securing car-related domain names to hiring executives from Tesla , it's clear that Apple is at least exploring autonomous driving. But the company in September reportedly laid off dozens of employees working on the self-driving project, code-named Project Titan, in a sign that the tech giant is rethinking its efforts.\nIn the letter, sent by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner on Nov. 22 and spotted by the Wall Street Journal last week, the company said it agreed with many safety and certification rules for the production of self-driving cars, but suggested that prototypes should not be subject to all of them. Rather than requesting exemptions from the rules each time it makes a modification to a prototype, Apple wants to self-certify that its prototypes are safe.",

      "text": "December 05, 2016 at 09:45 AM EST Tech Today: Going ‘Cautious’ on Apple, Amazon ‘Go,’ Fitbit #1 Here some things going on today in your world of tech : Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down $1.50, or 1.3%, at $108.40, amidst news of both its rumored ambition in driverless vehicles , and more spot checks of the health of iPhone . On the latter score, boutique house BlueFin moves to a “cautious” rating on the stock, from “positive,” after “supply chain checks” make the analysts, John Donovan and Steve Mullane worried that March quarter iPhone sales will be “well below Wall Street consensus.\" Pacific Crest ’s Andy Hargreaves , who has an Overweight rating, cuts his price target to $127 from $129, after cutting his estimates to “roughly in line with consensus” for December and for all of fiscal 2017. On the matter of self-driving vehicles, Reuters ’s David Shepardson reported Saturday that a five-page letter from from the head of Apple’s “product integrity,” Steve Kenner, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dropped hints about the company’s interest in things like “ machine learning ” related to transportation.",

On the other hand, users will be able to test drive the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 5 and Public Beta 5 releases, which are tagged as build 16C60b, and the fifth Beta of watchOS 3.1.1, tagged as build 14S883. Looking at the release notes for iOS 10.2 Beta 6/Public Beta 6, we can notice that Apple once again improved its new TV app, which should no longer crash or display the \"TV is unavailable\" error on iPod touch d...",

      "text": "  10:14 AM EST Apple: March iPhones Could Miss by A Mile, Says BlueFin Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down 47 cents, or half a percent, at $109.43, as the concerns on the Street about possible cuts in the company’s orders for building iPhone gain steam with two new reports, from boutique firm BlueFin Research Partners , and from Pacific Crest. To review, last Tuesday saw a warning from UBS ’s Steve Milunovich about possible order cuts by Apple in its iPhone production plans. Then last Thursday there was a report from DigiTimes . Friday morning , Junheng Li of JL Warren Capital wrote of cuts to this quarter and next quarter’s production. But Friday saw two bullish notes refuting the matter, from Instinet and Raymond James . In today’s note, BlueFIn analysts John Donovan and Steve Mullane have written that “our most recent Apple supply chain update shapes our view into early 2017 as one of build cuts and an air of uncertainty.\"\"Accordingly, we are adjusting our view from Postive to Cautious near term,” they write. \"We think the stock will be under pressure until the reduced demand levels in 2017 are better understood.\" Without citing any specific sources, Donovan and Steve Mullane see the smaller iPhone 7 and the “SE” models being cut in terms of total units produced. Total March quarter iPhone builds have been reduced from 59M to 53M, with sharp reductions in iPhone 7 and SE models, while the iPhone 7 Plus remained unchanged. Peering into CQ2:17, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus totals have not changed, rather more changes in mix reflecting stronger 7 Plus demand while SE production has been modestly reduced. For the 1H:17, total builds have been reduced 8M to 99M. Table 1 below illustrates the updated build schedules with CY 2017 highlighted based on our most recent supply chain reads.",

      "text": "Apple Releases Sixth Beta of iOS 10.2, Beta 5 of macOS 10.12.2 and watchOS 3.1.1 GO The new builds are available to devs and public beta testers Dec 5, 2016 22:03 GMT · By Marius Nestor · Share: Just three days after seeding iOS 10.2 Beta 5 and Public Beta 5 , Apple released new Beta builds of its upcoming iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, and watchOS 3.1.1 operating systems, and this time they are available to both registered developers and public beta testers on the same day. iOS 10.2 Beta 6 and Public Beta 6 are here and tagged as builds 14C90 and 14C91, depending on the iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch device used. On the other hand, users will be able to test drive the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 5 and Public Beta 5 releases, which are tagged as build 16C60b, and the fifth Beta of watchOS 3.1.1, tagged as build 14S883. Looking at the release notes for iOS 10.2 Beta 6/Public Beta 6, we can notice that Apple once again improved its new TV app, which should no longer crash or display the \"TV is unavailable\" error on iPod touch devices, as well as to no longer delete its library content when attempting to sync your device with iTunes 12.5 up-to 12.5.3. iOS 10.2 should hit the streets as soon as next week Considering the fact that the winter holidays are approaching fast, Apple will try to wrap things up as soon as possible and release the final versions of the iOS 10.2, macOS Sierra 10.12.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1, which are considered point releases that improve the stability, security, and compatibility of your devices. If you plan on test driving the new Beta builds released by Apple today, we recommend to install them if you're currently using a previous development version. Otherwise, if you're still using iOS 10.1.1 or macOS Sierra 10.12.1, we suggest that you wait a little longer before updating to iOS 10.2 or macOS Sierra 10.12.2. At the moment of writing this article, the tvOS 10.1 Beta build remains at version 4, for 4th generation Apple TV devices, and we have no idea if Apple plans on seeding a new Beta. Same goes for the upcoming Xcode 8.2 IDE, which is currently at Beta 2. Xcode 8.2 will include SDKs for iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1. CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (2 Images)",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Worried about what to get the loved ones this holiday from the tech world?\nBarclays analysts Blayne Curtis and company are here to help.\nHe and his colleagues today offered up a note on what gadgets are hot this season, and what to look forward to in the upcoming CES gadget fest that kicks off in Las Vegas on January 3rd.\nThe point of the exercise, from an investment standpoint, is to show off companies the analysts cover, such as Apple ( AAPL ) and Amazon ( AMZN ), and the chip companies that supply them, such as Cirrus Logic ( CRUS ) and Silicon Labs ( SLAB ).\nFor each category of gadget, the analysts offer a summation of where the market stands.\nIn the area of audio gadgets , the authors see Cirrus as a should-have-been winner, but one that missed out amidst an onslaught of wireless headsets and wireless speakers : \nCRUS is an early enabler of lightning and USB-C noise cancelling headphones, but they missed our list this year given the delays in manufacturing, which pushed the launches into Q1:17. Instead we focused on the wireless audio side, which Apple championed with its AirPod release. Unfortunately, Apple is also seeing manufacturing delays and we left the AirPods off the list as well, but we are hopeful they are available by late December as the product appears very compelling based on announced features. What we did include is two categories – Bluetooth (BT) wireless headphones and BT speakers. The BT speakers offer a fun portable way to project sound and increasingly they are linked to the Internet, which starts to blend this category with IoT/home automation. We ultimately chose the wireless Bose headset for this category given it’s still the de facto standard for noise cancelling headphones, and this is the company’s wireless version of a very popular product line. We see the launch of the AirPods as the next milestone for wireless audio as it utilizes a proprietary wireless technology to deliver independent stereo sound while the rest of the world will have to wait for BT LE to arrive. \nThe authors single out for special mention products such as the Bose “QuietComfort 35” headphones; the Jaybird “ X3 ” headphones; the JBL “ Pulse 2 ” wireless speaker; and Sonos ’s “ Play 1 ”\nThe Internet of Things “is a product category that has received a lot of hype in recent years but has largely failed to deliver on its promise.”\n“It seems like that is finally beginning to change,” write the analysts.\nThey highlight five products in IoT, including Amazon’s “ Echo ” appliance; the Philips “ Hue ” LED lights; Rachio ’s “ Smart Sprinkler Controller 2 ”; Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) “ Nest ” security cam; and the Kwikset “ Kevo ” “ touch-to-open smart lock .”\nThey seem to zero in on Amazon as the category winner:\nAmazon’s Echo products are the first devices to really deliver on the promise of home automation. The Alexa enabled speakers allow you to seamlessly stream music throughout your home while also controlling your Thermostat, Lights, AV equipment, and other devices with natural language voice commands. We like the Dot for the low price and ability to connect to discrete speakers. \nIn the category of wearables , they highlight Apple’s “ Watch Nike+ ,” a special version of the new second-gem device developed with Nike ( NKE ); Garmin ’s ( GRMN ) “ Vivosmart HR+ ”; Fitbit ’s ( FIT ) “ Charge 2 ,” and privately held China telecom giant Huawei ’s “Huawei Watch.”\nThe authors write that wearables are “ currently still clearly finding their way ” as a category. Curtis’s colleague, Mark Moskowitz , follows Apple, and the firm’s opinion is that the company is “a clear leader in the high end of the market even though the product has been less successful to date than many hoped,” and they add, “We chose the Apple Watch Nike+ based on high build quality, tight integration with the iPhone, clear focus on fitness applications.”\nFor smartphones , they choose Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7-Plus, Samsung’s “ Galaxy S7 ,” Google’s “ Pixel ,” and Lenovo Group ’s ( 0992HK ) Motorola unit’s “ Moto Z .”\nThe authors offer that suppliers to watch most in smartphones are Broadcom ( AVGO ), Skyworks Solutions ( SWKS ), Qorvo ( QRVO ), “with additional effects on Intel ( INTC ), CRUS, and Texas Instruments ( TXN ).”\nIn the category of drones , products to watch are DJI ’s “ Mavic Pro ” and Parrot ’s “ Bebop 2 .”\nFor virtual reality gaming stuff, you know the suspects: HTC ’s “ Vive ” and Facebook ’s ( FB ) Oculus unit’s “ Rift ,” and also Sony ’s ( SNE ) “ PlayStation VR .”\nThey also note the Nintendo ( 7974JP ) “ NES Classic Edition ” console and the Sony PS4 Pro update to the console.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here some things going on today in your world of tech :\nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) are down $1.50, or 1.3%, at $108.40, amidst news of both its rumored ambition in driverless vehicles , and more spot checks of the health of iPhone .\nOn the latter score, boutique house BlueFin moves to a “cautious” rating on the stock, from “positive,” after “supply chain checks” make the analysts, John Donovan and Steve Mullane worried that March quarter iPhone sales will be “well below Wall Street consensus.”\nPacific Crest ’s Andy Hargreaves , who has an Overweight rating, cuts his price target to $127 from $129, after cutting his estimates to “roughly in line with consensus” for December and for all of fiscal 2017.\nOn the matter of self-driving vehicles, Reuters ’s David Shepardson reported Saturday that a five-page letter from from the head of Apple’s “product integrity,” Steve Kenner, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dropped hints about the company’s interest in things like “ machine learning ” related to transportation.\nJ.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall writes “we like the fact that Apple is clearly working on auto software though it is likely a few years down the road before the company is able to realize any revenue from these projects.”\n“More importantly, we see Apple’s focus on machine learning as critical to the future of the company given the importance of these systems in the future.”\nShares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) are up 14 cents, or 0.6%$, at $23.99, after Gabelli & Co .’s Hendi Susanto started coverage of the stock wth a Buy rating, and a $29 price target,” writing that “ CEO [Meg] Whitman has successfully led strategic initiatives to lower costs, improve the company’s performance, engage in transformative transactions, unlock value and strengthen the product portfolio.”\nShares of Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL ) are down 19 cents, or 1.4%, at $13.83, after Goldman Sachs ’s Mark Delaney cut his rating on the stock to Sell from Neutral, writing that “most of the positive catalysts investors were looking for are now priced in.”\nShares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are up $6.50, or 0.8%, at $746.84, after the company this morning unveiled “ Amazon Go ,” which lets you walk into retail outlets and take things off the shelf without having to stop to pay for them. “No lines, no checkouts,” says an Amazon video on the matter . Items are automatically added to an electronic payment system via an app. The technology is currently featured at Amazon’s brick-and-mortar store in Seattle.\nResearch firm IDC this morning reports that wearables technology shipments rose by 3% in Q3, to 23 million units, with most of it, 85%, being fitness devices. Fitbit ( FIT ) had 23% market share, up from 21% a year earlier, while China’s Xiaomi held second place at 16.5%. Garmin ( GRMN ) was in third place, and Apple at 4th place. Apple fell to 4.9% from 17.5% a year earlier, a 71% decline. \nFitbit shares are down 4 cents, or half a percent, at $8.10.",

      "text": "› Latest issue to hit Apple; phone app freezes on iPhone 7, iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s Latest issue to hit Apple; phone app freezes on iPhone 7, iPhone 6s and iPhone 5s Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Just a few months ago, when it felt as though Samsung Galaxy Note 7 's were exploding left and right, the iPhone almost had a halo around it by comparison. But lately, Apple's iconic handset has been experiencing issues of its own. Some Apple iPhone 6 units are having problems recording touch inputs on the screen, which has led to the filing of a class action suit against Apple. The so-called Touch Disease can be repaired by the tech titan for $149 .Additionally, some Apple iPhone 6s units manufactured between September and October 2015 are shutting down with the battery going from 30% to 0% in the blink of an eye. You can check on Apple's support website to see if you are entitled to a free battery replacement .The latest problem with the iPhone has been discussed on the Apple Support Communities forum. There, owners of the Apple iPhone 7 , iPhone 6s and even the Apple iPhone 5s are complaining that their phone application is freezing. This is preventing them from making and taking phone calls, or handling other phone related operations. It appears that for many, this problem started after the update to iOS 10.1.1. For some, the problem came with the update to iOS 10. Soft and Factory resets are not helping. \"I have the new iPhone7. The Phone APP often freezes and requires me to \"hard-close\" the app by double clicking the home button and swiping up. Is this a known issue? Does anyone know how to fix? My software is up to date iOS 10.1.1\"-Complaint from iPhone 7 user BingoBones Apple has yet to acknowledge this issue, but the company initially did the same with Touch Disease and the so-called #BatteryGate problems. It is hoped that iOS 10.2 will fix this issue. Right now, iOS 10.2 Beta 5 has been disseminated to developers and members of the public beta program, which means that iOS 10.2 is close at hand. \nSome iPhone users have had their phone app freeze once they updated to iOS 10.1.1",

      "text": "Pin it Share Here are some of the stocks the Yahoo Finance team will be watching for you today. Aetna ( AET ) and Humana ( HUM ) shares are in focus this morning. The two health insurance giants’ legal battle with the Justice Department over their planned $37 billion merger begins to unfold in court today. The key issue in the antitrust trial is whether Medicare Advantage customers will face higher prices and lower benefits if Aetna and Humana are allowed to merge. ExxonMobil’s ( XOM ) chairman and chief executive Rex Tillerson is among the candidates being considered for Secretary of State as President-elect Donald Trump looks to fill the top diplomatic job. Tillerson who joined Exxon in 1975, is set to retire next year. McDonald’s ( MCD ) shares were higher this morning after Nomura turned bullish on the fast-food chain, upgrading the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and raised its price target to $139 from $126 a share. The investment firm is optimistic that same-store sales will improve and is encouraged by potential menu updates in 2017, such as the new burgers and and the roll out of its smartphone ordering system. FairPoint Communications ( FRP ) soared in early trading. Consolidated Communications ( CNSL ) is buying the broadband service provider in an all-stock deal valued at $1.5 billion, which also includes debt. Apple ( AAPL ) stock is also on investors’ watch list. We’re learning a bit more about Apple’s interest in developing technology for self-driving cars. In a letter to safety regulators, Apple reveals it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation”in areas including transportation. An Apple spokesman said the company wants to work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to define best practices for the autonomous driving industry. ",

      "text": "| News \nApple Watch shipments fell sharply in the third quarter, primarily due to the timing of the company’s “ Series 2 ” revision, according to new data published today by IDC. Apple is estimated to have sold 1.1 million Apple Watch units in the third quarter of 2016, a 71 percent decline from the 3.9 million units the company sold in the same quarter last year. \nIDC attributes the decline in Apple Watch sales to an “aging lineup and unintuitive user interface.” The first generation Apple Watch was released in April 2015, with Apple waiting until September 2016 to unveil the Apple Watch Series 2 . With the product’s release so late in the third quarter, the Series 2, which addressed many of the user interface concerns, didn’t have time to significantly contribute to Apple’s sales numbers. \nThe decline in Apple Watch sales came amidst modest growth for the wearables market overall. The entire market, which includes both smartwatches and fitness trackers from companies such as Fitbit , grew 3.1 percent year-over-year. Fitbit maintained its lead in the market, selling 5.3 million units for 23.0 percent market share, an 11 percent increase over last year. Xiaomi, Garmin, and Samsung also saw year-over-year growth in shipments. \nWith 1.1 million units sold during the quarter, Apple is in fourth place among wearable vendors. However, the company retains the number one spot when considering just smartwatches, beating out competitors Garmin, Samsung, Lenovo, and Pebble. Apple also sells products at higher prices than its competitors (Apple Watch starts at $269 while Fitbit products start at around $60). \nDespite this, IDC analyst Jitesh Ubrani expects the lower cost fitness-oriented wearables to continue to outpace the more complex smartwatch category: \nIt’s still early days, but we’re already seeing a notable shift in the market. Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background. \nHowever, IDC manager Ramon Llamas suggests that smartwatches may make a comeback in terms of marketshare, as consumers grow more accustomed to wearables and begin to demand greater functionality.

      "title": "UK Police Circumvent iOS Encryption By Snatching iPhone Out of Suspect’s Hands",
      "text": "| News \nWith few exceptions , Apple’s iOS encryption is virtually unbreakable, leading to praise from consumers and condemnation from law enforcement. But while the privacy debate rages here in the United States, police in the UK have effectively deployed an alternative strategy: snatching the iPhone right out of the suspect’s hands while they’re using it. A Digital Fortress \nThe issue is that Apple now encrypts user data by default in iOS, requiring the use of Touch ID or a passcode to unlock it. Due to the complexity of the encryption and a protection scheme that permanently locks the device if too many incorrect passcodes are entered, the data on an iPhone with a secure password is virtually unobtainable. \nThis is great for user privacy and protection, but it presents a serious issue for law enforcement, which has the right under certain circumstances to access an individual’s private information. Apple has taken a hard stand against law enforcement in the U.S. and abroad when it comes to incorporating “back doors” into iOS that would allow law enforcement to circumvent a device’s encryption, arguing that the implementation of such a back door would endanger all iOS users when a hacker or nation inevitably compromises it. \nThis has led to a standoff between Apple and various law enforcement agencies, one which was enflamed by the role of an iPhone in the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack . And although the FBI later claimed it was able to successfully hack into the suspect’s iPhone without Apple’s help, the exact nature of that hack has not been clarified, keeping the issue in the spotlight. Smash & Grab \nDespite this apparent conflict between personal liberties and law enforcement powers, it appears that some good old fashioned police work has revealed an alternative. According to a BBC report last week shared by 9to5Mac , Scotland Yard’s cybercrime unit was able to obtain the data needed to bring down an international credit card fraud racket by simply taking the iPhone out of the suspect’s hands. \nThe suspect, Gabriel Yew, had been under investigation for manufacturing fake credit cards that gangs across Europe were using to purchase luxury goods. The investigators believed that Yew was using an iPhone to communicate with his criminal network, but knew it was unlikely that he would unlock the phone if detained. \nFaced with this dilemma, detectives from the UK’s “ Operation Falcon ” team, which specializes in online organized crime and fraud, devised a plan to surveil Yew and wait for him to unlock and use his iPhone. When the time came, the undercover officers rushed in and seized the device in an apparent mugging. The officer then kept swiping and interacting with the iPhone to prevent it from locking until IT specialists arrived and downloaded the phone’s data. \nDetective Chief Inspector Andrew Gould, who led the operation, told the BBC that it was a complete success, with the iPhone yielding evidence that was “crucial to the prosecution” and detailed a “motherlode” of information on Yew’s criminal activities and those of his partners, leading to a five-and-a-half year prison sentence. \nWhile an operation like this wouldn’t have been useful in situations where police uncover an iPhone after the fact, such as in the case of the San Bernardino terrorists, it does provide a route that preserves the integrity of the iOS operating system as well as law enforcement’s right to pursue criminals.

      "text": "| Quick Tip \nWith the release of Mac OS X Lion way back in 2011, Apple removed easy access to the user’s Library folder. Although arguably well-intentioned, this change was frustrating for longtime Mac power users. There were still several workarounds to access or unhide the Library folder, but they weren’t immediately obvious or simple. \nThankfully, recent versions of the Mac operating system make things easier. While Apple still hides the user’s Library folder by default, you can restore it with a single checkbox. \nTo unhide your Library folder in macOS Sierra, launch Finder and navigate to your user Home folder (you can jump directly to your user folder by select Go > Home from the Finder’s menu bar or using the keyboard shortcut Shift-Command-H ). \nWith your Home folder open, go to View > Show View Options from the menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut Command-J . \nAt the bottom of the View Options window, check the box labeled Show Library Folder and then close the window with the red close button in the upper-left. You’ll now see your Library folder listed inside your Home folder, where it will remain unless you uncheck the aforementioned option. \nWhile many Mac users don’t need to venture into their Library folder (hence why Apple chose to hide it by default), there are indeed many useful maintenance and troubleshooting tasks which require access to it.

      "text": "| News \nRumors of the long-speculated Apple car project received a shot of new energy this week when the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a letter from Apple regarding the rights of “new entrants” into the autonomous car industry. \nThe letter , dated November 22 and signed by Apple Director of Product Integrity Steve Kenner, argued that “new entrants” into the autonomous car industry, such as Apple and Google, should have the same rights when developing their technologies and products as the established automakers do. Under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act , companies such as Ford and General Motors are not required to obtain an exemption to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards when testing their autonomous vehicles on public roads. Those rights do not currently extend to companies without automotive experience until 18 months after the company has received its U.S. Department of Transportation registration. \nApple argues that, when it comes to internal development prototypes, all companies should have the same rights and restrictions, and that no company should need to obtain a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards exemption. As exemption requests can take up to four months to obtain and are required after each material change to the product’s design or testing, Apple notes that allowing companies to test internal prototypes without restrictions is the best way to encourage rapid development and maximize safety. \nTo Apple’s knowledge, the exemption process was intended for, and remains focused on, the sale of new motor vehicles to the public—not on the safe and controlled testing of development vehicles on public roads… To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation, and promote fair competition, established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally. Instead of applying for exemptions, all companies should be given an opportunity to implement internal safety processes summarized in a Safety Assessment. Data Sharing & Privacy \nApple also used its letter to express its support for data sharing among developers of autonomous vehicles, with companies agreeing to share “de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses.” However, Apple insisted that any data sharing programs not compromise individual user privacy, and urged its competitors to “invest the resources necessary to protect individuals’ fundamental right to privacy.” \nThe highly anticipated Apple car program, codenamed “ Project Titan ,” has been on a rollercoaster of late. After gaining traction last year with high profile hirings , recent layoffs and internal sources suggested that the company was putting its autonomous vehicle ambitions on hold . While the company’s recent letter to the NHTSA shows that its plans are not totally abandoned, Apple was quick to clarify its intent with a statement to the Financial Times , claiming that it is “investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems,” and wants to “work with the NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.” Share this:",

      "text": "We're a long way from seeing an Apple-made self-driving car on the road. But a letter from the company to a government agency at least makes the talk of Apple being involved in the development of automated cars a lot more real.\n\nThat letter, written by Apple last month to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and now available as a downloadable PDF , doesn't reveal any specifics about technology Apple is working on. But Steve Kenner, Apple's director of public integrity, does say that the company “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nMORE: Everything We Know About the Apple Car So Far \n\nApple sent the letter to the NHTSA to weigh in on a proposed policy about automated vehicle testing. In the letter, the company asks about clear definitions for things like liability in the event of a self-driving car crash and what effects new regulations could have on an emerging field of tech. This is a big deal, because Apple wouldn't bother asking these kinds of questions if it didn't have plans to either bring an actual self-driving vehicle to market or to at least be heavily involved in someone else's effort. \nFor the record, current law states that in an autonomous vehicle without actual driver controls such as a steering wheel or pedals, the passengers are not liable for any accidents. However, the laws do not state what parties would be liable, something that could include the makers of the vehicle, the makers of the self-driving software, or another entity entirely. \nApple also asked questions about privacy, especially as it relates to personal information gathered about drivers. The company acknowledges that sharing of anonymous driving between car makers would be big help in advancing tech, but that it shouldn't come at the expense of distributing potentially sensitive data to multiple third-parties. \nKenner's letter also placed emphasis on cooperation with Europe to ensure a \"harmonized\" policy for self-driving cars, in addition to regulatory flexibility to allow for room for innovation. \nSo while we still nothing almost nothing about Apple's mysterious self-driving car, this letter clearly shows that Apple is getting more serious about delivering something, perhaps sooner rather than later. \n\nSee Also : 10 Best High-Tech Cars on the Road in 2016 \nYour Guide to Apple CarPlay \nBest Gifts for Drivers: Guide You Can Now Get Android Auto in Any Car About the author Sam Rutherford @samrutherford Sam Rutherford is a staff writer at Tom's Guide who covers smartphones, car tech and cameras.

As smartwatches numbers declined, the larger wearable space is up overall all, thanks in no small part to the Charge manufacturer. \nAccording to IDC’s numbers, Fitbit commanded nearly a quarter of the entire category at 23-percent, a year-over-year increase of 22-percent, with total device shipment volumes bumping from 4.7 to 5.3 million for Q3. Those numbers are, unsurprisingly, primarily made up of the new devices, namely the Blaze, Alta, Flex 2 and Charge 2 – the latter of which is currently the top selling wearable here in the States. \nLow-cost Chinese hardware maker Xiaomi and GPS-turned-fitness-brand Garmin took the number two and three spots, while Apple dipped to fourth place, due to a pretty step decline of 71-percent, year over year. That number is thanks, in part, to the company’s decision to release the product late in the quarter, though it’s hard not to view the loss of market share as part of a larger trend . \nAfter all, in just the past week, rumors surfaced of Pebble getting swallowed up by Fitbit, while Motorola just up and admitted that it wasn’t moving enough Moto 360 units to justify a continued investment in the space moving forward. \nThe overall numbers don’t look great, though the delay of Android Wear 2.0, the late in year release of the Samsung Gear S3 and the relatively minor upgrades to the Apple Watch Series 2 could all be factors in a category that doesn’t have the same shine as it did when it first exploded on the scene. 0 ",

      "text": "HackerNews calls for “political detox,” critics cry censorship Posted Fitbit’s up and Apple’s down in IDC’s latest wearable market numbers \nCan social media even exist without political debate? What about trolls? HackerNews , the social news site run by Y Combinator, is trying to find out. \nThe head of the HackerNews community since 2014, Daniel Gackle (whose HN handle is “dang”) on Monday initiated a site-wide “Political Detox Week.” \nTo introduce the temporary ban on political content, Gackle wrote: \n“For one week, political stories are off-topic. Please flag them. Please also flag political threads on non-political stories. For our part, we’ll kill such stories and threads when we see them. Then we’ll watch together to see what happens. \nWhy? Political conflicts cause harm here. The values of Hacker News are intellectual curiosity and thoughtful conversation. Those things are lost when political emotions seize control. Our values are fragile—they’re like plants that get forgotten, then trampled and scorched in combat. HN is a garden, politics is war by other means, and war and gardening don’t mix.” \nWhen users sought more detail on what, precisely, would be defined as politics and blocked on HN this week, Gackle elaborated: \n“Pure politics: conflicts around party, ideology, nation, race, gender, class, and religion that get people hot and turn into flamewars on the internet. We’re not so concerned about stories on other things that happen to have political aspects—like, say, software patents.” \nThe post about the “detox” or “cleanse,” as Gackle called it, has drawn hundreds of comments on HackerNews since it posted this morning. \nMany users said this effort, even if well-intentioned, amounts to censorship. Many warned it would have the unwanted consequence of silencing the views and experiences of minority users including women and people of color who comment on the site. \nY Combinator CEO Sam Altman tells TechCrunch,”We don’t want to be the day to day US politics site. There are a lot of other places for that. And this just shuts down the lightning rod for a few days.” \nThe CEO also acknowledged that, as is happening on social networks like Twitter, Reddit and Facebook, bigots have infiltrated the HackerNews community of late. \nStill, every social network going back to Usenet in the 90s faces the same problem in abating trolls and maintaining a high level of discourse. Telling people they can’t do or say something online never seems to make things easier , or improve the quality of discussions , for the moderators of these online communities. \nWe’ll see how HackerNews fares. \nGackle wrote in an e-mail to TechCrunch to emphasize that the “detox” is just a one-week experiment, and he’s not sure what HackerNews will learn from it. \n“The idea came about because there has been an uptick in political flamewars and, worse, accounts that use the site exclusively to argue about politics and don’t appear interested in anything else. We already ban such accounts, but the trend in that direction made it seem like a good time to clarify what HN is and what it is not,” he wrote. \nWe asked Gackle specifically for his response to critics who believe his project will silence underrepresented people on HN, and is essentially a form of censorship. He said: “Words like ‘silence,’ ‘underrepresented,’ and ‘censorship,’ are highly charged, and people use them to mean a lot of things, even opposite things. So before trying to answer such a criticism, I’d want to make sure I understand, and for that it’s best to be talking to a specific user about their specific concerns, not arguing in a general debate.” HN has developed and integrated software that tries to detect patterns of abuse on its site, but hasn’t written anything specifically new for the Political Detox week or around political content. \nGackle had plenty more to say to HN users. You can read his comments here on a reverse chronological thread of his answers to their questions.",

      "text": "Cloud accounting firm Xero adds Apple Pay invoice payment option By Monday, December 05, 2016, 03:51 pm PT (06:51 pm ET) Starting Monday, subscribers of cloud-based accounting software firm Xero can offer their customers the option to view and pay off invoices using Apple Pay, streamlining and securing the often cumbersome payment resolution and reconciliation process. Xero, which currently boasts some 862,000 subscribers, is rolling out Apple Pay transactions in available markets through a strategic partnership with payments service Stripe. Small businesses using Apple Pay will see payments automatically logged and matched against Xero invoices in the cloud. With a low-friction user interface, the accounting service believes Apple Pay integration will help cut down on late invoice payments, an all too common problem for small businesses. Xero estimates more than 60 percent of the 15 million invoices its customers sent out globally within the past 30 days will be paid late. \"Attaching a payment option to online invoices helps Xero customers get paid almost 80 percent faster than invoices that don't use a payment service - so they spend less time chasing unpaid invoices for a more productive and cash healthy business,\" said Xero CTO Craig Walker. \"By enabling these connections with payment services, small businesses are able to offer multiple payment options on an invoice, giving them and their customers choice of payment and also the ability to pay the invoice as soon as it arrives, ensuring they get paid faster.\" In addition to quick payments turnaround, small businesses that opt to employ Apple Pay will benefit from the platform's built-in security features which decrease fraud and reduce the chance of chargebacks, the company said. Integration with Xero comes after Intuit added Apple Pay web payments to its QuickBooks Online service in October . After a U.S. launch in 2014, Apple Pay is slowly expanding beyond traditional banks and credit unions to include support for digital transactions. Apple recently enabled web-based payments in September , a feature made more useful with the inclusion of Touch ID in the new MacBook Pro lineup. Topics: ",

      "title": "HyperDrive Is A USB-C Hub For Your MacBook Pro",
      "text": "HyperDrive Is A USB-C Hub For Your MacBook Pro  28 PST \nOne of the controversial moves Apple made last year was by removing all of the ports on the 12-inch MacBook and replacing it with a single USB-C port. Thankfully for this year’s MacBook Pro , Apple decided to give us four USB-C ports which should make things a little bit easier, although not by much. \nIf you still own a ton of legacy accessories that still connect via traditional USB 3.0 ports, this can be a problem, but not to worry as a Kickstarter project for a device called the HyperDrive will fix that . The HyperDrive is essentially a USB-C hub for the MacBook Pro. It plugs into the side of your laptop and will take up both USB-C ports. \nHowever in return it will also provide users with access to other ports such as HDMI, USB 3.1 x 2, microSD/SD, as well as Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C for charging and plugging in other newer accessories. The HyperDrive is definitely not the first USB-C hub we’ve seen designed for the MacBook Pro, so you can think of it as being one of the options available out there if you are shopping about. \nJust like with other USB-C hubs, the HyperDrive is small and slim which makes it easy to be brought around when you need it. If you are interested in helping making the HyperDrive a reality, then you’ll want to pledge to its Kickstarter campaign.",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix December 5, 2016 | 04:33PM PT \nNetflix ’s iPhone app topped Apple ’s list of top-grossing apps for the first time Monday, surpassing not only mobile games like “Mobile Strike” and “Candy Crush Saga,” but also fellow subscription services like Spotify and Pandora. The news comes on the heels of Netflix adding mobile downloading capabilities to its iOS and Android apps . \nThe ascend in the top-grossing chart was fist noted by SensorTower, a company that tracks app performances across mobile app stores. “In addition to being the top app in the U.S., it also occupies the No. 1 grossing spot on iPhone in India, Mexico, and Colombia,” the company wrote in a blog post. \nNetflix’s app is free to download in the Apple App Store, but the company started to offer users the ability to pay for their monthly subscription fees via in-app subscription fees a little over a year ago . \nApple is charging publishers a 30 percent cut on any in-app fees, which has long been criticized by media services and game developers alike. In June, Apple announced that it was going to lower this fee to 15 percent for any user that stays subscribed for 12 months or longer. In addition, Apple is reportedly looking to lower its fees to 15 percent for any video app that joins its new programming guide for Apple TV. \nNetflix added the ability to download select programming to its mobile apps last week. To do so, the company tweaked its encoding schemes for mobile video , allowing users to download better-looking videos at equal or smaller file sizes.",

      "text": "iPhone battery replacement: Apple explains why your smartphone shuts down unexpectedly iPhone battery replacement: Apple explains why your smartphone shuts down unexpectedly Apple iPhone 6s device users have been facing continuous issues with the battery as their smartphones shut down unexpectedly even when there is some charge left. By: FE Online | Published: December 5, 2016 1:46 PM Apple has unveiled the exact reasons causing the issue with the iPhone 6s smartphones and the batteries, on its China website. (Reuters) \nApple iPhone 6s device users have been facing continuous issues with the battery as their smartphones shut down unexpectedly even when there is some charge left. Apple has unveiled the exact reasons causing the issue with the iPhone 6s smartphones and the batteries, on its China website. The company’s support page for China clarifies hat the battery parts of the iPhone was “exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs.” As a result, the batteries have started to degrade quicker than the normal phones which eventually lead to ‘unexpected shutdowns’. Apple has announced free battery replacement tools and programs for iPhone 6s users who are facing this problem. \nHowever, Apple in the note says that there is no safety issue regarding this. This comes as a relief for the consumers as well as Apple itself, as Samsung had to stop the production of Galaxy Note 7 after the recent exploding batteries issue. Apple has apologised for the ‘inconvenience this has caused customers’, and on the website said that users can get their batteries replaced. The battery issue affects iPhones which were manufactured between September 2015 to October 2015 and was first reported in China itself. Apple will replace the batteries globally and the offer is valid till 3 years since the sale of the first product. \nAlso read | Apple introduces new tool to check if your iPhone battery is eligible for replacement \nYou can check out a page set up by Apple, “apple.com/in/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/”, where you can find the details of the new program under which there is the new tool which can be explored if the iPhone you have qualifies for the replacement. The new tool by Apple enables the user to enter the serial number of the smartphone and check it their iPhone is eligible. In a previous post by 9to5Mac, it put out information about the serial numbers on the list. \nIf you have an iPhone 6S and wish to find the serial number, you need to go to Settings>General>About. Go down to the serial number option. Enter that serial number on the Apple Support page and you will know if your iPhone is eligible for replacement or repair. Make sure you delete all your data before giving the phone for repairing and shut down the ‘Find my iPhone’ option also. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "5 Uses for Apple Cider Vinegar My Grandmother Taught Me  //blogs.naturalnews.com/5-uses-apple-cider-vinegar-grandmother-taught/ \nBy davidtrounce \n 23pm EST \nWhen I was a boy I found a book in an old shop called, “The Apple Cider Vinegar way to Health”. It was written by an old doctor from Vermont or New England, I can’t remember where. \nI’ve not been able to find the book since I was a young man but remember reading it over and over again. I was enthralled by the many uses and health benefits that apple cider vinegar promised me. I remember telling anyone who would listen about the magical wonderful powers of this simple product. \nMy grandmother appeared to know all of this already. And I used to wonder, why didn’t you tell me? Why wasn’t she telling anyone about this wonderful simple medicine from the Earth? \nSo, in addition to the book, I also learnt a great deal many more things about apple cider vinegar from my grandmother \nI suppose she was a shy lady and it now falls upon me, in her honour, to present to you the top 10 uses for apple cider vinegar that my grandmother taught me. \nThese remedies have been tried and tested in our family for generations and I am now teaching my own children to discover the benefits of apple cider vinegar. Restoring Damaged Teeth \nApple cider vinegar has been known to remove plaque and tartar from your teeth. Perhaps more remarkable, is that the good doctor that taught me also had evidence that apple cider vinegar could restore damaged and rotten teeth to a near-new condition. \nOf course, this is not something that I ever expected to happen overnight but the thought of it is stunning. the good doctor suggested that most people would begin to see results at around the 3-month mark. \nThe rule of thumb suggested by most natural health practitioners is a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in 8 ounces or one glass of water twice daily. Getting Rid of Psoriasis \nPsoriasis is a horrible skin condition that tends to affect elbows, knees, scalp and ankles. \nThere are many products, mostly topical, that are on the market I have not seen anything work quite like apple cider vinegar. \nApple cider vinegar helps restore the pH balance of your body. This, in turn, has an effect on the skin as well as all of your organs in the body. \nA body in good health has a natural ph balance. Foods like red meat, potato chips and ice cream all create an acidic environment in the body. This acidic environment is what enables disease conditions to develop. \nIt may seem counterintuitive but apple cider vinegar, being and acid food, has the effect of increasing the body’s alkalinity. When this alkaline in balance is addressed the body naturally and readily begins to heal itself. Dealing with Dandruff \nMy grandmother knew that apple cider vinegar was a sure remedy for dandruff. Fast safer than prescription drugs and apple cider vinegar solution can restore the pH balance of the scalp and prevent the growth of the yeast-like fungus that is thought to produce dandruff. \nWhile it’s true that you might start smelling like a salad for a few days it seems like a far simpler solution thn pouring chemicals onto an already uncomfortable scalp. \nThe usual rule of thumb is to mix a quarter of a cup of apple cider vinegar with the same amount of water. One easy application is to put the mixture into a spray bottle. \nMy grandmother would instructors to wrap a towel around ahead and leave them next to him for about 15 minutes and then go and have a shower to wash it off we only needed to do this twice a week and dandruff would clear up very quickly. Losing Weight \nOK, I realise that this is a controversial issue. Diet and weight loss programs a billion dollar business and no billion dollar business wants to be told that the problem could possibly be solved with a 1-litre bottle of apple cider vinegar. \nNevertheless, there is some good science behind the reasoning when it comes to apple cider vinegar and weight loss. \nIt is said that the acid in apples, and especially apple cider vinegar, helps with the digestion of which proteins. These proteins are the building blocks for many of our hormones. In particular, the growth hormones. These growth hormones are said to be especially important in breaking down fat cells. \nThe conclusion that many have drawn is that the apple cider vinegar is breaking down the food more efficiently by creating the acidic environment in the stomach necessary for good digestion. That good digestion leads to better metabolism and improved absorption of nutrients. \nFor that reason, many people who swear are having a glass of water with a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar before breakfast and the evening meal. Lowering Cholesterol \nThat’s a big claim, isn’t it? But, it’s one that has been substantiated many times over. \nYou are one of the leading causes of death. We know about some of the factors that increase or decrease the risk of heart disease. A number of studies have shown that the regular use of apple cider vinegar may reduce some of these risk factors. \nApple cider vinegar contains the antioxidant chlorogenic acid. it is believed that this acid has been shown to protect LDL cholesterol particles from becoming oxidized, a significant factor in the development of heart disease. \nAre you ready to give apple cider vinegar I go? \nI am sure that you can find a dozen more uses for apple cider vinegar. Everything from cleaning chewing gum off your shoes to making your hair shiny. All I can do is encourage you to study and learn from the past if such simple remedies exist for such troubling and debilitating illness isn’t it worth investigation? \nI think so. \nDisclaimer: These home remedies are not medical advice, nor should they be construed as a prescription for any ailment. These are folklore remedies past down through generations. If you have a problem, go see your Doctor (He may be able to tell you where you can pick up some good quality Apple Cider Vinegar).",

      "text": "Reddit \nAs we head into the holiday season, Apple is continuing to push its latest iPhone 7 lineup. This evening, the company shared a new advertisement highlighting the dual-camera capabilities of the iPhone 7 Plus and its real-world applications. \nThe ad starts by showing a professionally shot clip of kids reenacting Romeo and Juliet. The video then cuts away to show that what we’re actually seeing is a school production of the play with a parent proudly video taping their child in the play. \nThe parent is using an iPhone 7 Plus to record the play and is seen using the zoom capability of the built-in Camera app to get a closer shot of the scene. \nApple closes the ad with a pair of tag lines. First, the company touts that “Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7,” implying that the iPhone 7 Plus is capable of studio-like camera capabilities. Apple closes the ad completely, however, with the “practically magic’ tagline that it has used for the iPhone 7 in the past. \nThe new ad comes following Apple’s annual holiday ad , which this year was called “Frankie’s Holiday” and showed an iPhone-toting Frankenstein. This was notable because Apple’s holiday ad has traditionally focused on a wide array of its products, not just an iPhone. \nToday’s new ad can be seen below. Let us know what you think of it in the comments.",

      "text": "Apple Finally Admits it's Working on Autonomous Cars / Home / News / Rumors A lot of things happened on November 22, 2016, but a mysterious letter from Apple to the NHTSA recently became the hottest topic of discussion among driverless cars nerds around the planet. In the official letter sent to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, Apple discussed many topics, but the biggest news was the fact that it's “ excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation .” For most car pundits out there, that phrase signaled that Apple is finally admitting its focus on making an autonomous car at some point. The rumors surrounding the so-called “Project Titan” have been swirling for years, and the Cupertino giant added fuel to the fire by buying the apple.car, apple.auto and apple.cars domain names at the beginning of 2016. Since then, there has been news about Apple patenting an articulated steering system for tracked vehicles, about the Project Titan being demoted to self-driving software and/or about the project itself being pushed back to at least 2020 . Nothing is certain as of yet, but the NHTSA letter sure does a lot of that “pour fuel over a fire,” especially because of some of its content. It was written by Steve Kenner, who is the director of product integrity and, among other things, it also urges the U.S. regulator not to go full throttle on establishing new rules on autonomous car testing in the real world. The bit that reeks most of Apple is the proposal to somehow make companies working on this type of technology share date from crashes and near-crashes so that everyone could benefit and create safer systems from the get-go. The letter also tackles personal privacy concerns, adding that both the industry and the NHTSA should “ address privacy challenges associated with the collection, use, and sharing of automated vehicles data ,” using advice and collaboration from privacy experts that aren't necessarily linked to the automotive industry. You can take whatever you want out of these snippets of information, but we have a strong feeling that Apple won't be making a fully autonomous car anytime soon, now will anyone else for that matter. That said, they are definitely working on something related to this subject. The dawn of self-driving cars is near, but it's not yet here, though. apple car Apple autonomous driverless cars autonomous cars NHTSA ICAR",

      "text": "As part of its App Store policy, Apple can choose to give refunds to customers who are unsatisfied with an app they download. It’s a good, common-sense move, and a valuable tool for anyone who’s ever read a description, downloaded the app, and then wondered if they’re even using the same piece of software. But according to some developers, customers are abusing the refund policy to get free games, and Apple is turning a blind eye to the practice.\n\nDON’T MISS:  Galaxy Note 7 fires were caused by over-ambitious design, engineers find \nA report in the  The Korea Times  details how a communication failure between Apple and the developers lets people get away with free stuff:\n\n“Apple holds full control in paying refunds on paid for mobile content such as games. It determines whether to give refunds to consumers.\nBut the content developer cannot take part in the process under Apple’s refund policy. Apple does not even provide information about the users who have requested and received the refund, claiming it is to protect consumer rights. For this reason, the developers have no other choice but to manually track down the users and check if they continue to use the charged content they have already received refunds for.\nOn the backdrop of this, some users have abused the loophole in Apple’s refund policy to purchase charged content multiple times, request refunds and continue to consume the content without actually paying for it. In particular, some of the abusers have organized profitable businesses to operate the refund process on others’ behalf. “\nIf the game studios alleging abuse of Apple’s policies are right, this is a serious problem. Limited cases of abuse are one thing that Apple can be expected to slowly deal with; setting up businesses to get free stuff out of the App Store is a much more major short-term problem.\nFour Korean game studios told  The Korea Times  that they’ve started cross-checking data to work out users who are repeatedly requesting refunds, and have moved to block them. But with no help from Apple, it’s a long and difficult struggle for the developers. That adds to the costs of trying to make money from the App Store, and while the plight of a couple developers probably doesn’t move you, the long-term damage it could do to Apple’s vital dev community is genuinely serious.\nTrending right now: \nGet ready for a limited NES Classic Edition sale tomorrow morning Samsung may adopt a beloved iPhone 7 feature for the Galaxy S8, and it’s not the camera Watch the new SNL sketch that had Donald Trump fuming on Twitter See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe Apple Watch may be the most successful smartwatch ever, but even that may not be enough to captivate the hearts of consumers, at least according to a recent report. While the Apple Watch continued to be the best-selling smartwatch, sales are predicted to be down 71 percent in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 , according to market research firm International Data Corporation. In raw numbers, those sales sit at 1.1 million for the quarter. \nThe reason for that is that the wearable market seems to continue to be dominated by cheaper fitness trackers from the likes of Fitbit, Xiaomi, and other companies. The news is especially problematic for Apple considering the fact that the third quarter of 2016 is the quarter that the company launched the Apple Watch Series 2. \nMore: No phone necessary: Runkeeper’s app now uses Apple Watch’s built-in GPS \nIt’s important to note that it is possible that many Apple Watch customers were waiting for the new Series 2 model to be released and could not get their hands on it until the fourth quarter due to stock issues but whatever the reason, 70 percent is not good news for Apple. It’s also possible that many didn’t see the Apple Watch Series 2 as enough of an upgrade —the device keeps the same design and really only adds GPS and waterproofing as far as new features go. \nIt’s also important to note that these figures, at least for now, are just estimates. Apple doesn’t officially report Apple Watch sales numbers, so for now, all we have are estimates. The way Apple does report sales to investors is through an “Other Products” business category, which includes the Watch, iPods, Beats headphones, and more. \nApple is likely hoping that the upcoming holiday season will bring in big sales, however, if this report is any indication Apple could have a serious issue on its hands. Or, erm, wrists. Also watch:",

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., left, is seen in a car with comedian James Corden during an event in San Francisco in September. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) \nApple's courteous, albeit bland, letter to federal regulators weighing in on preliminary guidelines for development and testing of self-driving cars has again ginned up excitement and speculation about its eventual entry into the automotive space, yet revealed nothing about actual plans to do so. As CEO Tim Cook put it, it's still Christmas Eve . \nThe letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, confirms what was already known: the company has a program to develop automated driving systems. Should Apple want to run road tests of its self-driving technology, Kenner's letter emphasizes that official policies shouldn't discriminate against companies that haven't previously participated in the auto market or that intend to sell vehicles. \nAs currently written, proposed U.S. guidelines don't clarify whether test vehicles that may not be intended for retail sale can receive an exemption to operate on public roads without a lengthy approval process, according to Kenner's letter. Apple wants explicit wording in the new rules that would do that for driverless \"internal development vehicles.\" \n\"To maximize the safety benefits of automated vehicles, encourage innovation and promote fair competition, established automakers and new entrants should be treated equally,\" Kenner said. The exemption sought would allow Apple, which has no history of building cars, to avoid having to go through a lengthy approval process for every step in the development of test vehicles. \nApple's commentary on nascent U.S. policy, and the disclosure in the letter that it's \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\" is it's clearest statement to date that it does have an automotive program. Yet the company is clearly not ready to discuss whether it envisions being a provider of software and tech for robotic vehicles or perhaps someday will even build and sell them. \nOver the past year, there's been little more to go on beyond rumors, speculation and personnel changes about Apple's car plans. At the start of 2016, Vice President of Design Steve Zadesky, a former Ford engineer who'd apparently led Apple's car program from its inception in 2014, reportedly left that role. In July, the Wall Street Journal said Apple tapped engineer Bob Mansfield to take over. The company was rumored to be in talks with a number of automotive engineering firms for months, and the Financial Times reported in September the company was poised to buy supercar maker McLaren, presumably to get access to its engineering group. So far, that hasn't happened. \nIn October, reports surfaced that Apple had cut \"hundreds\" of engineering and software jobs on its auto team, and was on the fence about the project's fate. \nRival Google , which ignited the race to develop driverless vehicles more than six years ago, hasn't laid out its strategy to bring the technology to market, though it's clear that it has one. The company's hiring of long-time automotive executive *John Krafcik in September 2015 was a clear signal it intended to create a business around the technology, and company officials have indicated that the team is spinning off from Alphabet's X skunkworks to soon become a stand-alone unit. \nMeanwhile, Elon Musk's Tesla , Ford, General Motors, rideshare firms Uber and Left, Volvo, BMW and a host of tech and automotive suppliers are racing to get driverless technology to market as soon as it can be validated for reliable real-world use. \nApple's circumspect public comments indicate the company is keeping its options open, while committing to nothing. At a February shareholder meeting in Cupertino, California, Cook responded to a question about Apple’s car program as follows: \"Do you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren't sure what was going to be downstairs? Well, it's going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\" \nTen months later, there’s still no sign of Santa. \n(*The author worked for Krafcik for a year, before he joined Google.) ",

      "text": "View Comments Despite the release of a zippy new model, the Apple Watch may be doomed for tepid sales, based on new data. Eight-five percent of the wearable technology market is comprised of \"basic\" devices that don't run third-party apps, according to quarterly data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). Simple wearables saw double-digit growth during the third quarter, IDC said, but when smartwatches were added to the mix, the market grew only 3.1 percent from a year ago. That was bad news for Apple, who saw wearable shipments fall 71 percent year-over-year in the quarter, to 1.1 million units. Apple does not break out its Apple Watch sales. Eight-five percent of the wearable technology market is comprised of \"basic\" devices that don't run third-party apps, according to quarterly data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). Simple wearables saw double-digit growth during the third quarter, IDC said, but when smartwatches were added to the mix, the market grew only 3.1 percent from a year ago. That was bad news for Apple, who saw wearable shipments fall 71 percent year-over-year in the quarter, to 1.1 million units. Apple does not break out its Apple Watch sales. The results are somewhat expected, since the release of the company's highly-anticipated Apple Watch Series 2 was near the end of the quarter, and consumers may have waited to make their purchase. But the trend toward simpler wearables may not bode well for Apple's new device headed into the holiday season, IDC said. \"The primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface,\" IDC said. \"Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.\" Apple was the only major wearable vendor to see a decline in growth, bested by Samsung, Fitbit, China's Xiaomi and Garmin, according to IDC. But that doesn't mean others have unlocked the market, either. Xiaomi's market share eroded as it failed to make inroads outside of China. Fitbit, meanwhile, has seen its shares fall 45 percent over the past 6 months, after giving fourth-quarter guidance that was well below estimates. Samsung's share of wearables was also boosted by one-time bundling it with its phones. Fans of the Apple Watch, like former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée, have said that Apple's playing the long game, continuously improving an aspirational product. Still, while Apple has focused on upgrading its technology — adding a brighter display, dual-core processor and water resistance — it doesn't have many lower-end options for impulse buyers, IDC notes. \"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst at IDC said in a statement. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\" -CNBC",

      "text": "Leave a comment \nAfter much speculation , Apple has acknowledged for the first time that it is investing in autonomous car technology. \nThe tech giant wrote a letter to US transport regulators , in which it said the company was \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation\". \nThe five-page letter, penned by Apple's director of product integrity Steve Kenner, was sent in response to the proposed Federal Automated Vehicles Policy – something Apple believes \"will be fundamental to ensuring the safety and public acceptance of automated vehicles while providing a flexible path for innovation\". \nThe company registered a number of car-related web domains earlier this year, but hasn't previously stated that it is working on a self-driving car itself. \nApple has now asked that \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally\" when it comes to the imposition of new testing regulations for the vehicles. \nThe letter also proposes that all companies in the industry club together to share data from crashes in order to build a more comprehensive picture – but adds that an individual's privacy should not be compromised by this. \n\"Data sharing should not come at the cost of privacy,\" it states. \"Apple believes that companies should invest the resources necessary to protect individuals' fundamental right to privacy.\" \nApple was first rumoured to be working on an autonomous vehicle in early 2015, when reports suggested that the company already had 600 employees working on an electric car design. \nLater that year, more rumours suggested that the company hoped to launch an electric car to the public by 2019 . \nApple has not confirmed or denied its move into the automotive industry. But in 2014, CEO Tim Cook revealed that \"there are products [Apple] are working on that no one knows about\". \nHis argument was backed by the US Department of Transportation, which earlier this year unveiled its plans to eradicate road accidents by increasing the number of autonomous vehicles . \nHowever, the technology is still being refined. An accident report recently revealed that one of Google's self-driving vehicles had collided with a public bus in Mountain View, California – soon after it became the first non-human to be recognised as a driver in the US .

      "text": "Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphone - Black ‹ See It » Pros: “W1 chip, 40+ hours of battery life, portable, understated design, best-in-class comfort and isolation for an on-ear headphone, fun sound signature” Cons: By MICHAELSD Pros: W1 chip, 40+ hours of battery life, portable, understated design, best-in-class comfort and isolation for an on-ear headphone, fun sound signature Cons: Lack of clarity in the highs, bass bleeds into lower mids at times, low-end could be more detailed \nApple is really doing it: they're taking a brand that has the dominant marketshare in the headphone marketplace despite having had subpar audio quality, and greatly improving it while adding groundbreaking features that will take the competition a year or two to catch up with. It's a bit of a genius proposition: purchase the most popular headphone brand that people buy solely for the branding and marketing despite abysmal audio quality, then rebrand it so that consumers are actually getting a quality product with innovative features. The Solo3 is a solid buy for most, even if its audio presentation isn't perfect. Design Appearance The matte black Solo3 I'm auditioning is classy and understated. They're stylish without screaming \"Beats\" in a gaudy way like they did in the past. Unfortunately though, the two glossy options do cheapen the design. The rest of the options, particularly rose gold, are tastefully done. Build quality Despite being lightweight, the Solo3 manages to feel substantial. There is no flexing, and the headband seems reasonably reinforced. The earcups do rattle, but they also swivel for a better fit so it's a fair trade-off. Comfort/fit Plush leather earpads make the Solo3 more comfortable than anticipated, while also being softer than expected making the Solo3 feel more like a cushion pressed against the ears. Very surprisingly they're the most comfortable pair of headphones I own, even more so than the huge ATH-700 with its velour pads. Perfect for glasses wearers as the earpads can be adjusted in a manner that's completely unaffected by frames. The headband is also soft and grippy enough that the Solo3 will stay in place no matter what. For the purpose of this review I can shake my head in any direction and the headband won't move, which makes it reassuring for use at the gym or for a run. They're a rare combination of being on-ear, comfortable, and fixed on the head. My ears can tend to get red and burn a bit after having these on for a while, but the pain is mostly felt after the fact and I'm working on adjusting the fit to prevent this. On the plus side, I can wear these longer than my other headphones with less pain. Isolation is excellent as well considering there is no active noise cancellation. (I dislike ANC anyway as it can muck up the sound and waste battery life.) At around 60-70% volume the outside world can be mostly blocked out, at least enough so that speech is completely inaudible. Bonus: even the driver (the part that emits sound) is padded better than I've ever seen, if you have extremely small ears then you're in for a treat. They really thought over the comfort design of these headphones. Packaging Premium Apple unboxing experience reminiscent of any other Apple product, with a bit more flair. The single complaint I have is that the included carrying case could be a tad more padded and premium. Sound Beats' Sound Signature This is where the review gets a little less glowing, though bear with me. I'm an audiophile, I've studied to a greater extent than I'd care to admit what makes for good sound. These aren't the type of headphones where a listener is going to hear every little detail in a song, but that's okay for listeners who haven't owned a better pair of headphones before; for better or worse, the mass market may not notice the flaws in the Solo3's sound. The sound signature is a colored Beats presentation with a massive low-end accentuation, forward mids, and a very laid-back treble. But you know what? Apple's Beats sound signature is exciting, fun, and sounds good with most modern music. Mids are nicely present, so voices and guitars will still be front-and-center alongside the bass. Some songs do sound off, and no amount of EQ is going to fix those that do. Nowhere else are you going to find such an accentuated bass with forward mids, but the faults are glaring: Issues The problem is the bass and and treble aren't accurate. Not even the bass is going to sound as it was intended to by the sound producer, and some drums have a bloated if not addictive-at-times sound that makes drum kits lose their detail. If you're going to be listening to music with mostly real instruments and no modern production, the Solo3 may not be the best option. However, the bass is mostly fine though it is accentuated and loses a bit of detail in the process. The low-end also bleeds into the mids a bit too much, which causes some details like a guitar in the background to potentially be lost. What needs finer tuning is the treble. Cymbals that have a fine detail on a pair of better-tuned headphones can be reduced to sounding more like a hip-hop \"ticking\" sound. The treble is frankly abysmal. I don't mind it being so laid-back but good treble needs to retain its detail. There is a positive to having such a lacking treble, and that is that there's less listening fatigue. Perhaps Beats was looking out for its customers who listen to these loudly, as the lack of higher frequencies make it possible to listen to these loudly longer. Bottom-line HEY, TIM, APPLE, DR. DRE, AND JIMMY IOVINE: THE SOLO SERIES COULD SOUND FANTASTIC IF YOU FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RETAIN THE BEATS SOUND SIGNATURE (ACCENTUATED LOW-END) WHILE STILL HAVING A DETAILED BASS AND TREBLE. KEEP THE TREBLE LOWER THAN THE OTHER FREQUENCIES, BUT ACTUALLY MAKE CYMBALS SOUND LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO. These aren't for analytical listening, but for enjoyment they work well with most songs and genres. While most songs aren't going to sound exactly as they were intended, I'd recommend auditioning these yourself to see if it suits your personal music taste if you do listen to modern music (pop, hip-hop, EDM) alongside a mix of other genres. W1, baby Wireless Connectivity Works as well (better in my book since there's no cable noise... or wire) as using a wired headphone with an iPhone. Pairs instantly out-of-the-box. Pressing the button on the Solo3 while it's unpaired will connect it to a modern iPhone/iPad seamlessly within two seconds. 2012 Retina MacBook Pro is a bit more hit-and-miss as it can tend not to show up as an immediately connectable option, though I'll look into that. Rock-solid connection though. I can move to another room and experience no cutting out. I was also able to watch an episode of Halt and Catch Fire with no lag and perfectly in-sync audio. Side note: The Solo3 are excellent for watching movies/TV; the soundstage is precise, and not too wide or closed-in, so it provides a great surround experience that brings background details to the surface as well or better than my open-back Audio Technica ATH-700. Meanwhile the accentuated bass brings a subwoofer-like excitement to movies while voices are crystal-clear. Wireless Quality Apple worked some DAC magic into the Solo3 as they sound as good or better than they do using a wired connection. Oddly enough, I do find an extra bit of clarity using them with an iPhone 6s Plus than I do using them with a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro; it seems they both use AAC to transmit to the Solo3 but the iPhone's Bluetooth is 4.2 vs 4.0. However's there no need for ever using them wired: Battery Life It lasts as long as advertised. 40+ hours of battery plus ultra-quick charging. Conclusion Apple has managed to create the first practical wireless headphone on the market, lasting long enough to only need to be charged under a handful of times a month while also having best-in-class wireless functionality. All in an understated lightweight design that's portable enough to go anywhere and comfortable enough to wear for long periods. They put it under the Beats branding, which means a fun sound that lacks clarity particularly in the high-end. However, the Solo3 is the first very good headphone from Beats (with the first two good headphones being the Solo2 and the Studio 2.0). This gives me hope for the future of where Apple will take Beats, as they're already proving their worth and the future of the brand by releasing a headphone with groundbreaking features. If the Solo4 can greatly improve upon the detail of the sound quality while retaining Beats' signature fun sound, it could be an all-around winner. For now the Solo3 gets my recommendation for being a very practical daily driver wireless headphone. There aren't any other wireless headphones I'd recommend more as a daily driver, thanks mostly to the benefits of the W1 chip and portable design. Audiophiles: The sound signature of the Solo3 is unique and pleasant despite lacking clarity in the bass and treble, though it isn't isn't an unlistenable experience like the old Beats by Dre. If you find value in the features of the Solo3, these could be a fun portable pair of headphones perfect for casual listening or the gym. Would I have bought the Solo3 if they were wired headphones? No. But the trade-off of some clarity is worth it for what the Solo3 does bring to the table, and the fun sound isn't unpleasant. In fact, I'm growing to like it and would be completely satisfied if they figure out a way to improve clarity without losing the addictive sound signature in future iterations.",

      "text": "Apple's 'Romeo and Juliet' ad puts iPhone 7 Plus camera in focus By Monday, December 05, 2016, 06:01 pm PT (09:01 pm ET) Apple on Monday released its latest iPhone ad, a touching 30-second short highlighting the dual-camera system introduced with iPhone 7 Plus. The spot, titled \"Romeo and Juliet,\" plays on Act II Scene II of Shakespeare's masterwork. Known colloquially as the balcony scene, Capulet's Orchard is unquestionably one of the most famous scenes in all of theater. In Apple's take, all roles are played by children. The ad leads with a cinematic shot: exterior, nighttime, Capulet's estate. Inside, Juliet is alerted to Romeo's presence. She rushes to the balcony, \"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\" Apple's version skips a few lines, moving straight into Romeo's response, \"Call me but love.\" Interestingly, Romeo glosses over the \"and I'll be new baptized\" line. Cut to a contrasting shot of a teary-eyed man holding an iPhone 7 Plus. Instead of a movie version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" starring a cast of kids, we realize the reenactment is merely a school play as seen through the eyes of Juliet's father, who is in the audience filming. With proper cinematography giving way to an amateur recording, Apple implies iPhone 7 Plus offers users unrivaled camera quality to capture the most special of moments. Indeed, the ad ends with the tagline \"Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7.\" \"Romeo and Juliet\" is the latest in Apple's \"practically magic\" commercial series which started with the ad \"Balloons\" in September . Like most consumer companies, Apple is getting into the Christmas spirit. Like holiday themed TV spots of yore, today's ad tugs on the heartstrings, much like last month's ad \" Frankie's Holiday .\" Topics:",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nApple has been pushing out iOS betas at a pretty fierce pace lately. It released iOS 10.2 beta 4 on November 28 , followed by beta 5 a few days later on December 2. Today, it's already rolling out another new preview release. \niOS 10.2 beta 6 ( build 14C90/14C91 ) is now available, both for developers and those on the Public Beta program . The final version of iOS 10.2 is likely to be released for all non-beta users later this month. \nThe newest version of Apple's mobile OS will bring various new features, including the company's TV hub app, dozens of additional emoji, and a new Emergency SOS feature that will call 911 (or your country's equivalent emergency services number) if you push the power/wake button five times in a row. It will also bring other minor tweaks, such as the option to preserve camera settings, along with various bug fixes and stability improvements. \nMeanwhile, Apple has also released macOS 10.12.1 beta 5, bumping the build number up to 16C60b, following the fourth beta's arrival last month . Unlike the latest iOS beta, the new macOS release is exclusively for devs. \nAnd finally, developers can also get their hands on watchOS 3.1.1 beta 5. As its version number suggests, that update will be a minor one, focusing on bug fixes. Like iOS 10.2, the final versions of the macOS and watchOS updates are expected to be released to the public before the year's end. Tags",

      "text": "Apple Releases New ‘Romeo and Juliet’ Ad Highlighting iPhone 7’s Camera Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Dec 06, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nApple today shared a new ad titled ”Romeo and Juliet” to highlight the camera capabilities of the iPhone 7 Plus. \nThe 30-second ad shows two kids acting out Romeo and Juliet’s love story in a movie-like setting which turns out to be a stage act, with their father capturing the whole thing using the iPhone 7 Plus. Using the 2x optical zoom on the handset, the father is able to zoom in on her daughter’s face to be able to better capture her expressions. \nThe ad ends with the tag line “Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7” followed by “practically magic”. \nThe dual 12MP shooter on the iPhone 7 Plus has been consistently highlighted by Apple in its various ads. Not only does the primary 12MP shooter offers better performance thanks to a wider aperture and improved camera sensor, the inclusion of a secondary telephoto lens allows the iPhone 7 Plus to offer 2x optical zoom without any severe loss in image quality. The smaller iPhone 7 only features a single 12MP shooter so it does not offer similar camera features as its larger sibling. \nHow impressed have you been with the dual 12MP shooter of the iPhone 7 Plus so far?

Enlarge Image Photo by Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nBecoming a star means everything to your children. \nHow else are they going to make any money when robots do almost everything else? \nMoreover, being a star allows you to say anything you want to anyone you want. Just ask Kanye. \nApple believes it has now developed the perfect way for you to begin your child's ascent to movie stardom. It's called the iPhone 7 Plus. \nI know this because Cupertino has just released an ad that suggests this phone's video camera is just as good as anything they use in Hollywood. \nWe think, indeed, we're watching a movie. For some reason, the director has cast children to play Romeo and Juliet. Yes, little children, rather than the usual teeny starlets. This is art? This is the man who directed \" Bugsy Malone \"? \nIt turns out that the director is a mere parent. One of those frightfully annoying parents that hold their phones up all through the school play. For that's all this is. \nBut then the message from Apple: \"Your movies look like movies.\" More Technically Incorrect ",

      "text": "0 An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., December 5, 2016. Reuters/Brendan McDermid \nApple is nearly ready with its iOS 10.2 update and will release it soon. No iOS 10 jailbreak tool has been made public yet. Apple has already released the fifth developer version of the iOS 10.2 beta and those who participated in the beta test program, will be able to download the latest firmware update. Once Apple is happy with the results, it will make the firmware available to all. \nHowever, popular jailbreaker Luca Todesco has warned other jailbreakers to stay away from Apple’s latest update. Updating to the newest firmware may seem lucrative to many as they believe updating would make their device safe and secure. Todesco has asked users to stick to iOS 10.1.1 as the latest firmware update will patch a lot of bugs and may make iOS 10 jailbreak impossible. \nUpdating to the newest version of iOS 10 will plug all the loopholes in the present iteration. Todesco believes that anyone who has jailbroken the current version, must stick to that and not update. But the fact is that there is still no jailbreak too for iOS 10 and that’s why Todesco feels users to stick to the current version as it is still possible to produce an iOS 10 jailbreak tool with it. Updating may ruin everything. \nPopular Chinese hacking group Pangu has hinted at an iOS 10 jailbreak tool they will release soon. However, no such tool has made an appearance. Now, with the introduction of iOS 10.2, it is now or never for Pangu as Apple is confident that its iOS 10 operating system is unbreakable. This means with every update, Apple is strengthening its OS. \nApple is immensely strategic and methodical when it comes to dealing with bugs in its OS. It is now offering a fat reward for anyone who can find bugs in its operating system. As per the risk of level of the bug, Apple’s bug bounty program offers up to US$100,000 (AU$134,000) to a bounty hunter who can uncover a bug. \nIt is advisable for the general user to update to the latest firmware update once released as their beloved mobile device will be protected from security threats. As far as the iOS 10 jailbreak tool is concerned, Pangu may release one during Christmas though nothing has been confirmed by the hacking team.",

      "text": "0 A man looks at a McLaren F-1 LM-Specification car is displayed at Sotheby's in New York June 3, 2015. Reuters/Bendan McDermid \nApple, most popularly known for its smartphones, laptops, and other electronic devices, has been rumored to be joining the car-making industry with its first self-driving car to be released in 2019. While Apple was silent regarding the issue, there were hints that it would be producing a self-driving car in the very near future. \nEarlier this year, talks about a huge project dubbed Project Titan circulated among Apple fans. The said project was kept a secret, although information was leaked about the company’s car-making division. There were talks about Apple initiating talks with designers of automated cars as well as the company that makes the F1 cars. \nThese hints were further considered close to the truth when Steve Kenner, product integrity director of Apple, sent a letter to the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy regarding rules that would be applied to autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, the letter talked about how excited the company was in the potential of automated systems, including transportation. Apple pointed out the social benefits that mankind would derive from self-driving cars and how these would be able to enhance human driving experience \nIn the five-page letter , Apple stated that it was hoping that both new entrants and existing automated car manufacturers would be given the same opportunities in using public roads for the testing of such vehicles. \nIt was speculated that Apple would not have wasted time writing this letter if it has no vested interests in car-making. The content of the letter seemed an admission that the rumours about a new car being conceived by Apple were true. \nIt was believed that an Apple automated car that looks like a minivan would ply most roads in Washington and around the world in 2019. Apple fans in Australia as well are waiting for this car to become reality.",

      "text": " 46pm EST Apple   Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks about the Apple Watch during an Apple event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 9, 2014. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo By Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO \n  \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \n(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)     \nNEW YORK Union mechanics at United Continental Holdings Inc on Monday ratified a six-year joint collective bargaining agreement with the airline, marking the end to several years of contract talks between the two parties.

      "text": "Apple Watch 2 sales are down 71% compared to original   7:19   \nThe smartwatch market was expected to truly boom with the launch of the Apple Watch but so far, things haven’t exploded in the way analysts had predicted. In fact, it turns out that Apple Watch Series 2 sales are down by 71 percent compared to the original Apple Watch last year. However, simpler solutions like the Fitbit are still doing quite well. \nIn September, Apple unveiled the Watch Series 2, but third-quarter sales are estimated to be 71 percent lower compared to the same quarter last year, according to IDC. This means Apple would have shipped around 1.1 million units in the last three months or so. \nHowever, it’s not all doom and gloom for the wearables market as simple and more importantly, low-cost, solutions are still doing well. In comparison to Apple’s 1.1 million units, Fitbit has managed to shift 5.3 million devices during Quarter 3 this year, with Xiaomi sitting at 3.8 million units sold. \nKitGuru Says: It seems that people are more interested in cheaper wearables that do one job, rather than full-blown smartwatches that try to cram a smartphone onto your wrist. It will be interesting to see if that dynamic changes at all in the next year or two, especially with Android Wear 2 set to launch in 2017. How do you guys feel about smartwatches? Do you think they will eventually be popular?",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks about the Apple Watch during an Apple event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, …\nBy Julia Love\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.\nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high.\n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote.\n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said.\nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \n\n(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

      "text": "Technology News | Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 4:46am GMT Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Apple's Cook Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks about the Apple Watch during an Apple event at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 9, 2014. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo By Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO \nSAN FRANCISCO Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV. \n(Reporting by Julia Love; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Next In Technology News Delaware Court revives case over Pincus's Zynga stock sale \nWILMINGTON, Del.

      "text": "Market News | Mon Dec 5, 2016 | 11:42pm EST Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Apple's Cook By Julia Love | SAN FRANCISCO \nSAN FRANCISCO Dec 5 Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters. \nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high. \n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote. \n\"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said. \nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget. \nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an \"other products\" category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV.

      "text": "San Francisco: Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.\nResponding to an email from Reuters, Cook said the gadget's sell-through — a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves — reached a new high.\n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook wrote.\n \"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" he said.\nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC estimating that the tech giant sold 1.1 million units of the Apple Watch during the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from the year-ago quarter. The comments offer a glimpse of the gadget's performance during the holiday quarter, which is typically Apple's strongest. \nThe CEO did not immediately respond to a request for specific sales figures for the gadget.\nApple has disclosed few details about the performance of the Apple Watch, its first new product released under Cook. The company has not broken out sales of the gadget in its earnings, instead lumping it into an “other products” category that includes devices such as the iPod and Apple TV.",
