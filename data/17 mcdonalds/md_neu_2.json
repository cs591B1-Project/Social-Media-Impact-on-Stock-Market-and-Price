(AP) — A Connecticut couple is facing charges after police say they engaged in sexual activity in a parked car with a 6-year-old boy in the back seat. \nPolice in Orange say two McDonald's employees were leaving the restaurant on Nov. 15 when they spotted two people engaged in sexual activity in the front seats of a car. They say the child was in the back seat, awake and alert. \nPolice say they arrived to find 28-year-old Kimberly Onorato partially undressed. Police say Onorato and 27-year-old Rory Clark stated they had only been cuddling. \nClark and Onorato are both charged with impairing morals of a minor and breach of peace. Online court records don't list lawyers for the pair. \nThe child was turned over to a relative. Police also contacted child welfare authorities. Tags",

      "text": "Court Dude : 'Got hit by an uninsured driver in July 2016, 'totalled my car and hers.'Was out of work for four months, immobile, bedridden, 'disability only pays 60% of your pay, BTW.In my case 60% barely covered the mortgage and electric. Everything is now a few months behind.My right foot is still broken five months later.I'll be under a doctor's care through at least July 2017.Insurance doesn't settle or pay up until you are released from the doctor's care.That means in my case I won't even collect a dime from my insurance until over a year after the accident, then they can go after the uninsured driver who in her case is destitute with tens of thousands in medical bills and confined to a wheelchair, without job or vehicle.I hope the 'crazy woman' had insurance with far in excess of the minimum because in Virginia you only need $25K USD for injuries and $25K USD for vehicle damage per incident. She wrecked seventeen vehicles in a single incident.Her insurance isn't going to be paying much. 'She'll be paying for years.And me--I'll be 'broke' for the next foreseeable year as I try to bring all of my accounts back current, while still in an air pressure cast.I'm leaning towards us needing to have a death penalty for uninsured motorists; their act of driving while uninsured seems to be the ultimate 'eff you' being given to every single person on the road around them. In Florida you aren't even required to carry Boduly Injury. To tag your car you only have to have PIP and 10k property damage. You may as well not even be insured with regards to the other party if you wreck someone else. Its pretty farked up.",

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nMcDonald's had a nice 3rd quarter in terms of earnings per share, but net income and revenues did not deliver. \nStock buybacks have allowed the firm to show more value to shareholders whilst the business remains stagnant despite sales jumps. \nFurther attempts to bring in more customers will have to be evaluated at a later date in terms of their success rates. \nRight now the negative revenue forecast implies that earnings will get tighter for the firm, especially if they increase staff to carry out their plans for table delivery etc. The earnings surprise isn't that exciting McDonald's investors (NYSE: MCD ) are celebrating a Trump victory that will usher in an administration far more friendly to businesses . A Republican government may do its part in avoiding things like the Golden Arch being liable for independent contractor violations or in voiding the penalties faced to employers under the Obamacare mandates. These sorts of measures still don't fix the biggest problem facing McDonald's: It's not growing in the right way. Revenues for the firm have been stagnant for quite some time, decreasing year over year despite a minor sales boom prompted by things such things as all-day breakfast and attempts to revamp the menu. Some may be encouraged by the increasing earnings per share through the past few quarters, but most of this comes from McDonald's buying back stock to keep the earnings more concentrated. This share management is very obvious if you take a look at the difference in earnings per share versus net income . The third-quarter EPS (diluted) grew 16% year over year while net income came in unchanged. There's an obvious long-term flaw in that equation. One has to question how long that can continue without revenue growth. Forecasted revenues for next year are $2 billion below what's expected for 2016. Shifts like this happen to all companies, but it certainly does paint a tougher picture for MCD keeping that earnings growth alive. JPMorgan has developed a similar view of the stock going into next year. The stock just lacks the catalysts necessary to propel things upward. With a price to earnings of 22, it's not exactly a cheap buy either. Despite my dismay with the company's inability to grow (in terms of revenue), the stock is still offering a nice dividend of over 3%. I don't blame anyone for wanting that yield. The problem is the stock seems a bit high right now to be sure you won't lose that 3% yield in a pullback. The situation must be viewed cautiously. How confident can you be in a stock that has succeeded in increasing sales (which were supposed to be the root of the problem) and still lose revenue? The third quarter is a showcase of the inherent problem facing the firm. Moves like table service , order screens and revamping stores could go two ways. If the service brings in more customers, it'll pay off. But the company has stated it will be increasing positions to deliver food and help with touch screens. Will the increased cost outweigh the benefit? It remains to be seen, but thus far it's clear that the golden arch has flat-lined in terms of growth.

      "text": "\nFollow @dmihalopoulos It was one of those moments when it seemed everything had changed — or would have to change, at last. \nThe video recording of an officer firing 16 bullets into a 17-year-old boy named Laquan McDonald placed Chicago at the center of the national debate over policing and race. \nThursday marks a year since city officials released the video. Sure enough, many significant things did happen after the video of the police shooting went viral: Authorities charged Jason Van Dyke — the officer who shot McDonald and continued to shoot him after he crumpled to the middle of Pulaski Road — with first-degree murder. The U.S. Department of Justice opened a civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department. The tough-talking police superintendent who led the department at the time of the shooting in 2014 was forced out, replaced by the city’s first African-American top cop in 13 years. Voters unseated the prosecutor who had not immediately charged Van Dyke and elected a new Cook County state’s attorney who’s promising criminal-justice reform. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and aldermen dismantled the ineffective agency that investigated misconduct charges against officers and created the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability. As Emanuel’s public-approval ratings plummeted, he became a pariah among national Democrats who once saw him as a rising star, and he admitted that a “code of silence” exists in the Chicago Police Department. And just recently — amid a sharp spike this year in murders and other violent crime — the mayor promised to add nearly 1,000 officers to the depleted police force. \nBut how much really has changed? \nNot nearly enough, say advocates for reforming policing in Chicago. \n“Things have definitely changed in terms of the popular framing of the issue,” says Johnae Strong, an organizer with Black Youth Project 100, who was arrested at a protest after the video’s release. \nShe says police, however, continue “harassing, violating, assaulting and murdering people” with impunity. \n“We have a long way to go,” says Strong, 26, who lives in the Bronzeville neighborhood. “I don’t believe real accountability has happened.” \nOPINION \nRELATED STORY: On anniversary of McDonald video release, no sign of federal case \nPolice officers now are much more aware of the possibility they could face criminal charges for their efforts to fight crime, says Daniel Herbert, the lawyer who’s representing Van Dyke. \nAlthough he couldn’t comment specifically on the ongoing Van Dyke case, Herbert says being injured or killed in the line of duty is the only thing officers in Chicago now fear more than the specter of an indictment against them. \nAs a result, some police offices say they have gone into self-preservation mode. Herbert blames that new mentality for the rising crime numbers. \nSince the video was released on Nov. 24, 2015, Chicago has seen 758 murders, according to records from the police department and the Cook County medical examiner’s office. \nThe last time there were so many murders in a calendar year was 1997. \n“Pro-active policing is essentially dead,” Herbert says. “I think it very much correlates with the exploding homicide rate.” \n“At the end of the day, there has to be law enforcement and order in the streets. Officers need to have the ability to do their jobs. What we have now is, if somebody makes a mistake, they will be indicted criminally.” \nPolice have fatally shot 10 people in Chicago since the release of the video. The most notorious of those cases was the first such incident, which came barely a month after the video’s release. \nOfficer Robert Rialmo shot and killed college student Quintonio LeGrier as he ran out of his dad’s house on the West Side on the morning after Christmas 2015. Rialmo also fatally shot Bettie Jones — a next-door neighbor and innocent bystander. \nAlthough police quickly apologized for Jones’ death, Rialmo remains on the force and was even mistakenly allowed to go back out on the streets for a spell during the summer. \nStanding in a blood-spattered doorway on the frigid day of the double shooting, the Rev. Marshall Hatch was incredulous that police apparently had not become less likely to shoot so freely in the wake of the McDonald video’s release. \nIn the past year, Hatch said this week, officers have essentially told the public in violence-plagued neighborhoods: “Either we get to do it our way or we won’t police.” \nSince the video was released, the gulf between the department and communities with the highest crime rates has only widened, and less-aggressive policing has emboldened criminals, says Hatch, the pastor at New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Garfield Park. \n“It’s reasonable for us to expect the police to be aggressive and also operate with integrity — to do their jobs without breaking the law,” he says. “It’s just not too much to ask.” \nAt City Hall and at police headquarters, there no longer is any disputing that systemic change is necessary. \nEver eager to get ahead of the news, the Emanuel administration released a report Monday detailing the changes officials claim credit for in the past year. \n“We’re committed to reform,” CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi says. “It’s something we’re going to do. We’ve done a lot, and we will do a lot more. \n“We’re chipping away at the rock here. Change takes time. You want to make sure you do it right.” \nFlint Taylor, a veteran civil-rights lawyer, says there remains “a tremendous amount of unfinished business.” \nChicago has seen many police scandals come and go over the decades. Summerdale. Fred Hampton. Jon Burge. \nThe release of the video of McDonald’s death, Taylor says, ranks right up there with the lowest moments in the department’s history. \n“It was a very profound moment,” he says. “It exposed for all to see the racist police violence and the code of silence and cover-ups that have been endemic for the 50 years I’ve been involved in these issues.” \nStill, Taylor views many of the changes of the past year with skepticism. He noted that the new police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, came from within the department ranks, meaning the department has not been led by a “true outside reformer” since O.W. Wilson was top cop in the 1960s. \nTaylor also says the police union continues to enjoy contract protections that make it difficult to punish bad cops. \n“They make no distinction in who they will defend,” Taylor says of the Fraternal Order of Police lodge representing Chicago officers. “That has not changed at all. The city has to show some real muscle in the next contract negotiations.” \nThe future of police reform, he says, will hinge greatly on whether a “powerful citizen review aspect to the disciplinary system” is allowed to emerge from the ruins of the ineffectual, old Independent Police Review Authority. \nHatch and Taylor said they have little confidence that the feds will pursue their investigation of the Chicago police with much enthusiasm after Donald Trump becomes president. \nTaylor predicts that Trump’s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, will dismantle the civil-right efforts of the Justice Department. He and officials with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois said they hoped the federal civil-rights probe would lead to a consent decree between the feds and the police, as happened in many other cities during President Barack Obama’s administration. \nBecause Trump won, Hatch says, “We can’t depend on the Department of Justice. We have to deal with it ourselves. We owe it to ourselves to use the tragedy of the Laquan McDonald case to radically change and reform.” \nIt likely will be a lot more than one more year before it’s clear whether the shock of the video’s release will make a real and lasting difference. \nContributing: Sam Charles ",

      "text": "McDonald's caught engaging in propaganda scheme at high schools, teaching that 'fast food is nutritious' \nFriday, November 25, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: McDonald''s , junk food , propaganda (NaturalNews) Do you think it's really possible to actually lose weight eating nothing but a steady diet of pre-processed McDonald's fast food ? Well, the restaurant chain would sure like for you to believe that, even though most items on McDonald's menus have been proven to be stuffed with unhealthy ingredients.Nevertheless, the chain wants to convince people that its food offerings contain the daily recommended allowances of carbohydrates, sugar, protein and fat – and as such, it is completely healthy to eat whatever is on the menu, because none of it causes obesity or the many ailments associated with it, as has been claimed.Do you remember when John Cisna, an Iowa high school teacher, claimed to have lost 56 pounds eating nothing but food from McDonald's in 2013? He even wrote a book about it, called My McDonald's Diet . Mindless nutritional propaganda Cisna claims that he limited his daily intake to 2,000 calories and exercised for 45 minutes, five times per week. After that he said he lost a total of 21 inches off his chest, waist and hips; his total cholesterol fell from 249 to 190; his body mass index (BMI) fell from 38 to 30; and he dropped to 224 pounds from 280 pounds, Anon HQ reports . In a documentary that McDonald's is peddling to high schools everywhere as a tool for healthy eating, Cisna says, \"I ate 540 straight meals at McDonald's. I spent a half a year of my life eating nothing but McDonald's and I know it works so when I hear the skeptics, it doesn't disgruntle me. It actually fires me up because those are the people that I have to educate.\"Ever since, as a paid brand ambassador for the fast food chain, he has crisscrossed the U.S., promoting McDonald's fare to middle- and high school students. He has even talked to students studying dietetics.In his own documentary, Cisna attempts to discredit the hit film , Supersize Me , which laid bare the kind of damage to your health that only eating fast food – especially in large portions – can do.But in the end, most legitimate dietitians and health experts were not impressed with his \"findings.\" In fact, most of them pointed to some very obvious factors that led to his weight loss – and it wasn't typical McDonald's food that did it.In an interview with Today , registered dietitian nutritionist Elisa Zied of New York City, author of the book, Younger Next Week , lauded Cisna's success at losing weight, but said that his recommendation of a strictly McDonald's-only diet was not realistic. 'I wouldn't recommend this to anyone' That's because much of his weight-loss results came from cutting his daily caloric intake and by exercising. Plus, she said, it is very likely that while he lost weight and cut his cholesterol level, his diet was probably high in sodium, low in fiber and consisted of far fewer vitamins and minerals found in healthier diets that include fruits, vegetables , whole grains and other foods rich in nutrients.\"I personally would not recommend this to anyone,\" she said . \"Fast food can be part of a healthful, balanced and nutrient-rich diet but it...shouldn't be a large part.\"Actually, it should play no part in your diet.Zied advises people to prepare most of their own food fresh at home while eating out less.As an update, The Washington Post reported that McDonald's has quietly ended it's controversial program involving sending Cisna to schools to talk about its food and nutrition in the same breath.Critics lambasted the effort as an underhanded way for the fast food chain to legitimize fast food as a nutrition alternative to kids who would grow up thinking that burgers, fries and shakes are actually good for you.

      "text": "  \nSay what you want about McDonald’s and the quality of their food, but I don’t think anyone could argue that there’s anything bad about a McFlurry. It’s just the perfect mix of ice cream and whatever topping you decide to put in it and I can’t believe that anyone who enjoys ice cream wouldn’t like it. And if you don’t like ice cream there’s something wrong with you anyway. Featured Image VIA \nThe best part of the McFlurry is that McDonald’s are constantly innovating it by thinking of new toppings/fillings/whatever to go into it. Just in time for Christmas this year, they may very well have come up with the best version of it yet by partnering with Terry’s Chocolate Orange to bring you the Chocolate Orange McFlurry. \nI’m sure you can guess what the deal here is – it’s just a McFlurry with crushed up Terry’s Chocolate Orange pieces in it – but I’m sure if you’ve ever eaten a Chocolate Orange then you can appreciate just how good this is going to taste. After launching today, everyone who’s been lucky enough to snap one up seems to be saying the same thing as well: Terry's Chocolate Orange McFlurry is everything I ever dreamed of! 😂😍🍫🍊",

      "text": "By arugatse on Flickr \nWhen Rob Lowe appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live with a golden McDonald’s card last year, one big question remained: How could the Average Joe get his own card that granted him access to unlimited McDonald's? \nNot easily, a little sleuthing revealed. \nThe first complication: Rob Lowe's Gold Card was not issued by McDonald’s corporate office. Instead, it is from the owner of, and can only be used at, McDonald’s franchises in Santa Barbara or Goleta, California. \nWhile Lowe says he received the Gold Card because his buddy’s dad created the McMuffin, McDonald's confirmed to Business Insider that he in fact received the card from David Peterson — the buddy in question, who is now a McDonald’s franchisee himself. \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/YkrY5nl6W8Q\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nHerb Peterson, who passed away in 2008, was a legendary force in the fast-food world. He debuted the first Egg McMuffin at the Santa Barbara McDonald's he co-owned with David in 1972 . Peterson started his work with McDonald’s as the vice president of the company’s advertising firm, D’Arcy Advertising, and went on to become a franchisee and operator of six McDonald’s locations. \nToday, David Peterson has carried on his father’s legacy with the chain. Earlier this year, the franchises he runs in the Santa Barbara and Goleta areas became some of the first to launch “taste-crafted” sandwiches as part of the McDonald’s turnaround plan, reports local news station KEYT. \nBy arugatse on Flickr \nPeterson also wields the power to give out Gold Cards, granting the recipient free McDonald’s at the locations he owns and operates. While Lowe is quite likely the most high-profile person to be awarded the card, he is not the first — just the first to brag about it on late-night TV. \nFor example, Larry Crandell was awarded a Gold Card by Peterson on his 90th birthday, reports SantaBarbara.com. While the cards are nearly identical, unlike Lowe’s card, Crandell’s awarded him free McDonald’s for life.\nCrandell is a bit of a celebrity in Santa Barbara, having reportedly helped raise millions of dollars for the community as a volunteer and expert emcee. \nAssuming you aren't a famous actor who has a personal connection with David Peterson or a local legend in Santa Barbara, California, there are other ways to get free McDonald’s. \nIn fact, McDonald's franchisees across the country appear to be more than happy to give local heroes free food with their own versions of the “Gold Card.”   \nBy arugatse on Flickr \nWarren Buffett told  CNBC   he had a McDonald’s card that allowed him to order unlimited food for free in Omaha. \nCharles Ramsey , who ditched his half-eaten Big Mac to help rescue three kidnapped women in May 2013, was awarded free McDonald’s at all locations for a year and unlimited McDonald's for the rest of his life at local Ohio restaurants.\nIn March, Ottawa Senators goalie Andrew Hammond, nicknamed the Hamburglar, received a card that gave him free McDonald’s for life from an Ottawa franchisee who, coincidentally, was also the father of Hammond's former coach. \nHowever, there are only two major confirmed stories of people in possession of cards granting them free, unlimited McDonald's anywhere in the country, or even the world. \nWhile on the campaign trail in 2012, Mitt Romney told a story of how his father had a \" little pink card \"  that awarded him free McDonald’s for life. McDonald’s confirmed that founder Ray Kroc had given Romney the card, but did not have any record of the reason for the gift. However, the chain noted that Kroc was known to informally gift these Lifetime \"Be Our Guest\" cards to various people throughout the years.   \nBy arugatse on Flickr \nThe other lucky recipient of a lifetime of free McDonald's — not a little pink card, but a bona fide Gold Card, according to the company — is Bill Gates. According to Warren Buffett, Gates' card works worldwide. Of course, it is unclear how often Gates stops by McDonald’s these days, after The Gates Foundation Asset Trust liquidated its position in the fast-food company in February 2015.   \nGetting your hands on a McDonald's Gold Card is no piece of cake. But, the legendary cards are real — and something that could end up in your own pocket, if you befriend the right McDonald’s franchisee. \nNOW WATCH: We went to check out the new 'walk-up' McDonald's that has no dining tables or chairs \n",

      "text": "(By arugatse on Flickr) \nWhen Rob Lowe appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live with a golden McDonald’s card last year, one big question remained: How could the Average Joe get his own card that granted him access to unlimited McDonald's? \nNot easily, a little sleuthing revealed. \nThe first complication: Rob Lowe's Gold Card was not issued by McDonald’s corporate office. Instead, it is from the owner of, and can only be used at, McDonald’s franchises in Santa Barbara or Goleta, California. \nWhile Lowe says he received the Gold Card because his buddy’s dad created the McMuffin, McDonald's confirmed to Business Insider that he in fact received the card from David Peterson — the buddy in question, who is now a McDonald’s franchisee himself. \n\nHerb Peterson, who passed away in 2008, was a legendary force in the fast-food world. He debuted the first Egg McMuffin at the Santa Barbara McDonald's he co-owned with David in 1972 . Peterson started his work with McDonald’s as the vice president of the company’s advertising firm, D’Arcy Advertising, and went on to become a franchisee and operator of six McDonald’s locations. \nToday, David Peterson has carried on his father’s legacy with the chain. Earlier this year, the franchises he runs in the Santa Barbara and Goleta areas became some of the first to launch “taste-crafted” sandwiches as part of the McDonald’s turnaround plan, reports local news station KEYT. \n(Herb Peterson.AP Images) \n\nPeterson also wields the power to give out Gold Cards, granting the recipient free McDonald’s at the locations he owns and operates. While Lowe is quite likely the most high-profile person to be awarded the card, he is not the first — just the first to brag about it on late-night TV. \nFor example, Larry Crandell was awarded a Gold Card by Peterson on his 90th birthday, reports SantaBarbara.com. While the cards are nearly identical, unlike Lowe’s card, Crandell’s awarded him free McDonald’s for life.\nCrandell is a bit of a celebrity in Santa Barbara, having reportedly helped raise millions of dollars for the community as a volunteer and expert emcee. \nAssuming you aren't a famous actor who has a personal connection with David Peterson or a local legend in Santa Barbara, California, there are other ways to get free McDonald’s. \nIn fact, McDonald's franchisees across the country appear to be more than happy to give local heroes free food with their own versions of the “Gold Card.” \n(Warren Buffett sipping a Cherry Coke. Reuters/Rick Wilking) \n\nWarren Buffett told CNBC he had a McDonald’s card that allowed him to order unlimited food for free in Omaha. \nCharles Ramsey , who ditched his half-eaten Big Mac to help rescue three kidnapped women in May 2013, was awarded free McDonald’s at all locations for a year and unlimited McDonald's for the rest of his life at local Ohio restaurants.\nIn March, Ottawa Senators goalie Andrew Hammond, nicknamed the Hamburglar, received a card that gave him free McDonald’s for life from an Ottawa franchisee who, coincidentally, was also the father of Hammond's former coach. \nHowever, there are only two major confirmed stories of people in possession of cards granting them free, unlimited McDonald's anywhere in the country, or even the world. \nWhile on the campaign trail in 2012, Mitt Romney told a story of how his father had a \" little pink card \" that awarded him free McDonald’s for life. McDonald’s confirmed that founder Ray Kroc had given Romney the card, but did not have any record of the reason for the gift. However, the chain noted that Kroc was known to informally gift these Lifetime \"Be Our Guest\" cards to various people throughout the years. \n(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \n\nThe other lucky recipient of a lifetime of free McDonald's — not a little pink card, but a bona fide Gold Card, according to the company — is Bill Gates. According to Warren Buffett, Gates' card works worldwide. Of course, it is unclear how often Gates stops by McDonald’s these days, after The Gates Foundation Asset Trust liquidated its position in the fast-food company in February 2015. \nGetting your hands on a McDonald's Gold Card is no piece of cake. But, the legendary cards are real — and something that could end up in your own pocket, if you befriend the right McDonald’s franchisee. \nNOW WATCH: We went to check out the new 'walk-up' McDonald's that has no dining tables or chairs \n\nMore From Business Insider \nWe tried the special breakfast sandwich McDonald's is testing — and think it could be a huge hit \nNordstrom is refusing to ditch Ivanka Trump's brand — and people are furious \n7 things you shouldn’t buy on Black Friday",

      "text": "(By arugatse on Flickr) \nWhen Rob Lowe appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live with a golden McDonald’s card last year, one big question remained: How could the Average Joe get his own card that granted him access to unlimited McDonald's? \nNot easily, a little sleuthing revealed. \nThe first complication: Rob Lowe's Gold Card was not issued by McDonald’s corporate office. Instead, it is from the owner of, and can only be used at, McDonald’s franchises in Santa Barbara or Goleta, California. \nWhile Lowe says he received the Gold Card because his buddy’s dad created the McMuffin, McDonald's confirmed to Business Insider that he in fact received the card from David Peterson — the buddy in question, who is now a McDonald’s franchisee himself. \n\nHerb Peterson, who passed away in 2008, was a legendary force in the fast-food world. He debuted the first Egg McMuffin at the Santa Barbara McDonald's he co-owned with David in 1972 . Peterson started his work with McDonald’s as the vice president of the company’s advertising firm, D’Arcy Advertising, and went on to become a franchisee and operator of six McDonald’s locations. \nToday, David Peterson has carried on his father’s legacy with the chain. Earlier this year, the franchises he runs in the Santa Barbara and Goleta areas became some of the first to launch “taste-crafted” sandwiches as part of the McDonald’s turnaround plan, reports local news station KEYT. \n(Herb Peterson.AP Images) \n\nPeterson also wields the power to give out Gold Cards, granting the recipient free McDonald’s at the locations he owns and operates. While Lowe is quite likely the most high-profile person to be awarded the card, he is not the first — just the first to brag about it on late-night TV. \nFor example, Larry Crandell was awarded a Gold Card by Peterson on his 90th birthday, reports SantaBarbara.com. While the cards are nearly identical, unlike Lowe’s card, Crandell’s awarded him free McDonald’s for life.\nCrandell is a bit of a celebrity in Santa Barbara, having reportedly helped raise millions of dollars for the community as a volunteer and expert emcee. \nAssuming you aren't a famous actor who has a personal connection with David Peterson or a local legend in Santa Barbara, California, there are other ways to get free McDonald’s. \nIn fact, McDonald's franchisees across the country appear to be more than happy to give local heroes free food with their own versions of the “Gold Card.” \n(Warren Buffett sipping a Cherry Coke. Reuters/Rick Wilking) \n\nWarren Buffett told CNBC he had a McDonald’s card that allowed him to order unlimited food for free in Omaha. \nCharles Ramsey , who ditched his half-eaten Big Mac to help rescue three kidnapped women in May 2013, was awarded free McDonald’s at all locations for a year and unlimited McDonald's for the rest of his life at local Ohio restaurants.\nIn March, Ottawa Senators goalie Andrew Hammond, nicknamed the Hamburglar, received a card that gave him free McDonald’s for life from an Ottawa franchisee who, coincidentally, was also the father of Hammond's former coach. \nHowever, there are only two major confirmed stories of people in possession of cards granting them free, unlimited McDonald's anywhere in the country, or even the world. \nWhile on the campaign trail in 2012, Mitt Romney told a story of how his father had a \" little pink card \" that awarded him free McDonald’s for life. McDonald’s confirmed that founder Ray Kroc had given Romney the card, but did not have any record of the reason for the gift. However, the chain noted that Kroc was known to informally gift these Lifetime \"Be Our Guest\" cards to various people throughout the years. \n(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \n\nThe other lucky recipient of a lifetime of free McDonald's — not a little pink card, but a bona fide Gold Card, according to the company — is Bill Gates. According to Warren Buffett, Gates' card works worldwide. Of course, it is unclear how often Gates stops by McDonald’s these days, after The Gates Foundation Asset Trust liquidated its position in the fast-food company in February 2015. \nGetting your hands on a McDonald's Gold Card is no piece of cake. But, the legendary cards are real — and something that could end up in your own pocket, if you befriend the right McDonald’s franchisee. \nNOW WATCH: We went to check out the new 'walk-up' McDonald's that has no dining tables or chairs \n\nMore From Business Insider \nWe tried the special breakfast sandwich McDonald's is testing — and think it could be a huge hit \nNordstrom is refusing to ditch Ivanka Trump's brand — and people are furious \n7 things you shouldn’t buy on Black Friday",

      "text": "McDonald’s Mobile Ordering Kiosks Will Boost Efficiency, Cut Down Mistakes? Joe Bacaron Nov 27, 2016 07:44 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter websiteRonald McDonald entertains the crowd in one of the kiddie events of the fastfood giant \nAfter disappointing second quarter earnings, the McDonald's mobile ordering kiosks were launched that may prop up revenues for the retail fastfood giant. \nAccording to CNBC , McDonald's had a net income of $1.09 billion on sales of $6.26 billion. While analysts predicted that the company will hit 3.4 percent growth on that period, same-store sales in the US only accounted for 1.8 percent growth. \nAt that time, the fastfood chain was aggressively promoting its All-Day Breakfast and McPick 2 promos which, although popular, did not really make a dent on the bottomline due to their cheap cost. \nThis time, however, it introduced the McDonald's mobile ordering kiosks to speed up service. This new strategy will roll out in the US in the first half of next year. \nThe report from Nation Restaurant News said that McDonald's has piloted the mobile kiosks at 500 locations in NYC, Southern California and Florida. Next year, Seattle, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston and San Francisco will follow suit. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

Apart from speeding up the ordering process, the mobile ordering kiosks will also reportedly boost efficiency and cut down on the number of mistakes. \nThe McDonald's mobile ordering kiosks strategy is still in its early stages, said CEO Steve Easterbrook, who also conceded that, \"There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience.\"",

One of them is a food snaps, then an enhanced selfie, and then a beautifully captured sunset with the golden-arched McDonald's sign in the foreground. Wait, what? Yep, while we're all used to the odd sunset photo on our feeds, it turns out a fast food variant could be the next trend for the photo-sharing app. West Ryde McDonalds // photo by @p_buts // #maccassunsets #sunsets #maccas #sydney A photo posted by maccas.sunsets (@maccas.sunsets) on Oct 4, 2016 at 12:52am PDT 5.31pm Drummoyne Maccas // @wheresed6 @mcdonalds #maccassunsets #sunsets #maccas #sydney A photo posted by maccas.sunsets (@maccas.sunsets) on Sep 15, 2016 at 1:38am PDT It's beautiful, isn't it? Well, unfortunately, this tasty bit of artistic work is harbouring a severe shortage of snaps. But over on '@maccas.sunsets' - which is likely an Australian joint, given the name - you can thankfully slide into its DMs to feature. So, finally, all those McDonald's sunset photos you've had saved on your phone can now get the viral treatment they deserve. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "1 minute ago rga184 : PainInTheASP: My only question is why? Specifically, why in Wisconsin? There must be a dozen places in Milwaukee that serve better deep-fried curds than I see in that picture.Are they trying to capitalize on a niche product line or gauging viability? Or are they long on mozzarella-flavored gum product and need to shrink inventory before the end of the year?Because Wisconsinites are loathe to ever do anything or try anything that isn't quintessential Wisconsin. So, they produce amazing, award winning cheeses, but those get largely sold elsewhere because Wisconsinites eat cheese curds and drink crappy beer and talk about the packers and talk about the badgers. All day long. Occasionally they interrupt a packer conversation to congratulate themselves on how awesome they are at braving the cold weather\\ thank God I'm out. I couldn't stand to listen to another person talk about Obama being Muslim as if being Muslim is automatically evil. Not sure where you lived but where I am, most of the good award winning cheeses are only sold locally. I have friends who load up when they come to town because they have nothing like it in their part of the country. Same thing with beer. Some of the best is only sold in state (and no, I am not talking about Spotted Cow).Yes, we love our cheese curds. I am guessing McD's is testing them here because we are picky about our cheese curds and if they don't fly in WI, they won't fly anywhere else. Not a fan of Culver's because I prefer battered rather than breaded. Displayed 12 of 12 comments Log in (at the top of the page) to enable voting.

      "text": "Nicole Linsalata \nFORT LAUDERDALE, FLA. (WSVN) - Authorities are searching for the driver who, they said, took off from the drive-thru of a McDonald’s restaurant in Fort Lauderdale following a police-involved shooting, Monday afternoon. \nOfficers detained one of two male passengers who took off on foot from the scene. The third subject remains on the run. \nFort Lauderdale Police confirmed one of their officers opened fire in the 2300 block of West Sunrise Boulevard, just after 12:15 p.m. \nAccording to Fort Lauderdale Police, officers were attempting to stop a stolen Ford Fusion with three men in the restaurant’s drive-thru. That’s when two men jumped out of the silver sedan and took off running. \nPolice said responding officers saw one of the subjects discard a firearm as he ran. \nWitnesses said the driver then attempted to flee. “The driver of the car stepped on the gas and took off through the drive-thru,” said witness Pat Hanley. \nInvestigators said the driver then hit one of the officers, throwing his body on the roof of the car. \n“He was actually laying down on it. He was laying down on top of the car, and he turned around and shot into it,” said witness Chris Harter. \n“Officers did draw their firearms and fired shots into the vehicle. It is unknown at this time if the driver was actually struck,” said Fort Lauderdale Police Detective Keven Dupree. \nThe motorist then jumped a curb and headed west on Sunrise Boulevard, initially driving on the eastbound lanes. #FLPD Ref OIS. Shots fired at 2300 W. Sunrise. Suspect fled in vehicle. Active search. Firearm recovered at scene. Unknown if suspect struck \n— Fort Lauderdale PD (@FLPD411) November 28, 2016 #FLPD Ref. Shooting. UPDATE. 2 suspects at large. 1 in custody. 1 officer transported to Broward Health w/ minor injuries after… (1 of 2) \n— Fort Lauderdale PD (@FLPD411) November 28, 2016 …being struck by suspect vehicle. Vehicle recovered, unoccupied. Vehicle (Ford Fusion) confirmed stolen. Ongoing investigation. (2 of 2) \n— Fort Lauderdale PD (@FLPD411) November 28, 2016 \nWitnesses said it was unclear who was shooting at whom. “That’s what’s tricky about it, is because you heard ‘pop, pop, pow’ and you saw the gentleman flee, so you’d think it was him, but from what I understand, the cops were the ones who shot at him,” said Hanley. \n“It all really happened so quick,” said Harter. \nStore manager Shauna Harvey said she is still reeling from the display of gunfire. “It’s a lot. It’s very traumatic. I hope that they catch who they’re looking for,” she said. “Whoever did what they were doing, I hope they get him.” \nThe officer was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries. \nOfficers apprehended the passenger spotted discarding the gun. The driver and the other subject remain at large. \nThe Fusion was later found abandoned along the 2800 block of Northwest 15th Court. Police confirmed the car had been reported as stolen. \nPolice said they recovered a handgun at the scene and another firearm inside the abandoned car. \nIf you have any information on this incident, call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward. \nCopyright 2016 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How about a gold-plated version of a McDonald’s coffee stirrer? \nOr a decapitated, armless, scuffed up remnant of a stone goddess statue? \nGorgeous at the Asian Art Museum suggests they are. A jumble of these and 70 other objects from the Asian and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the exhibit encourages us to just look--without, or at least before, reading the labels and wall signs. Traditional classification, such as where and when the art was made, is set aside “in favor of very direct experience,” says SFMOMA curator Janet Bishop. “It’s not about what the museum thinks,” says Jay Xu, the Asian’s director. “What do you think?” \nBut you’ll wonder how the curators defined “gorgeous,” because you’ll inevitably question why certain pieces are in the show, which was led by the Asian and is one of SFMOMA’s off-site collaborations while its building undergoes renovation until 2016. What’s gorgeous is in the eye of the beholder, but it’s “beyond conventional beauty,” says Allison Harding, the Asian’s assistant curator of contemporary art. \ncontinue reading below our video Tips for Taking Better Travel Photos \nAs beauty “pushed to the max,” pushed into excess, fantasy, playfulness, grotesqueness, exaggeration, danger or other unexpected realms, \"gorgeous\" may teeter between attractive and repulsive, Harding says. The artworks were chosen, says curator Forrest McGill, “not for traditional scholarly reasons, but because we find them gorgeous, or having something intriguing, funny or provocative to say about gorgeousness.” \nTake the ornate ceremonial Burmese alms bowl standing next to Jeff Koons’ gleaming white and gold ceramic Michael Jackson and Bubbles sculpture. Both are intriguing but can be readily dismissed as being too gaudy. Buddhist monks reject materialism and accept donations in their begging bowls, yet the bowl and its pedestal are gold and inlaid with jewels, notes McGill, the Asian’s senior curator of South and Southeast Asian art. But (and this is where label-reading enters) the bowl is wood, lacquered and gilded, and the “jewels” are mere glass. Capturing Jackson’s obsession with gorgeousness, Koons’ depiction of the “slightly creepy” King of Pop and his pet chimp is over-the-top and kitschy but crafted very beautifully by Italian porcelain artists, McGill says. “It’s the object we all love to hate,” he says. \nTo arrange the objects, the curators thought up headings--e.g., “seduction,” “dress up,” “evocation,” “on reflection”--but they add that many items could be grouped in more than one category. The goddess’ stone torso for instance, at least 400 years old from Southern India, is voluptuous with one hip coyly jutting out; what’s left of her is “beyond imperfection” but could fall under “seduction” or “pose,” too. \nWith the loose suggested groupings of objects of very disparate origins, time periods and genres, Gorgeous is a wide-open potpourri. If John Currin’s Laughing Nude oil pinup, Robert Smithson’s Nonsite of mirrors and a pile of dirt, and the menacing 18 th -century statue of the enlightened Tibetan Buddhist goddess Simhavaktra Dakini, wearing a cape of flayed human skin, are in the exhibit, what in SFMOMA’s or the Asian’s collections wouldn’t belong? \nThe show also features “promiscuous juxtapositions”—like Michael Jackson and the alms bowl—that are “a device for loosening the cladding behind which objects so often stand,” SFMOMA assistant curator Caitlin Haskell writes in the catalog (which purposely resembles a fashion magazine). One striking pairing is a petite gold-plated spoon and a centuries-old Balinese kris adorned with gold and jewels. Coke Spoon 02 by Tobias Wong and Ju$t Another Rich Kid, complete with a pair of golden arches on the handle, memorializes a plastic coffee stirrer that McDonald’s handed out in the 1970s—until it became a popular tool for snorting cocaine. \nIt’s interesting to notice how gut, visceral reactions from just looking, which the exhibit encourages, may differ from our informed, intellectual opinions. On first glance, the urinal, though sleek and rounded, is unspectacular. But Fountain is an authorized 1964 reproduction of a ready-made standard urinal that in 1917 Dadaist Marcel Duchamp signed with the pseudonym “R. Mutt,” laid on its back on a stand and submitted to an art exhibition, which rejected it. Alfred Stieglitz photographed the original urinal . Do those facts make it more gorgeous or less so? \nWriter Lawrence Weschler has likened the urinal’s shape to a seated Buddha’s, and McGill compares it to a 1930s World’s Fair pavilion. Yet, McGill notes in the catalog, “Probably the last word Duchamp would have wanted applied to Fountain --for either its conceptual or visual qualities--is gorgeous .”",

(KSNT) – A Topeka McDonald’s employee who put mustard into a Topeka Police Officer’s drink has been fired after a lengthy investigation. The District Attorney’s Office is opening a criminal investigation into the matter. \nIt all started with a photo shared on Facebook showing a law enforcement officer’s soda at a Topeka McDonald’s mixed with mustard has gone viral. \nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!” \nThe incident reportedly happened at the McDonald’s located at 2001 North Topeka Boulevard. \nSupervisor at the McDonald’s, Gary Vaughn, tells KSNT News the issue has been handled internally but would not elaborate on what that meant. \nTom and Marilyn Dobski of McDonald’s Franchisees in Topeka released the following statement. \n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.” \nThe Kansas Highway Patrol tells KSNT News this happened to one of their trooper’s about two weeks ago at the same location.

      "text": "Previous Next \nTULSA, Okla. (AP) -- McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. The fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. McDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. The company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "3 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 3% \nIncome investors love dividend stocks because they combine both current income and growth prospects. However, you can't just buy any dividend stock. Instead, you need the stocks with the most potential for future gains. Below, you'll find out how McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), Target (NYSE: TGT), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) have not only managed to give investors yields of 3% or more but have also provided ongoing growth to longtime investors. Better Buy: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. vs. McDonald's \nFast food has come a long way over time. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) reigned supreme over its chain competitors throughout much of the second half of the 20th century, distinguishing itself from both its fast-food peers and its slower casual-dining counterparts. But in the 21st century, fast-casual giant Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) led the way in producing a new way for people to eat. Investors looking for stocks in the consumer space are curious whether Chipotle or McDonald's is a better bet right now. Let's look more closely at the two restaurant stocks and compare them using several different measures to figure out which one is more attractive right now. Latest Business Achievements",

AP \nThe inventor of McDonald's iconic Big Mac has died. \nMichael Delligatti, who was known as \"Jim,\" died Monday night in Pittsburgh at the age of 98. \nDelligatti was one of McDonald's first franchisees. \nHe made an indelible impact on American cuisine with the creation of the Big Mac burger in 1967 at his Uniontown, Pennsylvania restaurant. \nDelligatti made the sandwich by combining two all-beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions, as well as a \"secret sauce.\" \nThat's the same recipe that's used today for the Big Mac sandwich, which is served in more than 100 countries worldwide. \nDelligatti also played an integral role in the development of McDonald's breakfast menu, by creating the Hotcakes and Sausage meal to feel steel workers at the end of their overnight shifts, according to an obituary written by his family that was provided by McDonald's. \nDelligatti at a celebration for his 90th birthday. AP \nHe opened his first McDonald’s restaurant in 1957 and went on to operate 47 additional locations in Pennsylvania. \n\"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" McDonald's said in a statement on Delligatti's death. \"We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\"",

      "text": "Jim Delligatti, Who Invented the Big Mac, Dies at Age 98  24:  By James R. Hagerty \nAs a McDonald's Corp. franchisee in the Pittsburgh area, Jim Delligatti in the mid-1960s believed the burgers-and- fries menu needed something jazzier. He came up with the Big Mac, tested it in one of his restaurants and saw it swiftly become a national sensation, heralding an era of ever-increasing reliance on novelty in fast food. \nMr. Delligatti died Monday at his home in Fox Chapel, a suburb of Pittsburgh, his family said. He was 98 years old. \nMr. Delligatti acknowledged that the Big Mac was derived from double-deck hamburgers made popular by rival fast- food restaurants. \"This wasn't like discovering the lightbulb,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 1993. \"The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.\" Even so, his initiative helped launch McDonald's on a long-running diversification of a menu once limited to little more than basic hamburgers, fries, shakes and soft drinks. \nIn recent years, the Big Mac's appeal has faded as McDonald's has struggled to find ways to entice customers back from rivals whose food is widely seen as fresher, healthier and hipper. The Big Mac \"has gotten less relevant,\" a top McDonald's franchisee wrote in a memo to other operators in July. Only one in five millennials has tried a Big Mac, the memo said. \nMichael James Delligatti was born Aug. 2, 1918, in Uniontown, about 45 miles south of Pittsburgh. He attended school in Uniontown and Fairmont, W.Va., and served in the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. \nIn 1953, he and a partner opened Delaney's Drive-In Restaurant in Pittsburgh. Two years later, Mr. DelliGatti met Ray Kroc, founder of McDonald's, at a restaurant trade show in Chicago. He became a franchisee of McDonald's in 1957, opening an outlet in Pittsburgh, the first in western Pennsylvania. \nMr. Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, two sons, five grandchildren and eight great grandchildren. His two sons and two of his grandchildren are McDonald's franchisees. In all, the family owns and operates 18 McDonald's restaurants in western Pennsylvania. \nIn 2007, the family opened a McDonald's Big Mac Museum Restaurant in North Huntingdon, Pa., near Pittsburgh. \nMr. Delligatti also innovated by coming up with an early version of the chain's breakfast offerings--hotcakes and sausages initially aimed at steelworkers returning home from overnight shifts. \nHe wasn't alone among franchisees in coming up with a hit product. McDonald's said other franchisees invented the Egg McMuffin and the Filet-O-Fish. \nWrite to James R.

      "text": "Fast food has come a long way over time. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) reigned supreme over its chain competitors throughout much of the second half of the 20th century, distinguishing itself from both its fast-food peers and its slower casual-dining counterparts. But in the 21st century, fast-casual giant Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) led the way in producing a new way for people to eat. Investors looking for stocks in the consumer space are curious whether Chipotle or McDonald's is a better bet right now. Let's look more closely at the two restaurant stocks and compare them using several different measures to figure out which one is more attractive right now.\n\nImage source: McDonald's.\nMcDonald's and Chipotle have seen their stock prices go in opposite directions recently. Since November 2015, McDonald's shares have risen 9%. Chipotle hasn't been able to recover, falling more than 30% over the same period.\nContinue reading ",

AP file By Associated Press \nPITTSBURGH >> The Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. Michael “Jim” Delligatti was 98. \nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, Pa., when he invented the chain’s signature burger with “two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.” \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. Advertisement \nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger, and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti’s 47 stores, then went national in 1968.",

      "text": "McDonalds / Via instagram.com ID: 10082157 \nMichael “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchise owner who invented the iconic Big Mac burger at his Pennsylvania restaurant in the 1960s, has died. He was 98. \n“Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you,” the company said in a statement . \nDelligatti died Monday at his home in Pittsburgh surrounded by loved ones, according to an obituary prepared by his family and provided by McDonald’s to BuzzFeed News. A cause of death was not released. \nDelligatti was one of McDonald’s earliest franchisees, opening up his first store in Pittsburgh in 1957. During his life, he would own and operate 47 other McDonald’s restaurants, making him one of the company’s largest ever franchise holders. \nIn 1967, he began serving the Big Mac at his Uniontown, Pennsylvania, restaurant after being inspired by double-decker burgers at other competitors.“This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,” he said in 1993 . “The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.” McDonald's ID: 10082223 \nThe Big Mac —“two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions – on a sesame seed bun,” as a famous 1970s jingle described it — was an instant hit and McDonald’s began selling it nationally in 1968. \nIn 2008, for the burger’s 40th anniversary, McDonald’s said they sold more than half a billion Big Macs each year. It is currently sold in more than 100 countries around the world. \nBut sales of the 540-calorie burger declined in recent years as customers became more health-conscious. Earlier this month, the company officially announced that in 2017 it will briefly offer smaller and larger versions of the sandwich . \nTotal US sales have rebounded in the past year at McDonald’s, thanks largely due to the introduction of all-day breakfast — an area where Delligatti’s influence was also felt. \n“A true innovator for the industry, Jim was instrumental in introducing breakfast service at McDonald’s,” his family obituary stated. “He developed the Hotcakes and Sausage meal to feed hungry steel workers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills.” Delligatti at his 90th birthday in 2008. Gene J. Puskar / AP ID: 10082903 \nIn a statement, a McDonald’s spokesperson praised Delligatti as “legendary franchisee…who made a lasting impression on our brand.” \nDelligatti, who also served as a US army sergeant in World War II, is survived by his wife Ellie, two sons, five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. \n“Delligatti…never dreamed his 1968 ‘invention’ would become a major piece of Americana,” McDonald’s said in 2008 . “Next to baseball and apple pie, his Big Mac stands as a proud figure of American pop-culture.” 3.

      "text": "McDonald’s introduces automated kiosks, fresh meat By Kevin Allen | Posted: November 30, 2016 \nMcDonald’s is stepping up its efforts to compete with fast-casual eateries such as Shake Shack and Five Guys. \nHow? By including fresh beef in more of its menu items and restaurants. \nThe fast-food company started the trend in the Dallas area in May. More than 50 locations now serve fresh beef there. McDonald’s recently announced that 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area would also start serving it. \nMcDonald’s frequently tests new menu items and to be competitive, it has upgraded some of its ingredients. In an effort to provide healthier options, it has stopped using high fructose corn syrup in its buns and uses butter in lieu of margarine. RELATED: The 2017 Social Media Conference for PR, Marketing and Corporate Communicators at Disney World. \nEarlier this year in an earnings conference call, McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook said that the company has to be careful when rolling out fresh beef because of the possibility of “cross contamination.” Things could become costly for the company if kitchen upgrades are needed. \nHowever, what the company spends in updating some of its kitchens, it might save in eliminating counter jobs. \nThe company is rolling out more automated ordering kiosks, which would eliminate the need for counter staff.",

      "text": "Herr Flick's Revenge : spidermann: Guy is a douchenozzle and deserves jail/prison time.Side Note:Don't pay child support directly to the person. Pay either your local DOJ, City/County or other agency that handles child support. This does many things:1. An impartial, third-party record of payment that is reported to credit bureaus (great if you're on time every time, not so great if you're behind)2. No \"they didn't pay!\" when they did pay arguments because of #13. If the divorce or custody/support was contentious, this will minimize any possible incidents happening over the payment/reporting of support4. Many states will go after and rescind/make invalid licenses (medical, driver's, et al) or degrees (BA/MA) if you're not making concerted effort to pay. Again, this goes back to #1; having the third party keep track of it all means no possible loss of important means of making a livingMost states just take it straight from your paycheck.You have no choice if you have a legitimate job.If your a criminal, I guess you have no choice but to pay by other means. In Colorado you have the option of choosing if the divorce was uncontested. I pay her by check every month directly. Haven't had an issue in the last six years.

      "text": "Executive editor, TheMid.com , and founder, ProGhostwriters.com @ BillMurphyJr WRITE A COMMENT Advertisement \nIn the beginning, McDonald's didn't even want to hear it. \nBut Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti didn't care. He was a franchise owner with 48 McDonald's restaurants across the country. He forced the burger giant's hand by offering his crazy new menu item in all of his outlets, and became one the greatest unsung innovators of all time in the process. \nHis creation? The Big Mac--a hamburger with (get this): two buns! The year was 1967. The Wall Street Journal picks it up: \nThe hamburger features two beef patties, a mildly tangy sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions slathered over a soft sesame-seed bun sliced into three layers. The original price was 45 cents, compared with an average of about $5 today. McDonald's put the Big Mac on its national menu in 1968. \nDelligatti, whom you might never heard of until today, died this week at the age of 98. Lived to that ripe old age, we should add, while reportedly consuming a diet that included at least one Big Mac each week for nearly 50 years. \nOh, and he also invented the Egg McMuffin in 1970--at least that's what some reports say . (Others say the McMuffin might have been another franchisee's creation.) Regardless: an American icon and another icon. \nGranted, you might nitpick and point out that the Big Mac isn't what it used to be. The Golden Arches have had a tougher time of late --battling healthier choices on one side, and gourmet $9 burger joints on the other side. Delligatti even lived to see them tinker with the recipe. \n(Sriracha Mac Sauce, my colleague Chris Matyszczyk reports. And now they're offering breakfast all day.) \nAnd yet: If any of us invents something that lasts as long in the public consciousness as the Big Mac or the Egg McMuffin, we will have done something worth remembering. Here are a few things that the were introduced to the United States long after the Big Mac was already a major American icon: Honda (first cars imported to the USA in 1970). Donald Trump (first mentioned in a New York Times article in 1973). Star Wars (1977). Inc. magazine (originally founded 1979) The World Wide Web (1989). Twitter (founded 2006, mentioned because that's where McDonald's posted its memorial to Delligatti). Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn -- McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 \nAll of that, and still, the latest estimates I could find are that McDonald's still sells 550 million Big Macs in the United States each year--nearly twice that if you count every single instance of two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun sold worldwide. \nSo, rest in peace Mr. Delligatti. Our condolences to his wife, Ellie, his sons and grandchildren (also McDonald's franchisees, by the way). And for the rest of us, think of him the next time you have an amazing idea and the powers of be tell you that it won't work. Like this column?

The Pennsylvania native opened his own McDonald’s franchise in Uniontown the mid-‘60s and soon began looking for ways to expand McDonald’s’ bill of fare beyond hamburgers, fries and shakes.\nPHOTOS: Most Shocking Celebrity Deaths of All Time\nDelliganti decided to experiment with making the Mickey Ds burger better by adding two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun, and began selling it at his restaurant.\nPHOTOS: Celebrity Foodies\nDuring a 2006 interview with the AP , Delliganti revealed that McDonald’s initially opposed rolling out his invention to more of its restaurants because sales of the company’s burgers were already doing well. However, Delligatti — who went on to own and operate 47 McDonald’s locations — never gave up; and after a little bit of pushing, the Big Mac became a national sensation in 1968 after it was introduced to restaurants all over the U.S.\nOn Wednesday, McDonald’s paid tribute to Delliganti via the company’s official Twitter account, writing: “Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you.” The fast food chain shared a photo and Quote: from the fast food inventor, saying: “I never would have dreamed that my creation would turn into a piece of Americana.”\nRelated Content: Kelly Ripa Calls Anderson Cooper the 'Live' Host 'That Got Away' Blac Chyna Calls Herself Angela as She Shows Off Gingerbread House With Rob Kardashian 'Don't Be Tardy' Recap: Kim Zolciak, Husband Kroy Biermann Reveal His Career Woes Cause a 'Lot of Worry'",

Subscribe Google Confirms Massive UK Investment Plan It’s probably the most famous burger out there, the Big Mac, and while it’s hard to imagine any other food item becoming as iconic, McDonald’s continues to innovate, looking for its next big thing. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) \nThe man who brought us the Big Mac has gone to that great golden arches in the sky. \nAs you may have heard, Michael “Jim” Delligatti , a Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s area franchise owner, passed away Monday night. He was 98, and the Big Mac debuted nationally in 1968, thirteen years after McDonald’s came on the scene. But before the Big Mac would become something of a national phenomenon, Delligatti first sold his burger creations, with its two beef patties and special sauce, in his 47 McDonald’s in the Pittsburgh area. \nThat’s a pretty similar path to how McDonald’s products are unveiled today. Long before the public at large samples them, they usually are tried out in a test market city, in case there’s a misfire and to work out any kinks in the system. So in tribute to Delligatti’s passing, let’s take a look at some of the many products and services that McDonald’s is currently testing around the world. \n1) New Big Macs . If you’ve ever wished your Big Mac could be hotter, as in spicy, well, good news. McDonald’s is currently testing the Sriracha Big Mac in Columbus, Ohio. According to USA Today , it’s also been tested in Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle. If things continue to go well, it may eventually be available nationwide. \nAnd if you’ve ever wished your Big Mac could be smaller or bigger, you’re in luck. Next year, according to reports , the Mac Jr. and Grand Mac burgers will be offered nationwide, but as a limited-time offer. Hopefully Delligatti would approve. \n2) A Breakfast Happy Meal. McDonald’s is testing a Happy Meal for breakfast in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and it may be rolled out nationally next year, also according to USA Today . Judging from how popular their Happy Meals are, it seems incredible that they didn’t decide to do this decades ago. \n3) Deep-fried cheese curds. It seems unlikely to me that we’ll see this unveiled nationwide because this seems very Wisconsin-y, but for those who don’t mind their arteries being clogged, here’s hoping: Right now, at any McDonald’s in Wisconsin, you can buy cheese curds for a limited time, for five bucks. According to one reviewer , “The cheese had only a hint of squeak and the batter was a bit on the greasy side, but they were perfectly acceptable Wisconsin cheese curds.” Well, I’m sold. ",

      "text": "It is possible to order some of the items off the unofficial McDonald's \"secret menu,\" but should you? (Credit: Tara Conry)\nHave you ever been biting into your McDonald's Big Mac and wished there were six additional beef patties inside? Or imagined what would happen if you stacked the chain's Filet-O-Fish filet atop a McChicken cutlet and then, sandwiched both inside a Big Mac. Well, you're not alone.\nAn anonymous UK McDonald's manager made waves when he mentioned the fast food giant's \"secret menu\" during a Q&A...",

      "text": "Submit Cancel \n1. Waste time with a purpose. Find a McDonald’s or watch a basketball game at the Modell’s in Times Square. Your journey will not begin until you swipe your Metrocard and enter the system. Stall as long as possible above ground. Remember, once you’re in the system, you won’t come out. \n2. Swipe in. For the next seven hours, you will be in the subway. You will ride one line until the last stop. Switch to the opposite train. Ride until the end of the line. Repeat. Find a subway line that is mostly underground with many stops. You’ll curse every time wind gusts enter the train every two minutes. This eliminates the lines to Coney Island. Express trains go from end-to-end too quickly. Take the #2. 2a. The #2 train takes you from deep in the heart of Brooklyn into deep into the heart of the Bronx. If your image of New York City involves a combination of pleasant bicycle-riding photographers or Kim Cattrall, this might not be the line for you. If you need a feeling of security, try the #6. 2b. Do not switch subway lines for a shakeup in scenery. It accomplishes nothing. Sight-see during the day. \n3. Place your possessions under your legs. Clutching anything to your chest flags a signal that there is something worth losing in your possession. Think like a Jedi. You must be prepared to give up what you are afraid to lose. \n4. Close your eyes. Try to sleep. 4a. Feeling secure in a subway requires a temporary suspension of the paranoid part of your brain. Be thankful though that this is New York. Whatever the time, no one will find it strange that you are on the train. You could be coming late from a party, or heading back from a friend’s. You could be on drugs. No one cares. 4b. For beginners, successful sleep is in 30 to 45-minute intervals. If fate decides to give you more experience in the art of sleeping on the subway, it might boost up to a whole hour. With practice, all of the sounds of the subway will mesh into an indistinguishable audio blur. \n5. As the night wears on, you will notice your company looking more or more like the kinds of people who sleep on trains. Fossilized ash has hardened their elbows. You’ve never seen so many shades of black or grey in someone’s clothes, shoes, and skin. You must remind yourself that you are not this person. To avoid the association, get off one station before the last stop. This way, you leave alone. \n6. When switching trains, non-verbally communicate why you’ve gone from one train to the opposite side. Fumble with a phone. Look at the subway map as if you were lost. Fake yawn. Create plausible deniability that you were sleeping on the train. \n7. Look at the time. 2:56. Do some quick math. 75 minutes each way puts another two round trips before daylight approaches. \n8. Bored? Good. You should be sleeping. \n9. Can’t sleep? Allow yourself a moment to reflect. 9a. Remember that you aren’t the kind of person to be sleeping on the subway. 9b. Remember that you aren’t the kind of person that can ask to crash on another couch either. 9c. Remember that sleeping on the train is better than sleeping at the bus stop, and the two weeks of bronchitis that followed. \n10. As daylight approaches, reward yourself and break rule 2c. Transfer onto the A Train heading toward Far Rockaway. If you time it properly, a stretch of rail will be over Jamaica Bay. There are no skyscrapers or murals, parks or cemeteries; all things that you’ve seen during your night in the station. Just the water. It is a total sunrise before your eyes. Remind yourself that you would not have seen it had you been waking up in a bed. \n11. Enjoy the sunrise and head back toward Manhattan. \n12. Take the A toward Brooklyn. Get off at High Street. Sleep some more at Brooklyn Bridge Park.",

      "text": "10 Facts About Big Mac Inventor Michael James Delligatti The McDonald's franchise owner died at 98 this week. Image credit: McDonald's   \nMcDonald's has been around for 61 years, but its most well-known offering, the Big Mac, wasn't even on the menu until more than a decade into the chain's history. It was the creation of Michael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, a franchise owner in Uniontown, Pa. This week, Delligatti died at 98 at his home in Fox Chapel, Pa. \nToday, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn — McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 \nIn 1967, Delligatti had to work to convince the higher-ups that the 45-cent burger was worth the risk. It took only a year for the now-iconic sandwich to land on the restaurant's national menu. Today, it is available in more than 100 countries. \nThe Golden Arches recently added two new Big Mac options for diners: an even bigger and a slightly smaller burger. These ideas originated at franchise locations in Ohio and Texas. \nRead on for ten facts about innovative franchisee Jim Delligatti. \nRelated: McDonald's to Sell a Bigger Big Mac -- and a Less Big, Big Mac? 10. Delligatti decided to open a McDonald's after meeting founder Ray Kroc at a restaurant trade show in Chicago in 1955. \n9.He was the first person to own a McDonald's in western Pennsylvania. He opened his first location in the Pittsburgh suburbs in 1957. \n8. During World War II, he served in the army and was stationed in Europe. \n7. After the war, he hitchhiked from West Virginia to California, He first got into the restaurant industry by working at drive-ins and managing a Big Boy. \n6. Over the course of 25 years, Delligatti opened 48 stores across Pennsylvania. \nRelated: McDonald's Will Soon Have Self-Serve Kiosks and Mobile Ordering in U.S. Stores \n5. For the burger’s 40th birthday in 2007, he opened a Big Mac Museum Restaurant in North Huntingdon, Pa. Visitors can see not only a statue of Delligatti, but also the largest Big Mac in the world – a 12- by 14-foot bronze sculpture. \n4. Delligatti reportedly never tired of his creation, and he ate one Big Mac every week according to his family. \n3. You can thank him for those breakfast sandwiches. He was among the first to serve breakfast at McDonald's. He put hotcakes and sausage on the menu to feed his customers who worked long, late shifts at steel mills. \n2. He helped launch the seventh Ronald McDonald House , which opened its doors in Pittsburgh in 1979. \n1. McDonald's became a Delligatti family business . His two children and two of his grandkids are also franchisees. Nina Zipkin Nina Zipkin is a staff writer at Entrepreneur.com.

      "title": "Will Health Concerns Catch Up to McDonald's Stock? (MCD)",
      "text": "McDonald’s: Perception vs. Reality (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | December 1, 2016 — 11:26 AM EST \nFor most investors, McDonald's Corporation ( MCD ) is seen as a mature company that generates significant cash flow , pays a generous dividend , and is resilient to bear markets . All of this is true, but there is a bigger underlying picture. \nMCD has appreciated 4.21% over the past 12 months, which puts it relatively on pace with the S&P 500’s gain of 4.57% over the same time frame. However, MCD currently offers a dividend yield of 3.12 whereas the S&P 500 currently yields 2.01%. MCD has become a no-worry stock, meaning that while upside potential might be limited, there is a floor. This might remain the case, especially with McDonald’s cutting costs and improving customer service by adding self-order kiosks. In most cases, self-order kiosks would weaken customer service, but this is widely viewed as an improvement at McDonald’s. \nThe longer-term danger for McDonald’s is the negative consumer perception of the brand. Consider the following information. Prior to 2000, consumers ate at McDonald’s without much concern. They knew it wasn’t the healthiest option in town, but no big deal. Then, in 2004, Super Size Me crushed the belief that eating at McDonald’s was no big deal. This was followed up by McLibel: Two Worlds Collide in the United Kingdom in 2005. Though not related directly to McDonald’s, Food, Inc. was released in 2008, which didn’t help. \nNotice that all of the above films were released in the 21 st century, a time when the health-conscious consumer is rising and passing on fast food for healthier alternatives. \nMcDonald’s had a rough stretch in the early 2000s. It recovered in the mid-2000s, was hit in 2008 with almost every other stock throughout the broader market, and then began its tear higher in 2009. The difference between now and the early 2000s are twofold: the rise of the health-conscious consumer and significantly increased competition such as sandwich shops, the popularity of fast-casual, and the relentless rise of Shake Shack. \nIf perception is everything in the investment world, then McDonald’s is safe for now because its perceived as strong-cash-flow company that returns capital to shareholders while also offering resiliency. This may continue, but in the real world, McDonald’s is facing strong headwinds related to food quality and increased competition. Unless McDonald's can change its image, it might only be a matter of time before the stock catches up to reality.

      "text": "McDonald makes push to be part of 49ers' future McDonald makes push to be part of 49ers' future By Matt Maiocco December 02, 2016 7:00 AM \nORLANDO, Fla. – It has taken tight end Vance McDonald a while, but he has become a legitimate threat in the 49ers’ passing game. \nMcDonald, a second-round draft pick in 2013, recorded just 10 receptions in his first two seasons. He started to see more action last season after the 49ers dealt Vernon Davis to the Denver Broncos at the trade deadline. He has started 20 games the past two seasons, including all nine games in which he has appeared this year. \n“I just always look back at the opportunity when Vernon went to (Denver),” McDonald said. “Just being able to have the trust and the opportunity to start games and play every down.” \nThrough three seasons, McDonald had not produced and given few indications that he warranted a contract extension. But as a player who is scheduled for unrestricted free agency in the offseason, McDonald is making a convincing argument to become a priority for the 49ers to re-sign. \nMcDonald ranks third on the 49ers with 22 receptions and second behind Jeremy Kerley with 382 receiving yards. McDonald has a team-leading four touchdown catches, including scoring plays of 75 and 65 yards. \n“He’s one of our weapons on the offensive side of the ball and he runs better than most tight ends in this league,” 49ers coach Chip Kelly said. “So really depends on week to week what people have available at the safety spot to kind of match up with him. But he’s certainly someone that I think people defensively have to game plan for.” \nEven the 49ers’ designated deep threat, wide receiver Torrey Smith, has not been able to shake free for as many big gains as McDonald, who is listed at 267 pounds. \n“Vance has done a great job,” Smith said. “I’m very happy for him, especially knowing how hard he’s been fighting over the years. He’s finally getting a chance to show what he can do. And he’s done a great job. He’s very fast. That’s what helps him out a lot. It’s not often you can get a tight end and take it to the house, running past everyone.” \nMcDonald said he believes Kelly’s system allows him a greater opportunity to be part of the team’s passing attack. \n“It provides the tight end an opportunity to be a big playmaker,” McDonald said. “I’ve welcomed that idea and embraced that role this year. It’s been a lot of fun. \n“As an offense, I like looking at a bigger picture, and we have to be more consistent. I can help with that and I’m trying my best.” \nAhead of 49ers bout, Bears make call on Cutler's season USATSI By Associated Press December 01, 2016 3:15 PM \nJay Cutler's season is over and his time in Chicago might be, too. \nCoach John Fox announced Thursday that the veteran quarterback will have season-ending surgery on his right shoulder, the latest blow in a lost year for the Bears. \nThe operation to repair the labrum will take place on Saturday. \n\"I talked to him earlier today. He's in good spirits,\" Fox said. \"It wasn't like it was never going to be an option. You try to avoid it, especially for a quarterback on your throwing shoulder. But he talked to many capable doctors, like he should. So that's been the determination at this point.\" \nMatt Barkley figures to start his second straight game when the Bears (2-9) host San Francisco (1-10) in a matchup between struggling teams on Sunday. \nCutler injured his shoulder during a loss to the New York Giants on Nov. 20 but finished the game. Fox initially insisted the injury was not season-ending. But after working through treatment options, Cutler won't play again this season. If he has thrown his last pass for Chicago, Fox was not about to confirm it. \n\"You know, offseason is the offseason,\" Fox said. \"We're not there yet.\" \nOffensive coordinator Dowell Loggains had strong praise for Cutler. \n\"I just know my relationship with him and I know how the QB room feels about him and his teammates voted him a captain for a reason,\" he said. \"I know how much Matt Barkley appreciates the input. I know how much Brian Hoyer appreciates his input as well. And I know how much I appreciate the things he's done to this point.\" \nLoggains mentioned Cutler's toughness and \"how much the team means to him.\" \n\"That's been incredible to watch,\" he said. \"There's a perception and there's a reality of that. Just, it's been really fun the last two years getting to coach him and I've enjoyed every minute of it.\" \nCutler no longer has a high salary-cap figure, so it becomes more likely he could be traded or cut in the offseason. The problem for the Bears is they have no obvious replacement on the roster. Chicago has not drafted a quarterback in Ryan Pace's two years as general manager. \nIf they part with Cutler and don't trade for a quarterback, they could try to go with Hoyer as a stopgap or with Barkley. \nHoyer made five starts while Cutler was sidelined by a sprained right thumb and threw for more than 300 yards in four straight games before breaking his left arm at Green Bay on Oct. 20. Cutler was cleared to return in the days after that game. Whether he would have regained the starting job had Hoyer stayed healthy is not certain. \nCutler made five starts this season and completed 81 of 137 passes for 1,059 yards with four touchdowns and five interceptions. \nHe came to Chicago in a blockbuster trade with Denver before the 2009 season and holds just about every major all-time franchise passing record. He is the Bears' leader in attempts (3,271), completions (2,020), yards (23,443) and touchdowns (154). \nBut the Bears are missing the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years since the 2006 team reached the Super Bowl. The 2010 team beat Seattle in the playoffs before losing to Green Bay in the NFC title game, with Cutler sitting out most of the second half because of a knee injury. \nCutler at times has clashed with coaches and teammates since his arrival. He has also been hampered by poor offensive lines and a lack of talent around him. Throw in a penchant for turnovers at inopportune moments as well as a series of injuries and it's added up to a rocky tenure in Chicago. \n\"I know he's extremely competitive,\" Fox said. \"I think he's been very tough-minded when he's had to deal with things, even in our tenure here, different surgeries, the hamstring, the thumb and now the shoulder. I think he's handled that as well as most guys I've ever been associated with.\" Injury report: 49ers' WR Patton returns to limited practice USATSI By Matt Maiocco December 01, 2016 2:35 PM \nORLANDO, Fla. – Wide receiver Quinton Patton returned to limited practice, as he continues to be on pace to be cleared to play Sunday in the 49ers’ game against the Chicago Bears. \nPatton wore a blue jersey, signifying he is off-limits for physical contact, during practice on Thursday at the University of Central Florida. Patton has returned to non-contact football activity. The next step for Patton to be cleared is to take part in full football activity, including contact. \nPatton is the 49ers’ second-leading receiver with 31 catches for 374 yards. Veteran Rod Streater entered Sunday’s game against the Miami Dolphins when Patton was injured. Streater caught four passes for 46 yards. \nRegardless of Patton’s condition, 49ers coach Chip Kelly said Streater has earned more playing time. \n“Yeah, he should,” Kelly said. “I think with Streat, all this is a meritocracy and he merits playing time. I thought what he did was really valuable for us, especially late in that fourth quarter there he made some really big plays for us. \n“It’s about trying to get the ball in playmaker’s hands and those guys did a really good job.” \n49ERS PARTICIPATION REPORT",

      "text": "Dennis McDonald is proof that you can reach a goal if you don't give up.\n\nMcDonald is set to receive his bachelor's degree in computer science in two weeks at age 49. That in itself is an accomplishment, but there's more: McDonald was among three University of Illinois Springfield students to recently participate in one of the National Cyber League's annual competitions.\n\nDuring the two competitions, students deploy anti-hacking measures to defend real-time network attacks. McDonald finished in the top 15 percent of both competitions in which he participated. He ended finishing 342nd of 3,070 in the first and 362nd of 2,736 in the second.\n\n\"It takes persistence. The challenges are pretty difficult. You have an eight-hour window to get it done,\" McDonald said. \"It is pretty tedious but really interesting work. I felt great about how I finished, especially since there was a lot on there I haven't been trained to do.\"\n\nMcDonald has deftly handled curveballs in his life for years.\n\nThe Barry native joined the U.S. Navy's nuclear power program after graduating from high school in 1985. When he returned to the area, he worked as an electrician and ran a computer store.\n\n\"I always wanted to get my degree in computer science, but things happen,\" McDonald said.\n\nHaving a family, he said, as well as running a business, left him with little time to devote to higher education. In the late 1990s, he started attending John Wood Community College on an Illinois Veteran Grant and GI Bill benefits.\n\n\"Then I got custody of my kids, so I put that on hold,\" he said.\n\nUndeterred, McDonald would return to earn his associate degree from John Wood, maintaining a 3.93 grade-point average. He enrolled in the University of Illinois Springfield's computer science program online, and has managed a 4.0 grade-point average.\n\n\"It's been tough balancing working full time and going back to school,\" McDonald said, \"but getting this degree is something I've always wanted to do.\"\n\nThe story was reported by the Quincy Herald-Whig on December 2, 2016.\n\nRead the story online.

      "text": "Wait, what?! McDonald’s now serves waffle fries and we honestly cannot deal We can’t think of much else to say about the fact that McDonald’s now serves waffle fries except ZOMG, NOM NOM NOM, followed by excessive drooling that interferes with our ability to speak anything other than acronym-riddled gibberish. Actually, here’s something: What took so damn long? Like, Mickey D’s came up with crazy creations like pumpkin chocolate fries for the fall , but made us wait to dine on waffle fries? What’s up with that?\nSo, according to Delish , the wait isn’t exactly over for most of us because these waffle fries are only available in Canada for now. And as if this wasn’t painful enough to accept for anyone not located in Canada (or driving there at breakneck speed as we speak), there’s even a photo of the new fries on Twitter to rub our faces in what we’re missing out on:\nReady for Waffle Fries? #SeasonsCravings @McD_Canada pic.twitter.com/SE6ngM3tDm \n— Foods of Toronto (@FoodsOfToronto) November 30, 2016 And UGH, the Canadian locations will also add a hash brown and bacon-topped burger to their menus. You know…this is just a lot to take in at the moment. It might be way too early for an emotional eating sesh, but we’ll probably feel a lot better after downing a large order of McDonald’s fries.\n\nOn second thought, make that extra large. But if and when McDonald’s decides to expand this idea in our direction, we’d like to suggest a McDonald’s fries-only restaurant where waffle fries are served all day and night, please and thanks in advance.\nThe post Wait, what?!

      "text": "By Ken Wheaton . Published on December 05, 2016 This is only a hamburger. Credit: Courtesy McDonald's Most Popular \nAs the editor of advertising age, I don't get to do as much actual editing as I'd like to do. While I'm stuck in meetings and dealing with budgets, the other folks are having all the fun. So I was pretty excited last week when I overheard some discussion on headlining a Lowdown item and I was able to contribute the following: \" Lowdown: Dehydrated Vagina Strikes Again in Vagisil Spot. \" \nIf I may take a moment to brag, as headlines go that's close to ideal. It's catchy, it's funny and it describes what's going on in the story. In this particular case, the Vagisil brand had released an online video that discusses a very sensitive subject in a very funny manner. \nIt was also a case of a headline working well as a tweet. It was sure to take off in social media. \nAnd it did. \nBut for all the wrong reasons. \nLowdown, you see, is a midweek grab bag of items, a digest of news nuggets and information that we think are interesting or important, but don't have the time or resources to give the full story treatment. And one of the other items in last week's Lowdown was about the death of Michael Delligatti, the inventor of McDonald's Big Mac. For that particular section, we used a photo of a Big Mac. \nI'm not going to bore you with the technical details, but when a tweet gets sucked into SocialFlow from our CMS, the default setting selects the largest picture. In the body of the story, the Vagisil spot was a video, not a static image, so I'll give you one guess what photo ended up accompanying the tweet. \nThat's right. A tweet reading \"Dehydrated vagina strikes again in Vagisil spot\" sat right above a very large photo of a Big Mac. \nIt was the second rainy day in a row here in New York, and when we first noticed the misplaced image, we literally laughed out loud. Then we thought, \"Oh boy. Here we go. Social media storm of the century.\" \nI decided not to take it down. Why? One, this is social media. It was already out there and I knew with 100% certainty that someone had already grabbed a shot of it. It's what I would have done. Hiding it would have just fed the beast. \"What is Ad Age trying to hide?\" (I'm not such a glutton for punishment that I'm going to embed it here again. Besides, you can find it easily enough.) Two, it wasn't really hurtful or offensive. If anyone looked bad, it was us. Three, again, this is social media. Despite the intensity of tweet storms, despite it feeling like the world is ending, these things pass relatively fast. Four, 2016 has sucked for a lot of people, and it seemed like our faux pas was actually bringing some sort of joy into the world. \nIn fact, one person called it the \"cure\" for 2016. \nSo instead of pulling it down, I tweeted from the official Ad Age account: \"We realize the tweet about the Vagisil ad pulled in the wrong image. Enjoy the laugh at our expense.\" \nAfter that, I followed along on Twitter to see the responses. Some seemed to come from extremely literal people who only read headlines, never click on links and, as one would expect from such people, were confused. There were also a lot of jokes—from both men and women, thankfully. \"Mine looks totally different,\" said one. Many of them included the phrase \"special sauce.\" Many others were so raunchy they can't be repeated here. Others just pointed at the tweet and laughed: \"If there is a Twitter Hall of Fame, this tweet better be included.\" Gizmodo wrote a post about it, saying \"This Might Be in the Top 5 or Even Top 10 Tweets of All Time.\" (The writer called us a blog, but I'll let that slide.) \nWe even earned points for taking it in stride and not freaking out. \nAnd by the time I'd returned home that evening, it was all forgotten. \nIt did not turn into an all-caps social media crisis. \nThat's not to say some folks weren't implying it might turn into one. \nSomeone informed us twice that \"this has been up for an hour,\" as if trying to save us from imminent demise. Another wrote \"Predicting a social-media opening at @adage in 3…2…\" A handful of others suggested someone would or should be fired over this. And someone went so far as to say that Ad Age would be getting an earful from McDonald's PR. \nNo one was fired over it. No one would have been fired over it. And McDonald's apparently had better things to do than call us over an errant tweet. (And McD's feelings about the tweet would have been irrelevant anyway. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.) \nThose reactions didn't so much anger me as make me tired. I'm tired of social media outrage. It's something I've been cautioning brands about for as long as social media has been around. Not that they need to be careful never to cause social media outrage, but rather that they shouldn't overreact to it. Somewhere in the world, someone is always mad. In the olden days, these people had to grouse to their spouses, complain to their kids or corner someone at the office watercooler. In the olden days, these people were also unable to easily connect with like-minded outraged folk. These days, it's all too easy. They hook up on social media, and it isn't long before we have a howling chorus of anger over the slightest thing. \nHell, I'd argue that political correctness hasn't gotten worse over the last three decades, it's just gotten more organized, more cohesive and therefore louder. What was once a well-meaning, if slightly annoying, academic phenomenon that kept mostly to campuses has escaped into the wider world. On top of this, the folks who say they hate political correctness have internalized its lessons, i.e., take offense at everything, lead with emotion over logic and play the victim card. \nLook no further than the kerfuffle involving Breitbart and Kellogg . Kellogg decided to pull its ads, so the supposedly anti-PC, pro-free-speech legions of Breitbart readers dusted off their pitchforks and torches. And … \nAnd nothing. Kellogg's business is likely not going to be hurt by any of it. \nIf there's one thing less effective than an actual mob, it's a virtual mob. \nIt's something for marketers, and humans in general, to keep in mind. A tweet is not the same thing as an action. A hashtag in support of Standing Rock doesn't actually do anything for the people gathered there. A tweet from Donald Trump isn't the same thing as a policy statement or a bill. (I suspect he knows that and knows how to leverage the knee-jerk outrage to his advantage, but that's another topic.) \nWords do matter, sure. But getting outraged over every little thing is not only exhausting, it's childish and lessens the impact of actual outrage. If we're all outraged all the time, when something is truly outrageous, no one cares. It's the equivalent of crying wolf. \nAnd a last word of advice for marketers. Don't do anything offensive or hurtful. Don't say anything offensive or hurtful on social media. And if you do do something stupid, especially if it's an accident, sit tight and give it a chance to blow over. In this article:",

McDonald's in China is a tall order The world's biggest fast-food chain couldn't have done much better than locking up Citic and Carlyle as buyers of its franchise in Asia's largest economy, Bloomberg writes. With the sale, McDonald's now gets out of running a difficult business in a country where tainted-food scandals are par for the course and politics can hobble income. 7. Ann Nathan, matriarch of River North Gallery scene, is closing Her 30-year-old gallery, as well as the Echt and Zygman Voss galleries, are shutting at the end of the year after losing their leases on Superior Street. Crain's has the story. —Each year, museums spend millions acquiring works for their permanent collections. Here are the deets behind 2016's most significant acquisitions, a la Chicago Magazine. 8. Italy's prime minister says he'll resign after reform rejected The country plunged into political and economic uncertainty as Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign after voters decisively rejected constitutional changes, a step certain to reverberate across a European Union already buffeted by anti-establishment anger. More from the New York Times. Lawmakers dropped the ball again in Springfield, skipping town Dec. 1 without passing a budget. But the Do-Nothing Gang did manage to get one thing done: passing a nifty bit of corporate welfare that benefits Exelon, writes Crain's Editorial Board. —Here's why Rauner should veto that bailout, writes Best Coalition Director Dave Lundy in this Crain's op-ed.",

      "text": "Food A Burger With a Hash Brown and Other Crazy Fast Food Items From Around the World McDonald's in Canada's newest menu item is a cheesy sandwich with waffle fries and an ice cream sundae. \nMcDonald's Deep-fried Pork Katsu Burger Stuffed With Cheese. Image credit: McDonald's Japan Watch Now December 5, 2016 \nIf you're traveling abroad and need a taste of home, take note: from McDonald’s to KFC to Dunkin’ Donuts, fast food eateries from across the globe take a slightly different approach to their greasy cuisines. \nCheck out these 17 fast food items that will either make your mouth water and/or your jaw drop. Potato Rosti Burger, McDonald's, Canada Image credit: McDonald's Canada Our neighbor to the north is now offering a burger with a hash brown patty, bacon, cheddar cheese and a cheese sauce, served with waffle cut fries and an ice cream sundae with caramel turtles on top. Nutella \"burger,\" McDonald's, Italy Image credit: McDonald's | Facebook \nIn Italy, McDonald's announced a new treat, called the \"Sweety con Nutella.\" It's two sweet rolls with a helping of the chocolate hazelnut spread, which actually originates from Italy. Cheese Katsu Burger, McDonald’s, Japan \nForget about a McDouble, McDonald’s in Japan is taking things up a notch with its new Cheese Katsu Burger . The item features traditional pork katsu -- a breaded and deep fried patty -- nested between two sesame buns. \nBut that’s not all -- what would this McDonald’s item be without an American twist? We're talking cheese, of course. The pork katsu cutlet is fried and oozing with cheese on the inside and also topped with cabbage and mayo. Zinger Double Down, KFC, Korea \nForget about your typical Double Down, KFC in Korea has taken things to another level. The Zinger Double Down is a burger topped with bacon and cheese that sits between two fried chicken fillets drenched in barbecue and white pepper sauce. \nIf that won’t make your heart stop -- we’re not sure what will. Lobster Surf & Turf Burger, Wendy’s, Japan Image credit: Kazuhiro Nogi | Getty Images \nWendy’s in Japan takes things up a notch by turning your fast food experience into fine dining. \nFor a limited time, Wendy’s Japan offered luxurious items such as a Lobster Surf & Turf Burger and the Premium Caviar & Lobster Sandwich. \nIn the past, the eatery's menu also offered a Foie Gras Burger smothered in goose liver and truffles sauce. The item was only available for a year and later removed from the menu in 2012. Gracoro Burger, McDonald’s, Japan Image credit: McDonald's Japan \nLike Wendy’s, McDonald’s also likes to test funky products on the Japanese market. \nMcDonald’s Gracoro Burger -- only available during winter -- features a patty filled with macaroni, shrimp and white sauce with a breadcrumb crust. The patty is topped with cheese and “demi-glace” sauce and sandwiched between buns. Chicken Tikka Masala, Taco Bell, India Image credit: Taco Bell India In India, many customers don’t go to Taco Bell for a Mexican-style Burrito. Instead, Taco Bell locations offer takes on the country's traditional items, such as a Chicken Tikka Masala Burrito or rice bowls adorned with a variety of spices. Kimchi Quesadilla, Taco Bell, South Korea \nSince its release in June, this mashup has been a surprising hit at Taco Bells in Korea, making up some 10 percent of the restaurant's sales in the country. \nThe Kimchi Quesadilla combines the traditional Korean dish with the Bell’s chicken and cheese Quesadilla. Deep Fried Salmon, KFC, Japan Image credit: KFC Japan Move over fried chicken -- at KFC, Deep Fried Salmon was a hot commodity. The name says it all: the dish is simple fried salmon with your favorite KFC dipping sauce. Pork and Seaweed Donut, Dunkin’ Donuts, China Image credit: Dunkin' Donuts China Forget about sprinkles and chocolate -- in China, Dunkin’ Donuts takes a saltier approach: the Pork and Seaweed Donut is exactly what it sounds like. Flying Fish Roe Salmon Cream Cheese Pizza, Pizza Hut, Hong Kong Image credit: Pizza Hut Hong Kong \nIn America, we think Pizza Hut’s cheese-filled crusts are bizarre -- but maybe this item will make us think twice. \nIn Hong Kong, Pizza Hut’s limited-edition Flying Fish Roe Salmon Cream Cheese Pizza is out-of-this-world whacky. The 2014 limited-time item featured crust filled with salmon flavored cream cheese and flying fish roe (fish eggs). \nThe pie was available in two flavors: Crayfish Seafood Deluxe (crayfish, scallops, shrimp, clams, cherry tomatoes, peppers, red onions and thousand island sauce) and Sausage, Pepperoni & Pomelo. Double Down Dog, KFC, Philippines Image credit: KFC Philippines In January last year, KFC lovers hurried to try KFC’s craziest concoction. With only 50 served at participating stores in the Philippines, patrons clamored to get their hands on the Double Down Dog -- a hot dog wrapped in a fried chicken bun. Cheeseburger Pizza Crust, Pizza Hut, U.K. Image credit: Pizza Hut UK \nHere’s a solution to all you indecisive eaters. \nCan’t decide between a pizza or a cheeseburger? At Pizza Huts in the U.K, you can order your pizza with a Cheeseburger Pizza Crust . The 2,000-plus calorie dish initially debuted in pizza huts in the Middle East and has since expanded north to the U.K. Cheetos Crunchwrap Slider, Taco Bell, Canada Image credit: Taco Bell Canada \nAlthough it has yet to make its way to the American market, Canadian Taco Bells recently released a Cheetos Crunchwrap Slider for a limited time. \nA junk foodie’s dream, the new item comes in three flavors: Beefy Cheddar, Spicy Chicken and Supreme -- all of which are infused with Cheetos, of course. Green Peas Patty Sub, Subway, India Image credit: Subway India \nTo replace meat for the country's large population of vegetarians, Indian Subways offer a variety of alternatives -- one of the most popular being the Green Peas Patty sub . \nAloo Patties (made with potatoes), Chatpana Chana Patties (made with chickpeas) and Hara Bhara Patties (made with potatoes and green vegetables) are also among the vegetarian offerings. Guacamole and Salsa Loaded Fries, McDonald’s, Australia Image credit: McDonald's Australia Now this one might get your mouth watering. McDonald’s famous fries just got even better. With the option to add toppings to “ Loaded Fries ,” customers can enjoy fries topped with cheese and bacon or guacamole and salsa. Choco Marsh, Taco Bell, Spain Image credit: Taco Bell Spain If you have a sweet tooth, Taco Bell in Spain has the perfect thing: the Choco Marsh is a tortilla filled with chocolate and marshmallow.

      "text": "How McDonald's Revamped McCafe Could Beat Starbucks It's all about identifying the target customer. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of Insight , a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named Bariso one of its top three management writers of the year. His forthcoming book, EQ, Applied, shares fascinating research, modern examples, and personal stories that illustrate both high and low EQ--as demonstrated in the real world. Advertisement \nWe need to talk about McCafe. \nMcDonald's will reintroduce the coffee shop in 2017, in attempt to challenge Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. \nVia Bloomberg: \n\"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. \nSound familiar? \nThe world's largest fast-food chain is also raising its game by providing an equipment upgrade. The new espresso machines, which are more technologically advanced than the current ones, reportedly cost about $12,000 each. \nWith Starbucks C.E.O. Howard Schultz stepping down in April next year, the timing couldn't be better for McDonald's. McDonald's Advantage \nThere's no questioning Starbucks is the king of the coffee world right now, and the best McDonald's can hope for now is to cut a small slice of market share for itself. The company reportedly opened its first stand-alone McCafe in Toronto last year, so it will be interesting to see if it continues with that strategy. \nBut if you ask me, McDonald's should focus on one strategy above all others: \nMake McCafe nice. Sophisticated , even. \nBut also make it family-friendly. \nHere's why I say that: \nThere's a McDonalds my family and I have been to that's a little more upscale than your typical fast-food chain. (Yes, it houses a McCafe as well.) \nAs my wife and I recently enjoyed what I considered a good cappuccino, we couldn't help but notice the comfortable, plush leather seats. The décor and lighting were also very contemporary, and the music was pleasant. At one point, we looked at each other and asked the same thing: \"Is this really a McDonald's?\" \nBut the best part was that our two young children weren't bored. There was plenty to do, with multiple video game stations and a large \"Play Place\" outside. My kids were overjoyed to get their happy meals, after which they went off for a little fun. And my wife and I were able to enjoy a cup of coffee and decent conversation, while keeping an eye on the kids. (No easy task with children the age of ours.) \nI've never seen another McDonald's/McCafe combination like this one, so I'm assuming it's an individual franchise operator who decided to go above and beyond. But if McDonald's is smart, they'll start building more. \nBecause it ain't the hipsters and coffee connoisseurs they're going to win over. \nIt's the friends with kids. Like this column?

      "text": "Previous Next \nNEW BERN, N.C. - A customer placing her order in the drive-thru line at a North Carolina McDonald's was shocked by what she allegedly heard being said through the intercom speaker. \n\"You know, I'm actually on the toilet right now and I'm just going to serve you your food. I'm not even going to wash my hands,\" a man is heard saying through the radio in a video shot by the customer, according to New Bern's WCTI-TV . \nThe video was recorded Sunday and has reportedly been viewed more than 38,000 times on Facebook. \n\"You know what, just pull forward because I'm going to give you whatever the f--- I feel like giving you,\" the person is also heard saying in the video of the intercom. \nThe owner of that McDonald's location reported the incident to local police and blamed the vulgar exchange on hackers, according to WCTI. Employees at the restaurant said the intercom's radio frequency had apparently been accessed by pranksters. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

Yes, you read that correctly. \nMcDonald's Canada announced last week that the chain will be testing the new menu item, and our neighbor to the north just became even more attractive. As if waffle fries weren't enough, McD's Canada is also testing out a new hash brown burger . RELATED McDonald's Is Now Serving a Nutella Burger » \nGet 'em while you can, because these puppies are available only through the holidays. That is, of course, if the item that just got bumped to the top of our wish lists isn't granted . . .

      "text": "McDonald's Is Putting Potatoes In Its Burgers (And That's Not All) What is happening at the home of the Big Mac? You tell me. Owner, Howard Raucous LLC @ ChrisMatyszczyk WRITE A COMMENT And Americans must do without. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nAbsurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \nEvery time I walk or drive past a McDonald's these days, I wonder what depravities might be happening inside. \nCulinary depravities, that is. \nThey've even started serving burgers that are full of Nutella instead of meat . \nWhat's next? The Anaconda Burger? The Quinoa Burger? \nOh, it's more inventive than that. Here's the mere name: the Potato Rosti & Bacon Burger . \nPlease imagine walking into your local McDonald's and putting on your poshest accent to utter the word \"Rosti.\" Can you do that? \nBut wait. What is a Rosti? It's one of those words you see on menus, but you're too shy to ask, in case you get a condescending stare-down from a server. \nIt seems that this snooty term couches something with which Americans will be familiar: the Hash-Brown Patty. \nYes, McDonald's is putting potatoes into its burgers. The full list of ingredients in this glorious concoction: bacon pieces, potato rosti, cheddar, and cheese sauce on a toasted, rolled-oat-topped bun. \nNot everyone, however, will be privileged enough to try one of these Rosti delicacies. It's only available in Canada. \nThe country to which almost every Hollywood star has (said they would, but hasn't yet) emigrated to will now have a singularly festive joy, while American McDonald's eaters content themselves with the dazzle of Peppermint Mocha. \nThis favoritism toward our cousins of the North is breathtaking. It's made worse, though, by the fact that they can accompany this potato-headed burger with something else: Waffle Cut Fries. \nIt's as if McDonald's is choosing to limit the scope of its imagination for Americans, while rolling out the red and yellow carpet for Canadians. \nI contacted McDonald's to ask why this apparent favoritism is occurring. Is this some strange nod to Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau and his affectionate feelings for Fidel \"All Your Waffle Cut Fries Are Belong To Us\" Castro? \nIs someone at McDonald's obsessed with hockey and got it into their heads that this is a Waffle Puck Fry? \nMcDonald's didn't immediately get back to me, but I'll be sure to update, should it choose to explain this international incident. \nAs Americans lurch toward the Holidays, their hearts in their mouths, they'll perhaps cast an envious eye toward the stomachs of the north and wonder: \"Why not us?\" The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

      "text": "Michael Keaton reveals the face of American greed in the shrewd McDonald's drama 'The Founder' 'The Founder' Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc in \"The Founder.\" Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc in \"The Founder.\" (Weinstein Co.) Justin Chang from a shrewd script by Robert Siegel, “The Founder” moves briskly and assuredly from one well-constructed scene to the next, propelled by currents of dialogue that, while barbed and engaging, have none of Aaron Sorkin ’s hyper-articulate verbal fireworks.\nWhat the two movies do have in common — with each other, and with another Sorkin-scripted drama, “The Social Network”— is a fascination with a powerfully disruptive moment in American commerce. They also prove more than willing to defy the traditional, often tedious dramatic logic that a protagonist — particularly one based on a real-life person — must be an inherently heroic or likable figure. \nThat’s not to suggest that we feel nothing for Kroc, who is played with alternately ratty and reptilian intelligence by Michael Keaton — an actor too generous, and too instinctively fair-minded, not to imbue even his most unsavory alter egos with at least a glimmer of soul. \nWhen we first meet Kroc in 1954, wearily hawking milkshake machines at drive-in diners across the heartland, we’re impressed by the practiced fluency of his sales pitch even as we sense the corroded spirit behind it; the trappings of personal failure and disappointment are as unmistakable and overpowering as the smell of fry grease. \nBut when Kroc hears about McDonald’s Hamburgers, a restaurant out in San Bernardino that has become an overnight sensation, he makes the long drive west to meet Richard “Dick” McDonald (Nick Offerman) and Maurice “Mac” McDonald (John Carroll Lynch). The brothers happily explain how they tossed out the problematic drive-in model and introduced the kind of speed, consistency and convenience — all-paper packaging, a mechanized system of production and assembly — that we have long since come to associate with not just the McDonald’s brand, but the fast-food industry in general. \nThe flashback-heavy sequence that brings all this together — tightly edited by Robert Frazen, in rhythm with the McDonald’s employees’ own clockwork-precise movements — is a small masterpiece of narrative compression. It’s also a deceptively optimistic tribute to American innovation in action. You might not emerge from “The Founder” craving a hamburger with a machine-tooled distribution of onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard but you can’t help but admire the skill and ingenuity with which it all comes together. \nSomething similar might be said of “The Founder,” whose sneaky brilliance lies in its tonal control, its way of calling our own sympathies and ideals into question. At every step the movie honors the McDonald brothers’ decency and humility, their heroic commitment to ensuring quality at their flagship San Bernardino location. (Lynch and Offerman’s good-bro-bad-bro routine is a delight.) But it also allows us to appreciate Kroc’s thrilling, enormous vision of those heavenly Golden Arches stretching from coast to coast. Finally winning over the brothers, he tells them, “Do it for America.” \nHancock traces the fallout of this Faustian bargain with impressive nuance, clarity and a rigorous attention to the sort of procedural minutiae — the laws and loopholes of franchise real estate, the moral and logistical implications of a powdered milkshake — that might have bogged down a less assured telling. In doing so, he turns the unlikely subject of a fast-food chain into a quasi-religious satire, a parable of American striving and, ultimately, a study of artisanal integrity gradually caving in to commercial compromise. \nThat tension was also at the heart of Hancock’s previous film, “Saving Mr. Banks,” an under-appreciated comic portrait of the author P.L. Travers and her battle with Walt Disney for the soul of Mary Poppins. Like that movie, “The Founder” bolsters its leads with several perfectly calibrated supporting performances, including from B.J. Novak as Harry Sonneborn, the finance whiz who would eventually become McDonald’s Corp.’s first president and CEO, and Linda Cardellini as Joan Smith, a business associate whose seductive ruthlessness turns out to match Kroc’s own. Best of all is Laura Dern, tamping down her natural radiance and letting a silent tragedy play out in the face of Kroc’s long-neglected wife, Ethel. \nOne of the smoothest, most reliable craftsmen now working in Hollywood, Hancock has a particular feel for smart, uncondescending stories set in the American heartland (as does Siegel, who wrote the scripts for “The Wrestler” and “Big Fan”). He also brings to the table a subtly sardonic attitude that helps cut through the sentimentalism that creeps in around the edges of his movies, including “The Rookie” and “The Blind Side.” \nThat attitude is especially pronounced in “The Founder,” as evidenced by Carter Burwell’s moody, jaundiced score, and by the work of the cinematographer John Schwartzman, who often favors long shots over closeups — a tactic that especially suits the movie’s visual tribute to the heyday of the American drive-in diner, as well as its grim montages of identical-looking McDonald’s locations opening in state after state, city after city. \n“The Founder” isn’t a McDonald’s takedown in the manner of, say, Morgan Spurlock’s documentary “Super Size Me”; it is, on one level, an elegy for what the company might have been, but it’s also wise enough to know that McDonald’s is interesting only because of what it became. Not without reason, many will interpret the movie as a timely study in Trumpian decadence, the story of an unprincipled self-made businessman trampling over a nation’s higher ideals. \nI myself couldn’t help but wonder if the movie struck a particularly resonant chord with executive producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, two empire builders who know firsthand what it feels like to have a family-branded company taken away from them. I also had to marvel at the irony that a movie about the challenges of promotion and distribution has, until now, been so clumsily mishandled in those departments — up to and including the Weinstein Co. ’s decision, after months of repositioning “The Founder” on its 2016 release calendar, to move up its Oscar-qualifying run at the last minute. \nThe film is now playing for a week at Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood, and will open wide on Jan. 20. Whether you see it now or later, it’s a tastier, more nourishing meal than the packaging implies.",
