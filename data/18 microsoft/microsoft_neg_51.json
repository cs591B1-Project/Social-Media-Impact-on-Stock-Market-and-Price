      "title": "Chrome 55 Muzzles Memory Usage, Cripples Flash And Continues Efforts To Crush Microsoft Edge",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Chrome 55 Muzzles Memory Usage, Cripples Flash And Continues Efforts To Crush Microsoft Edge There’s no question that Google Chrome is by far the most dominant player in the desktop browser market. As we reported in early November, Chrome has more market share than both Internet Explorer and Edge combined. And over the past year, Chrome has seen its market share climb from 35 percent to 55 percent.\nDuring its meteoric rise, Microsoft has done its best to assail Chrome and promote its Edge browser as the faster and more efficient choice for Windows 10 users. But with Chrome 53, Google gave Windows 10 users a 15 percent speed boost by using Microsoft Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) technology. Now, with Chrome 55, Google is putting the browser’s insane memory usage in check . \nChrome 55, which is available to download today via the stable channel, has significant changes to its V8 JavaScript engine that enable its parsers and compilers to use available memory more efficiently. Google’s optimizations mean that Chrome 55 reduces peak zone memory consumption by 40 percent on average, while heap size has seen a 50 percent decrease. \nThe newest version of Chrome also takes another step towards killing Adobe Flash , which is excellent news in our book. Chrome 55 defaults to HTML5 , and only exempts sites that are Flash-only. “For those, you’ll be prompted to enable Flash when you first visit the site,” said Google’s Anthony LaForge back in August. “Aside from that, the only change you’ll notice is a safer and more power-efficient browsing experience.” \nYou’ll also find an array of bugs that have been squashed with Chrome 55, all of which you can examine on the official Chrome blog. Chrome 55 is currently available for Windows, macOS and Linux desktop platforms. It will soon be rolling out to Android and iOS users as well.",

      "text": "If you are in need of a bit of music for this Holiday -- read Christmas -- season, then Microsoft has you covered. The company has just launched the Holiday Album Giveaway on Windows Store.\nWhat you get? Nine Christmas themed albums for you to enjoy, or not. The enjoyment question depends on whether you like Justin Bieber.\n\nLets take a look at the nine albums:\nJustin Bieber – Under The Mistletoe, Deluxe Edition Ariana Grande – Christmas Kisses Mary J. Blige – A Mary Christmas The Jackson 5 – Ultimate Christmas Collection Rod Stewart – Merry Christmas, Baby (Deluxe) Vince Guaraldi – A Charlie Brown Christmas, Remastered & Expanded Edition Boris Karloff – How The Grinch Stole Christmas: Original Soundtrack Various Artists – A Motown Christmas Trans-Siberian Orchestra – Dreams Of Fireflies (On A Christmas Night) All you need to do is open Windows Store on your device. I tested this on Windows 10 and it worked, but don't know if Windows 8.x users will also be able to grab the free albums or if the offer is Windows 10 exclusive.\nYou can use the links as well posted above to go to individual album pages right away. Click on the free link there to open the linked Store page and start the download of the album from there.\nMicrosoft displays the Holiday Giveaway Album link on the front of the Store. It opens the collection of nine albums, all free.\nYou may pick one, some or all. Click on the album that you want, and then on the free button on the next page. This links the album to your account. Repeat the process for any other album you want.\nOnce done, you may hit the play button right away to start playback of one of the albums. All albums are downloaded to the local system automatically from where you can play them.\nYou find them in the Music\\Purchases folder on the device. Please note that you can play the songs in any music player, not just Groove. I have tested playback in AIMP3 and it worked just fine.\nEnjoy, and have a nice weekend.\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Microsoft Holiday Album Giveaway: grab 9 free albums appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "I want to create a subnet for the exclusive use of Point to Site VPN 10.200.0.0 /16 \nWhen I do so in the portal, the VPN client will add a default route for 10.0.0.0/8. Microsoft's justification for this is in RFC1918, and they refuse to allow me to customize this route. In my opinion they clearly misunderstand that this RFC doesn't apply in this case. \nWhen I change the netmask to 168.192.1.0 a Class B route is applied. This works, but it's annoying that I need to deviate from my numbering pattern because of Microsoft Support's misinterpretation of the RFC \nTheir reply: \nAs specified by RFC 1918 , Address space must be a private address range, specified in CIDR notation 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16. \nNote that the following routes will be added to the client, respectively, for directing traffic from the local machine to the virtual network: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0, 172.16.0.0/255.255.0.0, or 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0. This means that, for example, you may not be able to contact other 10.0.0.0/8 addresses on your local subnet if you have specified 10.0.0.0/8 for your VPN client address space. \nAny address space which you chose to starts with 10.x.x.x will result with this problem (not just 10.0.0.0/8). The VPN client package will treat this VPN address space as a Class A (255.0.0.0 subnet mask) regardless of how the you chooses to define it in Azure (for ex : 10.1.0.0/24). \nSo we always ask our customers to use a 192.168.0.0/X range when creating their P2S environment, and to make sure it doesn’t overlap with any subnet they may have on-premises (where their P2S clients are connecting from). \nQuestion Should Microsoft support a custom CIDR mask for the 10.x range? How can I persuade them otherwise?",

      "text": "According to Wainhouse Research, “The video conferencing industry entered a phase of strong transition in the past year. Driven by changes in the workforce, new strategies for the workplace, and new technologies and products driving improvements in price/performance, the industry is experiencing rapid growth in some segments, modest declines in others, and bumpy ups and downs in others still .” Author Andrew Davis explains that the proliferation of video-enabled personal and mobile devices and an increase in cloud-based video services are among the list of factors contributing to this transition. \n\nIn our upcoming December 6 webinar, Davis, senior analyst and partner at Wainhouse Research, will explore the transition of the video conferencing market. Davis will be joined by Scott Wharton, vice president and general manager of Logitech Video Collaboration and BJ Haberkorn, director of product management at Microsoft. Haberkorn will provide insight into the newest Skye Room Systems meeting solutions, and Wharton will provide an in-depth look at Logitech SmartDock . If you are currently using or thinking of using Skype for Business in your meeting rooms, you won’t want to miss this webinar. \nRegister for the webinar (Dec. 6 at 11 am PT/2pm ET) here and secure your free copy of the Wainhouse report. \nThe post Webinar: Modernizing the Meeting Room with Wainhouse Research, Microsoft and Logitech appeared first on Blog .\n",

At first, it was thought that Home Hub would be some sort of Amazon Echo competitor, and although that's not entirely true, it isn't entirely false either.\nSo just what is it, then? Our sources have confirmed that Home Hub is a Windows 10 feature designed to make your PC the center of your home, by making shared PCs more communal and bringing the connected home to Windows.\n\nWe've been speaking with various sources to piece together everything planned for Home Hub — it's a really big project for Microsoft. So much so that not everything detailed here will likely make the initial release, and may even get cut before it ever reaches Insiders. With that in mind, settle in for a detailed look at what Microsoft has envisioned for Home Hub. ",

      "text": "Summary \nAt Microsoft's Shareholder Meeting, investors asked about the future of Windows Phone. \nWindows Phone (mostly Lumias) will probably be allowed to die, but this isn't the end of Windows on mobile devices. \nSurface Phone, running an Intel processor and a full version of Windows, will offer Windows users the mobile device they've always wanted. At Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) recent shareholder meeting, investors expressed concern about the company's strategy for mobile. Indeed, with the dismantling of the Nokia experiment, it has seemed that the strategy was simply to cut losses. Although CEO Satya Nadella vowed to continue support for Windows Phone, it's clear that the platform is dying. This will conclude Microsoft's ill-fated attempts to port Windows to ARM processors for smartphones and tablets. Windows users should not mourn overmuch. Click to enlarge Source: Nokia Power User Asking the Tough Questions What I found so refreshing about Microsoft's Shareholder Meeting was that shareholders were finally asking the questions about the company's mobile strategy that analysts have been studiously avoiding for the past year. The collapse of Lumia sales and the lack of a successor to the Lumia line were taboo subjects at earnings conference calls. During the Q&A , shareholder Jim Pierce laid it on the line: \nI've heard that you're stepping away from mobile. Can you calm me down and tell me where your future, what your vision is for mobile? Nadella's reply: \nWhat we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated in Windows Phone, it's manageability, it's security, it's Continuum capability, that is the ability to have a phone that, in fact, can even act like a PC. \nSo we're going to double down on those points of differentiation. In fact, the HP X3, which came out recently, is perhaps a great example of a differentiated device built using the Windows Phone platform, and that sort of points to the direction. Earlier this year, I highlighted the HP (NYSE: HPQ ) Elite x3 and its Continuum capability as the \"Killer App\" that Windows Phone has needed. Source: HP Alas, Continuum, even on the x3 was less than completely satisfying, and the compromises in using it are well described by PCWorld : \nFor simple paper-to-digital data entry on a spreadsheet, firing off email, or typing your thoughts into a document, Continuum will work just fine. It might even be an ideal solution. \nThe minute you need to use two or more productivity apps at once, however, Continuum's cracks start to show. Maybe one day Continuum will be ready for me, but not yet. In the meantime, I'll have to keep lugging that trusty laptop around wherever my travels take me. The compromises inherent in Continuum are inherent in the fact that Windows Phone isn't a full-up version of Windows. It's a port to ARM architecture, which means that legacy Windows apps are inaccessible. And even though the x3's Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) Snapdragon 820 processor is among the best available for smartphones, it strains mightily under the burden of running a Windows Phone. At this stage, the Continuum feature is more interesting than compelling. In this light, a recent report that Microsoft is testing a Surface Phone with the new Snapdragon 835 processor is not particularly encouraging. The 835 will be fabricated on Samsung's ( OTC:SSNLF ) new 10 nm node, and will be Qualcomm's most powerful mobile processor to date. That may not be enough, however. Reportedly, the processor is being evaluated for an x86 emulation mode. Yuck. I can't imagine a worse user experience. Processor emulation rarely works acceptably, and then only if the processor doing the emulation is much more powerful than the processor being emulated. Using an ARM processor to emulate an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) processor doesn't seem like a winning approach. What Works Sometimes companies will try out a technical approach just to verify that it doesn't work. I hope that this is just such a case. x86 emulation is a recognition of the various problems that have always existed with Windows on ARM: lack of legacy app support, lack of developer support, lack of performance. But it's not a solution to any of them. Here's what I think will work. Give up on Windows on ARM. Give up even on a separate OS platform. Instead of building Windows into a smartphone, build the smartphone into Windows as an inherent capability. There would only be one processor platform: Intel. That makes things a lot easier for developers. They don't have to worry about testing universal apps on a multitude of different processor platforms. Although Intel bailed out of mobile phones earlier this year, Intel's 10 nm devices will probably be suitable for very small phablet devices. Don't bother with Continuum. All Windows devices should implement the full version of Windows, and therefore be capable of desktop mode automatically. Offering a seamless, unified experience across all Windows devices will be essential to increasing the Windows penetration into mobile. Other than necessary compromises to accommodate small screens, Windows OS should be the same regardless of form factor. Nadella is on the right track. Continuum was intriguing, but not compelling because it stopped short of being what Windows users need and expect in terms of performance. Offering a full Windows OS in a device you can put in your pocket will be compelling. Such devices will naturally accommodate external monitors and input devices, just as Surface Pro does now. This is the Surface Phone device that Windows users want. Investor Takeaway Microsoft and Intel are approaching an interesting confluence of mutual interests. Both want to get back into mobile, and both must partner with each other in order to do so. With the arrival of Intel's 10 nm processors next year, Microsoft will finally have the platform that it has needed to realize the vision that is only previewed in Continuum. Whatever cost disadvantage that Intel might suffer compared to ARM processors is rendered moot for Surface Phone. The value of running a full Windows OS on a mobile device more than compensates. This confluence of interests and capabilities is probably why we haven't seen or heard too much on the smartphone front from either company. Microsoft has gotten rid of the massive Nokia apparatus for generating money-losing smartphones to everyone's relief. With its Surface devices, Microsoft has shown that it can make limited production of high-quality devices work as a business. For Intel, Surface Phone will simply be one more Windows application of its lightweight Core M series processors. Surface Phone volumes may not be large, but it won't matter in the grand scheme of things. Surface Phone, running a full Windows OS, will allow Microsoft to reenter the smartphone market on its own terms, and it could tap into considerable pent-up demand. I continue to rate both MSFT and INTC as holds, pending developments in Intel's 10 nm processors and Microsoft's Surface Phone. Disclosure: I am/we are long QCOM.

      "text": "Could this Microsoft smart grip be the solution to your swing problems? By Twitter An entire industry is built upon improving your golf game. From teachers to books to training aids, there are multiple assets available for the average hack to better their performance. While those resources work to varying degrees, Microsoft might be close to simplifying the diagnosis of your entire swing. All from how you hold the club. Sensoria, a partner of Microsoft, recently teamed up with Bryson DeChambeau to create the Smart Grip. The device reveals DeChambeau's hand-on-grip position and levels of pressure, reads his strokes on different clubs and sends real-time data to Microsoft intelligent systems. This info runs through an app that studies the data, providing visual and audio feedback. Better yet, the app stores previous swings, allowing comparison to the past and giving the present context. Facebook How does the Smart Grip gather this information? The instrument is under half an ounce and just one-inch square, harvesting the input from pressure sensors in each grip. Through this data, DeChambeau can figure out a consistent grip with different clubs, along with the ideal swing speed, plane, and tempo. The product is still in the testing stages, and like most training devices, it can't be used in real play. Nevertheless, the Smart Grip could be the next step in inching you closer to more consistent -- and likely better -- golf.",

We used to run 3v3 scrims in Gears 2 with custom game variants years ago and can't wait to be able to do that again for old times sake. Regardless of what the naysayers say about backward compatibility, it isn't anything other than a plus since it's a free feature that allows for more games.

      "title": "Microsoft’s Home Hub expected to re-innovate a shared family Windows 10 PC",
      "text": "\nOver the past few months, there’s been a couple of rumors regarding Microsoft’s “HomeHub.” According to rumors, the software giant built a Cortana-powered device for your kitchen, similar to Amazon’s Echo speaker and Google’s Home device. We also reported about Microsoft’s Home Hub recently , but details regarding the product have been pretty scarce so far.\nToday, a new report provided a closer look at the Microsoft Home Hub. As it turns out, Microsoft is planning something much bigger than just a device powered by Cortana for your kitchen.\nWith the Home Hub, Microsoft essentially plans on re-innovating a shared PC running Windows 10. Home Hub will allow a family to share a PC between different members in the family, but it’ll provide a streamlined experience for authentication. Firstly, HomeHub will apparently have a “family account” which will be always logged in on a PC — and users will be able to access some of the authorized apps and content without a password.\n“Family Enabled Apps” is basically Kids Corner 2.0\nFrom the main account, all users can access the Family Desktop which will have “Family Enabled Apps” — these are basically apps that are enabled to be used without a password, and allow family members to share data. This feature does, indeed, sound a lot like Windows Phone’s Kids Corner features. It is worth noting that members of a family will also have different accounts on the same PC with content which is only accessible by themselves — and they’ll be able to log in very easily with Windows Hello.\nAnother substantial part of HomeHub is expected to be the “Welcome Screen”. This feature will simply a shared workspace with an overview of your day in the desktop which includes details regarding your upcoming appointment, sticky notes, to-do lists — and it’ll be accessible to everyone in the family.\n“FamTana” will allow Cortana to work with multiple users on a shared family PC\nHome Hub features will also be integrated into Cortana — which is apparently codenamed “FamTana” (Family Cortana). This feature will basically be able to distinguish between different members of the family, and it’ll be interact with users based on their personal details. For instance, it will be able to provide details from a certain user’s Notebook in the family. Another app Microsoft is working on is called the “Connected Home” which will be a hub for all of the smart devices in your home — this includes smart bulbs, locks, and other smart home devices.\nDevices powered by Home Hub will arrive as early as late-2017\nAll Windows 10 PCs should theoretically be able to run Home Hub, and they should also come with the full Windows 10 PC experience. However, Microsoft is apparently in talks with its OEM partners regarding All-In-One devices designed “specifically for Home Hub” which could arrive in late 2017.\nFrom the looks of things, Microsoft has a lot of huge things planned for Home Hub. The software giant is clearly working on a big project here, so it’ll be quite interesting to see if it succeeds. Keep in mind that things are still under development, so some of the mentioned features may not even show up in the future. If Microsoft decides to go ahead with Home Hub, users should be able to enjoy the full-fledged experience in 2018 — but early versions of the feature and devices powered by Home Hub should arrive in 2017.",

Certain Dell machines will be discounted by as much as 40 percent on the 11th day of the promotion, and on the last day, Microsoft is cutting up to $200 off the Surface Pro 4 while throwing in a free $159 Type Cover.\nThere will be promotions covering tablets, laptops, Xbox One consoles, games, and even the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift VR headsets at various times through the month. Offers will be available online and in-store while stocks last, with the promotion of the day changing at midnight Pacific each day.\nIf you elect to visit one of the physical stores, there's a second set of daily promotions available on top of the 12 days of deals; this set includes a $120 price cut (down to $179) on certain Xbox One consoles on Sunday, December 11.",

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nOn Tuesday, Microsoft Corporation announced that its HoloLens will be available for pre-order in Japan starting December 2. It will be available from the Microsoft Store in Japan, and shipping will begin in early 2017. \nMicrosoft HoloLens is the world's first self-contained holographic computing that runs on Windows 10. It was first announced in January 2015 and has been shipped to developers and commercial partners in both US and Canada on March 31 this year. \nPR Newswire reported that the announcement was made six weeks after Microsoft HoloLens Dev Edition and Microsoft HoloLens Commercial Suite expanded globally. It is now available in Canada, Australia, France, Ireland, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, UK and US. . Advertisement \nAlex Kipman, technical staff of Microsoft Windows and Devices Group, said, \"Our Mission at Microsoft is to bring a mixed reality to every person and organization on the planet\". Mr. Kipman went on, \"We continue to be inspired by the work developers and customers are doing with HoloLens across the globe.\" \nKipman also added that people in Microsoft have been hard at work since January 2015 to bring the vision of mixed reality to life. They can't wait to see what everyone in Japan creates when they get their hands on HoloLens, as reported by Kit Guru . \nMicrosoft HoloLens is part of a handful of products that include Magic's Leap Headset. These headset offers a very different take on virtual works than VR headsets do, as they have good visual details with unique components added in them. \nThere are many companies that are using HoloLens, and it is used by Japan Airlines in Japan right now. The market revenue in 2016 for the augmented reality and virtual reality market is USD 5.2 billion, which can reach up to more than a whopping USD 162 billion in 2020. Advertisement \nIn 2017, Windows 10 will be updated to include Windows Holographic which is a platform that powers the mixed-reality experiences to give a virtual feel to the world. SEE ALSO ",

      "text": "  16:45 PM EST Powershelf(R) and Hitachi Consulting Introduce New IoT Smart Retail Shelves Powered by Microsoft Azure PRWeb \nPowershelf(R) and Hitachi Consulting are working with Microsoft to introduce smart shelves to US retail stores. The new Powershelf smart shelf units will be installed in 15 supermarkets of a leading Midwest supermarket chain. KING'S HAWIIAN(R), America's leading provider of Hawaiian food, will be the first to use the new smart shelves to reduce out-of-stock incidents and ensure shoppers can find its products while shopping this holiday season. By dramatically reducing the amount of time KING'S HAWAIIAN shelves are empty, the company is making customers' shopping experiences a little less frustrating and also limiting the revenue that can potentially be lost when shelves are empty. \nThe units consist of a series of shelves that hold and display products. Built-in Powershelf technology tracks product availability; when a shelf is empty, a restocking alert is automatically sent to store personnel. The solution utilizes Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to analyze when, where, and why products sell so fast, allowing retailers and consumer product companies to identify trends and avoid out of stocks before they ever happen. \nJohn Linehan, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development at KING'S HAWAIIAN, was impressed with early pilot results and believes the technology will lead to better customer satisfaction and improved sales performance. \"Improving out of stocks is an important strategy for KING'S HAWAIIAN, and Powershelf will give us the data to manage this metric most effectively,\" said Linehan. \"We look forward to expanding this technology to as many of our retailers as soon as it is practical.\" \nKING'S HAWAIIAN and its respective retailers and distributors will be able to access data gathered by the units--including historical out-of-stock incidents and loss of potential sales--in real-time through the Internet of Things (IoT) with a customized digital dashboard co-developed by Microsoft and Hitachi Consulting. \n\"We have spent years working with our partners to develop this IoT solution that helps to solve out of stocks, and I am excited to see it introduced in time for this holiday shopping season,\" said Larry McWilliams Co-CEO of Powershelf. \"By making more products available we are providing shoppers with a more positive shopping experience, while reducing the cost of restocking. This is a powerful first step into the future of retail.\" \nBrendan O'Meara, Managing Director of Worldwide Retail at Microsoft, explained why the data gathered by these units is so valuable. \"Our collaboration with Powershelf enables us to leverage the Microsoft Cloud to combine a retailer's inventory data with the data Powershelf sensors gather from the store floor and visualize it using Power BI tools,\" said O'Meara. \"Decision makers can use their custom dashboard to see the state of their stores and supply chains in real-time and react much faster than in the past.\" \nAbout Powershelf Powershelf is a leading provider of retail technology solutions. The patented technology--the Powershelf system--provides constant power and two-way communications to software-enabled applications and devices that deliver a variety of advertising, merchandising and pricing services to customers.

      "title": "This is Microsoft's Home Hub, coming to Windows 10 PCs next year",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 11 minutes ago with 1 comment \nEarlier this year, there were rumors that Microsoft was working on a Cortana-powered standalone device that would compete with Amazon's Echo. Those rumors turned out to be untrue, as Home Hub is actually a feature of Windows 10 . Today, a report from Windows Central tells us more about Home Hub. \nOne thing that's clear is that Home Hub is most certainly not a dedicated device, but since it runs on a Windows 10 PC, it can turn your all-in-one into an Echo- or Home-style device. The goal is to make the PC more family-centric, allowing members of the family to use shared resources. \nAs it stands right now, everyone accesses a PC through individual accounts, and there's also a guest account. With Home Hub, there will be a family account, which will allow users to access a subset of features without logging in, such as a shared calendar, appointments, specific apps, and so on. \nThere will also be a shared Welcome Screen, which will show information from those shared resources. The Welcome Screen is meant to be visible and informative, running on top of the desktop experience, and Cortana will always be listening while it's on. \nYou'll notice that the Cortana logo has an orange outline around it, and that's meant to differentiate between an individual user's notebook and the family's. Internally, this is being called \"FamTana\", and it's designed to make Cortana more family-friendly, which would be a unique advantage over many of its competitors, such as Google's Home. \nAccording to the report, there's nothing stopping third-party OEMs from building their own Home Hub devices, but Microsoft is encouraging them to build all-in-one PCs around the idea. Ideally, these devices would be created for the living room or the kitchen. \nOf course, one has to wonder if any of this will be an advantage at all. These days, pretty much all members of a household have their own computing devices, whether it's a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or something else. Devices like Amazon's Echo have worked so well precisely because they don't have screens. Would anyone really be served better with an all-in-one PC in their kitchen then they would with, say, and Echo Dot? \nBut then again, some families might not be able to afford additional hardware (and some may find it simply unnecessary), and since Home Hub will work on existing PCs, it could end up being useful to some users. \nThe answer to that question won't arrive for some time, as Home Hub is slated to arrive throughout Redstone 2, 3, and 4. Redstone 2 is the Creators Update, which is slated to arrive early next year , with Redstone 3 coming in late 2017 and Redstone 4 coming in early 2018. Tags",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio \nAll-in-one computers provide everything your average consumer might need in a single package, nixing the need for a standalone desktop in favor of a monitor-endowed piece of PC hardware. They come in an array of styles, offering everything from 1080p touchscreens and 5K resolution to robust sound and high-end Intel Core processors, each of which typically comes bundled with a keyboard and mouse. \nMore: The best gaming desktop you can buy \nMost target the premium market with a sleek, streamlined design, yet recent market offerings continue to push the boundaries of a what a budget-based PC is capable of. Consumers pay for this style and convenience with performance, and while the best all-in-ones don’t pack the processors or video cards some enthusiasts demand, they’re efficient enough for most everyday tasks. Microsoft Surface Studio ($3,000+) \nMicrosoft may be a newcomer to the all-in-one market, but that hasn’t stopped the Redmond giant from making a splash with the high-end Surface Studio. Its massive and beautiful 28-inch PixelSense display boasts an enormous 4,500 x 3,000 resolution, and is objectively and subjectively one of the best displays we’ve set eyes on, while claiming the top spot among touchscreens. You’ll find your choice of sixth generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs inside, plus either the GTX 965M or GTX 980M. We didn’t find the hybrid drive inside to our liking, but it’s still better than a pure HDD, and it’s the only option, so you’re stuck with it. Starting at $3,000, the Studio is targeted at designers, graphic artists, and animators, but will draw the eye of everyone who walks by. Read our full review . Buy one now from: Microsoft Apple iMac with Retina 5K display ($1.800+) \nApple’s 27-inch, Retina display iMac offered the first 5K display in the world. The stunning, 5,120 × 2,880 screen delivers crystal-clear images and sharp text, while boasting powerful internal specs in the form of a quad-core, 3.2-GHz Intel Core i5 CPU and 8GB of RAM. Moreover, the all-in-one maintains the stylish design with which we’ve all grown accustomed, reveling in a gap-less front panel and rounded corners that compliment the glass-and-aluminum build. The graphics chip can’t really handle games at full 5K, but it’s sufficient for many at 1440p. Read our full review . Buy one now from: Apple Amazon Dell XPS 27 Touch ($1,200+) \nThe XPS 27 Touch is among the Windows-based AiO we’ve ever laid eyes on. The plastic backside may feel a bit flimsy compared to most premium machines, but the 2,560 x 1,440 touchscreen gleams with detail and reclines to better accommodate tapping and swiping on a 27-inch screen. The machine also showcases robust audio with a subtle heaping of bass, along with an admittedly-aging Core i7-4770S CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 2TB hard drive for demanding productivity tasks. Read our full review . Buy one now from: Amazon Dell LG 22CV241 Chromebase ($280+) \nThe LG Chromebase redefines what you should expect on a shoestring budget. This capable all-in-one basks in a modern simplicity akin to the Chromebooks before it, capitalizing on an accurate color palette and lighting within a rounded aesthetic. The base model ships with an Intel Celeron 2955U dual-core CPU and 2GB of DDR3 RAM, which is more than adequate at performing tasks other than gaming, and the entire system relies on the Web-based Chrome OS for barebones functionality. The bundled peripherals are also solid, and you can even use the display as an external monitor. Read our full review . Buy one now from: Amazon Best Buy Asus Zen AIO ($1,399+) \nWhile it doesn’t take any big risks when it comes to design, Asus’ new Zen AIO stands out for top-notch performance and an agreeable price point. The display is a little too glossy for its own good, but makes up for it with an impressive 4K resolution and discrete Nvidia graphics. There are a couple of other shortcomings that we like to see addressed on high-end models, but all-in-all it provides a great computing experience and even decent gaming performance at 1080p. This is a strong choice if you’d like an all-in-one similar to iMac, but prefer the Windows operating system. Read our full review . Buy one now from: HP Envy 27 ($1,049+) \nHP Envy All-in-one 27 \nDespite the locked-in state of the parts inside, the HP Envy 27 offers a surprising range of options that start with a 1440p display and Core i5, and scale all the way up to the Skylake i7-6700T with 2.8GHz base clock, with Nvidia’s GTX 950M. It’s beautiful, too, with a thin, sleek look and simple support underneath. Like some of the other systems, it includes a mouse and keyboard. Unlike the older version of the Envy 27, even the base model presents a solid value. Buy one now from:",

      "title": "Microsoft shares its '12 Days of Deals' for 2016 Holiday Shopping -- here's which days are best",
      "text": "Tweet \nWell folks, December is here, and before you know it, Christmas and other holidays will be upon us. You know what that means -- shopping. For some ultra-responsible people, their holiday shopping is already done. For many other people, however, there are still many gifts to buy. \nTechnology-related gifts are always popular, and this year Microsoft is rolling out some great deals. In fact, unlike Black Friday which only lasts one day, the Windows-maker is offering a mind-boggling \"12 Days of Deals\". Many of the deals are available both online or at Microsoft's retail stores, but the ones labeled \"In-Store Doorbuster Deal\" are only available in the latter. While you can see all of the deals below, lets dive in and see which are the best. \nDay 1 ( Dec. 5 ):Intel Day -- Save Up to $1,000 on select Intel PCs starting at $199. In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $50 on a JBL Flip 2, now only $19.99 \nUh oh. On day number one, we see the dreaded \"up to\" caveat -- this means many of the discounts will be much less than $1,000. In other words, do not get too excited. The JBL Flip 2 for $20 is a great deal, however, and is worth a trip to your local Microsoft Store. Day 2 ( Dec. 6 ): Save $100 on Lenovo Ideapad 110, now only $199 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Biggest savings of the year on the FitBit Blaze \nOn day two we see a rather anemic laptop for $199. While the price is attractive, the machine will disappoint. Fitbit Blaze? Meh. Skip this day. \nDay 3 ( Dec. 7 ): Save 50 percent on Select Xbox One games, now $19.99 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Get a $50 Microsoft Store gift card with purchase of a 12-month subscription with Groove Music \nOn day 3 there is a discount on \"select\" games. This is probably code for \"not popular\". But OK, if you are a gamer, you may be able to find some well-priced titles. This could be a great way to get some inexpensive stocking-stuffers for the gamer in your life. \nGroove Music is actually a pretty decent streaming music service -- a $50 discount is a great deal. Yeah, this is worth the car ride. Day 4 ( Dec. 8 ):Save $250 on Surface Core M Devices, now $649 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Get a $25 Microsoft Store gift card with the purchase of a 12-month subscription with Xbox Live Gold On day four we see a discount on Core M Surface computers. You know what? These Intel processors are actually quite peppy, so it is worth a look. The $25 gift card for buying a year of Xbox Live Gold is not a good deal -- you can do better elsewhere online if you look around. Day 5 ( Dec. 9 ): Save up to 70 percent on select Windows tablets, starting at $49 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $120 on a Lumia 650, now only $79 Low-cost Windows tablets? Windows Phones? You do not want these for yourself. You don't want to give them as gifts either. Don't bother on day five. Day 6 ( Dec. 10 ): Save up to $250 on the Windows Premium Collection, starting at $499 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Biggest savings of the year on Office 365 Home Day six is far too vague, so I would forgo making a trip to the retail store and just shopping online this day. Maybe there will be a good deal, but since Microsoft is so quiet about this day, I would guess not. Day 7 ( Dec. 11 ): Get a $25 Microsoft Store gift card/code with purchase of select Xbox Wireless Controllers In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $120 on select Xbox One consoles (500 GB consoles), now $179 Yes, day seven looks to be a winner. If you are buying an Xbox One for a young casual gamer, you can save some money by buying an older model with less storage capacity -- they probably won't mind. Buy an extra controller so they can play with a friend and get a gift card. Nice deal. Day 8 ( Dec. 12 ): Save $50 and get two free select games with select Xbox One consoles In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Be one of the first customers in line to get a $25 Microsoft Store gift card Ugh. Microsoft does not share how many cards they have to giveaway, so you could end up waiting in line and missing out. Quite frankly, your time should be worth more than that -- don't stress yourself for the mere possibility of a free $25 card. The day eight Xbox One discount doesn't sound as good as day seven, but if it is, you can always return what you bought on the prior day. I would suggest just being happy with your day seven Xbox buy and just skip day eight altogether. Day 9 ( Dec. 13 ): Get a $100 Microsoft Store gift card/code with purchase of HTC Vive or Oculus Rift In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Biggest savings of the year on FitBit Charge HR Both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift are incredible virtual reality platforms -- saving $100 is great, right? Yes, but make sure you compare to other sites first. Microsoft will likely charge you tax too, meaning a better deal could possibly be had elsewhere. Fitbits are great, but the offer is too vague. Day 10 ( Dec. 14 ): Save up to $1,000 on select Intel powered gaming PCs, starting at $799 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Get Quantum Break, Halo 5 and Forza Motorsport 6 for $19.99 Again, saying \"up to\" doesn't really tell us much. Still, there may be some good online deals. The in-store deal is much better, as all three of those titles are popular and should make great gifts -- just make sure the recipient doesn't already have them. Day 11 ( Dec. 15 ): Save up to 40 percent on select Dell PCs, starting at $199 In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $150 on an Acer Jade Primo, now $299 See above about \"up to\" -- shop cautiously online. The in-store \"deal\" of a $300 Windows Phone should be avoided. Day 12 ( Dec. 16 ): Get a type cover with any Surface Pro 4 for up to $159.99 in savings In-Store Doorbuster Deal: Be one of the first customers in line to get a $50 Microsoft Store gift card Day 12 is probably my favorite day of them all. The Surface Pro 4 is an amazing computer, and getting a free Type Cover is a great value. The free $50 gift card is icing on the cake, but again, Microsoft does not share how many cards each store will offer. You could end up waiting in line and not getting one. I think $50 is worth the gamble, however.",

      "title": "Windows 10 Creators Update: New accessibility features revealed, including braille support",
      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago \nEarly next year, Microsoft will release the Windows 10 Creators Update , a major 'Service Pack'-style collection of new features and improvements, following on from the Anniversary Update that was released this summer. Microsoft has already highlighted some of the changes to the communications experience and new gaming features that will arrive with that update. Other enhancements will include a new UI for sharing content , along with integrated virtual reality support through the Windows Holographic shell . \nToday, Microsoft announced details of how it will improve accessibility features in Windows 10, in an effort to ensure that the OS can be comfortably used by as wide a range of users as possible. \nMicrosoft said today that it has established \"three companywide guiding principles\" for all of its future product development: Transparency, to commit to sharing our plans to ensure that Microsoft’s products are accessible. Accountability, for prioritizing inclusive design and accessibility in the creation of our products and services. Inclusivity, in order to keep all of our customers and their abilities top of mind. \nIn pursuit of those goals, the company will be making numerous additions and improvements to Windows 10 with the Creators Update. One of the most significant new additions will be support for braille in the Windows 10 Narrator feature. The Creators Update will include beta support for braille input and output through specialized braille displays \"from over 35 manufacturers, using more than 40 languages and multiple braille variants, including grade 2 contracted braille.\" \nIt's also adding the ability to use a controller to handle Narrator interactions on Xbox One consoles, including pitch and speed adjustments for the Narrator voice. \nOther highlights include: Unassisted installation: Users will soon be able to install the Windows 10 Creators Update using Narrator throughout the installation process, including from within Windows RE/PE for setup & troubleshooting. New way to launch Narrator: We have changed the quick keys used to launch Narrator to address feedback from many Windows 10 users. Users can now launch Narrator by clicking CTRL + WIN + ENTER. WIN + ENTER no longer launches Narrator. Users can still launch Narrator from Cortana or from the Settings Window. New text to speech voices and capabilities: We are adding more than 10 new voices. In addition, there will be Narrator support for multilingual reading, so that Narrator seamlessly switches between languages when you have the corresponding voices installed. Improved audio experiences: We implemented dynamic ducking, so Narrator will only reduce the volume of other applications like Groove or Pandora when it is speaking. The handshake between Narrator and Cortana is also improved, so Cortana won’t transcribe what Narrator (or other screen readers) is speaking. More general reliability and usability improvements: We added features to make it easier to understand the context of a control with which you are interacting and to make it possible to discover information about objects like the background color of a table cell. Narrator will remember and maintain your mode, e.g. scan mode, across applications. Narrator cursor positioning improvements include stopping and starting where you expect when reading in scan mode and when reading by line, paragraph and in continuous reading. Easier web browsing with Edge: Narrator responsiveness is improved with Edge and several new features have been added, including the ability to jump directly to a form element like a check box, text field or button, and the ability to navigate by heading level. \nSome of these features are already built into Insider Preview builds of the Creators Update, but others will be coming in early 2017, before the update eventually begins rolling out a few months into the year. \nMicrosoft also detailed some of the accessibility improvements that will be coming to Office 365 early next year, promising \"to empower [users] to consume, create and collaborate on content independently, efficiently and confidently.\" These features include: Built-in controls for authoring accessible content: We will be introducing more accessible templates to help you get started, making it easy to insert alternative text descriptions for images and meaningful display names for hyperlinks as well as making the accessibility checker available in more Office applications. Watch this short accessible authoring demonstration to learn more about these capabilities. Built-in controls for personalizing reading experiences: Inspired by the profound impact the introduction of Learning Tools for OneNote has had in classrooms and are making these tools to promote concentration and comprehension available in more Office applications. Settings to read text aloud with simultaneous highlighting, increase text spacing and break words into syllables are already rolling out in Word for PCs to Office Insider and First Release program members and are coming next to Word Online and OneNote Online. Watch this short Learning Tools demonstration to learn more about these capabilities. Support for creating professional, polished content with assistive technologies: Making it easy to use new cloud-powered, intelligent services in Office applications with assistive technologies such as screen readers and alternative keyboards. Services such as Designer in PowerPoint , Researcher and Editor in Wor d can reduce the effort you spend on tasks such as formatting, citing and proofing your work and let you focus on refining the ideas you’d like to communicate. \nMicrosoft's announcements today follow a commitment from its CEO, Satya Nadella, a year ago to put accessibility and assistive technologies at the heart of everything that the company does. He said: \nAs I think about living our mission, top of mind for me heading into 2016 is how we must make Microsoft products accessible to the more than 1 billion people globally of all abilities. This is a shared goal. Universal design is central to how we realize our mission and will make all our products better. Along with our Senior Leadership Team, I will continue to devote my time and passion to this priority. \nMicrosoft's Jenny Lay-Flurrie, the company's Chief Accessibility Officer, said today that it's \"thrilled to see the impact that technology is having on our customers\", and that the firm is focused on keeping up that momentum in the year ahead.",

      "text": "PC and Xbox One gamers will finally be able to face off in Microsoft and developer The Coalition's Gears of War 4, but only for a few days. Crossplay between gamers using a controller and those using a mouse and keyboard will be available starting today (Dec. 2) through Monday, Dec. 5.\n\n\n\"This test is being conducted to evaluate the potential of a more permanent crossplay solution in the future to allow Windows 10 and Xbox One gamers to play together in Versus outside of Private Matches,\" wrote Gears of War community manager TC Oculus on the Gears of War forums .\nIt will be an interesting test. The idea of crossplay is inherently divisive because of the differences between using a controller and a mouse and keyboard. The latter tend to be far more accurate, and as a result, some games give controllers \"aim assist\" functions to make up for inaccuracy caused by analog sticks.\nMORE: 9 Tips for Dominating Gears of War 4 Multiplayer \nBut TC Oculus reminded users that this will be just a test, and that the data collected will lead to an informed next step, or lack thereof.\nIf the test is successful and The Coalition can put together a permanent game mode for PC and console gamers to share, it would be a huge step in competitive play for all.

      "text": "  13:45 PM EST Powershelf® and Hitachi Consulting Introduce New IoT Smart Retail Shelves Powered by Microsoft Azure \nNew Technology Will Increase On-Shelf Availability and Generate Shopper Insights \nAnnapolis, MD   \nPowershelf® and Hitachi Consulting are working with Microsoft to introduce smart shelves to US retail stores. The new Powershelf smart shelf units will be installed in 15 supermarkets of a leading Midwest supermarket chain. KING’S HAWIIAN®, America’s leading provider of Hawaiian food, will be the first to use the new smart shelves to reduce out-of-stock incidents and ensure shoppers can find its products while shopping this holiday season. By dramatically reducing the amount of time KING’S HAWAIIAN shelves are empty, the company is making customers’ shopping experiences a little less frustrating and also limiting the revenue that can potentially be lost when shelves are empty. \nThe units consist of a series of shelves that hold and display products. Built-in Powershelf technology tracks product availability; when a shelf is empty, a restocking alert is automatically sent to store personnel. The solution utilizes Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to analyze when, where, and why products sell so fast, allowing retailers and consumer product companies to identify trends and avoid out of stocks before they ever happen. \nJohn Linehan, Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development at KING’S HAWAIIAN, was impressed with early pilot results and believes the technology will lead to better customer satisfaction and improved sales performance. “Improving out of stocks is an important strategy for KING’S HAWAIIAN, and Powershelf will give us the data to manage this metric most effectively,” said Linehan. “We look forward to expanding this technology to as many of our retailers as soon as it is practical.” \nKING’S HAWAIIAN and its respective retailers and distributors will be able to access data gathered by the units—including historical out-of-stock incidents and loss of potential sales—in real-time through the Internet of Things (IoT) with a customized digital dashboard co-developed by Microsoft and Hitachi Consulting. \n“We have spent years working with our partners to develop this IoT solution that helps to solve out of stocks, and I am excited to see it introduced in time for this holiday shopping season,” said Larry McWilliams Co-CEO of Powershelf. “By making more products available we are providing shoppers with a more positive shopping experience, while reducing the cost of restocking. This is a powerful first step into the future of retail.” \nBrendan O'Meara, Managing Director of Worldwide Retail at Microsoft, explained why the data gathered by these units is so valuable. “Our collaboration with Powershelf enables us to leverage the Microsoft Cloud to combine a retailer’s inventory data with the data Powershelf sensors gather from the store floor and visualize it using Power BI tools,” said O’Meara. “Decision makers can use their custom dashboard to see the state of their stores and supply chains in real-time and react much faster than in the past.” \nAbout Powershelf Powershelf is a leading provider of retail technology solutions. The patented technology—the Powershelf system—provides constant power and two-way communications to software-enabled applications and devices that deliver a variety of advertising, merchandising and pricing services to customers.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOne of Windows’ most important security features is BitLocker support, which has provided full-disk encryption since Windows Vista first rolled out. Coupled with a compatible Trusted Platform Module, which is now required for new Windows 10 machines , BitLocker theoretically provides solid protection for a Windows machine that’s lost or stolen. \nHowever, any security feature is only as good as the entire system that surrounds it, and any weak link can present a vulnerability that renders it less than secure. For Windows 10, the weak link involves the fact that the operating system turns off Bitlocker during Feature Updates, aka upgrades, creating a potential exploit, as the official Win-Fu blog reports . \nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Edition aims to knock down ransomware \nAccording to Windows trainer and MVP Sami Laiho, the vulnerability occurs due to the ability to hit SHIFT+F10 during the reimaging process performed during a Feature Update and access the command prompt. This result in access by the non-admin account that’s in use during the update to the root SYSTEM folder and to all of the contents of the non-BitLocker-protected hard drive. \nThe following video provides an overview of the process: \nAccording to The Register , security experts further maintain that anyone with physical access to the machine could exploit the bug to access the BitLocker encryption keys. Fortunately, Microsoft is working on fixing the bug, which affects all relevant versions of Windows 10 including the production versions 1511 (November Update) and 1607 (Anniversary Update) , as well as newer Windows Insider builds. \nThe bug does require physical access to the Windows 10 machine, but once that’s accomplished, for example via theft or by an internal employee, then the bug allows admin access to the system once an upgrade is kicked off. Until Microsoft issues a fix, Laiho recommends disallowing unattended upgrades and using the Long-term Servicing Branch version of Windows 10. That’s not much help to nonenterprise Windows 10 users, however, and so maintaining physical control over a Windows 10 machine becomes that much more important. Also watch:",

      "text": "Microsoft today highlighted the role they played in helping to empower voters & political organizations to create a more secure, informed, and efficient democratic process in the US elections. You can check out the video above.\nMicrosoft acted in a bipartisan manner and provided similar levels of support to both Republican and Democratic conventions and they provided the conventions with technology tools to help them operate efficiently and accurately. They did not endorse either political party or its nominee. Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer at Microsoft recently shared his thoughts on the US election results .\n“Every president-elect deserves our congratulations, best wishes and support for the country as a whole. The peaceful transition of power has been an enduring and vital part of our democracy for over two centuries, and it remains so today. As a company, Microsoft joins many others in congratulating President-elect Donald J. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence.”\nRead about Satya’s thoughts on the US Elections here. \n",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan How and why Microsoft is stepping up its focus on 'families' with Windows 10 Windows 10's Home Hub feature set could be a step along Microsoft's long-term goal of making households, and not just workplaces, more productive and connected. | Topic: Windows 10 \nFor the past few months, a number of Microsoft watchers have been predicting and hoping (incorrectly) that Microsoft was ready to roll out a competitor to Amazon's Echo and Google Home. \nA discovery by Microsoft sleuth The Walking Cat, a k a @h0x0d, of something called \"Home Hub\" further fueled this rumor. However, as Walking Cat also discovered, Home Hub wasn't hardware ; it was some kind of feature or feature set in Windows 10 that will be, at least initially, enabling a shared family account. \nOn December 2, Windows Central posted more about what their sources are telling them about Home Hub . As the feature name implies, the features/strategy around Home Hub are all about making Windows 10 more of a shared hub for users in a home. \nVia Home Hub, according to Windows Central, users will be able to more easily share calendars, apps and services in a more seamlessly connected way . \n(I've asked Microsoft if anyone there wants to talk Home Hub. No word back yet, but I'm expecting a no comment.) \nMicrosoft has been working to realize this home-collaboration/productivity vision for years, by the way. A f uturistic \"envisioning\" video produced by the company in 2013 -- which was meant to provide a glimpse of where company execs thought technology was going in the five- to ten-year time frame -- showed off some of the type of concepts that Microsoft may be aiming to deliver via Home Hub. \nI've embedded in this blog post a few stills from that 2013 video, which showed family members sharing photos, apps and calendars from a shared environment that could be on a larger screen device or even a wall in the home. Placing objects on or in front of such a device could trigger proactive suggestions -- as in, provide a list of recipes featuring carrots -- thanks to image recognition. \nA recent Microsoft job posting for a software engineer in operating systems engineering, highlights Microsoft's burgeoning \"family\" focus. There's actually a \"Family team\" in the Windows and Devices Group (the home of Windows, Xbox, HoloLens and Surface) that's working on Web and back-end services targeted expressly at families/households. \nFrom that November job posting : \n\"Families are among the most valuable and loyal customers of Microsoft. Families want an environment where children can use their devices and our services safely and responsibly. Families want to share pictures, videos, applications, games, and other purchases easily. Families want to communicate freely and stay in touch. Microsoft is competing fiercely with Google, Amazon, Apple, AT&T and numerous other giants to build a compelling portfolio for families, and the race is just getting started. \n\"Join the Family team in WDG, and be a critical part of this mission. You will be designing and building web and backend services that will power critical family features for hundreds of millions of users and their families all over the world. Your work will enable families to grow, to keep children safe on the Internet, make purchases in a responsible manner, share digital media and subscriptions, and do much more.\" \nGiven Microsoft's focus on natural-language interface, Cortana, Skype, bots, and the Surface pen/Dial peripherals will likely be part of the Home Hub strategy as it evolves.And Azure will no doubt figure in, as well, given Microsoft's ongoing makeover as a cloud-first company. \nMicrosoft has dabbled a bit in various \"family\" features already with Windows ( renaming Family Safety parental controls to Microsoft Family ) and pricing/licensing Office 365 Home around a \"household\" of users . But so far, those efforts have been rudimentary. \nIf Windows Central is right, Microsoft may, further out, extend Home Hub so that it's central to the idea of a connected home. Again, Microsoft has done quite a bit of experimenting and research around the \"HomeOS\" concept , but hasn't brought the technologies around it to market. \nI'm still doubtful we'll see anything like a \"Cortana Cube\" Echo/Home competitor from Microsoft's Surface team, as that team seems largely focused on business-first devices these days. But maybe some Windows OEM will attempt such a device....",

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe How The 'Silly' Irish Founders At Intercom Built One Of Silicon Valley's Fastest-Growing Businesses Microsoft's Julia Liuson: \"Big open source projects like Android, Chrome and Java happen with a design process that is essentially behind the corporate wall -- we decided not to do that with our approach to open source and instead work with an 'inclusive design process' from the start for .NET and Visual Studio Code etc.\" Image credit: contentparty.org \nA decade ago when Microsoft asked: Where do you want to go today? It didn't really mean we could go anywhere, in a truly open software sense of the term. They (it, the firm) really meant: Where do you want to go today within a Windows-specific 'proprietarily' closed platform of software using our applications, browser and tools? \nBut that would have made a really shoddy marketing slogan. \nLatterly, in an attempt to broaden, Microsoft moved on to use Windows Everywhere , but even this slogan has now become redundant. Today in late 2016, the firm has adopted a different tune and it is one of: Any developer, any app, any platform , at the software engineering and programming level at least, which ostensibly translates directly to the user level too. \nYes okay, obviously, Microsoft would still like all roads to lead back to Windows and its other platforms if occasionally possible -- Azure cloud, Office 365, .NET and its newer breed of cognitive services -- but something of a turnaround has occurred. \nTurning the big ship around A shift from focusing on proprietary platforms to embracing an open source approach doesn’t happen overnight and requires something much deeper than marketing slogans. The questions triggered by this big change are: h ow has the firm been re-engineering itself, what's life been like inside the big ship making the turnaround and can we see any holes in the argument it is now putting forward? \nJulia Liuson is corporate vice president for Visual Studio at Microsoft and is responsible for developer tools and services, including all the firms programming languages and runtimes. In other words, she's the software boss at Microsoft. \nSpeaking at the company's recent Connect () 2016 event in New York, Liuson opened up on a few truths as she detailed the Microsoft journey from 'Linux is a cancer' (in the era of Ballmer) to 'any platform is cool by us' today.

That was all. \nMy browsing history didn't register that I went to another site (just 2 consecutive instances of the same email-account website I opened my mail with); my download history and download folder did not have any new additions; no new installed program has appeared in my programs and features; and nothing was added to my startup folders or startup in task manager. \nA runthrough by malwarebytes anti-malware premium (which I only bought after clicking the link) didn't find anything, nor did windows defender. \nQuestion \nWhat I would like to know is what could have happened? Could malware have sneaked its way in? And if so, how do I find out about it? \nI was told that one possible consequence could have simply been that my email was validated as real by the scammers, for future email scam use. I can live with that annoyance. But I don't like the idea of some ransomware, keylogger or botnet malware hiding itself on my computer. \nWhat is possible that could have happened from such an event, and what can I do to damage control it? \nI have seen that at least another poster has asked a similar question, but I was wondering about the specifics of my incident.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard Brings Much-Improved, Strain-Free Typing Form December 2, 2016 \nWe have no idea whether Microsoft’s Surface Ergonomic Keyboard will really make for a much better typing experience. What we do know is its odd looks and unusual profile does seem a whole lot more fun than the boring rectangular keyboards the rest of us use every day. \nSimilar to the outfit’s Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard, the new peripheral sports an arched shape that improves typing form, all while protecting both your hand and wrist from strain. It also removes the odd cut-out area from the former, all while adding a whole new set of improvements \nFor instance, the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard comes with the number pad integrated, so you get a single unified keyboard instead of two separate units. It has a double-cushioned palm rest that’s covered in Alcantara, along with a subtly updated keytop geometry and a refreshed typing mechanism. Unlike their previous ergonomic keyboard that required a wireless dongle, this one comes with Bluetooth built in for easily pairing with laptops and PCs. \nA pair of AAA batteries allow it to run for up to 12 months on a fresh batch, so it’s quite the low-maintenance peripheral. Features include aluminum construction, updated media keys that better support Windows 10’s functionality, and quick shortcut keys. \nAvailable now, the Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard is priced at $129.99.",

      "text": "Kidsteruk Can these only be used with Windows phones? What are the OS limitations? Only works with the 950 & 950XL and as a 950 XL owner I got one free. Most useless gadget ever as its too much hassle to use with any screen so it becomes tied to a monitor and it is not real windows so only certain phone apps work. Nice idea but needs a lot of work to make it a useful gadget. My use case is to have the dock plugged into my TV, for occasional Internet use, Word, and watching movies.Plug mouse and keyboard in, perfect. Can take it away... without mouse and keyboard... use phone for input if needed when watching movies in hotel. Really easy. The app thing is a bit of a mute point when using in full desktop mode.. unless you need more than what I've said. For the price... it's a great start - looking forward to it developing. I thought about similar but decided against it. With wireless beaming through the Microsoft Wireless Adapter or things like Chromecast you can achieve more and connect to more devices with no wires across the living room. Tbh I will probably utlise the WIFI thing too, I just wanted a dock for a smoother 60fps display, rather than WIFI 30fps.",

      "text": "Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone. But that hasn’t stopped Microsoft from publishing some fairly amazing deals over the next 12 days, half of which you’ll need to visit a brick-and-mortar Microsoft store to score.\n\nSince the deals kick off on December 5, you have until Monday to plan your purchases. And you will need to plan them, too: The 12 Days of Deals unlock each day and are only good “while supplies last.” Naturally, you’ll have to line up at a physical Microsoft Store if you want to score a “doorbuster.” \n\nSome of the deals are well worth the trouble. Microsoft will offer up to $1,000 off on select PCs on two separate days, for example, and there are a number of half-off deals on Xbox One games, too. Another intriguing deal is a $49 Windows tablet on Friday, December 9. Microsoft’s best deals, however, are shrouded in mystery: The company isn’t revealing which tablet will be $49, or what PCs it will be discounting by $1,000. \n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "\nEarlier today, a report revealed information about Microsoft’s plans for new Family Oriented technology in Windows – Home Hub. \nA Microsoft job posting – scouted out by ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley – has provided some more context to this, specifically the formation of a specialised “family team” to deal with the task of creating a framework via with family members can share content such as pictures, videos and more. While Microsoft previously had rudimentary support for this built off on the Windows Phone 8 platform, the support wasn’t as fleshed out as the family sharing capabilities built by Google and Apple into their respective platforms. This initiative aims to change that.\nHere’s what the job posting says\nFamilies are among the most valuable and loyal customers of Microsoft. Families want an environment where children can use their devices and our services safely and responsibly. Families want to share pictures, videos, applications, games, and other purchases easily. Families want to communicate freely and stay in touch. Microsoft is competing fiercely with Google, Amazon, Apple, AT&T and numerous other giants to build a compelling portfolio for families, and the race is just getting started.\nJoin the Family team in WDG, and be a critical part of this mission. You will be designing and building web and backend services that will power critical family features for hundreds of millions of users and their families all over the world. Your work will enable families to grow, to keep children safe on the Internet, make purchases in a responsible manner, share digital media and subscriptions, and do much more. You will have a passion for quality and be a creative thinker. You will use Cosmos, Microsoft Power BI, and the Asimov Cloud Data Platform for developing business insights through data mining and analysis. Your work will be the cornerstone of the features we will build for families!\nMicrosoft’s Home Hub is rumoured to be coming next year, and this work would be very crucial to it.\nWhile its not exactly a huge revelation in light of the previous reports, it does add more credibility to them.\nAre you excited by Microsoft’s Family plans? Let us know in the comments below.",

      "title": "New Halo Wars 2 Trailer Show Off The Game's Big Bad",
      "text": "By William Usher 6 minutes ago \nMicrosoft and 343 Industries let loose a new cinematic trailer for Halo Wars 2 at this year's Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley. The new trailer centers around the motivations and fearsomeness exhibited by the game's lead villain, Atriox. \nThe new Halo Wars 2 trailer made its way onto the official Xbox YouTube channel after airing during The Game Awards. The trailer covers a brief history of Atriox and how he came to rule the Banished outside of the territories controlled by the Covenant. \nIt turns out that Atriox was an enslaved Brute who committed atrocious war crimes while under the Covenant banner. He was to be summarily executed by high command, but instead, he killed those who thought they were over him. His cunning wit and strategic prowess were unmatched by many within the Covenant, and he garnered a strong following of loyal warriors willing to fight and die for his cause. Thus, Atriox established an indomitable foothold with the Banished, and became an army without a nation. \nHowever, it's pointed out in the Halo Wars 2 cinematic that Atriox has taken control of one of the most powerful weapons in the Halo universe. With a brutal, unflinching and unwavering army of mercenaries, killers and banished war mongrels at his disposal, Atriox seeks to extend his platform from ruling on the outskirts of the galaxy to controlling the galaxy. \nThe Spirit of Fire makes a return to action after the events of the first Halo Wars . They've been in cryo for a long time and Captain James Cutter is now thrust into a seemingly impossible position of having to either face off against Atriox -- who has demolished all who have stood in his way -- or fleeing and risking Atriox growing even more powerful. \nThe premise for Halo Wars 2 is excellent, and I would say it even has a better plot setup than Halo 5: Guardians . I love that the stakes being presented to Cutter and his crew are easy to understand, and the choice they're faced with is a difficult one to make. I sort of wish they had found some way to raise the level of intensity in a similar way throughout Halo 5 , which seemed to just stroll along in how it presented the characters and whatever dangers they faced. \nThe trailer does a fantastic job of setting up the premise and the objective that players will have to undertake in Halo Wars 2 without giving too much away or making light of the Spirit of Fire's situation. The only thing that the developers have to do now is actually deliver on the gameplay aspect for Xbox One and Windows PC gamers. \nWhen it comes to real-time strategy games it's hard to win over console gamers, but if the story is as compelling as the cinematic trailer above, they might be able to win over plenty of fans. You can look for Halo Wars 2 to launch on February 21st in 2017. Subscribe To Topics You're Interested In close \nSubscribe To Topics You're Interested In I've already subscribed",

      "text": "  \nAmazon’s Echo is an internet-connected, voice-activated speaker that you control by talking to it. Google Home is a similar device, but it uses Google’s Asisstant voice service rather than Amazon’s Alexa. And Apple is said to be working on a Siri-based version. \nBut what about Microsoft? The company reportedly has its own solution on the way… but according to Windows Central , it won’t be a standalone speaker. \nInstead, Microsoft Home Hub is expected to be new software that can turn any Windows 10 PC (with the right hardware) into a smart home hub. \nIn a nutshell, Home Hub is a souped-up version of Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant software plus multi-user features that will let you designate a PC as a device for use by the whole family. It’s expected to roll out in 2017, also some parts of the experience are already included in the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, which is already available to members of the Windows Insiders Program. \nRight now you can set up multiple user accounts on a single PC, but switching between them or sharing data between accounts can be a bit of a hassle. Home Hub will let you set up a “family” account that everyone in a household can access no matter which user is logged in. \nImagine you’ve got an all-in-one Windows 10 PC in the living room or kitchen. It has Home Hub software, a family account, and accounts for each of the members of your household. Since one of the features rolling out with the Windows 10 Creators Update is the ability to interact with Cortana from the lock screen, you’ll be able to approach the computer and start talking to it without unlocking it… and it won’t matter whether you’re currently logged in or not. \nAny shared calendar appointments or other data are available… and thanks to Windows Hello, you can also authenticate yourself quickly to access your private appointments, contacts, or other data without switching user accounts. \nCortana will also offer Alexa/Google Assistant-like integration with third-party services such as smart home hardware. \nBut since Home Hub is basically just software, you’ve also got a fully-functional PC. Want to jot a note with a digital pen and leave it for other members of the family to see? You can leave a virtual sticky note instead of posting it on the fridge. \nThe multi-user features seem like they could help set Home Hub apart from the competition. But I can’t help but wonder if people want to set up an always-on PC to act as a smart home hub with a screen and always-listening microphone when companies like Amazon and Google are banking on the simplicity of their voice-only solutions. \nWhile Amazon hasn’t released any official sales figures for its Echo products, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon has sold 5.1 million (PDF) Alexa-enabled devices since the Echo first launched in 2014. \nThat said, there’s also a report out this week suggesting that Amazon may be working on a new model that has a touchscreen display. So maybe Microsoft isn’t the only company that figures a smart home hub could benefit from a screen. Share this:",

      "text": "Tired of Microsoft pop-up ads on Windows 10? What to do  38 pm Most of Microsoft’s intrusive ads can be disabled, writes Patrick Marshall, who provides a step-by-step solution. He also has some advice for users on problems with sleep mode and theme syncing. Share story Patrick Marshall Special to The Seattle Times \nQ: Ever since my computer upgraded to Windows 10, I’ve been irritated by all kinds of advertisements that pop up, mostly for Microsoft’s own products. How can I get rid of these? \n— B. Austin \nA: I hear you. I think that Microsoft has gone too far with intrusive ads. Fortunately, we can get rid of most of them, though it takes several steps. \nThe first thing most users will notice is the lock-screen ads, which appear when you’ve been away from your computer long enough to require you to log in again. To get rid of them, click the Start button and then the Settings icon. Next, launch the Personalization utility and click on the Lock Screen option. Finally, turn off the item labeled “Get fun facts, tips and more from Windows and Cortana on your lock screen.” Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nMicrosoft also has helpfully infected your Start menu with suggestions that you download apps from the Windows Store. The setting to disable these suggestions is found just two menu items down from the lock-screen control. In the Personalization utility, click on Start and then turn off the item labeled “Occasionally show suggestions in Start.” \nYou may also be getting pop-up ads suggesting that you subscribe to Office or to Skype, two products owned by Microsoft. You may get these ads even if you already have those applications installed. \nThe easiest way to get rid of them is to go to the Start menu and scroll down the list of applications until you see “Get Office” and “Get Skype.” Right-click on each and select “Uninstall.” \nQ: The “power scheme” for my computer seems to magically change from my selected custom plan to the Windows generic “Balanced Plan” on its own, causing the computer to go into the sleep mode at any time and without warning when I leave the computer for a few minutes. \nI have searched the internet for a solution and see that there are many, many entries about this very problem. However, none of the suggested solutions seem to offer or have found a solution that stops the computer from changing the power plan. \n— Scott Hayes \nA: The most likely cause of this issue is that your computer’s BIOS — the software that controls the computer’s input and output — needs updating to work properly with your version of Windows. You would do this by going to the computer manufacturer’s website and seeing if there is an update for your model. \nIt’s also possible that other software utilities that came with your computer — or even a third-party program, such as an anti-virus program — may be conflicting with the power plan. If that’s the case, finding the culprit will be much more difficult. But the place to start is by contacting your computer’s manufacturer. \nQ: I will be working on the computer doing my normal stuff and the hard drive will be buzzing along. All of a sudden, I get a pop-up that says “This theme cannot be applied to the desktop.” I never had it on Windows 7; it is only showing up on Windows 10. \nI hope you can tell me how to eliminate the problem. \n— Lib Patricelli \nA: I’m figuring you have syncing of themes turned on — a feature designed to ensure that your various devices all have the same display theme — and that the OS is having trouble doing so. \nIf all you want is to get rid of that message, try this: Click on the Start button and select the Settings icon (the one that looks like a gear). Select Accounts and then click on “Sync your settings.” Finally, slide the slider under Theme to “Off.” Patrick Marshall : . Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

      "title": "Microsoft Calls 2016 Tipping Point for Xbox One",
      "text": "Xbox UK marketing director calls 2016 a tipping point for Xbox One, saying the console’s momentum builds confidence within the industry going into 2017. It’s no secret that for the last few years since they launched, Sony’s PlayStation 4 has consistently outsold Microsoft’s Xbox One . With more than 40 million units sold worldwide, PlayStation 4 has outperformed Xbox One nearly every month since release.\nHowever, that changed this summer. Beginning in July, Xbox One sales picked up, taking over the top spot in console sales since . That momentum has been good for Xbox, which released the Xbox One S and announced next year’s Project Scorpio , both of which offer features not currently available on any PlayStation 4 device.\nThese successes together constitute what one Microsoft executive is claiming to be a “turning point” for Xbox One. According to Xbox UK marketing director Harvey Eagle, gamers and the industry will remember 2016 as the turning point for Xbox One, and the start of a momentous rise in the industry. While speaking with GI.biz , Eagle offered Microsoft’s point-of-view about 2016’s Xbox One sales, and what it means for the future of the console and company.\nMomentum is really important in this business, because it gives confidence to retailers, publishers, and to consumers. We are giving them confidence that they have made a right point. I think we’ll look back on 2016 as a tipping point for Xbox One.\n\nThat momentum carried though to Black Friday, where Xbox One held the top spot among gamers, at least with online sales. That momentum has poised Microsoft to “sustain and build” on the success it’s had going into 2017, according to Eagle.\nWhen it comes to November, it’s possible PlayStation 4 may reclaim the throne. Analysts have pointed out that PlayStation 4 won online sales on Cyber Monday, and was in the lead in November going into the big holiday shopping weekend. However, that may not hamper the success Xbox One has seen in recent months. Momentum can be a powerful force in the gaming industry, and if Microsoft uses the momentum it’s gained correctly, it could see that success continue into 2017.\nSpeaking of 2017, Eagle referenced a few big launches Microsoft is planning next year for Xbox One, each of which could have strong benefits for the console maker. Halo Wars 2 , which was featured during The Game Awards 2016 , along with Sea of Thieves , are two of the top tier exclusives set for 2017. Additionally, Project Scorpio, while still fairly unknown, will deliver a powerhouse experience for gamers that’s already slated to outperform PS4 Pro in many key ways.\n\nEagle also noted that there are many households that still use their Xbox 360 consoles, and haven’t made the switch yet to Xbox One. Naturally, Microsoft is looking to capture those sales this holiday season, and is working diligently to make the upgrade appealing to Xbox 360 owners. Eagle said:\nOur data shows that there is still a significant number of households actively using their Xbox 360 who haven’t upgraded yet. [The backwards compatibility list] is growing all the time and I think it is definitely a benefit for Xbox 360 owners, to know that the money that they’ve already spent on games won’t get wasted when they upgrade to Xbox One.\nAt the moment, there are more than 280 games available on Xbox One’s backward compatibility, with new games coming to backward compatibility every month. If Microsoft continues like it has, it may be enough to drive Xbox 360 owners to the store to pick up an Xbox One.\n\nWe’ll note that while Xbox seems to have great momentum at the moment, it may be impossible for Microsoft to catch PlayStation 4’s sales. Granted, continued success and leading in the sales will benefit Xbox One sales tremendously, but as Xbox’s Phil Spencer said this time last year, PlayStation 4’s lead may be too large at this point . In the meantime, there’s plenty to celebrate at Xbox headquarters, and the team there will undoubtedly take any success they can get.\nWhat do you think about 2016 being a tipping point for Xbox One? Will the Microsoft console make a surge to catch PlayStation 4, or is that impossible at this point?\n",

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Finding Microsoft Deals At Amazon Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Finding Microsoft Deals At Amazon Jennifer Hong Dec 02, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Finding Microsoft Deals At Amazon 2 \nShoppers are still finding deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 To Compete With Samsung Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 To Compete With Samsung 1 \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Mary Smith Dec 02, 2016 7 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 To Compete With Samsung ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone With NEON, Snapdragon 835 Technologies Microsoft Surface Phone With NEON, Snapdragon 835 Technologies \nMicrosoft is set to make Windows 10 Mobile hotter than before, and we got some news on the latest Surface Phone that could bring more competition to the market. \nSatya Nadella says Microsoft is planning the “ultimate mobile device”. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

      "text": "on Dec 2, 2016, 3:30 PM TechSpot \nBlack Friday and Cyber Monday may have passed but for millions of consumers, there’s still plenty of shopping to do. If you happen to have a techie still on your list (or are simply scouting for a great deal for yourself), Microsoft’s 12 Days of Deals promotion may be worth a look. \nBeginning December 5 (this coming Monday), Microsoft will host a new deal each day through December 16. In lieu of revealing a new deal each day and keeping potential customers in suspense, Microsoft elected to publish its full slate of deals in one fell swoop which we’ve reproduced below: Day 1, December 5: Save up to $1,000 on select Intel-powered PCs, starting at $199 Day 2, December 6: Only $199 for a Lenovo Ideapad 110 laptop Day 3, December 7: Save up to 50 percent on select Xbox One games, now $19.99 Day 4, December 8: Save $250 on Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core m3 and 128GB SSD (now $649) Day 5, December 9: Save up to 70 percent on select Windows tablets, now starting at $49 Day 6, December 10: Save up to $250 on the Windows Premium Collection devices, starting at $499 Day 7, December 11: Buy select Xbox controllers and get a $25 Microsoft Store gift code Day 8, December 12: Save $50 and get two free games with select Xbox One consoles Day 9, December 13: Get a $100 Microsoft Store gift code with the purchase of Oculus Rift or HTC Vive Day 10, December 14: Save up to $1,000 on select gaming PCs, starting at $799 Day 11, December 15: Save up to 40 percent on select Dell PCs, starting at $199 Day 12, December 16: Save up to $200 on select Surface Pro 4 plus free Type Cover (up to $359 value) \nIt’s uncharacteristic of Microsoft to reveal its hand all at once but then again, this isn’t the same Microsoft with Satya Nadella at the helm (and that’s a good thing). Quite frankly, there’s no reason to keep daily deals a secret – especially near the end of the holiday buying season. Doing so only increases the likelihood that potential customers will take their business elsewhere. \nAs an added bonus (today only), you can pick up nearly a dozen holiday-inspired albums absolutely free .

      "title": "Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.0 Update: What to Know",
      "text": "Video game developer Mojang and Microsoft recently unveiled big news regarding the hit version of Minecraft: Pocket Edition . The two announced that for the 5-year anniversary the title will finally get an “end game” and much more. Here’s what you need to know about the official Minecraft: Pocket Edition v1.0 update.\nAdvertisement\nOver the past few years the game has grown increasingly more popular. Updates arrive often , but the mobile version still isn’t running v1.0 of the latest software. Now, nearly five years later it’s finally coming. The company has a lot planned to, and released a teaser video for excited fans.\nRead: 5 Tips for Minecraft Pocket Edition New Players\nFor most, the open-world creation game doesn’t have an actual ending. We can just build and build forever. However, that’s finally about to change. We can also expect more music, a soundtrack and other things. Take a peek at the video below.\nAdvertisement\nOn December 1st Mojang released the video above along with an official announcement on the blog . It’s our first look at teaser at the new end boss, among other things. Their game went from being tossed together for mobile in just three months, into a world-wide phenomenon. Now seeing nearly 40 million players across Android, iOS, and Windows 10. And that’s just for Pocket Edition.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the PC version of the game received an ending back in 2012, Pocket Edition never did. It took far longer than many expected and here’s what we know.\nMinecraft Pocket Edition 1.0 Update According to Mojang, the 1.0 update for Pocket Edition will be called the “Ender Update”. Which is of course because of the new Ender Dragon, the final boss. Beat him, and you’ve officially beat the game.\nAdditionally this update will add a lot of other effects and changes. While they aren’t sharing everything just yet, here are a few of the exciting changes you can expect to see in Minecraft Pocket Edition 1.o when it arrives.\nAdvertisement\nWorld Seed Library! We’re making it even easier for you to locate weird and wonderful worlds with this curated catalogue of superior seeds. Polar bears! Snowy biomes will now be prowled by these majestic beasts – but take care around cubs. The parents are very protective. Music! The original soundtrack finally arrives on mobile versions of the game, having already graced Windows 10. We don’t want our jams to jam up your internet pipes though, so it’s available to download separately from the main game. Oculus Touch support! Windows 10 players now have the option to use special VR waggle sticks to control the game! It’s well sci-fi! The Seed Library will make it easier to use portals and see alternate dimensions and other realms. Not to mention new characters in the game like the Polar Boar and its cubs.\nHowever, many fans of the original title will be happy about the music. Pocket Edition 1.0 will have the games original soundtrack. To make things even better, it will be available via a separate download from the game. Meaning the music won’t use data and other things.\nLast but not least, Oculus Touch support. Yes, Windows 10 players will soon have the option to enjoy Minecraft in full VR with the most advanced controls yet.\nPocket Edition 1.0 Update Release Date So that all sounds exciting, but when will it be released? Sadly Mojang didn’t share an exact release date yet, but we have a good idea of when to expect it. Typically the developers release game updates within a few weeks of making any major announcements.\nFollowing past timelines, it should arrive before the end of the year. Potentially right in time for Christmas. Now if we could just get cloud-based game progress saves everything would be perfect. It’s also worth stating that rumors suggest this update will increase block building height from 128 blocks to 256. So get ready to create wonderful things.\nAdvertisement\nIn closing, Mojang and Microsoft state that this is the Ender update, but not the end of Minecraft Pocket Edition. They have a lot more planned for the future, and are looking forward to seeing a 10th anniversary too. We’ll update once we know more, or when the update officially goes live.",

      "text": "While Microsoft’s OneDrive is a pretty great cloud storage service, some people prefer to use other ones like Dropbox, Box, etc. However, when it comes to mobile productivity, probably a lot of people are already using Office for Android on their mobile phone or tablet. Still nothing beats having Word, Excel, and Powerpoint on any device that you’re currently using. The problem is if you’re using a different cloud storage. Well, now Microsoft is allowing you to integrate several cloud storage services to its Office for Android apps through their Cloud Storage Partner Program (CSPP).\nA lot of people who work on the go don’t necessarily save their files on their local storage but would rather upload it on cloud services so they can access it on any device and wherever they are. So integration of these services on popular productivity apps like Office for Android is extremely important. The initial list of available cloud storage options include Dropbox, Box, Egnyte, and Tencent. Hopefully, more services will follow.\nIn the latest version of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, go to the Add a Place section in the menu, then add the cloud storage provider from there. You can then edit and share your documents saved on the cloud, and whatever you do on the Office apps will automatically save back and sync into the cloud. Isn’t life so much easier with that system?\nNext in line, Microsoft is looking to add Citrix ShareFile, Edmodo and Learnium and expand the CSSP to other big and small storage services. I wonder if we’ll even see Google Drive on that list someday.\nSOURCE: Microsoft",

      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 12/02/2016 \nMicrosoft has published a brief new guide for organizations grappling with the ongoing Shell Hashing Algorithim-1 (SHA-1) deprecation, which is a security concern for browser users and Web site operators. \nA new user's guide on SHA-1 deprecation (in PDF format) was announced this week in this blog post . Also, Microsoft this month provided information for organizations using Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on how they can test the effects of SHA-1 deprecation in advance, as detailed in this Microsoft Edge team blog post . There's also a main Microsoft reference publication on the SHA-1 transition, which can be found in this Microsoft wiki post . \nGoogle, Mozilla and Apple are all involved in removing support for SHA-1 in their browsers, as well as Microsoft. SHA-1 hashes have long been used with digital certificates to secure Web sessions, but many software vendors have been working to phase out SHA-1 use in their products in favor of using the SHA-2 hash family instead. \nSecurity researchers have reported that SHA-1 is potentially compromised and is subject to man-in-the-middle types of attacks. An attacker would have to perform hash collision analyses to generate the same hash output for use in fraudulent purposes. However, it's considered to mathematically possible to accomplish this feat with SHA-1. \nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has advocated using the SHA-2 family of hash functions instead ( PDF ). NIST, a standards group that's part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, actually warned in an earlier document ( PDF ) that SHA-1 use should be considered \"unacceptable\" after 2013: \nSome   signing a public key certificate, are very high risk and the use of SHA-1 in those applications should be avoided as much as possible. In NIST’s view, after 2013, the risk is unacceptable in all applications, and the use of SHA-1 when generating a digital signature is not allowed after that date. \nMicrosoft has announced details about its general SHA-1 deprecation plan, including an announcement back in May that the lock icon in its browser would not appear when SHA-1 technology was being used, starting in the summer of 2016. That phase is already in effect. \nThe next phase is slated for Feb. 14, 2017, when Microsoft's software products get updated. At that point, users of Microsoft Edge or the Internet Explorer 11 browser will see a warning about a Web site's security if SHA-1 technology was used. The use of the SHA-1 certificate won't be blocked. Instead, users will see options in their browser, including a not-recommended option to proceed to the Web site. The warning will look like this screenshot: [Click on image for larger view.] Microsoft browser message expected to appear in February when accessing sites using deprecated SHA-1 technology. \nThis change in behavior will only be in effect for \"SHA-1 certificates that chain to a Microsoft Trusteed Root CA [Certificate Authority],\" according to Microsoft's user guide. Certificates that were manually installed by an organization or self-signed won't be affected by this change of behavior. The exception also applies to certificates that were \"cross-signed with a Microsoft Trusted Root.\" \nAlso, the February 2017 software updates won't affect older Internet Explorer browser versions or third-party Windows applications \"that use the Windows cryptographic API set,\" the Microsoft Edge team explained. \nA third phase will kick in at a certain point in which SHA-1 use will be distrusted \"throughout Windows in all contexts\" for Internet Explorer 10 and older versions, as well for other applications. The date when this third phase will happen is yet to be announced by Microsoft. \nOrganizations that have installed the November Windows updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, including the preview of the monthly rollup issued in November, will have the capability to test these coming changes in advance. The steps to carry out those tests are illustrated in Microsoft's Edge team post. About  ",

      "text": "Artificial intelligence may be making small and steady advances in general-purpose situations like digital assistants. But it’s the more subtle AI accessibility features that have a more substantial impact today, especially for users with disabilities. For instance, an upcoming feature for Office apps like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint will automatically suggest image and slide deck captions, called alt-text, using AI algorithms. That way, when those files are presented to blind users, computer tools designed to translate the information onscreen into audio have text descriptions to work with. \nMicrosoft’s AI will analyze images and suggest text to be read aloud Microsoft is accomplishing this feat with its Computer Vision Cognitive Service, which uses neural networks trained with deep learning techniques to better understand and describe the contents of images. “We will offer you automatic suggestions for alt-text when you insert a photographic image that can be recognized with high confidence,” writes the Office 365 team in a blog post . “Through machine learning, this service will keep improving as more people use it, saving you significant time to make media-rich presentations accessible.” Facebook too announced a similar feature for photo captions back in April , and much of the tech industry is using these AI techniques to both improve accessibility and better parse images and videos for valuable data. \nThe feature will be available in Office and PowerPoint on PC starting next year for Office 365 subscribers. Microsoft also says it will be releasing accessible templates that for Office apps that are “structured to ensure ease of navigation with a screen reader and keyboard and use fonts and colors that are easy to read with low vision or color blindness.” For those who choose to customize their documents or slide decks, Microsoft says it has released an accessibility checker for Office PC apps that will review the file and fix any issues that make it difficult for users with disabilities to access the information.\n- Via: VentureBeat - Source: Office Blogs",

Microsoft announced that those who often use Office while on the move will have a few more cloud storage options at their disposal.The Redmond-based company announced that the Cloud Storage Partner Program (CSPP) is now available for all the Office apps that are now listed on Google Play store. This feature was already available for desktop users for quite a long time, but mobile users did not have the option to open and edit documents from a variety of storage locations.Basically, you can now add your own cloud storage solution to whatever Office app you're using. In order to do that simply head to “Add a place” menu in the latest versions of any of the Office apps on Android.That way you will be able to edit and share documents stored with that provider just as you would do with those stored on OneDrive. In addition, you can now launch Word, Excel or PowerPoint directly from the cloud storage provider's app.For the time being, there are only a couple of cloud storage options that you can choose from: Dropbox, Box, Egnyte and Tencent. However, Microsoft promised that it will soon add more cloud storage options, including Citrix ShareFile, Edmodo and Learnium. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

      "text": "Reprints Loading the player... \nThe battle to provide the best digital butler for homes is something Amazon ( AMZN ), Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) will be fighting over for years. \nThese in-home devices with artificial intelligence and language processing skills could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track. \nAmazon upped its game with announcement's at its re:Invent AWS user conference that ended Friday. \nAlready, Amazon grabbed an early lead with its digital butler called Echo — a 9-inch tall cylindrical device with speaker and wireless internet connection. It's infused with artificial intelligence and the ability to understand language, providing the brains that bring Alexa, the voice of Echo, to life. Simply ask, and Echo plays music from the cloud and delivers broadcast news, sports, weather and many other features via the voice of Alexa. It can also control lights in the home. The Echo sells for $179.99, with a low-end compact version, the Echo Dot, selling for $49.99. \nThe Google unit of Alphabet recently followed Amazon with the introduction of Google Home , a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant, which sells for $129. IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system . Strong earnings growth (the C and A in the CAN SLIM System, for Current earnings and Annual earnings) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but New products or services often generate stellar profitability. \nMicrosoft has yet to introduce a similar device for the home but has deep roots in artificial intelligence with its Cortana platform, available on mobile devices and PCs. This is also true of Apple with its Siri platform and Facebook ( FB ) with its Messenger platform. Facebook and Microsoft are tapping into software apps for smartphones called bots, software that performs automated tasks. \nThe devices have the potential of being the central hub of a smart-home ecosystem. Amazon is reportedly working on an Echo device that comes with a 7-inch touch screen , according to a Bloomberg report. It said the device could be introduced in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon's Re:Invent Announcements \nAmazon revealed several new services based on artificial intelligence at re:Invent conference, held in Las Vegas. \nOne is Rekognition, a platform that enables developers to build applications that analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. \nAmazon also introduced Polly, an artificially intelligent text-to-speech platform that could be used, for example, with software bots to provide a customer service feature. \nA third announcement was Lex, which can be used to build conversational applications. Lex helps power the Amazon Echo device, giving a personality to its voice by Alexa. \nAs to who will be the top dogs in this battle of brains is a wide open debate. Amazon is currently the market leader with Echo, reportedly with more than 4 million sold, but even it has work to do, according to commentary from Edison Investment Research via email. \n\"Still an awful lot of work to do for Amazon,\" Edison said about Echo. \nOn Wednesday, Amazon and Intel ( INTC ) announced a partnership, with two technology initiatives for the smart home ecosystem. \nOne initiative is designed to enable Alexa to remotely control and coordinate device actions with an Intel-based Smart Home Hub. The second is an Intel-based smart speaker reference design with Amazon Alexa included. It is intended to help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services . \n\"We would not be surprised to see Google follow suit in this strategy with Google Assistant where, once again, it will have the advantage because we have long believed that Google Assistant is vastly superior to anything else in terms if the user experience that it offers and the usefulness of its responses,\" the Edison commentary said. \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a research note said Amazon has been investing in voice technology for more than five years and believes it could be the next major disruption in computing, serving as a primary user interface in the next computing generation. \n\"We've been hearing many of the 'smartest people' at Amazon want to work on Alexa because they sense it's a major growth area for the company and will be 'something big,' \" Mahaney wrote. \"We believe the Echo devices could be one of the (technology) gifts this holiday season.\" \nMahaney has an outperform rating on Amazon and price target of 950. \nAmazon stock fell 0.45% to 740.34 in the stock market today . The stock has been sliding since hitting an all-time high of 847.21 on Oct. 6. \nPacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin in a research note said initial customer response to the AI applications announced by Amazon at re:Invent was strong and could further complement and differentiate Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. \nBracelin has an overweight rating and price target of 905 on Amazon stock. \nRELATED:",

News Tweet by Damian Seeto on December 1, 2016 \nMicrosoft has released the latest trailer for Halo Wars 2. It tells us the backstory of Atriox who is set to be the big bad guy in the game. \nThe official Xbox YouTube page posted the following: “ His name is Atriox, a Brute enslaved by the Covenant who eventually rose up against his masters and became a legend. His rebellion inspired the birth of The Banished, a savage army of mercenaries and killers now on the brink of acquiring the most powerful weapons platform the galaxy has ever seen. The only things between Atriox and his prize are Captain James Cutter and the crew of the USNC Spirit of Fire. Outgunned and long past any hope for reinforcements, Cutter’s survival depends on how quickly he can master the first law of the battlefield: Know your enemy .” \nHalo Wars 2 is the sequel to the RTS original. This time though, the game is out on Xbox One as well as Windows 10 PC. The release date for the game is February 21st, 2017. You can check out the new trailer below.",

      "text": "Top 5 free extensions for Microsoft Edge By Francis Navarro, Komando.com \nWith the release of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update in August, Microsoft finally rolled out extension support for its Edge browser, making it more competitive with products like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. \nAlthough the Microsoft Edge add-on selection is still not as varied nor as extensive as the other browsers, there are some pretty useful extensions that you can try now. \nHere are our top five free Microsoft Edge extensions: 1. Microsoft Translator \nAs the name of this extension suggests, Microsoft Translator translates foreign language websites to any of 50+ supported languages. Compatible websites will display the Microsoft Translator icon on the Edge address bar. Try selecting specific text and right-click to translate. \n2. Amazon Assistant \nThis official Edge extension is a companion add-on that enhances the Amazon online shopping experience. Amazon Assistant gives Edge users nifty shortcuts to the Deal of the Day, Wish Lists, Product Comparisons and your other favorite Amazon departments. Having personal recommendations delivered straight to the add-on is a great feature for deal-hunters.",

      "text": "As Amazon.com 's ( AMZN ) re:Invent conference draws to a close on Friday, the company's expanded partnerships and services could be a boon for some companies, but a thorn in the side of some other enterprise giants.\nAmazon announced an expanded partnership with Salesforce.com ( CRM ) comprising several areas. Users of Salesforce's AppExchange will be able to use Amazon's app streaming service, while Internet of Things customers can crunch data from networked device on Amazon's IoT platform and move it into their Salesforce databases. Salesforce will also draw on Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition tech, among other matters.\n\"That benefits Salesforce quite a bit,\" said Ryan MacDonald of Wunderlich Securities said of the pact.\nAmazon announced a range of cloud partnerships and services during the week-long Las Vegas conference for Amazon Web Services users and developers, from an agreement with Workday ( WDAY ) to new offerings in databases and voice-recognition technology. The moves will ripple through enterprise software, benefiting companies like Salesforce and Workday, but presenting new challenges for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Oracle ( ORCL ) and others.\nThe decade-old Amazon Web Services is \"one of the most formidable threats to other software vendors as it continues to release compelling competing services, and improve on existing offerings,\" Raimo Lenschow of Barclays wrote in a note about the conference.\nThe cloud unit is \"the fastest-growing, multi-billion dollar, enterprise IT [company] in the world,\" according to Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald. \"With new features and services in 2016 on track to hit 1,000 (vs. 722 introduced in 2015), the pace of AWS innovation is hard to match by any of its competitors,\" the analyst wrote in a report this week.\nBy itself, Amazon Web Services is worth $160 billion, or 44% of Amazon's enterprise value, according to Macquarie, which values the cloud unit at 9 times projected 2017 revenues. Microsoft's Azure and the cloud service Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google also have strong positions in the public cloud, but Amazon Web Services is the clear leader.\nAlphabet is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Dec 2, 2016 Convert Oracle Queries into Microsoft SQL Format \nMigration of an Oracle database to Microsoft SQL server involves converting Oracle queries into the destination format. The syntax of queries in Oracle and SQL is similar, yet not equal. Also, these two DBMS have distinguished sets of built-in functions. Learn more about the most important differences between Oracle and MS SQL syntax. Oracle's operator (+) is specific notation for LEFT OUTER JOIN. In Microsoft SQL it must be replaced by LEFT JOIN. Oracle's function TO_DATE must be replaced by CONVERT in Microsoft SQL. Oracle's CONCAT($s1, $s2) function returns $s2 appended or concatenated to $s1. MS SQL does not have the equivalent function, so it must be replaced by concatenation operator, the plus sign. Oracle's function nvl($var, $expr) that returns $expr if $var is NULL must be replaced by MS SQL equivalent ISNULL($var, $expr). Oracle's function nvl2($var,$expr1,$expr2) that returns $arg2 if $var is NULL and $arg1 if $var is not NULL must be replaced in MS SQL as follows: CASE WHEN $var IS NOT NULL THEN $arg1 ELSE $arg2 END Oracle's function SYSDATE that returns the current date and time must be replaced by GETDATE(). Oracle does not require aliases for subqueries, while Microsoft SQL require it. Oracle's function TO_DATE must be replaced by CONVERT as follows: TO_DATE( $date, 'YYYYMMDD' ) - CONVERT( DATETIME, $date ) Oracle's function ADD_MONTHS($datetime, $n) that adds $n months to $datetime must be replaced by DATEADD($month, $n, datetime) in MS SQL.

      "text": "Markets Today How Amazon's Rapidly Growing Cloud Business Threatens Microsoft and Oracle Amazon Web Services is building up a formidable range of features and partners, challenging the big enterprise software providers. Chris Nolter Dec2,20162:30PMEST \nAs Amazon.com 's ( AMZN ) re:Invent conference draws to a close on Friday, the company's expanded partnerships and services could be a boon for some companies, but a thorn in the side of some other enterprise giants. \nAmazon announced an expanded partnership with Salesforce.com ( CRM ) comprising several areas. Users of Salesforce's AppExchange will be able to use Amazon's app streaming service, while Internet of Things customers can crunch data from networked device on Amazon's IoT platform and move it into their Salesforce databases. Salesforce will also draw on Amazon's Alexa voice-recognition tech, among other matters. \n\"That benefits Salesforce quite a bit,\" said Ryan MacDonald of Wunderlich Securities said of the pact. \nAmazon announced a range of cloud partnerships and services during the week-long Las Vegas conference for Amazon Web Services users and developers, from an agreement with Workday ( WDAY ) to new offerings in databases and voice-recognition technology. The moves will ripple through enterprise software, benefiting companies like Salesforce and Workday, but presenting new challenges for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Oracle ( ORCL ) and others. \nThe decade-old Amazon Web Services is \"one of the most formidable threats to other software vendors as it continues to release compelling competing services, and improve on existing offerings,\" Raimo Lenschow of Barclays wrote in a note about the conference. \nThe cloud unit is \"the fastest-growing, multi-billion dollar, enterprise IT [company] in the world,\" according to Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald. \"With new features and services in 2016 on track to hit 1,000 (vs. 722 introduced in 2015), the pace of AWS innovation is hard to match by any of its competitors,\" the analyst wrote in a report this week. \nBy itself, Amazon Web Services is worth $160 billion, or 44% of Amazon's enterprise value, according to Macquarie, which values the cloud unit at 9 times projected 2017 revenues. Microsoft's Azure and the cloud service Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google also have strong positions in the public cloud, but Amazon Web Services is the clear leader.

      "text": "Office for Android now allows more cloud storage integration By 0 \nWhile Microsoft’s OneDrive is a pretty great cloud storage service, some people prefer to use other ones like Dropbox, Box, etc. However, when it comes to mobile productivity, probably a lot of people are already using Office for Android on their mobile phone or tablet. Still nothing beats having Word, Excel, and Powerpoint on any device that you’re currently using. The problem is if you’re using a different cloud storage. Well, now Microsoft is allowing you to integrate several cloud storage services to its Office for Android apps through their Cloud Storage Partner Program (CSPP). \nA lot of people who work on the go don’t necessarily save their files on their local storage but would rather upload it on cloud services so they can access it on any device and wherever they are. So integration of these services on popular productivity apps like Office for Android is extremely important. The initial list of available cloud storage options include Dropbox, Box, Egnyte, and Tencent. Hopefully, more services will follow. \nIn the latest version of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, go to the Add a Place section in the menu, then add the cloud storage provider from there. You can then edit and share your documents saved on the cloud, and whatever you do on the Office apps will automatically save back and sync into the cloud. Isn’t life so much easier with that system? \nNext in line, Microsoft is looking to add Citrix ShareFile, Edmodo and Learnium and expand the CSSP to other big and small storage services. I wonder if we’ll even see Google Drive on that list someday.",

      "text": "share Microsoft expands its accessibility efforts on Windows 10 The upcoming Creators Update features a slew of new features designed with the disabled in mind, including support for braille. Share Save \nMicrosoft is keen on making sure people with disabilities can use their products, and next year it's only going to expand upon that directive. It starts with some big additions to Windows 10 and Narrator for the Creators Update like support for braille, some 10 news voices for text to speech and volume ducking when Narrator chimes in while you're listening to Spotify or another music program. \nNarrator will also dovetail better with the Edge browser too, making it easier to fill out forms and navigation via heading levels. On Xbox One (that's a Windows device too, remember?) you'll be able to tweak how fast Narrator speaks and the pitch of its voice. \nIf you were worried that Office 365 would be left out, those fears were unfounded. Next year, the productivity suite will make it easier to create stuff that's accessible by people with disabilities. That includes an AI boost from its Computer Vision Cognitive Service that makes it \" easy to insert alternative text descriptions for images and meaningful display names for hyperlinks, as well as making the accessibility checker available in more Office applications\". There are a few other bits and bobs like a read-aloud while simultaneously highlighting text option and a tool that breaks words into syllables for easier reading. \nThose last bits are already rolling out to Office Insiders and people in the First Release programs. Everyone else is just going to have to be patient until next spring, it sounds like.",

But that's not the only improvement included in the latest update. Microsoft also included the ability to add decorative frames to any image, both still and Live Images . Along with this option, there are quite a few frames that you can choose from included in the app.Last but not least, the update is meant to bring some improvements to picture processing. So, the white balance has been adjusted slightly warmer to enhance the healthy glow of skin tones.If you haven't tried Microsoft Pix Camera and you own an iPhone 7 Plus now would be a good time to take advantage of the new features. Keep in mind that the application is only compatible with devices running iOS 9.0 or newer. Microsoft Pix Camera for iOS Popular galleries",

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Next Post >> x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The Microsoft logo is seen on an electronic billboard on an office building in New York City. Reuters/Mike Segar \nIt looks like Microsoft is nowhere near done with the mobile department after all, and it is making progress in the development of the Microsoft Surface Phone. \nTaiwan-based publication Commercial Times claims that Chinese supplier Pegatron has teamed up with Microsoft again for the Redmond giant's smartphone flagship. \nPegatron is reportedly preparing to begin production trials for the Microsoft Surface Phone, which means that the device is not canceled after all. \nMicrosoft has enlisted Pegatron for the production of its newly unveiled Surface Studio, which makes it likely that the company is working with the supplier for the Microsoft Surface Phone as well. \nAdditionally, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has recently said that the company is not done with mobile devices yet and is, in fact, looking to create \"the most ultimate mobile device.\" Advertisement \nCommercial Times also reports that the flagship will be powered by an Intel mobile processor and will feature a new and improved Continuum that will allow for x86 emulation.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today \nInterestingly, it was reported that the Microsoft Surface Phone will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. \nThe mobile chipset will be the first from Qualcomm to make use of the 10-nanometer technology, which will allow Microsoft to make the Surface Phone thinner or use a bigger battery pack. \nEither chipsets will do when it comes to Microsoft's efforts to have the Microsoft Surface Phone run x86 apps, which is something that the Continuum in its current state is unable to do. \nAlthough the Microsoft Surface Phone is already in production testing, Commercial Times says that Microsoft will not release it until late next year or early 2018. However, a 2017 unveiling is expected. \nThis is also likely since, like what Mary Jo Foley of ZDNet said , Microsoft could be waiting for the Redstone 3 update for Windows 10, which is not coming until late next year.

      "text": "By Paul Hill Neowin LLC @_paulh93 · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft has announced the next update for Gear of War 4 that is set to be released on December 6th. It will include several improvements and two new maps (available from December 13th and December 6th for Season Pass holders). Season Pass holders will be able to earn additional XP and Credit rewards when playing the Developer Playlist, while it's available, too. \nThe main attraction in the new update is the additional maps, called Speyer and Glory. Unfortunately, those without a Season Pass will lose access to the maps: Gridlock and Relic, for the time being. Non-Season Pass holders can buy those maps individually in the Gears of War store, or buy a Season Pass. Liam Ashley, Community Manager at The Coalition, said: \n“Speyer: Evacuated long ago, this lonely district of Speyer is a still image of pre-Locust War life. The battle for the sanctuary is a close quarters affair, but teams looking to control the sprawling academy will need to do so together. Speyer’s opulent interiors and quaint plazas are best suited to longer range engagements. \nGlory: A monument of military might, this COG battery was used only against the most strategic targets to maintain its secrecy. The defensibility of this fortress can be used to your advantage if captured, which includes a powerful mounted turret that can suppress the courtyard below.” \nAs for other updates to the game, the developers have added “several highly requested improvements along with some new features.” The highlights are: A Daily Rewards system. Improved visual feedback for damage dealt with the Gnasher. Vertical Split-Screen for Windows 10 players. Improvements to footstep audio balance, audio/video settings. \nIf you haven’t got the game yet, now is the time to get it. Between December 1st and December 28th, it will have 33% knocked off its full price.",

      "text": "Comments 0 Advertisement \nThe fact that Microsoft is offering a series of daily deals/discounts through their online and physical Microsoft Stores leading up to Christmas is not major news because they have done this for quite a few years. \nHowever, there are two big differences this year with the annual tradition compared to years past. \nThe first is that the company has revealed all of the daily deals ahead of time instead of attempting to keep it under wraps. The entire list has always leaked out in the past so this puts Microsoft in control of the release. \nSecondly, it looks like if you want to enjoy the majority of the discounts on software and services then you will need to get those in the physical stores and not online because they will be offered as in-store door busters in the U.S. and in-store door crashers in Canada instead. \nOf course with all of the offers over this 12 day period, they are caveated with the standard while supplies last . It also appears these deals will only be offered in the U.S. and Canada . \nIt looks like the door buster/crasher offers are the same at U.S. and Canadian physical stores and there are just a couple of variations between the daily deals in each country. \nHere is a rundown of the 12 Daily Deals (physical and online) for U.S. customers: Day 1: Save up to $1,000 on select Intel PCs starting at $199, available Monday, Dec. 5 only.
