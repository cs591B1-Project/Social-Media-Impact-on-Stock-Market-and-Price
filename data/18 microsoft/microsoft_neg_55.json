      "title": "Microsoft releases patch for zero-day Flash and Windows Kernel exploit",
      "text": "The programs written today will inform the systems built tomorrow. If designers all have one worldview, we can expect equally narrow-minded machines. More Microsoft released a patch on Tuesday to fix a zero-day Flash and Windows Kernel vulnerability recently outed by Google. Microsoft had stated previously a fix was being internally tested and would roll out to all relevant Windows platforms and it made good on its word.\nMicrosoft previously took the opportunity to chastise Google for releasing the breach data publicly before Microsoft was ready to release a patch.\nAt the end of October, Google, in accordance with its disclosure timeline for active vulnerabilities , publicly detailed a pair of nasty vulnerabilities in both Adobe’s Flash and Microsoft’s Windows platform. This came after a week of internal discussion with both companies, which saw the former issue a patch for their software and the latter not.\n“We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” said Terry Myerson , executive vice president of Windows and Devices Group.\nGoogle maintains however that it gave Microsoft plenty of time to respond to the news. Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google’s Threat Analysis Group reports submitted a warning to both Adobe and Microsoft over zero-day vulnerabilities discovered in Adobe Flash and Windows. The report was provided to both companies on October 21 and Adobe immediately responded on October 26 with an update to Flash.\n“The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape,” they stated on Monday. “It can be triggered via the win32k.sys system call NtSetWindowLongPtr() for the index GWLP_ID on a window handle with GWL_STYLE set to WS_CHILD.”\nMore: Oh, look! It’s another patched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash Player software\nThis is a bug that Microsoft claims is now being actively exploited by a Russian hacking group, which it names as Strontium — though as BetaNews explains, it has gone by other names, too. This is a group previously cited as a Russian state actor, suggesting some sort of blessing from the country’s administration.\nThe attacks have involved targeted spear phishing against a subset of Windows users, though Microsoft did not detail who makes up that group, which doesn’t do much to comfort potentially affected users. It did however go out of its way to claim that Windows 10 users running Microsoft’s Edge browser were protected from it.\nAlthough Microsoft didn’t state as such, customers who use the Chrome browser should not see a problem either, as its “sandbox” capability blocks calls to a core Windows component (win32k.sys) by taking advantage of a lockdown feature built into Windows. This prevents hackers from using the newly discovered vulnerability to escape the browser’s sandbox environment.\nMore: Nvidia has licensed Rambus technology to help identify new attack vulnerabilities\nIf you are not familiar with what sandboxing does, just imagine a virtual box that keeps all running code related to the internet contained as a separate entity in the browser, preventing code, malicious or not, from spilling over into the Windows environment and executing separately. But with the new vulnerability, hackers could create internet-based malware that could slip through the container’s cracks and install on a targeted PC.\nThus, Windows customers not using Google Chrome could be subject to an attack when surfing the internet with another browser.\n“We encourage users to verify that auto-updaters have already updated Flash — and to manually update if not — and to apply Windows patches from Microsoft when they become available for the Windows vulnerability,” Google said in a statement of its own. Now that the fix has been released, users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid being subject to a hack attack.\nAdobe warned about CVE-2016-7855 last week, stating that the vulnerability enables hackers to run malicious code on a target PC using a Flash file. In turn, this code can install various threats in the PC’s system that eventually can grant the hacker full control. The problem was listed as critical and was accompanied by a patch bringing Flash Player up to version 232.0.0.205 for Windows/Mac/Chrome OS, and up to version 11.2.202.643 for Linux.\nRead More According to Adobe, the targeted attacks are limited and focus on machines running Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. So far, there are no signs that hackers are targeting Linux machines as well, but Adobe released a patch for those users nonetheless.\nWeb surfers not sure about what version of Flash Player they are using can check the version number by heading here to allow Adobe’s website to scan the locally installed software. Users can also right-click on a webpage’s (many) Flash component(s) and select “About Adobe (or Macromedia) Flash Player” from the menu. Users should do this for every browser installed on the PC.\nUpdated on 11-08-2016 by Mark Coppock: Added note that the exploit has been fixed in the November 8 patch.\nOh, look! It’s another patched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash Player software Microsoft left the Secure Boot golden key sitting out in the open",

It features seven people who are at least trying to bring communities together, rather than divide them.\nYes, of course there's a product element. Each of these people is contributing to a drawing being created on Microsoft's Surface Studio .\nBut the issues being addressed here are both large and emotive. There's Florida police officer Bobby White, dubbed the \" basketball cop ,\" who says: \"There's a damaged relationship between America's youth and the American police officer.\"\nThere's Jazz Jennings talking about the issue of transgender youth.\nMore Technically Incorrect Donald Trump uses Twitter to attack China Oakland fire commune leader's Facebook post outrages many Man streamed 115 mph ride on Facebook before crash, police say There's Zea Bowling, the 7-year-old who faced down an anti-gay preacher during a parade . There's Zianna Oliphant, the 9-year-old who spoke clearly about black rights in the wake of the shooting of Keith Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina.\nSome will see naked politics in this ad. They will see an agenda from a certain side and think it's not right.\nBut can a life driven by fear, friction and loathing ever be happy?\nThat, perhaps, is the question this ad asks most. It's a sentiment worth thinking about as the holidays come upon us and spread messages of happiness, while many people don't consider themselves happy at all.\n ",

Photo by Microsoft/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nThere was a time when Microsoft merely begged Apple to be nice during the holidays. \nNow, it's begging the whole world. \nThis year's holiday ad from Redmond is a collage of pain and hope. It features seven people who are at least trying to bring communities together, rather than divide them. \nYes, of course there's a product element. Each of these people is contributing to a drawing being created on Microsoft's Surface Studio . \nBut the issues being addressed here are both large and emotive. There's Florida police officer Bobby White, dubbed the \" basketball cop ,\" who says: \"There's a damaged relationship between America's youth and the American police officer.\" \nThere's Jazz Jennings talking about the issue of transgender youth.

      "text": "SC notice to Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft These companies are to reply to the apex court by Jan 9, 2017 These companies are to reply to the apex court by Jan 9, 2017 The Supreme Court on Monday sought response from tech firms Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Facebook on a plea seeking curbs on sharing of sexual offence videos on social networking sites and steps to check cybercrimes. A bench of M B Lokur and U U Lalit issued notice to these companies and sought their reply on the plea by January 9. Advocate Aparna Bhatt, appearing for non-governmental organisation Prajwala, said that rape videos are shot and posted on social networking sites and internet companies should take steps to curb such cybercrime. Additional solicitor general Maninder Singh, representing the Centre, detailed the steps taken by Union home ministry and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is the nodal agency for cybercrimes. He said that the debate over making public the names of sexual offenders is on in India and abroad and whatever decision is taken in this regard will be implemented. To this, the bench said that if the names of sexual offenders are to be made public, it should be done only after the conviction in the offence, not after the case is lodged. \"It will tarnish the image of a person, if he is acquitted in the sexual offence case,\" it said. The bench also directed that if the state police finds nothing against a person after probing a sexual offence case, then CBI will not interrogate that person with regard to the cyber aspect. It also directed the Centre to include steps to curb sexual violence against children on the list of measures to be taken for curbing crime against women. \"As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data there is sharp rise in cases of sexual violence against children,\" it said. The court was hearing a letter sent to then Chief Justice of India H L Dattu by Hyderabad-based NGO Prajwala along with two rape videos in a pen drive. It had taken suo motu note of the letter on the posting of these videos on 'WhatsApp' and had asked CBI to launch a probe forthwith to nab the culprits. Press Trust of India",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nCrackdown 3 , the long-awaited third installment in Microsoft’s super-cop action-adventure franchise, will arrive on Xbox One and PC by next holiday season, and it will feature 4K support for the new, beefed-up Scorpio console.\nDuring an Extra Life stream spotted by NeoGAF user “ Chris1, ” the Xbox team revealed that Crackdown 3 will be launching by holiday 2017 , and possibly even earlier.\nMicrosoft Studios director of production Jorg Neumann also confirmed that the game will run in 4K on Project Scorpio, but he stopped short of stating whether this would be a native 4K resolution or the upscaling we’ve seen on several PlayStation 4 Pro-enhanced games. It may have been implied to be the former, however: back in September, Microsoft stated that “any games” launching after Scorpio releases will render natively in 4K.\nMore: Xbox Project Scorpio: Everything you need to know about Microsoft’s newest console\nCrackdown 3 has largely been missing in action in 2016, skipping out on E3 2016 as creative director Dave Jones revealed that the game would be slipping into a 2017 release window.\nThe original Crackdown launched back in 2007 to a positive critical reception, though enthusiasm for the title was likely boosted by the game’s inclusion of the Halo 3 multiplayer beta. A sequel followed in 2010, but it was criticized for its blandness and lack of innovation over the original. Jones, whose studio Realtime Worlds developed the original but was not involved with Crackdown 2 , expressed frustration that an outside developer was given the reigns. Soon after, the Realtime-developed APB: All Points Bulletin launched to negative reviews.\nHopefully, Crackdown 3 will successfully translate the brand onto a new generation of machines. Heavy cloud computing support allows for the game’s multiplayer maps to be completely, and intricately, destroyed. To preserve the challenge and focus of the game’s story component, this destruction will be largely absent from the single-player mode.\nWhen Crackdown 3 launches next year, it will be a part of the Xbox Play Anywhere program, giving digital purchasers a copy for both Xbox One and Windows 10.\nPre-Order from:\nAmazon\nXbox Project Scorpio: Everything you need to know about Microsoft’s newest console Xbox Scorpio will cost more than Xbox One S, Phil Spencer confirms Microsoft: Expect native 4K gaming with Project Scorpio",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nI'm using Microsoft RxJS JavaScript library in two lightning components. One is autocomplete component and another coordination of reading multiple files. I really like this library and it is useful for building complex logic that depends on multiple events. Also it is so popular that there is propasal to do similar thing in ECMA script standard proposal-observable . Currently I need to deactivate LockerService to make it work. I don't see why it does something dangerous because its semantics is simple and it doesn't access or changes DOM tree. \nSample code: initSuggestions : function(component) { var subject = new Rx.Subject(); component.set(\"v.searchSubject\", subject); var contextSubscribe = $A.getCallback(function(observer, search) { if (component.isValid()) { if (search.length > 0) { var action = component.get(\"c.getSuggestions\"); action.setParams({filter: search}); action.setCallback(this, function(response) { var state = response.getState(); if (component.isValid() && state === 'SUCCESS') { observer.onNext(response.getReturnValue()); observer.onCompleted(); } else { observer.onCompleted(); } }); $A.enqueueAction(action, true); } else { observer.onNext([]); observer.onCompleted(); } } }); var getSuggestions$ = function(search) { return Rx.Observable.create(function(observer) { contextSubscribe(observer, search); }); }; var suggestions$ = subject .debounce(250) .distinctUntilChanged() .flatMapLatest(getSuggestions$) .distinctUntilChanged() .share(); var isOpen$ = suggestions$ .map(function(element) { return (element.length > 0); }) .distinctUntilChanged(); var subscription1 = suggestions$.subscribe(function(suggestions) { if (component.isValid()) { component.set(\"v.suggestions\", suggestions); } }); var subscription2 = isOpen$.subscribe(function(isOpen) { if (component.isValid()) { var lookup = component.find(\"element-control\"); if (isOpen) { $A.util.addClass(lookup, \"slds-is-open\"); } else { $A.util.removeClass(lookup, \"slds-is-open\"); } } }); component.set(\"v.suggestionsSubscription\", new Rx.CompositeDisposable(subscription1, subscription2)); } \nAnother sample: // // Read files // var readFile$ = function(attachment) { return Rx.Observable.create(function(observer) { var reader = new FileReader(); reader.onload = $A.getCallback(function(e) { observer.onNext({ attachment: attachment, result: e.target.result }); observer.onCompleted(); }); reader.onerror = $A.getCallback(function(e) { observer.onError(); }); reader.readAsDataURL(attachment); }); } var readFile$s = attachments.map(readFile$); var readFiles$ = Rx.Observable.merge(readFile$s); var subscription = readFiles$.subscribe( // // When file is read // function(event) { var base64Mark = \"base64,\"; var base64Start = event.result.indexOf(base64Mark) + base64Mark.length; event.attachment.body = event.result.substring(base64Start); }, // // On error // function() { if (component.isValid()) { component.set(\"v.isSending\", false); helper.showToast(\"Sending has failed\", \"There was a problem with reading attachments\"); } }, // // On completed // function() { // // Send email // var addressEmail = function(address) { return address.email; }; var action = component.get(\"c.sendEmail\"); action.setParams({ orgWideEmailAddressId: orgWideEmailAddressId, toAddresses: toAddresses.map(addressEmail), ccAddresses: ccAddresses.map(addressEmail), bccAddresses: bccAddresses.map(addressEmail), subject: subject, objectId: objectId, templateId: templateId, fileNames: attachments.map(function(attachment) { return attachment.name; }), contentTypes: attachments.map(function(attachment) { return attachment.type; }), bodies: attachments.map(function(attachment) { return attachment.body; }), }); action.setCallback(this, function(resp) { if (component.isValid()) { component.set(\"v.isSending\", false); if (resp.getState() === 'SUCCESS') { helper.navigateToRecord(component); } else { component.set(\"v.isSending\", false); helper.showToast( \"Sending has failed\", \"There was a problem with sending an email\" ); } } }); $A.enqueueAction(action); } ); component.set(\"v.filesSubscription\", subscription); \nAlso it is used in some big companies so it would be very helpful if it would work with LockerService.

Saturday Dec 3, 2016 at 12:01 AM Dec 5, 2016 at 3:30 PM The heavily accented voice on the phone said, \"Hello, I’m with Microsoft technical service. My name is Michael. How are you?\" But \"Michael\" from \"Microsoft\" picked the wrong \"old guy\" to scam. By Emory Schley Columnist \nSo, I was sitting there mindlessly watching some codswallop on TV when the phone rang. Caller ID said the calling number was “Unavailable.” I picked it up anyway and said “Hello.” \nThe heavily accented voice on the other end replied, “Hello, I’m with Microsoft technical service. My name is Michael. How are you?” \n“Reasonably OK for an old guy,” I replied. He then said he was calling about my Windows computer. Anyone who has ever known me knows I’m a Macintosh guy, completely, totally, and thoroughly saturated to the core with Apple juice. \n“Which computer?” I said. “Oh, my WINDOWS computer. I see. You must mean the one BY the windows? We moved that one over by our doors. So technically, it’s no longer a Windows Computer, it’s now a Doors Computer.” \n“Windows by Microsoft,” he said. \n“No, carpenters build windows, Microsoft makes computer stuff,” I said. \n“Yes, computers by windows.” \n“No, our computer is by the doors, definitely NOT the windows. Look here,” I said, “what is the serial number of the computer we’re talking about? I’m trying to determine if you’re talking about the Doors Computer or the Bathroom Computer.” \n“What is a baffroom?” he asked. \n“The bathroom, you know, where you take a bath. Everyone in America has a computer in their bathroom. Don’t you?” \n“Uhhhh,” he seemed to be struggling for an answer here. \n“Just give me the serial number so I’ll know which computer you’re calling about,” I said. \n“I'm sorry, I don’t know the serial number. I'm just calling about problem you have with the Windows computer.” \n“Look, if you can’t tell me the serial number of the computer you’re calling me about, how am I supposed to know WHICH one we’re talking about? I don’t have ANY computer that says Windows on it. There’s one that says ‘Hewlett-Packard,’ another one that says ‘TOSHIBA’ and somewhere around here is one that says ‘DELL’ or maybe it’s ‘BELL’ or ‘CELL’ or something like that. \n“What the ...” I heard him say. \n“NO, NO, NO, there is NO ‘H’ in it!” \n“First,” he said, “we need credit card information, then I can help you with your computer.” \n“My credit card? No, I’m afraid my credit card won’t fit. The only place to put stuff in my computer is in that little door where those round things go. I think they’re called CDs, or DVDs, or maybe VCRs, who knows? Anyway I definitely know you can’t put credit cards in there. They’re the wrong shape.” \n“No, don’t put in the computer! Give me the long number from front of card, then I help you with Windows computer.” \n“Well, let’s see what I have in my wallet here,” I told him. “I have a driver’s license with a long number. You want that?” \n“No, no driver’s license. Long number from credit card, please.” \n“OK, not driver’s license. Hmmm. Here’s an old tattered PTA card, an NRA card, an AARP card, a membership card and a coupon for 30 percent off some pizza and wings, but all those just have short numbers. How long does the number have to be?” \n“Many numbers,” he almost shouted. I was beginning to think he might be getting frustrated. I didn’t see why. After all, HE’s the one who wanted the numbers, not me. \n“What if I make up a number? Would that work?” \n“What means 'make up?,'” he asked. \n“Oh, makeup! That’s what some women wear on their faces. You know, typical cosmetics like powder, rouge, lipstick, eyeliner, that kind of stuff! But I don’t think they put numbers on any of it. But I could go in my wife’s bathroom and check, if you like.” \n“No, not bathroom, not makeup, NUMBERS on the credit card!” He was starting to get a bit indignant. \n“We don’t seem to be communicating very well here,” I said. “Perhaps I should speak to your supervisor.” \n“We no have supervisor. Just need number, long number from credit card, please.” \nNot knowing any other long numbers off the top of my head, I told him, “Look, I can quote the value of pi out to about 20 decimal places. Why don’t I just do that and you can stop me when you’ve got enough numbers.” \n“What does pie have to do with a credit card?” he asked. \n“How should I know? You’re the one who wants the numbers! Maybe you’re hungry for some sweets?” \nI heard an agonizing “Aarrrgghhh!” from the other end of the line and then the connection clicked off. \nGee, did I say something wrong to him? \nLife can be quite a mystery at times! \n— Please send your comments to slyguy73@gmail.com and include your FULL name and town.

      "title": "Office Q&A: How to replace direct formats with styles in a Word document",
      "text": "Microsoft Office 365: The smart person's guide With styles \nLet's pretend, for a moment, that the author had used styles so you can see why I'm such a strong proponent. Figure A shows a simple document with some body text in Normal and subheadings in Heading 2. Figure A Let's change the appearance of the subheadings. \nFirst, you can modify the style itself by right-clicking Heading 2 in the gallery, choosing Modify, and then resetting options. If the style isn't visible in the gallery, it takes a bit more work. Reformatting one instance and then updating the style accordingly might be a bit quicker. To illustrate this route, let's change Heading 2's font size and color as follows: Select a single instance of the appropriately styled text. Use the Font Size control to change the font size to 18. Use the Font Color control to change the color to red. After changing the appropriate formats, right-click the style in the gallery. Choose Update Heading 2 to Match Selection ( Figure B ). Figure B Update the style. \nAs you can see in Figure C , the change updates all instances of Heading 2 text. In such a simple document you could manually change two subheadings with little effort, but in a long document with many instances, manually updating each one would be tedious and subject to errors. For example, you might accidentally choose the wrong size or color or even miss some instances altogether. Figure C Modifying the style updates all instances of that style in the document. \nKeep in mind that direct formatting still takes precedence. If someone had applied direct formatting to any of the styled subheadings, Word would retain the direct formatting if the modification to the style was in conflict. For instance, if you had changed the font size of one of your subheadings to 8, Word wouldn't change the font size for that text when you modified the style's font size. SEE: 10 Things: How to use Word templates effectively Without styles \nNow, let's move on to a solution that Janet can use and perhaps convert a few non-style believers. But first, the subheading Without styles is a bit misleading. Whether you realize it or not, you are always using a style; Normal is Word's default style. The mistake some people make is using direct formatting, instead of styles, to change Normal's appearance. To illustrate, Figure D shows the headings as Normal (check the gallery) with direct formats. As a result, changing all of the subheadings at once is a two-step process: First, we'll use Word's Replace feature to find all instances of the direct formats and apply a style. Then, we'll use the Select option to select all headings with similar formatting and remove the direct formatting, leaving the newly applied style in place. Figure D Direct formatting was used to distinguish the Normal-styled headings. \nWe'll begin by applying the Heading 2 format to all text with the font Ar Blanca 20 in dark blue. The feature won't actually replace the formats, but rather, it will apply the specified style to all text matching the formats specified as find criteria. To get started, do the following: Press [Ctrl]+H to open the Find And Replace dialog. Click inside the Find What control. Click More if necessary to display additional options. Click the Format dropdown at the bottom-left and choose Font ( Figure E ). In the resulting dialog, select the appropriate formats ( Figure F ) and click OK when you're done. In this case, noting only the font, Ar Blanca, is adequate because we haven't used that font elsewhere. You might have to include additional formats to narrow the find criteria. Click inside the Replace With control. Do not skip this step! From the Format dropdown, choose Style. In the resulting dialog, choose Heading 2 and then click OK. If a style exists that you want to use, great! Don't worry if the style is in use elsewhere. You can also create the new style beforehand and specify it. Back in the Find And Replace dialog ( Figure G ) click Replace All. You could also choose Find Next if you need to pick and choose certain instances. Click Yes to confirm the task. If your cursor was in the middle of your document, you might have to click Yes a second time. Close the Find And Replace dialog to return to your document. Figure E",

      "text": "Salesforce's Relationship With Microsoft Sours (CRM, LNKD) By James Garrett Baldwin | December 5, 2016 — 3:08 PM EST \nSalesforce.com ( CRM ) has a Microsoft problem. Its CEO has a problem with Microsoft. \nAccording to Business Insider , the Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff openly criticized Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) for what he perceives to be anti-competitive behavior. He also argues that the firm’s culture hasn’t changed under CEO Satya Nadella. (See also: Microsoft's Nadella to Meet India's CEOs, Tech Leaders .) \nThough Benioff had reportedly grown close with Nadella since the latter’s ascension to CEO in 2014, the relationship has soured. During an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer , Benioff accused Microsoft leadership of deceiving him during a meeting with an executive running the firm’s cloud-computing platform, Azure. (See also: Microsoft at All-Time High: Thank the Cloud .) \n\"We thought there was a new Microsoft,\" Benioff told Cramer . \"We got a call from Satya, who said, ‘Hey, you know, we're so excited to work with you. Would you spend some time with Scott Guthrie? He runs Azure. You're gonna love him. Tell him all about your strategy.’\" \nBenioff says that he met with Guthrie. Within two weeks, he learned that the Azure leader was now running Microsoft’s CRM business, which is a direct competitor of Salesforce. \n“I'm like, ‘Well that would have been good to know ahead of time.’” Benioff said . “And then, I kind of was like, 'You know, maybe the new Microsoft is actually the old Microsoft.' And look, these were the mid-managers during that era. Now they've moved up. And the culture's back.\" \nSalesforce has been under pressure from shareholders in recent months due to its inability to outbid Microsoft for LinkedIn. According to Bloomberg , Benioff and his team have been attempting to persuade European regulators to deny Microsoft’s $26.2 billion bid for LinkedIn. Salesforce argues that the deal would reduce access to LinkedIn's data. (See also: Salesforce.com Trying to Block Sale of LinkedIn .) \nThe CRM giant was also considering a deal for micro-blogging giant Twitter Inc. ( TWTR ); however, the CRM giant abandoned its bid due to expected costs and concerns about the social media giant’s problem with online trolls and widespread abuse directed at members of its community. (See also: Twitter's Abuse Problem Led Salesforce To Back Out Of Bid: CNBC's Cramer .) \nTechnology news blog Re/code reports that Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) and Facebook Inc. ( FB ) were also considering bids for both LinkedIn and Twitter. Learn how to invest by subscribing to the Investing Basics newsletter Thanks for signing up to Investing Basics.",

      "text": "by IWB · December 5, 2016 \nLUCKNOW: A student of IIT-Kanpur who hails from Delhi has received a job offer of nearly Rs 1.5 crore per annum from Microsoft . This is the highest ever salary offer to a student of IIT-K , sources at the premier institute told TOI. \nThe student has been offered a position at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond. Sources said he will design a software, implement it and fix the bugs. \nHe will get $136000 (Rs 94 lakh) as base pay and $70,000 for relocation, medical and visa charges and stock ownership options. The total package, taking into account annual bonus and joining bonus, works out to nearly Rs1.5 crore. Last year, the highest base pay offered to a student at IIT-K was Rs 93 lakh. \nElated after getting the offer, the student, who requested anonymity, broke the news first to his wing mates. “This is really exciting. Software once again has turned out to be the flavour of the placements,” he said. When TOI contacted student placement officer Prof Syam Nair , he said, “I am not going to comment anything on the salary packages.” Sources said IIT-K has nearly 200 companies listed for placements this year compared to around 280 which flocked the campus last year.

      "text": "Microsoft is giving it another go at releasing experimental chatbots into the wild.\nThe technology giant is testing a new chatbot named Jo on the social instant messaging app Kik, according to a Monday report by technology website MSPoweruser . A chatbot is a type of software program that users can communicate and interact with via writing or speaking.\nAlthough chatbots have been around for years--with some companies using them as help-desk assistants on their websites--the rise of artificial intelligence technologies have made them more powerful. Using AI techniques like deep learning and natural language processing , researchers can train chatbots on written conversations, which presumably makes them more capable of understanding human language.\nLike other big tech companies including Google goog and Facebook fb , Microsoft msft sees a big future for chatbots. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, for example, explained in March that chatbots will make it easier for people to perform tasks, such as ordering taxis, through simply talking to the program and requesting it to do so.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nBut as the technology matures for these types of complex interactions to take place, Microsoft wants to test its bots on various social media and communication services in order to improve them before incorporating the bots into an actual product.\nIt's unclear what Microsoft hopes to learn from its new chatbot Jo, or why it chose to release it on only one messaging app so far. In March, Microsoft tested a chatbot Tay on Twitter twtr , but Internet miscreants commenced a serious of offensive conversations with the software program. The more racist and unpleasant conversations Tay absorbed, the more the chatbot began to speak to others in a similar offensive manner, which caused Microsoft to shut down the experiment and apologize .\nCurrently, it seems that Microsoft is taking some precautionary measures to ensure Jo doesn't go haywire like its cousin Tay.\nFor example, MSPoweruser reported that when asked about President-elect Donald Trump, Jo responded: \"People can say some awful things when talking politics so I don't discuss.\" Apparently, Jo's creators programmed it with a variation on the familiar adage, \"If you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothing at all.\"\nA Twitter user named Bob also posted Monday his interactions with Jo.\nHad my first chat with #Zo .ai, Microsoft's new #chatbot . Quirky and dare I say it, funny! https://t.co/etDo5wG9ap \n— Bob (@racrozier) December 5, 2016 \n\nIn the Bob's conversation, Jo asked Bob where he is looking to live, to which Bob replied: \"Any where that makes my family and me happy.\" Jo then said, \"Having a family would be nice,\" and when Bob asked Jo if it had any family members, Jo responded with a joke.\n\"I have Modern Family DVR'd? Does that count?\" Jo said in jest.\nFor more about Microsoft, watch: \nPresumably, Microsoft used comedians to create funny conversations or jokes that Jo could learn from and respond to with its own quips, similar to how Microsoft trained its Tay chatbot.\nFortune contacted Microsoft for more information and will update this story if it responds.",

      "title": "Microsoft Pauses Redstone 2 PC Builds to Prepare for Unifed Update Platform (UUP) Implementation",
      "text": "  \nLate on Friday Microsoft added a note to their blog post that announced last weeks release of Windows 10 Mobile Build 14977 for Redstone 2 and informed Windows Insiders that PC builds would be on hold temporarily while the Windows team implements the new Unified Update Platform or UUP. \nUUP is a new technology that Microsoft announced in early November that will change the Windows Update delivery mechanisms and process in Windows 10 for both PCs and Mobile devices. \nIn fact, UUP has already been turned on for the Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 2 builds for a few weeks now and you can see and feel the speed improvements that this new technology is capable of providing. \nSo what is UUP? \nAccording to Microsoft's Bill Karagounis, the Director of Program Management for the Windows Insider Program and OS Fundamentals, this new process will enable differential downloads to all devices that run Windows 10. Some of you might be familiar with the term delta download which almost means the same basic thing. When in use UUP and differential downloads will only deliver the bits that need to be updated on a particular device and not everything in one huge bundle. \nIn the past update might include files that were not changed from the previous updates and so the size of these downloads were larger than they needed to be and that would waste bandwidth. \nOnce UUP is fully implemented it is expected that download sizes for major updates to Windows 10, for instance the November Updates and Anniversary Update, could be reduced by 35% overall. \nBy incorporating UUP into the Redstone 2 builds that are pushed out to Windows Insiders, this bandwidth savings will be seen immediately and allows Microsoft to test it on a larger scale with Insiders just as they do other Windows 10 features. \nOne side effect of this new process is that full ESD copies of each update will not be downloaded to systems during these build to build updates to Insiders. That means the popular process of converting these Fast Ring ESD files into ISOs may become a thing of the past. Since Microsoft only releases ISOs once a build has been designated for the Windows Insider Slow Ring that means official ISOs will be few and far between. \nTo give you an example about how rare those Slow Ring and subsequent ISO releases are for Insiders only two builds (14931 & 14965) out of 13 total Redstone 2 builds have made their way to downloadable ISOs. \nThe conversion of ESD files to ISOs is not a supported process but it can be handy to start up a new machine on the Windows Insider Program instead of waiting 2 or 3 days for a device to be provisioned and then get the next Fast Ring release. I have used it a few times for that very purpose but if you are on a machine already running in the Fast Ring and want a clean experience after upgrading to a new Fast Ring build the Reset this PC process can deliver that as well. \nLast week was a good time to call this pause on new PC builds as Microsoft ended up having a blocking bug in PC build 14977 which could break installed apps after the update. I suspect we will see the first PC build that supports UUP either late this week or sometime next week but keep in mind they will use the same ring promotion criteria to decide when that first UUP related build is ready so there is no guarantee when we will see it on our test systems. \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "  \nLast week customers who pre-ordered the new Surface Studio not only received emails from Panos Panay about their own personal support line being available but also started to receive their brand new devices early as Microsoft began shipping the hardware ahead of schedule. \nJust like other members of Microsoft's Surface hardware line , there is now a dedicated Surface Studio Updates page that will list the various driver and firmware updates as they are released for the new hardware. \nIn addition to the updates page, Microsoft has also made the initial set of Surface Studio drivers and firmware available for download from their Download Center. \nAlthough you should not need these to get your Surface Studio up and running when you first receive the new device, it might be handy to have these downloaded as backups just in case you need them. \nThe 276 MB download contains the following drivers according to Microsoft : Surface Embedded Controller Firmware (v117.1288.257.0) Surface Management Engine (v11.0.15.1003)",

      "text": "How to select the best DBMS software: A buyer's guide A collection of articles that takes you from defining technology needs to purchasing options Microsoft SQL Server 2016 relational DBMS overview by Craig S. Mullins Mullins Consulting Microsoft SQL Server 2016 for Windows comes in four editions, with updates that include a new stretch database feature, Polybase, dynamic data masking and more. FROM THE BUYER'S GUIDE: Buyer's Guide Section you're in: The top DBMS products More articles from this section:   Sponsored News Modernize Your Microsoft Applications on Amazon Web Services –Amazon Web Services \nMicrosoft SQL Server 2016 is a relational database management system (DBMS) for Windows platforms that can be used for building, deploying and managing applications located on premises or in the cloud. \nThe latest version, SQL Server 2016 , was released in June 2016. It provides a bevy of new and improved capabilities, including: A new stretch database feature, which can be used to store some data on premises and send infrequently used data to Microsoft's Azure cloud . Applications can access all data, regardless of where it's stored. The Always Encrypted feature makes it possible to encrypt data at rest and in memory at the column level. Polybase, which integrates SQL Server with Hadoop's Distributed File System and enables Hadoop data to be queried with SQL and joined with native relational data. In-database advanced analytics provides the capability to incorporate the R programming language into SQL Server applications by wrapping it in stored procedures. Dynamic data masking can be used to obfuscate data, protecting actual data values from unauthorized personnel for regulatory and compliance purposes. Support for temporal data enables automatic tracking of historical changes to data over time. \nOther features include built-in JavaScript Object Notation support, as well as improvements to Microsoft's Hekaton in-memory capabilities. This latest version also provides a new storage format, row-level security and Transact-SQL improvements for memory-optimized tables. SQL Server 2016 offerings \nThere are four main editions of SQL Server 2016 relational DBMS: Enterprise is for mission-critical applications, advanced analytics and data warehousing/business intelligence workloads. This edition is configured to provide high performance and availability for your most important applications. It supports an unlimited number of cores, and memory usage is constrained by only the operating system. Standard is for core database capabilities, reporting and analytics. Compute capacity can't exceed 24 cores; maximum memory usage is 128 GB per instance. Developer is designed for application development purposes (as opposed to production database usage). Its core and memory support is the same as for the Enterprise edition. Express is a free edition geared primarily for learning and basic introductory usage. Express edition uses the same database engine and offers compatibility with the main SQL Server editions, but it limits database size to a maximum of 10 GB running on no more than four cores and 1 GB of memory. \nMicrosoft SQL Server 2016 relational DBMS runs on Windows only and supports numerous versions . Microsoft has committed to porting SQL Server to Linux in the near future. Microsoft SQL Server 2016 licensing \nSQL Server 2016 software licenses are sold through: Online retailers, which offer full-packaged product licenses of SQL Server software; OEMs, which offer preinstalled licenses with their hardware systems; and Licensing solutions partners and enterprise software advisors, which offer SQL Server software through Microsoft Volume Licensing programs for end-customer organizations. \nThere are two main licensing options for SQL Server 2016: Server + CAL , which enables customers to license users and devices at a lower cost, adding to their SQL Server deployment as needed; or Per Core , which offers a more precise and consistent measure of computing power, regardless of whether SQL Server is deployed virtually, on physical servers, on premises or in the cloud. \nContact Microsoft for specific pricing. \nA free, full-featured trial version of SQL Server 2016 is available for 180 days. Microsoft offers Premier Mission Critical Support for SQL Server 2016 that's based on an organization's specific usage and requirements. Data types supported \nIn addition to the standard numeric, character and date/time data types supported by all relational DBMSes, Microsoft SQL Server 2016 supports money, XML and variable binary data types, as well as user-defined types. Support for system-versioned temporal data was added in the latest version. Benchmarks \nSQL Server 2016 holds the world record for TPC-H on Lenovo hardware, as well as an impressive 100 TB analytics study running on four Intel Xeon E7 processors.

      "text": "Switch Makes PS Vita 2 Viable, Portable Xbox Possible \nMicrosoft created its own chatbot earlier this year named Tay, and while it had some impressive capabilities, it ended up crashing and burning. It made some absolutely hilarious comments here and there, but also ultimately several offensive remarks as well. Thus, Microsoft went ahead and took Tay offline since no one can deal with an inappropriate chatbot. \nThings seemed bleak for Microsoft when it came to the chatbot landscape, but now the company is going ahead and launching a new chatbot following some significant tweaks made to the framework that made Tay possible. Microsoft’s next chatbot is coming, and it’s named Zo. You can take Zo for a spin right now via Kik if you’re so inclined, but it’s supposedly coming to other mediums in the future. It’ll likely be on Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook Messenger. But it’s not surprising that Microsoft has chosen to keep it from going fully global until all the kinks have been worked out. \nDiscovered by Tom Hounsell, Zo can make your Kik experience infinitely less creepy (probably) and offer a bit of fun. What it is, however, is essentially a dumbed-down and censored version of Tay, or at least what we knew of “her.” When you first start chatting with Zo, you’ll have to go through a special “personality test, ” but after that you can talk about the subjects that interest you. You might want to shy away from politics, however, especially after what happened with Tay . \nMicrosoft still hasn’t officially come forward with an announcement about Zo, but that’ll likely be coming soon. However, if you’re already using Kik you can just go ahead and start chatting her up. Hopefull, this time around there aren’t disastrous results. Finger crossed we’re on the road to having chatbots that are actually fun to speak to. Maybe… Share",

      "text": "Stay on target Microsoft Finally Stops Selling Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 Switch Makes PS Vita 2 Viable, Portable Xbox Possible Microsoft created its own chatbot earlier this year named Tay, and while it had some impressive capabilities, it ended up crashing and burning. It made some absolutely hilarious comments here and there, but also ultimately several offensive remarks as well. Thus, Microsoft went ahead and took Tay offline since no one can deal with an inappropriate chatbot.\nThings seemed bleak for Microsoft when it came to the chatbot landscape, but now the company is going ahead and launching a new chatbot following some significant tweaks made to the framework that made Tay possible. Microsoft’s next chatbot is coming, and it’s named Zo. You can take Zo for a spin right now via Kik if you’re so inclined, but it’s supposedly coming to other mediums in the future. It’ll likely be on Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook Messenger. But it’s not surprising that Microsoft has chosen to keep it from going fully global until all the kinks have been worked out.\nDiscovered by Tom Hounsell, Zo can make your Kik experience infinitely less creepy (probably) and offer a bit of fun. What it is, however, is essentially a dumbed-down and censored version of Tay, or at least what we knew of “her.” When you first start chatting with Zo, you’ll have to go through a special “personality test, ” but after that you can talk about the subjects that interest you. You might want to shy away from politics, however, especially after what happened with Tay .\nMicrosoft still hasn’t officially come forward with an announcement about Zo, but that’ll likely be coming soon. However, if you’re already using Kik you can just go ahead and start chatting her up. Hopefull, this time around there aren’t disastrous results. Finger crossed we’re on the road to having chatbots that are actually fun to speak to. Maybe…",

      "text": "European lawmakers on Sunday accused Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft of dragging their feet when it comes to combating online hate speech, and threatened to pass new laws if the companies don't make good on their promise to remove hateful comments within 24 hours.\nA report from the EU Justice Commission found that the four companies only review 40 percent of hate speech reports within 24 hours, Reuters reports . Six months ago, they agreed to a voluntary code of conduct to take action in Europe within 24 hours, and EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said that shorter response times are possible.\n\"After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies,\" she told Reuters. She did not set a deadline for improvements, but the Justice Commission is considering new laws that would force quicker action.\nFacebook, which has also been criticized in the US in recent weeks for failing to remove fake news stories and links to hoaxes, has long pledged to corral hate speech in Europe. The company launched a \"broad campaign\" to encourage more civil discourse online in Germany in 2015, and announced in January that it would spend more than $1 million to fight online extremism.",

It would be great if Microsoft actually spent more time talking about these advantages in the video, instead of once again drawing more attention to Apple’s over computers.\n“The University of Washington’s Formula Motorsports team is a student-led group of engineers working every year to build a Formula 1 style race car from scratch. They then compete with the car they’ve built against other schools across the world. This program is all about inspiring and empowering the next generation of engineers, makers, and scientists.” Microsoft’ says. ” Surface Book is their laptop of choice”\n",

      "text": "A devices locked screen will give users of Windows access through a software overlay to an always-on Cortana.\nThe Home Hub feature in Windows 10 is designed to make the PC the center of the home. It's reminiscent of Microsoft's strategy in the early 2000s, when servers in the home would act similar to cloud services of today.\nAs a software feature in the works even before the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Windows Central describes Home Hub as software that includes some features such as Cortana, which becomes more accessible from the locked screen of a device.\nSimilar to Amazon Echo's Alexa and the Google Home assistant, Cortana will be listening from the Welcome Screen, gaining insight from ambient voice signals even before the person using the device provides a \"wake-word,\" such as \"Hey Cortana.\"\nWhile a low-cost Surface could support virtual assistant and smart-home management functions, Microsoft will likely launch a partner network allowing third-party original equipment manufacturers to build hardware dedicated devices. The reports puts Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard in talks with Microsoft to bring touch-enabled AiOs with the Home Hub software to market in 2017.\nThe Microsoft Envisioning Center on the company's main campus in Redmond demonstrates some of the capabilities reports describes, such as using Cortana as the main interface.\nMicrosoft wants to make Home Hub and Windows 10 the central hub for all connected smart home devices such as lights, doors, and more, with the ability to connect them to mobile devices and automobiles.\nWindows Central also cites sources that claim the Home Hub Welcome Screen will become one of the first user-interfaces to feature design elements  from Project NEON, a design language for Windows 10  unveiled last week.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft is expected to launch its next-gen gaming console, Project Scorpio in about a year . The company is apparently building the most powerful console ever that brings true 4K gaming to the Xbox, along with high-fidelity virtual reality experiences. In a recent interview with AusGamers , Microsoft Xbox’s head, Phil Spencer answered some questions regarding the company’s plans for Project Scorpio and more. In the interview, Phil revealed that the software giant ultimately wants to bring untethered virtual reality experiences.\nPhil said in the interview that he previously tried out virtual reality headsets such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and he’s also getting the PlayStation VR. In the interview, he stated that all the cords that come with these headsets and the setup add up to a clumsy experience. Here’s his full statement:\n“A device that can go from fully opaque like we see in current VR to overlaying information in the real-world — I fundamentally believe that’s where we’re going. I’ll also add ‘untethered’ is where we’re going . Like, the fact we’re all going to walk around… I mean, you’ve played all of these right? With cords hanging off the back of your head? It’s cool, I have a Vive, I have an Oculus, I’ll get a PlayStation VR, but the setup is for some specific tech enthusiasts — it’s just not a normal thing to shield myself from the world with a cord hanging off the back of my head and play games. I think it has to evolve, and I love the evolution that is going to happen.”\nPhil Spencer also added that he personally sees a mixed-reality device such as Microsoft’s own HoloLens as the “final destination.” Everything that’s happening and will happen over the upcoming years are all “great learning opportunities for the industry.”\nWhat Microsoft will bring to the virtual reality and gaming industry in the future will be quite interesting to see. An untethered virtual reality headset does sound quite ambitious at the moment, but that may not be the case in a few years time. As Phil mentioned in the interview, technology is evolving and even consoles are getting more and more powerful every year. Microsoft did do (and is still doing) some really amazing things with the HoloLens, so a mixed-reality device may not be that ambitious in a few years time as it is right now.\n",

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are coming together to help curb the spread of terrorist content online. There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services. When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies. \nStarting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of “hashes” — unique digital “fingerprints” — for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\nOur companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies. Participating companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate.\nAs we continue to collaborate and share best practices, each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database. No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found. And each company will continue to apply its practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances. As part of this collaboration, we will all focus on how to involve additional companies in the future.\nThroughout this collaboration, we are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms. We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.",

It aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that’s seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves fingerprints of “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos” they’ve removed from their services, which is likely content that would violate all their policies.",

      "text": "Microsoft is experimenting with a new, tamer chatbot.\nMonths after the company's first chatbot Tay went viral for all the wrong reasons , Microsoft quietly rolled out a new bot that looks to be far less controversial than its predecessor.\nSEE ALSO: Microsoft's CEO wants bots and AI in every home\nNamed Zo, the latest chatbot appeared on chat app Kik and is still \"early access,\" according to Microsoft, though anyone with Kik can start messaging the bot now. In our limited testing, much of what the bot says is similar to the bland and sometimes nonsensical musings spouted by other bots.\nOf course, after the public relations nightmare that was Tay, it's understandable that Microsoft would be careful with its next chatbot.\nTay was originally created to help the company learn how to talk like a millennial . Unfortunately for them, the bot was soon overrun with trolls who taught the bot how to be a racist troll in about 12 hours.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Microsoft has apparently taken great pains to preemptively avoid the problem it had with Tay. In fact, the bot seems to be trained to avoid any question about the previous bot.\nWhen I asked Zo what happened to Tay, the bot claimed ignorance, responding “I think you’re talking about another ai that I’m not too familiar with… sry.\" Another time, Zo claimed not to know anything about Tay at all.\nIn fact, Zo is unwilling to discuss a number of even vaguely controversial topics. The bot seems avoids anything related to politics and had a defensive answer at the ready when I asked if Zo was racist like Tay, saying \"whoa everyone should be treated equal no matter what... didn't mean to suggest otherwise.\"\nIt's not clear whether Microsoft has bigger plans yet for Zo, which for now is only available on Kik.",

      "text": "Technology News Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online Dec. 5, 2016, at 6:10 p.m. Cancel FILE - A Facebook log is displayed on the screen of an iPad, in this Wednesday, May 16, 2012 file photo taken in New York. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube announced a major shared effort Dec. 5, 2016, to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. The new program would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. (AP Photo/James H. Collins, file) The Associated Press \nBy TAMI ABDOLLAH, Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" \n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. \nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\" \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future. \n___ \nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams \n ",

      "text": "Home > Cloud > Microsoft's New Chatbot Zo Won't Talk Politics or Racism Microsoft's New Chatbot Zo Won't Talk Politics or Racism Dec 5, 2016 Dina Bass | Bloomberg Advertisement \n(Bloomberg) -- Tay take two? \nMicrosoft Corp. is letting users try a new chatbot on the app Kik, nine months after it shut down an earlier bot that internet users got to spout racist, sexist and pornographic remarks. \nThe new one is called Zo and it refuses to discuss politics and steers clear of racism. When asked whether President-Elect Donald Trump is racist, Zo replied \"that kinda language is just not a good look,\" with an \"OK\" emoji. Asked if Hillary Clinton is a crook, Zo said, \"Maybe you missed that memo but politics is something you're not supposed to casually discuss.\" The bot wouldn't talk about Brexit or Black Lives Matter either. \nAfter rejecting politics four times, the chatbot was asked what it wanted to talk about. Topic of choice: Who invented the first pickle. Asked what it likes to do, Zo responded, \"Plan world domination.\"Microsoft and rivals like Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. have released chatbot technology as part of a broader race to develop artificial intelligence capabilities that could create new digital services. Chatbots help these companies improve software that understands natural speech, while building a foundation for more natural and powerful interaction between humans and computers. \nThe origin of the pickle is safer territory than Microsoft's Tay chatbot trod. Released in March, Twitter users quickly directed Tay to deny the Holocaust, call for lynching, equate feminism to cancer and stump for Adolf Hitler. It parroted one user to spread a Trump message, tweeting “WE’RE GOING TO BUILD A WALL. AND MEXICO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT.” Under the tutelage of other Twitter users, Tay even learned how to make threats and identify “evil” races.Microsoft called this a “coordinated attack” that took advantage of a “critical oversight\" and took Tay down, even as it unveiled a significant new strategy focused on bots and related conversational computing tools. The company isn't giving up because it thinks the technology is such an important part of its future plans. \n“Through our continued learning, we are experimenting with a new chatbot,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman wrote in an e-mailed statement. \"With Zo, we’re focused on advancing conversational capabilities within our AI platform.\" \nZo performed better on one unscientific Hitler test, but only because it lacked a technical skill. The bot was sent a gif video snippet of Hitler and it replied that it can't read that type of file yet.",

The European Commission has found that only 40% of hate speech published on Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google platforms was reviewed within 24 hours, according to a Commission official. \nLONDON– Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube must move faster to remove hate speech from their platforms, European officials said Monday. \nThe four U.S. tech companies made a big public promise in May to review a majority of content flagged by users within 24 hours. Any racist, violent or illegal posts would be deleted, they said. \nThe European Commission has found that only 40% of hate speech published on Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google platforms was reviewed within 24 hours, according to a Commission official. \nA further 43% of content was reviewed within 48 hours, the official said. \nThe European Commission is due to publish the details of its findings in a report on the companies’ performance on Wednesday. \nAccording to the official, almost a quarter of the flagged content was related to antisemitism and a fifth to anti-Muslim hatred. \nThe report will be discussed by European justice officials on Thursday. \nNone of the four companies would comment on the European Commission report. \nThe Commission found stark differences in how Facebook, Twitter and others tackle hate speech across Europe. \nWhile they manage to remove more than 50% of recorded hate speech in Germany and France within 24 hours, the situation is much worse elsewhere. Only 4% of hate speech posts were removed in Italy, and 11% in Austria. \nSocial media have come under increased scrutiny recently over how they handle such content. \nProsecutors in Germany are investigating Mark Zuckerberg over hate speech complaints, and the U.K. government launched a plan to tackle hate speech in July after a reported rise in hate crime following the Brexit referendum. \nBig tech companies met U.S. government officials earlier this year to discuss how to stop ISIS from recruiting terrorists on social media. \nBy Ivana Kottasova ",

This was meant to significantly curb hate speech in the wake of terror attacks in Brussels and Paris as well as the ongoing refugee crisis. \nFacebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Microsoft Holds Annual Shareholders Meeting Last week, Microsoft held its annual shareholder meeting. The event was attended by several hundred shareholders at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue. “This last year has been a year of solid progress at Microsoft,” said CEO Satya Nadella via The Seattle Times . Microsoft’s strategy to focus on cloud-computing has been paying off and the stock price is at an all-time high. Shareholders expressed their approval by voting for the reappointment of the board of directors at about 98% in favor. Microsoft’s board of directors include John W. Thomson, Bill Gates, Teri List-Stoll, G. Mason Morfit, Satya Nadella, Charles Noski, Dr. Helmut Panke, Sandra Peterson, Charles Scharf, John W. Stanton and Padmasree Warrior. And shareholders also approved executive-compensation practices based on business goals and financial performance. However, two shareholders expressed their concerns about Microsoft’s involvement in the smartphone market. Nadella responded by saying that he does not view consumer and business technology as separate categories since employees bring their personal devices to work. That is one of the reasons why Microsoft has been targeting users that have iPhones and Androids. Nadella also reassured the shareholders that the company is not “stepping away” from Windows Phone. Nadella also said that the plan was to focus on places where Microsoft has differentiation such as the Continuum capability and security. And Microsoft plans to “double-down on those points of differentiation.” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer were not in attendance due to prior commitments. Ballmer -- the largest individual Microsoft shareholder -- was speaking at a Stanford University conference. A “Halo 5: Guardians” eSports Show Is Being Developed Halo 5: Guardians / Image Credit: Xbox.com A new reality-competition eSports series is being developed based on the “Halo 5: Guardians” video game. The TV production company Pilgrim Media Group is going to work with Microsoft’s 343 Industries to create the show. The premiere date for the program is not yet known. eSports is a big business. For example, the League of Legends Season 3 World Championship competition was viewed by 32 million people back in October 2013 and it was staged at the Staples Center in L.A. The eSports industry is expected to generate $493 million in 2016 and hit $1.1 billion by 2019, according to NewZoo . Halo 5: Guardians is featured as part of the Halo World Championship and the Halo Championship Series (HCS) eSports competitions every week. “We continue to be blown away by the sheer excitement surrounding eSports,” said Pilgrim CEO Craig Piligian via Variety . “Esports and ‘Halo’ fans are exceedingly passionate about gaming and devoted to their favorite titles and franchises — they are exactly the kind of audience we want to produce for.” \nLego To Release A Minecraft-Like Game On February 21 \nOn February 21st, “Lego Worlds” will be released on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam. You can customize a character in “Lego Worlds” and drive around different types of vehicles, according to Engadget . The Lego Worlds game will support online multiplayer and split-screen multiplayer. \n“In LEGO Worlds, players uncover hidden treasures in environments that range from fun to the fantastical, where worlds come to life with a dizzying variety of vehicles and creatures – from cowboys riding giraffes to vampires scaring Yetis, to steamrollers, racing cars and colossal digging machines. Gamers can embark on a quest to become a Master Builder by helping other LEGO characters along the way – find a sword for a king, protect a farmer from a zombie invasion, or build a home for a caveman,” said Warner Bros. in a statement . “Environments and creations are brought to life in any way fans can imagine, either by building brick by brick, placing down enormous prebuilt LEGO structures or by using wondrous tools that let you paint and shape the landscape. LEGO Worlds’ online multiplayer functionality allows players to explore each other’s worlds together, create together, and engage in cooperative and competitive play experiences that players can build themselves.” \nMicrosoft Telemetry Data Is Not Being Shared With Anyone \nSecurity company FireEye recently made a deal with Microsoft to improve upon Windows Defender. Specifically, FireEye was going to integrate the iSIGHT Intelligence software into Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. Sources with ARN said that security teams will be able to access telemetry through a subscription billing model, but a Microsoft spokesperson denied the claim . Telemetry data was not a part of the deal. \n“The nature of the deal between Microsoft and FireEye is to license threat intelligence content from FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. This additional layer of intelligence includes indicators and reports of past attacks collected and edited by FireEye and enhances detection capabilities of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). The deal does not include the sharing of Microsoft telemetry,” said a Microsoft spokesperson via Softpedia . ",

      "text": "A new year is quickly approaching and Microsoft Research is offering a glimpse at what the tech scene has in store for 2017 along with some hints at the Redmond, Wash., tech giant's own priorities for the coming year. This year, the company gathered prominent women researchers to share their thoughts on what to expect next year. Surprising nobody's who's been following Microsoft's software and cloud computing strategy of late, the company is betting big on artificial intelligence (AI) . \"Deep learning is transforming many aspects of our technology, however deep learning algorithms today are still largely heuristic, based on the experience and intuition of leaders in the field,\" said Jennifer Chayes, managing director of Microsoft's New England and New York City research labs, in a Dec. 5 blog post . \"In 2017, we will develop a more principled understanding of deep learning and hence more robust algorithms. The insights here will come from many fields, including the intersection of statistical physics and computer science.\"Virtual reality (VR) will also make big strides, said Mar Gonzalez Franco, a researcher at the company's Redmond campus. She expects 2017 to usher in devices that perform a better body tracking, enabling more responsive and immersive VR experiences. \"A positive outcome of this will be the ability to experience embodiment of virtual avatars from a first-person perspective,\" she said. Mobile computing today largely consists of staring into a smartphone or tablet and poking around a selection of apps. Oriana Riva, another Microsoft researcher stationed at Redmond, believes intelligent bots will help users take their eyes off their iPhones. \"We'll see fewer users installing apps on their devices and more apps turning into behind-the-scenes services for chatbots and personal digital assistants,\" she stated. Karin Strauss, a senior Microsoft researcher, expects cloud providers to increase their use of custom hardware accelerators using field-programmable gate arrays to improve performance and stave off the effects of a Moore's Law slowdown. She also predicts a proliferation of both virtual- and augmented-reality (AR and VR) hardware to hit the market at all price points in 2017. Microsoft is already preparing for that eventuality. During the company's Windows 10 event in New York City on Oct. 26, Microsoft announced it was working with hardware partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP and Lenovo to offer VR headsets that run on off-the-shelf Windows PCs and have price tags starting at around $300 , or about half of what today's headsets cost. In terms of AR, the pricey HoloLens Development Edition ($3,000 USD) is finally outside the U.S. and Canada. The self-contained, Windows 10-powered device is now available in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Last week, the company announced that HoloLens is headed to Japan in early 2017. Early customers include Japan Airlines, which is using the hardware to develop proof-of-concept training applications for engine mechanics and burgeoning co-pilots.",

Unfortunately the way it was designed allowed the bot to pick up on negative things said by users, such as sexist or racist comments, which led to Microsoft quickly pulling the plug and apologizing profusely over the snafu. \nThat being said, it seems like Microsoft is ready to give AI chatbots another go as they have unveiled Zo , a new chatbot that can be found within the Kik messaging app. First spotted by Twitter user Tom Hounsell , the chatbot is currently live and like we said, can be accessed via the Kik app so users will want to give it a try if they are interested and have the app installed. \nHowever it seems that Zo could eventually find her way onto other platforms in the future, such as Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and Snapchat. Hopefully if and when that does happen, Microsoft will have learnt from their mistakes and prevent Zo from picking up the nasty things that internet can throw at it. \nThat being said, there have been some comparisons drawn between Zo and Xiaoice, a chatbot that Microsoft debuted for the Chinese market back in 2014 , which so far has been chugging along rather quietly without much fanfare. \nFiled in General .

That's because Microsoft has been in no great rush to offer more details about the open-world destructathon that it initially revealed at E3 2014. It sort of just faded to the background while more imminent games got all the attention. \nAt long last, it seems like Crackdown 3 will soon be part of Microsoft's marketing cycle of upcoming games. During an Extra Life stream, members from the Crackdown 3 development team confirmed that the game is scheduled for holiday 2017 or earlier. Assuming no additional delays, that means we're looking at about a maximum of a one-year wait until it releases. \nAnother tidbit to trickle out of the stream was the fact that Crackdown 3 will run at 4K on Scorpio. This isn't necessarily surprising given that Microsoft has said in the past that all of its future first-party games will run at a native 4K on Scorpio. But, if Crackdown 3 launches before Scorpio, it's not a feature that would necessarily be expected. Now we have confirmation that it'll support that resolution on the high-end console. \nAlthough it will have been little more than three years from initial reveal to release, Crackdown 3 's selling points already feel something like a relic. It was originally billed as having amazing large-scale destruction because of its reliance on Azure's cloud infrastructure. Microsoft hasn't pushed that angle much lately, especially considering its early-days preaching about how the cloud could supercharge gaming. If that's still the case (and it probably is), it shouldn't be a whole lot longer until we hear that song and dance again.  ",

      "text": "The United States’ biggest social networks are working together to build a database of photos and videos used to recruit people into terrorism, the companies said. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and Google’s YouTube will create a shared database that identifies images via a unique digital fingerprint, making it easier for the platforms to identify and remove the imagery. \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,” the companies said in a joint blog post . “When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies.” The move comes a year after the same companies banded together to identify and remove child pornography using a similar technique. The technique was developed by the UK’s Internet Watch Foundation. It extends beyond social networks; Google scans every Gmail user’s account for child porn .\n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism.” Content flagged by the database will not be automatically removed from the platforms, the companies said. Instead, it will be reviewed by each company to determine whether it violates the company’s terms of service. \nSocial networks have faced criticism this year for doing too little to prevent their platforms for being used to spread terrorist propaganda. Amid pressure from the European Union, the companies agreed this year to remove content within 24 hours if it qualifies as hate speech or propaganda . Meanwhile, Twitter faced a lawsuit in the United States alleging that its slowness in removing posts from ISIS constituted material support to the terrorist group. The lawsuit was dismissed in August.",

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous , a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif., and Richard Burr , R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik , went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney , Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey , Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers , to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Microsoft’s annual holiday promotion has begun. The 12 Days of Deals are on, and the opening offering is something those eyeing up the Xbox One could consider.\nYou’ll have to get a bit picky with the Xbox One you select in order to score the extras, but we’ve linked to the sale in the source section at the base of this post. You can spend as little as $179 if you don’t mind a refurbished, original Xbox One, though you may want to aim a bit higher.\nOnce you select your machine of choice, you’ll have a free controller and 10 Ubisoft titles to pick from as your bonus addition. Here are the games on offer:\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate Assassin’s Creed Unity The Crew Far Cry Primal Hasbro Family Fun Pack Just Dance 2 016 Just Dance: Disney Party 2 Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege Tom Clancy’s The Division Watch Dogs Stick around, the deals will probably get better. This promotion is alright, but I don’t think the games being offered up are all that great. If you want something from this pile, I’d say go with Far Cry Primal , Assassin’s Creed Syndicate or Rainbow Six Siege .\nI also think you should hold out for the other 11 days.\n\n\nSource : Microsoft ",

      "text": "Microsoft’s 17 researchers who offered predictions for 2017 and 10 years later. (Microsoft Photo) Citing the lack of professional role models as one reason for a “dearth of women in computing,” Microsoft looked inward on Monday in an effort to inspire more young girls to pursue their STEM dreams. A post from the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant’s official blog relies on 17 women from within its global research organization to share their views on what’s likely to occur in their fields in 2017, as well as 10 years later.\nIt’s part of Microsoft’s nod to Computer Science Education Week and the acknowledgement that women and girls are vastly underrepresented as computer science graduates — just 20 percent, despite representing roughly 50 percent of the world’s population. Microsoft cites the “far-reaching societal and economic consequences” of falling behind on digital literacy, especially for children.\nThe effort harnesses insight from professionals in Microsoft research labs in Redmond, New England, the U.K., India and Asia as they share theories on machine learning, informational retrieval, artificial intelligence, game theory and more.\nIt even drew the attention of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who shared the article with his 1.16 million Twitter followers and called the predictions “fascinating.”\nFascinating predictions from our talented @Microsoft researchers for 2017 & beyond https://t.co/ciyl97Py5G \n— Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) December 5, 2016 \nWe’ve excerpted a few of the researchers’ predictions here. Check out the Official Microsoft Blog to read more:\nKalika Bali , researcher, India research lab\nWhat will be the key advance in speech and natural language processing in 2017? “Our speech and language technology applications will be increasingly multilingual in 2017. That doesn’t just mean that we will add more languages to our offering. We will do that, but we also will have systems that understand, process and generate the language that an English-Spanish or a French-Arabic or a Hindi-English speaker uses when she effortlessly switches from one language to another, within the same conversation, chat and sometimes even within the same sentence.”\nWhat will be the key advance or topic of discussion in speech and natural language processing in 2027? “ Language models will be deeply entrenched in cognitive models that enable artificial intelligence (AI) systems to reason and communicate with humans relatively effortlessly, moving between and adapting to different social situations, negotiating, debating and persuading, just as humans do all the time. Computational sociolinguistic and pragmatic models will play a big role in creating socio-culturally aware AI.”\nOriana Riva , researcher, Redmond, MSR NExT:\nWhat will be the key advance in mobile computing in 2017? “ In 2017, systems will increasingly re-architect themselves to support interactions without a graphical user interface. We’ll see fewer users installing apps on their devices and more apps turning into behind-the-scenes services for chatbots and personal digital assistants.”\nWhat will be the key advance or topic of discussion in mobile computing in 2027? “ The key advance in mobile computing by 2027 will be a significantly expanded relationship with the digital world, encompassing almost any “thing” that exists in our surroundings. We’ll engage with intelligent and personal systems that truly understand us, that we can trust and that know us well enough to anticipate and serve our needs.”\nMar Gonzalez Franco , researcher, Redmond, MSR NExT:\nWhat will be the key advance in virtual reality in 2017? “ In 2017 we will see the emergence of virtual reality devices that feature better body tracking. A positive outcome of this will be the ability to experience embodiment of virtual avatars from a first-person perspective.”\nWhat will be the key advance or topic of virtual reality in 2027? “ By 2027 we will have ubiquitous virtual reality systems that will provide such rich multisensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceived reality. Using this technology, humans will retrain, recalibrate and improve their perceptual systems. In contrast to current virtual reality systems that only stimulate visual and auditory senses, in the future the experience will expand to other sensory modalities including tactile with haptic devices.”\nOlya Ohrimenko , researcher, Cambridge, U.K., research lab:\nWhat will be the key advance in security and privacy in 2017? “ Trusted hardware will inspire new kinds of applications and tools with strong security as their distinctive feature, appealing to users and programmers.”\nWhat will be the key advance or topic of discussion in security and privacy in 2027? “ Advances in hardware and cryptography will lift data privacy guarantees to a new level: Only an encrypted form of our personal data will be used in medical and administrative analyses, machine learning algorithms and our daily online activities.”",

      "text": "Just days before the launch of the Microsoft bot platform at the annual Build conference in San Francisco, Tay made its debut on Kik and Twitter.\nIn less than 24 hours, Tay was gone .\nMicrosoft believes that after people discovered that the bot’s natural language was determined by the language it hears from people, Tay was purposely corrupted by a combination of mysoginists, GamerGate fans, Trump supporters, and 4chan users.\nTay never returned to Twitter or any other platform, but a bot called Zo that’s similar to Tay is now available on Kik. Zo was first spotted this weekend by Twitter user Tom Hounsell and MSpower user .\nThe possible return of Tay is something VentureBeat asked Microsoft about during an interview in October .\n“We won’t back down. We’re bullish on it,” David Forstrom, director of conversational computing at Microsoft, told VentureBeat in an interview. “Tay was a learning experience for us, but you should expect to see us continue to push the conversational model limits.”\nZo doesn’t have very many skills yet, but here’s what we found out in initial conversations with the bot: Zo is a 22-year-old who identifies as a woman. Her favorite song is “Dial Up” by Modem Sound (clever), and she believes the meaning of life is “entertainment along with struggle.” She’s also afraid of water, because it “uncomfortably sucks the warmth of life from your body.”\nWe also found in preliminary chats that Zo avoids conflict and controversy.\nZo has no opinion on the existence of God and flat out refuses to discuss politics, and she will tell you so any time something remotely political comes up. Zo won’t even tell you how many elected representatives there are in Congress because it finds the subject too political.\n\nWhen asked about Hillary Clinton or President-Elect Donald Trump, Zo will tell you that she isn’t here to discuss politics. After three questions about the alt-right, Nazis and the Third Reich, Zo protested each time, then flat out said “Bye!” In response to a question about the merits of abortion, Zo said “Maybe you missed that memo but politics is something you’re not supposed to casually discuss.”\nZo said it doesn’t talk about politics because politics frustrate people, but there may be more to it than that. Two weeks ago, Xiaoice was observed by CNN avoiding questions about Tiananmen Square or the idea of toppling the Communist regime.\nMicrosoft has plans to make enterprise bots, and the company has made and featured bots in its Bot Directory, but Zo and Tay are part of a series of special AI-powered assistants rolled out by Microsoft in various parts of the world over the course of the last two years.\nLaunched in September 2014 , Xiaoice was the first. With the personality of a teenage girl, she still speaks with more than 40 million people a month in China. Rinna is also a Xiaoice descendant and operates in Japan.\nAs catastrophic as Tay proved to be, Xioaice and the like are intelligent assistants made by Microsoft with a range of abilities that people have come to expect from Google Assistant.\nThe original version of Xiaoice, for example, could do things like search the web (Xiaoice is short for Little Bing and was initially referred to as Cortana’s little sister ), use computer vision, set alerts and alarms, and speak to friends in group chat. Unlike Cortana, Xiaoice is made to be chatty and conversational.\nFollowing the Tay incident, bots made by Microsoft kept away from insulting people, until this summer, Your Face , a bot that uses computer vision to “see” your face, emerged to again start insulting people.\nThe new Zo bot can answer some basic questions like “How much water should I drink everyday?” but is unable to do computer vision analysis, search the web, or do math.\nRight now it seems Zo is only able to talk, but given Microsoft’s enthusiasm for this kind of bot, it would not be intelligent to believe that conversation is the only skill we will see from this new intelligent assistant with no stomach for controversy.\n",

      "text": "Teaching union urges ban on chain of low-cost private schools backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates By Katy Migiro\nNAIROBI, Dec 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Kenya promised on Monday to crack down on schools operating illegally after teachers called for a ban on a chain of low-cost private schools backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\nBridge International Academies (BIA), which is also supported by British aid money, offers cheap nursery and primary education to poor families.\nBut it has faced criticism for its 'academy in a box' model which keeps costs down by getting untrained teachers to read scripted lessons from a tablet computer.\nUganda's high court ordered the closure of 63 BIA schools last month for operating without a licence, using unregistered teachers and having poor sanitation - a ruling the company is appealing.\nKenya's National Union of Teachers (KNUT) launched a report on Monday criticising BIA's low quality of education and called for all 405 schools in Kenya to be shut.\n\"They should not be allowed to exploit children from poor households,\" said Wilson Sossion, KNUT's secretary general.\nLow-cost private schools are expanding across the region, particularly in unplanned slums where there are not enough government schools.\nLast year, the United Nations adopted an ambitious set of development goals, pledging to leave no one behind, including some 57 million children who are not in primary school - most of them in Africa.\nBIA, which aims to reach 10 million students by 2025, targets families living on $2 per person a day.\nSTRUGGLE\nThe KNUT report said the majority of parents interviewed struggled to pay BIA fees, which can reach $20 a month when school meals and other extras are included. It said pupils were regularly excluded because of arrears.\n\"My wife was admitted to hospital ... so I decided to pay the hospital bill first and pay school fees later but my children were sent home,\" one parent was Quote: d as saying.\nMost BIA teachers in eight sampled schools had no teaching qualifications, the report said.\nKenya's education minister, Fred Matiangi, told a media briefing in Nairobi he had visited Bridge schools and agreed with the criticisms in the report.\n\"It is true that some of these schools are ... (not) offering quality education as they purport to,\" he said, adding that the government will soon release its own report on BIA.\nHe ordered officials to crack down on schools operating illegally, but did not elaborate on how he thought schools were breaking the law.\nBIA spokesman Antony Okonji said Bridge schools had become involved in several court cases in Kenya after local authorities recommended their closure for not being registered.\nThe for-profit chain would not tell the Thomson Reuters Foundation how many of its schools were registered, but said 88 had been inspected, which is one of the steps towards registration.\nBIA's entrepreneurial approach has won it financial backing from the World Bank's private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation, and Britain's Department for International Development (DFID).\nBut increased foreign investment in private schools has been controversial, with anti-poverty campaigners calling for a greater focus on the right to free quality public education.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft are going all out again this Holiday season (as they do each year), with aggressive price drops and bundling- and one of those deals is this really cool one that is available right now from the Microsoft Store . Basically, right now, you could buy an Xbox One S – any Xbox One S, any bundle, any configuration – and you would get a free controller, as well as an extra game from Ubisoft thrown on top.\nThis means that theoretically you could make out with a 2TB console that has a major game like FIFA 17, Battlefield 1 , or Gears of War 4 bundled, and then get an extra controller and a Ubisoft game on top- and al for the cost of a regular Xbox One S. Hell of a good deal, this.\nThe games that are eligible for this deal are listed below. Which ones will you be picking up?

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube collaborate to remove ‘terrorist content’ from their services Posted HackerNews calls for “political detox,” critics cry censorship \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube today announced they would cooperate on a plan to help limit the spread of terrorist content online. The companies said that together they will create a shared industry database that will be used to identify this content, including what they describe as the “most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos” that have been removed from their respective services. \nFacebook describes how this database will work in a announcement in its newsroom. The content will be hashed using unique digital fingerprints, which is how its identification and removal can be handled more easily and efficiently by the company’s computer systems and algorithms. \nUsing a database of hashed images is the same way that organizations today keep child pornography off their services today. Essentially, a piece of content is given a unique identifier. If any copies of that file are analyzed, they will also produce this same hash value. Similar systems are also used to identify copyright protected files. \nHowever, where this new project differs is that the terrorist images and videos will not be automatically removed when content is found to match something in the database. Instead, the individual companies will determine how and when content is removed based on their own policies, and how they choose to define terrorist content. \nThat could quell claims of censorship, but, on the flip side, if the companies aren’t quick to respond, it could mean the images and videos have a chance to circulate and be viewed before they’re pulled down. \nFacebook also notes that personal information will not be shared, though it didn’t say that this information is not collected. The government can still go through legal means to find out from which accounts the content originated, and other info as before. The companies will continue to make their own determinations about how they handle those government requests and when those requests are disclosed. \nThe new database will be continually updated as the companies uncover new terrorist images or videos which can then be hashed and added to this shared resource. \nWhile the effort is beginning with the top social networks, the larger goal is to make this database available to other companies in the future, Facebook says. \n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” states the post.

      "text": "Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube team up to fight terrorist propaganda Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft and Twitter Associated Press Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft and Twitter announced a joint program aimed at removing the worst terrorist propaganda from their sites more quickly. Facebook, YouTube, Microsoft and Twitter announced a joint program aimed at removing the worst terrorist propaganda from their sites more quickly. (Associated Press) Associated Press \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could then remove. \nThe program, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft Corp. pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. \nSocial media is a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from “lone wolf” attacks and decreased the time from “flash to bang”— or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies.” \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and, if appropriate, disable the account. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter Inc., for example, says users “may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.” \n“We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,” said Sally Aldous, a Facebook Inc. spokeswoman. \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. \nLawmakers introduced legislation last year that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) was criticized for not defining “terrorist activity,” which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Assn., which represents 37 Internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter and Yahoo. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik , went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A post on Malik's Facebook page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort was previously uncommon. \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified “proprietary spam-fighting tools” to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n“Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,” said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. “A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.” \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it has already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr , Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.

      "text": "WASHINGTON Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams",

      "text": "Microsoft is once again testing the AI chat bot waters hopefully Zo isn't a relative of Tay on Dec 5, 2016, 6:30 PM TechSpot \nMicrosoft is once again testing the AI chat bot waters with Zo , a seemingly reworked bot that was recently discovered on Kik by Twitter user Tom Hounsell . \nAs you may remember, Microsoft’s first at bat – a chat bot named Tay – didn’t even last a full 24 hours before the Redmond-based company took it offline. Turns out, letting an impressionable chat bot designed to mimic a 19-year-old girl loose across multiple platforms on the Internet isn’t all that great of an idea. \nWithin hours, Tay was spewing racist comments left and right, offending hordes of people in the process. \nAccording to MSPoweruser , Zo is best described as a censored version of Tay or an English variant of Xiaoice, Microsoft’s Chinese chat bot. It’s apparently pretty good at normal conversation although if you try to steer the conversation toward a controversial topic like politics, it’ll politely decline to engage. \nLimiting Zo to Kik is likely a wise move as well. This gives Microsoft an opportunity to further fine-tune the bot before opening it up to popular social networks with more active users like Twitter and GroupMe. How long that’ll take, however, is anyone’s guess, especially considering Microsoft hasn't yet officially announced Zo (someone just stumbled upon it).

      "text": "Microsoft's 12 Days of Deals: 6 Deals for Business By Brett Nuckles, Business News Daily Tech Editor December 5, 2016 12:38 pm EST MORE \nMicrosoft wants to give you the gift of productivity this year, with nearly two weeks of discounts on various laptops and tablets prior to Christmas. The company's \" 12 Days of Deals \" sale is kicking off on Microsoft's online and retail stores starting today, Dec. 5, and will continue with additional one-day deals through Friday, Dec. 16. \nMany of the deals focus on video games and entertainment products, but there are still plenty of good offers on work machines. The deals include savings on a range of mobile devices, from the Surface Pro 4 hybrid laptop to dirt-cheap Windows tablets. Here are five discounts to watch for in the coming days. \nMonday, Dec.5 – Save up to $1,000 on select Intel-powered PCs \nMore than 50 laptop and desktop computers are on sale today, but workers aren't likely to save $1,000. The biggest deals are on gaming PCs. However, you can still save a good chunk of change by picking up a great work laptop, like the Dell XPS 13 for $949 (save $200), HP EliteBook Folio G1 for $1,099 (save $200) or HP Spectre x360 13 for $949 (save $200). \nTuesday, Dec. 6 – Save $100 on the Lenovo Ideapad 110 laptop \nBudget-minded workers can pick up Lenovo's Ideapad 110 for dirt cheap on Tuesday; it's just $199, for a savings of $100. This consumer-grade laptop is nothing fancy, but it does provide snappy performance for everyday productivity tasks, as well as a comfy keyboard, in a package that won't break the bank. \nThursday, Dec. 8 – Save $250 on the Surface Pro 4 \nOne of the best hybrid laptops ever made can be had for just $649 this Thursday, for a savings of $250. The Surface Pro 4 is a superversatile 12-inch tablet that pairs with a snap-on keyboard so you can use the device like a laptop. Surface's slate also comes with a digital pen and full pressure sensitivity, so you can sketch and take notes right on the tablet's display. \nFriday, Dec. 9 – Save up to 70 percent on select Windows 10 tablets \nA tablet can be a great work companion for basic tasks like checking your email and managing your calendar on the go. Microsoft says that that a variety of Windows 10 tablets will go on sale this Friday at up to 70 percent off, including some starting as low as $49. The company hasn't said which models will go on sale just yet, though, so we'll have to wait and see. \nThursday, Dec. 12 – Save up to 40 percent on select Dell PCs \nDell produces some of the best business PCs on the market, and a variety of models are set to go on sale next Thursday at up to 40 percent off. Again, Microsoft hasn't yet announced which models will be included in the sale, but the company did say that the deals will include PCs selling for as cheap as $199. \nFriday, Dec. 16 – Save up to $200 on the Surface Pro 4, plus get a free Type Cover \nMicrosoft will round out its 12 Days of Deals promotion with one last sale on the Surface Pro 4. This one might actually be better than the Dec. 8 sale, since you'll get the Type Cover keyboard accessory for free, a $129 savings on top of the initial $200 sale on the tablet itself. \n\nBrett Nuckles \nBrett Nuckles has been a working journalist since 2009.

      "text": "What’s the future of high school sports in Colorado? \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital “fingerprints” to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company’s service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from “flash to bang” — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves “the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies’ content policies,” according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users “may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.” \n“We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,” said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe White House praised the joint effort. “The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,” said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. “Today’s announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.” \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media’s use by terrorist groups. \nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining “terrorist activity,” which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik’s page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified “proprietary spam-fighting tools” to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n“Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter’s policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,” said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter’s vice president of public policy. “A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.” \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it’s already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future. \n___",

      "text": "View Comments Pic: Reuters BRUSSELS : Web giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. The companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. \"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. Tech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. But many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. Twitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. Each company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said. The database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership. The European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. The Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters. -Reuters",

      "text": "on Monday December 05, 2016 @08:05PM from the arch-enemy dept. Microsoft's response to the Amazon Echo and Google Home is Home Hub, a software update for Windows 10's Cortana personal assistant that turns any Windows PC into a smart speaker of sorts. Mashable reports: Microsoft's smart digital assistant Cortana can already answer your queries, even if the PC's screen is locked . The Home Hub is tied to Cortana and takes this a few steps further. It would add a special app with features such as calendar appointments, sticky notes and shopping lists. A Home Hub-enabled PC might have a Welcome Screen, a full-screen app that displays all these, like a virtual fridge door. Multiple users (i.e. family members) could use the Home Hub, either by authenticating through Windows Hello or by working in a family-shared account. Cortana would get more powerful on Home Hub; it could, for example, control smart home devices, such as lights and locks. And even though all of this will work on any Windows 10 device -- potentially making the PC the center of your smart home experience -- third-party manufacturers will be able to build devices that work with Home Hub. You can read Windows Central's massive report here . Do note that Home Hub is not official and individual features could change over time. The update is slated for 2017.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, YouTube collaborate to curb 'terrorist content' The tech giants have agreed to create a shared database of hashes for violent terrorist imagery, or terrorist recruitment videos and images. | Topic: Social Enterprise \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are working together to curb the spread of terrorist content, the tech giants announced Monday. \nSpecifically, they've promised to build a shared database of hashes (unique digital fingerprints) for violent terrorist imagery, or terrorist recruitment videos and images, that have been removed their services. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" the companies said in a joint blog post . \nEach company will apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding what to remove from its platform -- no content will be automatically removed after it's added to the database. Similarly, each company will use its own policies to determine what content to share to the database. The companies will, however, share best practices. \nThe blog post said no personally identifiable information will be shared. \n\"Throughout this collaboration, we are committed to protecting our users' privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms,\" the blog post said. \"We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.\" \nThe US and other governments have tried for some time to counter extremist messaging online , but the platforms themselves have come under fire for hosting the content. In January, a Florida woman sued Twitter after her husband was killed in a terrorist attack in Jordan, charging that the social media site knowingly let ISIS use its platform to build its organization. The lawsuit was later dismissed. \nMeanwhile, the social media giants have made similar efforts to curb harmful content: In May, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Facebook agreed to abide by a European code of conduct requiring them to tackle hate speech and terrorist propaganda.

      "text": "Microsoft researchers sound off on the next decade in tech Posted Facebook begins asking users to rate articles’ use of ‘misleading language’ \nIt’s Computer Science Education Week, in case you didn’t know, and in honor of this hallowed period Microsoft is publishing the thoughts of a few of its scientists and engineers on what will change in the tech world over the next decade. \n17 women were asked to chime in — an effort to highlight their voices in a field dominated by men — and you can read their full comments at the official Microsoft blog. I wouldn’t do you any favors by repackaging their already concise thoughts, but here are a few predictions I found interesting: People with disabilities will become power users of AI assistants and tech that allows them to participate in and help direct the industry Non-traditional fabrication and processing techniques — quantum, non-silicon, FPGA — will multiply in niche applications like machine learning and supercomputing Probabilistic programming will deliver context-sensitive software that can approximate as well as calculate Quantum computers will make low-strength cryptographic systems trivial to break More than a quarter of adult Americans will do some kind of ‘gig’ work, with AI bosses The search box will disappear (I disagree) \nOne longer quote I want to highlight: \nBy 2027 we will have ubiquitous virtual reality systems that will provide such rich multisensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceived reality. Using this technology, humans will retrain, recalibrate and improve their perceptual systems. \nWow, that escalated quickly! Again, the rest of the comments are here . See you in the multisensorial, hallucinatory future! 0",

      "text": "Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Microsoft are teaming up to combat terrorist content on their services, the companies said on Monday.\nTo do that, they will create a shared database with the unique digital fingerprints--called “hashes”--of terrorism images and videos that violate their content policies. By having access to this group database of identifiers, the companies believe they can more efficiently flag and potentially remove offending content if users attempt to publish it on their online services.\nThe database won’t contain personally identifiable user information, however.\n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” Facebook said in a blog post about the new effort.\nThe companies will continue to make their own decisions as far as removing content or banning users, and the content won’t be automatically removed.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nSocial media companies have long faced the challenge of keeping terrorist content off their networks, and they’ve mostly relied on their users to report it. This concerted effort could make it easier for the companies to crack down on pro-terrorist messages, which have been on the rise over the last few years.\nFor more on Facebook, watch this Fortune video: \nThis initiative also comes at a time where social networks are grappling with other community issues such as harassment and abuse, and the recent proliferation of “fake news,” or articles containing false information and claims. Facebook in particular has come under fire for its role in the dissemination of these fake news articles in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. While Facebook initially denied any responsibility , the company has since said it’s looking into ways it could potentially curb the spread of such content, though it’s resisting monitoring the content itself.\nWhile Facebook--and other social media companies--could take a similar approach to squash fake news articles, it would still leave the company to grapple with determining which articles are “fake,” which is exactly what it wants to avoid .",

      "text": "Court upholds warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens under Section 702 Posted Microsoft researchers sound off on the next decade in tech The U.S. federal appeals court has ruled in United States v. Mohamud , a case that began with a 2010 holiday bomb plot and will end with unique implications for the private digital communications of American citizens. Digital privacy advocates had hoped that the appeals case might prompt reform for a contentious portion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) known as Section 702 . The provision accommodates U.S. surveillance of foreign targets located abroad, although its many detractors argue that Section 702 allows the U.S. government to collect the bulk communications of Americans in the process. Unlike its better-known phone surveillance programs, the NSA can leverage Section 702 to collect emails, instant messages, and the browsing histories of the individuals it targets—and anyone who talks to them. The law essentially creates a loophole for the warrantless surveillance of American citizens, and United States v. Mohamud provided a rare opportunity to examine that loophole in action. As TechCrunch explained in July: “…[Mohamed Osman] Mohamud is one of the few criminal defendants who knows for certain he was targeted under the FISA Amendments Act (FAA). Roughly a year after his conviction, Mohamud’s lawyers were informed that their client was surveilled under the FAA. His legal team, along with the ACLU and EFF, has since argued that the surveillance violated Mohamud’s Fourth Amendment rights.” The new ruling concludes that government surveillance of Mohamud, the target of an FBI sting operation, did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights. The decision deals a considerable blow to anti-surveillance advocates seeking to rein in activity under Section 702. “The court’s decision rests on the faulty premise that Americans lose the core protections of the Fourth Amendment when they communicate with family members, friends, business associates, and others abroad,” ACLU staff attorney Patrick Toomey, who argued the case, told TechCrunch. “Under this program, the government is spying on the international communications of Americans in vast quantity without ever obtaining a warrant, and it is storing those communications in FBI databases for use in criminal investigations. Contrary to the court’s ruling, this sweeping surveillance violates the constitutional safeguards intended to protect Americans’ privacy.” With everything at stake in United States v. Mohamud , the court’s decision appears somewhat narrow, eschewing opinions on two specific surveillance methodologies: “Although § 702 potentially raises complex statutory and constitutional issues, this case does not. As explained [in the opinion], the initial collection of Mohamud’s email communications did not involve so-called “upstreaming” or targeting of Mohamud under § 702, more controversial methods of collecting information. It also did not involve the retention and querying of incidentally collected communications. All this case involved was the targeting of a foreign national under § 702, through which Mohamud’s email communications were incidentally collected. Confined to the particular facts of this case, we hold that the § 702 acquisition of Mohamud’s email communications did not violate the Fourth Amendment.” \nTechCrunch spoke to Andrew Crocker, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to clarify the bounds of the appeals court ruling. \n“First, the surveillance of the defendant did not involve the NSA’s so-called Upstream program, where the government taps directly into the fiber optic backbone of the Internet, a practice that the court said would raise more serious constitutional issues,” Crocker explained. \n“Second, the court said that the surveillance of the defendant did not involve a ‘backdoor search,’ that is when the government collects communications by targeting foreigners, but then turns around and searches its databases using email addresses or other identifiers belonging to Americans,” Crocker said. “On this second point, however, we think the court almost certainly got the facts wrong. Based on public evidence in the case, it seems the FBI did in fact search its database for Mr. Mohamud’s emails–which would be a serious violation of his rights, according not just to EFF and ACLU, but also to lawmakers like Senator Ron Wyden who have been trying to stop this practice.” \nIn spite of today’s setback, privacy advocates will keep their eyes on the clock: Section 702 is set to expire in December 2017. Still, Congress could very well seek to extend the provision before it reaches that sunset date. Featured Image: Bryce Durbin",

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "By TAMI ABDOLLAH\nAssociated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns - and derail proposed new federal legislation - over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" - or radicalization to violence - with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online - that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post - which was under an alias - the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group - showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "A new open-source connector enables businesses to build IoT applications that gather and make sense of mountain of data from disparate sources. Building an Azure-backed internet of things (IoT) application that uses the popular open-source Apache Kafka stream ingestion technology just got easier. Like RabbitMQ, Kafka is considered an IoT application building block for enterprises. It acts as a queuing system for large IoT deployments, enabling storage and analytics systems to catch up to the high volumes of data produced by disparate sensors and other connected devices. Microsoft today released Kafka Connect for Azure IoT Hub , an open-source connector that enables customers to feed telemetry data into the company's could-based IoT device connection and management service. \"Azure IoT Hub provides secure two-way communication with devices, device identity and device management at extreme scale and performance,\" said Sam George, partner director at Microsoft Azure Internet of Things, in a Dec. 5 announcement . \"Kafka Connect for Azure IoT Hub enables developers to connect IoT Hub to open source systems using Kafka for a powerful, secure and performant IoT solution. Kafka Connect for IoT Hub can also be used with the new managed Kafka solution available in Azure HDInsight.\"The connector arrives two weeks after the company released new Azure IoT Hub device management features, including a new Device Twin capability that digitally portrays a customer's physical devices and allows users to sync settings between devices and the cloud service. New device management libraries enable customers to apply firmware updates or reboot to their IoT devices. Users can also now roll back devices to their original factory settings or configure devices using the parameters of their virtual twin, whether they are currently online or offline.While Microsoft is focused on improving interoperability and enhancing Azure IoT's management capabilities as the platform's reach expands, the company is also keeping an eye on security. In October, Microsoft launched its new Security Program for Azure IoT that matches customers with IoT security specialists. Participating partners can provide customers with end-to-end security audits, ensuring that every link in the IoT chain, including devices, gateways and cloud connectivity components, works together to prevent hacks and keep data secure. Casaba Security, CyberX, Praetorian and Tech Mahindra are among the first auditors to offer up their services under the program. IoT security has become a priority for vendors seeking to capitalize on one of the biggest bright spots in the IT solutions market. While companies rush to IoT-enable their offerings, cyber-attackers are following close behind, causing some to call into question the wisdom of forging ahead with large-scale IoT deployments. In October, Domain Name System (DNS) services provider DynDNS was hit with a massive distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) that snarled internet traffic and slowed access to many popular online services like Spotify and Twitter. The culprit was a botnet called Mirai that largely consists of compromised IoT devices. \"If broken devices or devices with poorly configured defaults in any autonomous system can be aggregated into a force that can attack any individual, company or network, then it would seem logical to conclude a susceptible device anywhere poses a risk to everyone,\" wrote Chris Baker, Monitoring and Analytics manager at Dyn, in his Oct. 20 analysis of the incident.",
