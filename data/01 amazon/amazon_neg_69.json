      "text": "print \nAWS re:invent/Business Insider \nOracle founder Larry Ellison has a decades-long history of publicly slamming his competitors and lately he's trained his sights on one of the most fierce competitors he's ever had: Amazon Web Services. \nIn September, during the keynote speech at Oracle's huge customer conference in San Francisco, Ellison spent a good deal of time trash talking Amazon, mostly by saying how much slower it was to run databases on Amazon's cloud than it was to run them on Oracle's cloud. \nEllison provided the results of benchmark tests to back up his claims. \nOn Wednesday, Amazon hit back. \nAndy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, took the stage at his company's huge customer conference in Las Vegas and mocked Ellison's famous showmanship. Jassy told the crowd of IT professionals that Amazon's cloud services could give them superpowers such as X-ray vision to help them avoid being swayed by Ellison's claims. \n\n\"X-Ray vision is the unique ability to have visibility and vision,\" Jassy said such as \"the ability to see through the hand-waving and bombast.\" \nAnd during that time, for just a quick second, he flashed a picture of Larry Ellison, hands up on screen. The audience didn't miss it and laughed. Jassy explained: \"In the old days, because it was so expensive to test and experiment for any period of time, you used to be able to get these old guard leaders who would stand up and make all these wild claims and manipulate benchmarks for their own purposes, or take out full-page ads or billboards claiming whatever they claim. And you had no ability to know what was real. You had to make a buying decision before you could figure it out. In the cloud, that's not the case. That ship has sailed, kind of like an America's Cup ship. The reality is that any of these technology infrastructure buyers will allow you to benchmark these services, test these services for any period of time, so you get to make an educated decision on what the best platform is for you.\" \nJassy later doubled down on his attack by saying, that Amazon's home grown database Aurora, is the \"fastest growing service history of AWS.\" And then he had a customer, Finra, on stage that talked about how it migrated its massive databases from Oracle to AWS. \nAWS says 14,000+ databases have been migrated from other vendors to Amazon’s cloud. \nJassy has shouted down Ellison's claims about AWS before. Back in October, Jassy called Ellison's speech a classic \"old guard technology tactic,\" in which a latecomer with less functionalities and a fewer number of customers tries to establish itself by \"manipulating\" benchmarks. \"As far as I can tell, that was made up,\" Jassy added, referring to the stats Ellison gave during his keynote last month. The battle between these two is very heated \nOracle's bread-and-butter product is its super popular database. Amazon's cloud offers a large number of databases where companies pay only based on how much they use them. Its databases are among its fastest-growing cloud products. Last year, it even introduced a product that helps companies easily move their data from an Oracle (or other) database, into an Amazon one. \nAnd AWS is on track to do $13 billion in revenue for its cloud this year, Jassy said. An increasing number of companies are opting to move all of their apps and data to the Amazon's cloud, too, and as they do, are reassessing whether to use Amazon's databases for some of their apps, rather than Oracle's, they say. \nJassy's smackdown of Larry Ellison was not lost on the crowd, either. \n#awsreinvent annd burned Larry.. — Neelesh Salian (@NeelS7) November 30, 2016 \nhilarious... larry makes a cameo on @ajassy x-ray vision slide... #awsreinvent — Jeremy Schneider (@jer_s) November 30, 2016 Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "Google Plus Image: Conner Forrest/TechRepublic \nOn Wednesday, at the first keynote of the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Andy Jassy took the stage to explain a host of new updates to the cloud provider's portfolio of services. And, it seems Amazon is making a big bet on next -generation technology. \nSome of the biggest announcements were the first three services of the Amazon AI portfolio. For starters, Amazon Rekognition provides image recognition, categorization, and facial analysis in batch analysis or real time. The facial analysis can detect sentiment, and tell whether or not the subject is wearing glasses, for example. \nAmazon Polly is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that is powered by deep learning. It takes a text input and returns an MP3 stream that is altered to sound more like actual conversation. For example, if the text contains \"WA\" the output might say Washington instead. Jassy also announced that a new service called Amazon Lex, which powers Alexa, is coming as well. Lex provides natural language understanding and automatic speech recognition. \nSEE: Cloud computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) \nThe new AI tools announced by Jassy could make it much easier for enterprise customers to tap into, and leverage, technologies such as machine learning to build their next generation of applications. \nIn his address, Jassy also noted that Amazon would be launching a new analytics product called Amazon Athena. As a companion to the existing EMR and Redshift, Athena is an interactive query service that allows users to analyze data in S3 using SQL. This significantly lowers the bar for everyday IT to utilize big data analytics to glean insights. \nTo go along with these new services, Jassy also announced a slew of new compute instances and features as well. Here are the following compute types that were announced: T2.xlarge - 16 GiB, 2 vCPU T2.2xlarge - 32 GiB,. 2 vCPU R4 - 48 GiB, DDR4, L3 cache, 64 vCPUs I3 - 3.3 million IOPS, 488 GiB, 15.2 TB NVMe SSD, 64 vCPUS C5 - 72 vCPUs, Intel Skylake, 12 Gbps to EBS, 144 GiB Must-Read Cloud",

      "text": "AWS chief Andy Jassy speaks about AI on Wednesday at re:Invent. Photo via AWS livestream. Amazon today announced three new artificial intelligence-related toolkits for developers building apps on Amazon Web Services.\nAt the company’s AWS re:invent conference in Las Vegas, Amazon showed how developers can use three new services — Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Rekognition — to build artificial intelligence features into apps for platforms like Slack, Facebook Messenger, ZenDesk, and others.\nThe idea is to let developers utilize the machine learning algorithms and technology that Amazon has already created for its own processes and services like Alexa. Instead of developing their own AI software, AWS customers can simply use an API call or the AWS Management Console to incorporate AI features into their own apps.\nAWS CEO Andy Jassy noted that Amazon has been building AI and machine learning technology for 20 years and said that there are now thousands of people “dedicated to AI in our business.” Now the company is opening up the back-end infrastructure to third-party developers. Three services were announced today and more are coming next year, Jassy said. He didn’t talk about pricing.\nAmazon CTO Werner Vogels detailed the new services in a blog post published Wednesday that describes each new service. Here’s a quick rundown of Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Rekognition.\nAmazon Lex \nAmazon Lex — which refers to what’s in between “A lex a” — lets developers build conversational interfaces into the apps by using voice and text.\n“The same conversational engine that powers Alexa is now available to any developer, making it easy to bring sophisticated, natural language ‘chatbots’ to new and existing applications,” Vogels wrote. “The power of Alexa in the hands of every developer, without having to know deep learning technologies like speech recognition, has the potential of sparking innovation in entirely new categories of products and services.”\nAWS CEO Andy Jassy, speaking at the keynote, said that Lex will allow developers to build conversational applications. He used an example of an app that lets people order pizza, with the artificial intelligence technology behind AWS using natural language processing and knowledge graphs to understand context and user intent.\n“You can build multi-step conversations,” Jassy noted.\nDr. Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy for AWS, talks about Lex. Photo via AWS livestream. Dr. Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy for AWS, also spoke during the keynote and showed how Lex can be used to build conversational travel planning apps. The process went like this:\nWood: Book a flight to London.\nAI: When do you want to travel?\nWood : Friday afternoon.\nAI: There’s a flight leaving at 5 p.m. for $500. Book it?\nWood : Book it.\nAI: OK, it’s booked.\n\n“This is a very simple example of the type of fluid conversations you can have with services running on Amazon Lex,” Wood said.\nLex can be integrated into Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Hubspot, Twilio, Facebook Messenger, and other platforms.\nYou can see pricing info for Lex here .\nAmazon Rekognition Amazon Rekognition is an image recognition service that can quickly detect what’s in an image, like the number of people, the gender of those people, different items, etc. It uses the same technology that Amazon uses to analyze images on Amazon Prime Photos.\n“Amazon Rekognition democratizes the application of deep learning technique for detecting objects, scenes, concepts, and faces in your images, comparing faces between two images, and performing search functionality across millions of facial feature vectors that your business can store with Amazon Rekognition,” Vogels wrote. “Amazon Rekognition’s easy-to-use API, which is integrated with Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda, brings deep learning to your object store.”\nPhoto via Werner Vogels’ weblog. During his travel planning demo Wood showed how Rekognition can be used in conjunction with Lex. For example, using the Rekognition image technology, the AI can show a user photos of a lake or forest that help guide them to where they want to travel.\n“Although each of these individual services — Polly, Lex, Rekognition — can be used independently, pulling them together allows you to build some really novel, sophisticated, category-defining applications,” Wood said.\nYou can see pricing info for Rekognition here .\nAmazon Polly \nPolly is a text-to-speech deep learning service.\n“With Amazon Polly, we are making the same text-to-speech technology used to build Alexa’s voice to AWS customers,” Vogels wrote. “It is now available to any developer aiming to power their apps with high-quality spoken output.”\nJassy explained how developers can use Polly to input a text like “the temperature in WA is 75° F,” and then spin out an MP3 stream. There is intelligence built into Polly so that the audio comes out like “the temperature in Washington is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.”\n\nPolly comes with 47 different voices and 27 languages.

      "text": "Amazon accelerates and simplifies its cloud infrastructure offering Services offer flexible GPU acceleration, simple virtual private servers and improved compute   \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy speaks at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank $29 for This Premium 4-Course Training on Amazon Web Services- Deal Alert \nAmazon Web Services continued to push its infrastructure offering forward on Wednesday with the launch of upgrades to its existing instance types and new tools for simplifying and accelerating computation tasks in its public cloud. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy unveiled a new Elastic GPUs feature for the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that will let developers add flexible acceleration using parallel processing for their applications. \nOn top of that, Amazon launched a new Lightsail service that’s aimed at giving customers an easy way to spin up a straightforward virtual private server without having to orchestrate a fleet of different AWS services. Finally, the company also unveiled upgrades to its burstable, memory intensive, high I/O, and compute intensive instances. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nAll of these announcements are aimed at helping Amazon maintain its leading position in the infrastructure-as-a-service market. The company has positioned its IaaS offering as foundational to its cloud platform. \nThe Elastic GPU service will let developers attach GPUs to different EC2 instances, so they can get the graphical acceleration they need without having to pay for specific, GPU-accelerated instances. When users first spin up an instance, they’ll be able to attach up to 8GiB of GPU vRAM. If they need to change the amount of vRAM available, developers will be able to shut down, modify and then spin up the instance again. \nIt’s a service that will be useful for a variety of applications, like gaming, graphical rendering and machine learning. The GPUs will be available for all of Amazon’s instance types, once they launch officially in the future. Right now, the amount of vRAM that an instance needs determines which of Amazon’s existing GPU-attached instances customers have to use. \n“Developers will love having slices of GPU, instead of paying for it all the time,” IDC Program Director Al Hilwa said in an email. \nIt’s similar to functionality that Google announced earlier this month, which will let companies attach GPUs to any of the compute instances running in its cloud. Amazon’s OpenGL library will automatically detect and use Elastic GPUs, which will be a boon to developers. Amazon \nA pricing chart shows the different pricing available for Amazon's new Lightsail VPS service. \nLightsail will allow people to easily spin up a virtual private server on AWS without having to understand how to start up a compute instance, connect it to storage, handle networking and more. Instead, users make a few clicks to select what they want the server to do, pick out its hardware capabilities and give it a name. \nLightsail servers start at $5 per month, which gets users 512MB of memory, 1 vCPU, 20GB of SSD storage, at 1TB of data transfer. Users can go all the way up to $80 per month, with 8 GB of memory, 2 vCPUs, 80GB of SSD, and 5TB of data transfer. \nJassy said users that want to then take advantage of additional AWS services will be able to go “under the hood” with a Lightsail instance and connect with other AWS services. \nOn top of all that, Amazon also announced refreshes to a host of different instance types that it already has available. New R4 instances are an upgrade to Amazon’s memory-focused R3 instances. They sport up to 488GiB of DDR4 memory and up to 64 vCPUs. That’s twice the memory available with the previous instances, and twice the number of virtual processors. \nAmazon’s burstable T2 instances got new t2.xlarge and t2.2xlarge types , which provide twice and four times the number of virtual CPUs and memory compared to the t2.large instance type, respectively. \nThe high I/O I3 instance type, which will be available in the future, will support configurations with up to 488GiB of memory, 3.3 million IOPS, 15.2TB of NVMe SSD storage and 64 vCPUs. On top of all that, the forthcoming compute-intensive C4 instances will support up to 72 vCPUs and 144GiB of memory. \nAll of these infrastructure revisions are part of Amazon’s announcements at its Re:Invent conference. The company also announced a new instance type that lets users access field-programmable gate arrays to help accelerate particular applications. Related:",

      "text": "The AWS Snowmobile, capable of moving 100 petabyes of data from a data center into Amazon’s cloud, debuted to applause at re:Invent 2016 in Las Vegas on Nov. 30, 2016. (Dan Richman/GeekWire) LAS VEGAS — Snowball, a physical device introduced last year to quickly move 50 TB of data out of a data center into AWS’s cloud, has proved extremely popular, requiring AWS to order ten times as many as it first got just within the first week of its use, AWS CEO Andy Jassy said today at re:Invent.\nBut now, organizations are seeking a way to move more data. Much more data.\nEnter, stage right, a ruggedized semi-trailer truck bearing Snowmobile, which holds 100 petabytes of data.\n“Moving an exabyte of data would take 26 years with a 10-GB-per-second connection,” Jassy said. “With the Snowmobile, it would take six months. And you wouldn’t believe how many companies have that much data.”\nOn a more modest level, the new Snowball Edge holds 100 TB. It can be clustered and automatically shares data among multiple units. It can upload and download data, and it has the new Greengrass Internet-of-Things framework and the Lamba code snippet-processing engine inside, giving it considerable computing power.\nAWS Greengrass embeds the Lambda compute service and others into connected devices, Jassy said. It’s a software capability that can be embedded into devices, giving them local compute power, secure communications, manageability from the AWS console, and local communication and orchestration. Lambda functions lets the devices communicate with each other. Chip makers Intel and QualComm will embed it into their next chips. Philips and other IoT makers are also on board.",

Finally, the company also unveiled upgrades to its burstable, memory intensive, high I/O, and compute intensive instances.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "AWS re:invent/Business Insider \nOracle founder Larry Ellison has a decades-long history of publicly slamming his competitors and lately he's trained his sights on one of the most fierce competitors he's ever had: Amazon Web Services.\nIn September, during the keynote speech at Oracle's huge customer conference in San Francisco, Ellison spent a good deal of time trash talking Amazon, mostly by saying how much slower it was to run databases on Amazon's cloud than it was to run them on Oracle's cloud. \nEllison provided the results of benchmark tests to back up his claims.\nOn Wednesday,  Amazon hit back. \nAndy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, took the stage at his company's huge customer conference in Las Vegas and mocked Ellison's famous showmanship. Jassy told the crowd of IT professionals that Amazon's cloud services could give them superpowers such as X-ray vision to help them avoid being swayed by Ellison's claims.\n \n\"X-Ray vision is the unique ability to have visibility and vision,\" Jassy said such as \"the ability to see through the hand-waving and bombast.\"\nAnd during that time, for just a quick second, he flashed a picture of Larry Ellison, hands up on screen. The audience didn't miss it and laughed. Jassy explained:\n\"In the old days, because it was so expensive to test and experiment for any period of time, you used to be able to get these old guard leaders who would stand up and make all these wild claims and manipulate benchmarks for their own purposes, or take out full-page ads or billboards claiming whatever they claim. And you had no ability to know what was real. You had to make a buying decision before you could figure it out. \nIn the cloud, that's not the case. That ship has sailed, kind of like an America's Cup ship. The reality is that any of these technology infrastructure buyers will allow you to benchmark these services, test these services for any period of time, so you get to make an educated decision on what the best platform is for you.\"\nJassy later doubled down on his attack by saying, that Amazon's home grown database Aurora, is the \"fastest growing service history of AWS.\" And then he had a customer, Finra, on stage that talked about how it migrated its massive databases from Oracle to AWS.\nAWS says 14,000+ databases have been migrated from other vendors to Amazon’s cloud. \nJassy has shouted down Ellison's claims about AWS before. Back in October,  Jassy called Ellison's speech a classic \"old guard technology tactic,\" in which a latecomer with less functionalities and a fewer number of customers tries to establish itself by \"manipulating\" benchmarks. \"As far as I can tell, that was made up,\" Jassy added, referring to the stats Ellison gave during his keynote last month.\nThe battle between these two is very heated Oracle's bread-and-butter product is its super popular database. Amazon's cloud offers a large number of databases where companies pay only based on how much they use them. Its databases are among its fastest-growing cloud products. Last year, it even introduced a product that helps companies easily move their data from an Oracle (or other) database, into an Amazon one.\nAnd AWS is on track to do $13 billion in revenue for its cloud this year, Jassy said. An increasing number of companies are opting to move all of their apps and data to the Amazon's cloud, too, and as they do, are reassessing whether to use Amazon's databases for some of their apps, rather than Oracle's, they say. \nJassy's smackdown of Larry Ellison was not lost on the crowd, either.\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/804002359617519617\n#awsreinvent annd burned Larry.. \nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/804002536038526976\nhilarious... larry makes a cameo on @ajassy x-ray vision slide... #awsreinvent \nNOW WATCH: JACK DANIEL’S MASTER DISTILLER: This is the real difference between scotch, whiskey, and bourbon \n",

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 30, 2016, 11:58 A.M. ET Nutanix’s CEO: What Would an Amazon Partnership Look Like? By Tiernan Ray \nShares of enterprise infrastructure equipment maker Nutanix ( NTNX ), which went public September 30th, are down $1.37, or 4%, at $32.72, despite the company yesterday beating fiscal Q1 expectations, and forecasting this quarter higher, too, results that pleased analysts but not enough to please traders. \nA big focus on the conference call following the report were the two areas where the company said it had done especially well, those being with the U.S. federal business, and in its sales of software to OEM systems manufactures, especially Dell , where it has a longstanding partnership. \nI spoke with CEO Dheeraj Pandey a short while ago by phone. I had first talked with Pandey in his San Jose offices in mid-2014 , when Nutanix was a privately backed startup. Pandey is always pleasantly outspoken. Back then, he told me that there had been “$200 million in venture money dedicated to killing Nutanix.” \nHis thoughts during today’s conversations were more philosophical than back then. He spoke about the company’s goal to merge public cloud computing with on-premise computing. Pandey regards his firm as more than a mere box-maker , like Pure Storage ( PSTG ) or NetApp ( NTAP ). Instead, it is designing the “ operating system ” to span from an enterprise’s facilities to public cloud installations running in Amazon.com ( AMZN ) AWS, with the company’s believing that “hybrid” cloud environments will dominate for the foreseeable future. \nHowever, Nutanix right now sells mostly to enterprise customers, including those deals with Dell. Less than 10% of revenue has been to service providers. And it doesn’t have a deal with Amazon, which I suggested to him means the company’s not selling as much to one half of the public-private cloud divide. \nBut Pandey points out it’s very early in the evolution of public cloud. “Today, there is only one real public cloud company, which is Amazon,” he observes. “[ Microsoft ’s ( MSFT )] Azure is not at that scale yet, and [ Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL )] Google is doing a lot of marketing. This is a five- to ten-year journey till we know who real the real providers are.” \nIn the same vein, he notes that Amazon alone can’t address the needs of the “ Fortune 5,000 ” companies that make up 80% of global IT spending. \nBut, I pressed, is it possible for him to do a partnership with Amazon? \nPandey replied, “That question is quite nuanced — What would a win-win look like?” \nHe continued that it’s not clear much of AWS is actually used by customers: These are all things we will explore in the future. I don’t know all the details, but basically, it’s [AWS] mostly Amazon renting hardware to be in there, and it’s quite topical at best. You have to really go deeper into using Amazon’s capabilities. There are a ton of those capabilities that I’m not sure people are going to use as part of this colocation or hosting they are offering. What about networks and security? Are you able, if you have an Amazon ID, to use that Amazon ID across both sides, both public and on-premise? \nThere are no ratings changes on the Street today, that I can see, but some price target increases, here and there. In addition to lots of praise for the company’s work, the biggest concern for analysts is the current reliance on the Dell partnership , along with quibbles about stock valuation: \nRichard Kugele, Needham & Co .: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $36 price target. “In its first quarter as a public company, Nutanix did not disappoint, materially exceeding topline revenue, billings and EPS loss estimates. Further, NTNX raised next quarter’s guidance vs. consensus, demonstrating continued momentum. In our view, the only thing the company potentially did wrong was report earnings as a public company, as it appears to be in vogue to find some real or imagined fault with next-gen tech companies regardless of how well they are actually executing. We strongly contest this view, as we believe these stocks ultimately revert to growth and fundamentals over time.” \nNepal Chokshi, Maxim Group : Reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his price target to $42 from $40. “October quarter results deliver 5th quarter in a row of y/y improving sales productivity to a phenomenal level, in our view […] The only potential issue investors can take with the earnings report in our view is the rise in DSOs, which based on our AR/billings DSO metric rose 21 days y/y and 6 days q/q. Management noted that billings linearity was similar to the past two fiscal first quarters, but that linearity of shipments did not mimic billings as a result of not managing the supplier relationships crisply towards the end of the quarter. \nMark Murphy, J.P. Morgan : Reiterates a Neutral rating, and raises his price target to $35 from $33. “In its first quarter as a public company, Nutanix reported impressive results with an accelerating revenue profile that beat expectations across all metrics and provided guidance above consensus […] We are very encouraged by the results and we expect Nutanix to continue to upend the IT infrastructure playbook, however, we think the risk/reward is fairly balanced for now at current price levels.” \nMehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna : Reiterates a Neutral rating, and raises his price target to $29 from $24. “We came away encouraged with NTNX’s strong October-quarter top-line results and January-quarter guide – as well as promising cash flow dynamics; however, we remain Neutral at current levels given the confluence of appropriate valuation, potential risk from an intensifying competitive environment and the prospect of a de-emphasized Dell OEM relationship combined with NTNX’s aggressive opex strategy.” \nSimon Leopold, Raymond James : Reiterates a Market Perform rating. “Although bookings were not disclosed, management noted that software content now makes up 15% of bookings, up from 9% in the year ago quarter, implying that OEM contributions to bookings are likely up materially as well given that 66% of OEM bookings are software. Management has stated in the past that despite the growing OEM contribution to bookings, it expects OEM revenue will remain less than 20% of total sales. Investors will likely remain cautious however as the continually increasing contributions to bookings from one its own competitors will likely remain a point of focus.” ",

      "title": "Everything announced at AWS re:Invent 2016 so far",
      "text": "For the past five years, Amazon has held a big conference for customers of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division in Las Vegas. Software industry people and existing customers have always paid attention. But this year AWS has become such a financial juggernaut for Amazon that it has become a bigger deal in the wider world of business. And that means this is a really big week for AWS, perhaps the biggest ever. \nOf course, AWS came prepared — it’s been planning for this event for months. Executives announce one piece of news after another onstage, just like at Google I/O or Microsoft Build. It can leave one overwhelmed, particularly if one doesn’t know the portfolio of AWS services backward and forward.\nHere’s a rundown of the announcements coming out of re:Invent this year.\nNew instances, FPGAs, and GPUs for EC2 Above: New AWS instances.\nImage Credit: Screenshot AWS announced the launch of new virtual machine (VM) instances that will be available for developers to rent out by the hour to run their applications. This is the most predictable announcement of the 2016 re:Invent conference, as AWS tends to unveil new VM types at this event. \nRather than just releasing new VM instances backed with graphics processing units (GPUs), AWS chief executive Andy Jassy said that AWS will be exposing “elastic GPUs for EC2,” a way for people to attach GPU resources to their existing VM instances. Also there are new F1-branded VM instances that are accelerated with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The AWS service lets you write code, package it up as an image, and then run it as custom logic on the FPGAs.\nRead more \nA DigitalOcean killer Above: Amazon Lightsail.\nImage Credit: Screenshot AWS announced Amazon Lightsail, a new way for developers to quickly and easily get access to low-cost virtual private servers (VPS).\nThey don’t need to worry about provisioning storage, security groups, or identity and access management (IAM) when they want to just get a box to run a simple application. They can just use Amazon Lightsail now.\nRead more \nAWS’ first AI services, including a conversational app framework called Lex, which is what’s behind Alexa Above: AWS chief executive Andy Jassy unveils Amazon’s first AI services at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016.\nImage Credit: AWS re:Invent Twitter account There is the new Rekognition image recognition service — presumably drawing on the talent and technology from deep learning startup Orbeus, whose team Amazon hired in the past year.\nThere is also the new Polly text-to-speech (TTS) service, which supports 47 voices and 27 languages. It’s free to process up to 5 million characters a month, and after that it costs $0. 4 per character, AWS chief evangelist Jeff Barr wrote in a blog post.\nBut the most significant announcement today is the launch of Amazon Lex. It’s effectively the technology underlying Alexa, Amazon’s voice-activated virtual assistant. Alexa is the basis of the Amazon Echo line of smart speakers, which have taken off — one recent report said Amazon has sold more than 5 million of them. Lex provides deep learning-powered automatic speech recognition and natural-language understanding.\nRead more \nAthena service for querying data in S3 Above: AWS chief executive Andy Jassy introduces Amazon Athena at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016.\nImage Credit: AWS re:Invent Twitter account At its annual re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the launch of Amazon Athena, a new tool for running queries on data that’s stored in AWS’ widely used S3 cloud storage service.\nPeople can use the standard Structured Query Language (SQL) with the service and don’t need to worry about setting up the infrastructure for it.\nAWS doesn’t believe Athema will overlap with the querying tools that are available through its Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) service and its Redshift data warehousing service, AWS chief executive Andy Jassy said during today’s keynote.\nRead more \nPostgreSQL support in the Aurora database engine Above: Andy Jassy talks about new capabilities in the Aurora cloud database service.\nImage Credit: AWS re:Invent Twitter account At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas, public cloud infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS) today announced that its Aurora managed cloud database engine now supports the popular PostgreSQL structured database.\nAmazon already lets developers store and retrieve data using PostgreSQL through its Relational Database Service (RDS). RDS added support for PostgreSQL in 2013. Of course, developers could also just install the open-source PostgreSQL atop AWS computing and storage infrastructure on their own. Sure enough, it will be possible to migrate PostgreSQL databases from RDS to Aurora.\nPostgreSQL support is the top request from customers of Aurora, AWS chief executive Andy Jassy said today.\nRead more \nThe Snowmobile truck and 100PB Snowmobile Edge boxes to efficiently move data to the cloud Above: AWS Snowmobile.\nImage Credit: Screenshot At its re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas today, public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) unveiled the next generation of its Snowball boxes that customers can use to move lots of data to AWS.\nThe first version was announced at last year’s re:Invent — it had a capacity of 50TB. Then, in April of this year, AWS showed off a 80TB version. This time around, AWS decided to add on computing resources, which opens up new possibilities for companies that need a Snowball.\nMultiple Snowball Edge boxes — each of which has a 100TB capacity and a color touchscreen — can divvy up databases with sharding, for one thing, AWS chief executive Andy Jassy said, and they can sync data to S3, too. But also, they can run new AWS software called AWS Greengrass, which effectively brings the serverless event-driven computing model of AWS Lambda outside of AWS and onto other kinds of devices, including embedded devices.\nRead more \nStay tuned for more news later on in the week.\n",

      "text": "Amazon accelerates and simplifies its cloud infrastructure offering Services offer flexible GPU acceleration, simple virtual private servers and improved compute U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 30, 2016 11:21   November   \nAmazon Web Services continued to push its infrastructure offering forward on Wednesday with the launch of upgrades to its existing instance types and new tools for simplifying and accelerating computation tasks in its public cloud. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy unveiled a new Elastic GPUs feature for the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that will let developers add flexible acceleration using parallel processing for their applications. \nOn top of that, Amazon launched a new Lightsail service that’s aimed at giving customers an easy way to spin up a straightforward virtual private server without having to orchestrate a fleet of different AWS services. Finally, the company also unveiled upgrades to its burstable, memory intensive, high I/O, and compute intensive instances. \nAll of these announcements are aimed at helping Amazon maintain its leading position in the infrastructure-as-a-service market. The company has positioned its IaaS offering as foundational to its cloud platform. \nThe Elastic GPU service will let developers attach GPUs to different EC2 instances, so they can get the graphical acceleration they need without having to pay for specific, GPU-accelerated instances. When users first spin up an instance, they’ll be able to attach up to 8GiB of GPU vRAM. If they need to change the amount of vRAM available, developers will be able to shut down, modify and then spin up the instance again. \nIt’s a service that will be useful for a variety of applications, Amazon says, including gaming, graphical rendering and machine learning. The GPUs will be available for all of Amazon’s instance types, once they launch officially in the future. Right now, the amount of vRAM that an instance needs determines which of Amazon’s existing GPU-attached instances customers have to use. \n“Developers will love having slices of GPU, instead of paying for it all the time,” IDC Program Director Al Hilwa said in an email. \nIt’s similar to functionality that Google announced earlier this month, which will let companies attach GPUs to any of the compute instances running in its cloud. Amazon’s OpenGL library will automatically detect and use Elastic GPUs, which will be a boon to developers. Amazon \nA pricing chart shows the different pricing available for Amazon's new Lightsail VPS service. \nLightsail will allow people to easily spin up a virtual private server on AWS without having to understand how to start up a compute instance, connect it to storage, handle networking and more. Instead, users make a few clicks to select what they want the server to do, pick out its hardware capabilities and give it a name. \nLightsail servers start at $5 per month, which gets users 512MB of memory, 1 vCPU, 20GB of SSD storage, at 1TB of data transfer. Users can go all the way up to $80 per month, with 8 GB of memory, 2 vCPUs, 80GB of SSD, and 5TB of data transfer. \nJassy said users that want to then take advantage of additional AWS services will be able to go “under the hood” with a Lightsail instance and connect with other AWS services. \nOn top of all that, Amazon also announced refreshes to a host of different instance types that it already has available. New R4 instances are an upgrade to Amazon’s memory-focused R3 instances. They sport up to 488GiB of DDR4 memory and up to 64 vCPUs. That’s twice the memory available with the previous instances, and twice the number of virtual processors. \nAmazon’s burstable T2 instances got new t2.xlarge and t2.2xlarge types , which provide twice and four times the number of virtual CPUs and memory compared to the t2.large instance type, respectively. \nThe high I/O I3 instance type, which will be available in the future, will support configurations with up to 488GiB of memory, 3.3 million IOPS, 15.2TB of NVMe SSD storage and 64 vCPUs. On top of all that, the forthcoming compute-intensive C4 instances will support up to 72 vCPUs and 144GiB of memory. \nAll of these infrastructure revisions are part of Amazon’s announcements at its Re:Invent conference. The company also announced a new instance type that lets users access field-programmable gate arrays to help accelerate particular applications.  ",

      "text": "Amazon just announced a new service called AWS Snowmobile , which is a 21st century version of the classic \"sneakernet\" method of data transport. Basically, Amazon is offering to tow a 45-foot-long shipping container full of hard drives to your data center, plug in to your servers via fiber, and siphon off up to 100 petabytes (a petabyte is 1 million gigabytes) of data. That shipping container is then transported to an Amazon data center where all the data is uploaded to S3 or Amazon Glacier, Amazon's cloud data storage services.\nThis is a sizable upgrade over Amazon's existing Snowball service, in which Amazon ships you a secure 80TB “Storage Appliance” to load your data onto over 10Gbps Ethernet. Amazon just announced a new version of Snowball (pictured above) with more storage and faster networking, but it’s still not “exabyte scale,” so the company decided to build something even bigger. With the new Snowmobile service, Amazon says you could ship one exabyte (an exabyte is 1,000 petabytes) of data to AWS in about six months — a feat which would take roughly 26 years over a 10Gbps dedicated connection. The Snowmobile truck's network cable is capable of transporting up to 1Tbps over multiple 40Gbps connections into the shipping container’s capacious hold.\nI'm not sure how many companies are looking to ship a literal truck's worth of data to the cloud, but it sounds like a fun project anyway. Apparently one of Amazon's first customers is DigitalGlobe, who is transferring 100 petabyes of satellite imagery to AWS via these sweet hard drive trucks. Amazon is also looking into an export service with Snowmobile, which would allow you to get data out of AWS at this same shipping container scale.",

      "text": "print \nBI Intelligence \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" E-Commerce Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nWalmart's investment in its holiday inventory could be paying off as the mass merchant is catching up to Amazon when it comes to in-demand items and pricing, according to data from Boomerang Commerce cited by Internet Retailer. \nWalmart boosted its online inventory ahead of Black Friday by more than half, which is giving it strength in the e-commerce market. However, the company may run into logistical barriers over the busy holiday season. \nWalmart is closing the gap between itself and Amazon for the holidays. In-demand items: Walmart.com is offering 66% of the 600 most popular toys available on Amazon this year, compared with just 46% during last year's holiday season. Moreover, Walmart is offering 68% of the most popular consumer electronics products, compared with 51% in 2015. Pricing: Walmart is offering lower prices than Amazon on 78 of the 394 toys that both retailers are offering, and lower prices on 84 of the electronics products that both merchants sell. \nBut there are logistical limitations to Walmart's lift in inventory. While Walmart has notably stocked up on in-demand goods — adding 1.5 million televisions and 3 million video games, for example — the company could run into issues with fulfillment. A spike in order volume, especially in a short period like Black Friday , puts a strain on third-party logistics providers that only have a certain amount of warehouse space and trucks to house retail partners' orders. \nIf Walmart's inventory optimization leads to unexpected sales spikes, the company runs the risk that its fulfillment partners (i.e. UPS or FedEx) could experience delayed shipments due to the heavy volume. It would be wise for Walmart, and other retailers competing against the e-commerce giant, to put sufficient effort into back-end fulfillment operations as they look to keep pace with inventory. \nThere is also another option: click and collect. This fulfillment option that lets shoppers place an online order and pick it up at a store — is thriving in the UK. Over half of UK shoppers report having used this method in the past year , according to a survey from JDA & Centiro conducted in April 2016. \nHowever, the US is far behind on the click and collect trend, with just 27% of consumers using the service. This is largely due to slower growth in mobile commerce, and specifically, the hesitancy shoppers feel about using mobile retail apps. \nRetailers in the US can look to the growth drivers in the UK to help drive up their own click and collect sales. Most notably, mobile commerce and adoption by grocery chains are driving shoppers in the UK to use click and collect. \nNancee Halpin, research associate for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on click and collect that breaks down the growth factors behind click and collect in the UK. It also discusses the retailers successfully implementing the fulfillment method, examines the of impact consumer behavior, and outlines some key steps that US retailers can take to replicate the UK's performance. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: T he UK's click and collect market is expected to grow 78% by 2020, to £8.2 billion ($10.6 billion) . Meanwhile, it is expected to reach £5.3 billion ($6.8 billion) by the end of 2016. Click and collect is benefiting from consumer adoption of mobile commerce in the UK. Mobile is a fundamental driver because it affords consumers more flexibility in the purchasing process. As a result, many UK consumers are purchasing goods on their mobile phones, and then picking them up on the way home from work, the gym, appointments, etc. The service is particularly popular among grocery chains, with many of the UK's largest supermarkets offering click and collect. Since trips to the grocery store are made frequently and regularly, click and collect is a perfect fit for shoppers who want to avoid recurring issues like long checkout lines and crowded stores. To grow click and collect in the US, retailers need to invest in their mobile presence and dedicate in-store resources to click and collect shoppers. Merchants should do more than just recreate the desktop browser experience on a mobile app — this includes employing tools like mobile loyalty programs, digital coupons, and social media integration. \nIn full, the report: Sizes the market for click and collect in both the UK and the US. Identifies the key growth factors that are making click and collect successful in the UK. Discusses key players in the UK that are seeing success with click and collect. Presents some of the challenges the US faces in spurring adoption.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy speaks at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank Larry Ellison learns to love the cloud \nAmazon Web Services continued to push its infrastructure offering forward on Wednesday with the launch of upgrades to its existing instance types and new tools for simplifying and accelerating computation tasks in its public cloud. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy today unveiled a new Elastic GPUs feature for the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that will let developers add flexible acceleration using parallel processing for their applications. [ Download the public cloud megaguide PDF: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Joyent compared . | Stay up on the cloud with InfoWorld's Cloud Computing Report newsletter . ] \nOn top of that, Amazon launched a new Lightsail service that’s aimed at giving customers an easy way to spin up a straightforward virtual private server without having to orchestrate a fleet of different AWS services. Finally, the company also unveiled upgrades to its burstable, memory-intensive, high-I/O, and compute-intensive instances. \nAll these announcements are aimed at helping Amazon maintain its leading position in the infrastructure-as-a-service market. The company has positioned its IaaS offering as foundational to its cloud platform. \nThe Elastic GPU service will let developers attach GPUs to different EC2 instances, so they can get the graphical acceleration they need without having to pay for specific, GPU-accelerated instances. When users first spin up an instance, they’ll be able to attach up to 8GB of GPU vRAM. If they need to change the amount of vRAM available, developers will be able to shut down, modify and then spin up the instance again. \nIt’s a service that will be useful for a variety of applications, like gaming, graphical rendering and machine learning. The GPUs will be available for all of Amazon’s instance types, once they launch officially in the future. Right now, the amount of vRAM that an instance needs determines which of Amazon’s existing GPU-attached instances customers have to use. “Developers will love having slices of GPU, instead of paying for it all the time,” IDC analyst Al Hilwa said. \nIt’s similar to functionality that Google announced earlier this month, which will let companies attach GPUs to any of the compute instances running in its cloud. Amazon’s OpenGL library will automatically detect and use Elastic GPUs, which will be a boon to developers. Amazon \nA pricing chart shows the different pricing available for Amazon's new Lightsail VPS service. \nLightsail will allow people to easily spin up a virtual private server on AWS without having to understand how to start up a compute instance, connect it to storage, handle networking and more. Instead, users make a few clicks to select what they want the server to do, pick out its hardware capabilities and give it a name. \nLightsail servers start at $5 per month, which gets users 512MB of memory, 1 vCPU, 20GB of SSD storage, and 1TB of data transfer. Users can go all the way up to $80 per month, with 8GB of memory, 2 vCPUs, 80GB of SSD, and 5TB of data transfer. \nJassy said users that want to then take advantage of additional AWS services will be able to go “under the hood” with a Lightsail instance and connect with other AWS services. \nOn top of all that, Amazon also announced refreshes to a host of different instance types that it already has available. New R4 instances are an upgrade to Amazon’s memory-focused R3 instances. They sport up to 488GB of DDR4 memory and up to 64 vCPUs. That’s twice the memory available with the previous instances, and twice the number of virtual processors. \nAmazon’s burstable T2 instances got new t2.xlarge and t2.2xlarge types , which provide twice and four times the number of virtual CPUs and memory compared to the t2.large instance type, respectively. \nThe high-I/O I3 instance type, which will be available in the future, will support configurations with up to 488GB of memory, 3.3 million IOPS, 15.2TB of NVMe SSD storage, and 64 vCPUs. On top of all that, the forthcoming compute-intensive C4 instances will support up to 72 vCPUs and 144GB of memory. \nAll these infrastructure revisions are part of Amazon’s announcements at its Re:Invent conference. The company also announced a new instance type that lets users access field-programmable gate arrays to help accelerate particular applications.   Related:",

      "text": "Blog This \nLAS VEGAS , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AWS re:Invent 2016, – NGCodec® ( Sunnyvale, CA ), a pioneering company focused on FPGA-based H.265/HEVC video codec development, today announced that it will use the new Amazon EC2 F1 instance in the development of RealityCodec ™ for hardware-accelerated AWS Cloud-based video encoding and VR / AR processing. \nAWS customers will be able to buy RealityCodec when it becomes available in the AWS Marketplace and run it on Amazon EC2 F1, offering ultra-high-performance video compression (at up to 4K resolution) and ultra-low sub-frame latency cloud-based VR and AR. By running the compute function in the cloud, customers can send only the graphics pixels in the form of a video feed to the HMD (Head Mounted Display), achieving higher performance, lower cost, and longer battery life for the consumer VR/AR hardware. \nNGCodec's RealityCodec technology runs on NGCodec AMI, which runs on Amazon EC2 F1 in the cloud, presenting significant advantages compared to traditional software encoding, including: Massive acceleration and efficiency compared to traditional CPU/GPU instances Higher-quality video for live encoding Lower running costs and flexibility / upgradability, just like traditional software \n\"AWS is breaking ground as the first public cloud to add FPGA-enabled instances with Amazon EC2 F1, which offers significant acceleration over CPU and GPU instance types,\" said Oliver Gunasekara , CEO & co-founder, NGCodec Inc. \"Many large media workflows, including on-demand and live streaming content, are moving to the AWS Cloud. These can now have all the benefits of FPGA acceleration in the AWS ecosystem.\" \nNGCodec will demonstrate using cloud-based FPGA acceleration for live H.265/HEVC video encoding on December 1, 2016 11am at the AWS re:Invent 2016 event in Las Vegas, Nevada . (CMP317 Session) \nAbout NGCodec \nNGCodec® has been in passionate pursuit of next generation video compression since 2012. With the support of investors including Xilinx and NSF, NGCodec's agile startup team has created RealityCodec™, a compressor-decompressor technology optimized for ultra-low latency, high-quality applications. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California , NGCodec licenses its H.265/HEVC video codec silicon intellectual property (IP) to semiconductor and equipment manufacturers around the World.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy speaks at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on November 30, 2016. Credit: Blair Hanley Frank 2016 State of The Cloud \nAmazon Web Services continued to push its infrastructure offering forward on Wednesday with the launch of upgrades to its existing instance types and new tools for simplifying and accelerating computation tasks in its public cloud. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy unveiled a new Elastic GPUs feature for the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) that will let developers add flexible acceleration using parallel processing for their applications. \nOn top of that, Amazon launched a new Lightsail service that’s aimed at giving customers an easy way to spin up a straightforward virtual private server without having to orchestrate a fleet of different AWS services. Finally, the company also unveiled upgrades to its burstable, memory intensive, high I/O, and compute intensive instances. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: How to build a private cloud \nAll of these announcements are aimed at helping Amazon maintain its leading position in the infrastructure-as-a-service market. The company has positioned its IaaS offering as foundational to its cloud platform. \nThe Elastic GPU service will let developers attach GPUs to different EC2 instances, so they can get the graphical acceleration they need without having to pay for specific, GPU-accelerated instances. When users first spin up an instance, they’ll be able to attach up to 8GiB of GPU vRAM. If they need to change the amount of vRAM available, developers will be able to shut down, modify and then spin up the instance again. \nIt’s a service that will be useful for a variety of applications, like gaming, graphical rendering and machine learning. The GPUs will be available for all of Amazon’s instance types, once they launch officially in the future. Right now, the amount of vRAM that an instance needs determines which of Amazon’s existing GPU-attached instances customers have to use. \n“Developers will love having slices of GPU, instead of paying for it all the time,” IDC Program Director Al Hilwa said in an email. \nIt’s similar to functionality that Google announced earlier this month, which will let companies attach GPUs to any of the compute instances running in its cloud. Amazon’s OpenGL library will automatically detect and use Elastic GPUs, which will be a boon to developers. Amazon \nA pricing chart shows the different pricing available for Amazon's new Lightsail VPS service. \nLightsail will allow people to easily spin up a virtual private server on AWS without having to understand how to start up a compute instance, connect it to storage, handle networking and more. Instead, users make a few clicks to select what they want the server to do, pick out its hardware capabilities and give it a name. \nLightsail servers start at $5 per month, which gets users 512MB of memory, 1 vCPU, 20GB of SSD storage, at 1TB of data transfer. Users can go all the way up to $80 per month, with 8 GB of memory, 2 vCPUs, 80GB of SSD, and 5TB of data transfer. \nJassy said users that want to then take advantage of additional AWS services will be able to go “under the hood” with a Lightsail instance and connect with other AWS services. \nOn top of all that, Amazon also announced refreshes to a host of different instance types that it already has available. New R4 instances are an upgrade to Amazon’s memory-focused R3 instances. They sport up to 488GiB of DDR4 memory and up to 64 vCPUs. That’s twice the memory available with the previous instances, and twice the number of virtual processors. \nAmazon’s burstable T2 instances got new t2.xlarge and t2.2xlarge types , which provide twice and four times the number of virtual CPUs and memory compared to the t2.large instance type, respectively. \nThe high I/O I3 instance type, which will be available in the future, will support configurations with up to 488GiB of memory, 3.3 million IOPS, 15.2TB of NVMe SSD storage and 64 vCPUs. On top of all that, the forthcoming compute-intensive C4 instances will support up to 72 vCPUs and 144GiB of memory. \nAll of these infrastructure revisions are part of Amazon’s announcements at its Re:Invent conference. The company also announced a new instance type that lets users access field-programmable gate arrays to help accelerate particular applications.

      "text": "6 Hours Ago | 06:57 \nThe power of Amazon Echo is no longer just for your home. \nDevelopers building on top of Amazon Web Services can now use Alexa, the voice-controlled intelligence system that runs the Echo home assistant, inside their applications, the Seattle-based company said on Wednesday at the annual AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. \nIt's called Lex, and the idea is to bring natural language controls to any app, whether it's for booking a flight, ordering food or, more importantly, the ability to ask questions and follow-ups in a conversational manner. The preview is available starting Wednesday. \n\"There are very few natural language understanding and speech recognition applications and platforms that get more everyday usage than what Alexa and the Echo get,\" said AWS CEO Andy Jassy, in an interview with CNBC. \"W hat a lot of customers want when they build these conversational applications is they want the technology that's actually being used over and over again that they see every day.\" \nAs more computing moves from servers in company closets and basements to data centers owned by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM, businesses are able to take advantage of more sophisticated technologies in their own services. Machine learning and artificial intelligence is perhaps the best example of what's coming. show chapters Friday, 4 Nov 2016 | 2:43 PM ET | 00:53 \nAmazon has two decades of experience recommending items to its customers on the retail side and building formulas that show what a buyer may like given past purchases. That eventually evolved into voice and the Echo, which has sold millions of units, and the technology is now available within AWS. \nIBM is promoting its Watson AI platform as part of its cloud-computing offering. CEO Ginny Rometty told CNBC last month that Watson will reach more than 1 billion consumers by the end of next year. And Google's Cloud has a software tool called TensorFlow, an open source offering that allows developers to embed machine learning in their apps and services. \nAmazon said that Capital One Financial , healthcare provider Ohio Health and software developers HubSpot and Twilio are using Lex for things like customer support and conversational bots. \n— CNBC's Deirdre Bosa contributed to this report.

      "text": "  13:39 PM EST AWS Announces Three New Amazon AI Services Today at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced three Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that make it easy for any developer to build apps that can understand natural language, turn text into lifelike speech, have conversations using voice or text, analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition are based on the same proven, highly scalable Amazon technology built by the thousands of deep learning and machine learning experts across the company. Amazon AI services all provide high-quality, high-accuracy AI capabilities that are scalable and cost-effective. Amazon AI services are fully managed services so there are no deep learning algorithms to build, no machine learning models to train, and no up-front commitments or infrastructure investments required. This frees developers to focus on defining and building an entirely new generation of apps that can see, hear, speak, understand, and interact with the world around them. To learn more about Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, or Amazon Rekognition, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai \nToday at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company ( NASDAQ: AMZN ), announced three Artificial Intelligence (AI) services that make it easy for any developer to build apps that can understand natural language, turn text into lifelike speech, have conversations using voice or text, analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition are based on the same proven, highly scalable Amazon technology built by the thousands of deep learning and machine learning experts across the company. Amazon AI services all provide high-quality, high-accuracy AI capabilities that are scalable and cost-effective. Amazon AI services are fully managed services so there are no deep learning algorithms to build, no machine learning models to train, and no up-front commitments or infrastructure investments required. This frees developers to focus on defining and building an entirely new generation of apps that can see, hear, speak, understand, and interact with the world around them. To learn more about Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, or Amazon Rekognition, visit: https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai \nUntil now, very few developers have been able to build, deploy, and broadly scale apps with AI capabilities because doing so required access to vast amounts of data, and specialized expertise in machine learning and neural networks. Effectively applying AI involves extensive manual effort to develop and tune many different types of machine learning and deep learning algorithms (e.g. automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, image classification), collect and clean the training data, and train and tune the machine learning models. And this process must be repeated for every object, face, voice, and language feature in an application. Amazon AI services eliminate all of this heavy lifting, making AI broadly accessible to all app developers by offering Amazon’s powerful and proven deep learning algorithms and technologies as fully managed services that any developer can access through an API call or a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Amazon AI services make the full power of Amazon’s natural language understanding, speech recognition, text-to-speech, and image analysis technologies available at any scale, for any app, on any device, anywhere. \n“The combination of better algorithms and broad access to massive amounts of data and cost-effective computing power provided by the cloud is making AI a reality for application developers. AWS is home to some of the most innovative and creative AI applications in use today,” said Raju Gulabani, VP, Databases, Analytics, and AI, AWS. “Thousands of machine learning and deep learning experts across Amazon have been developing AI technologies for years to predict what customers might like to read, to drive efficiencies in our fulfillment centers through robotics and computer vision technologies, and to give customers our AI-powered virtual assistant, Alexa. Now, we are making the technology underlying these innovations available to any developer in the form of three fully managed Amazon AI services that are easy to use, powerful, and cost effective. We are excited to see how customers use Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition to build a new generation of apps that have human-like intelligence and can see, hear, speak, and interact with people and their environments.” \nIntelligent conversations with Amazon Lex \nAmazon Lex is a new service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text that is built on the same automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology and natural language understanding (NLU) that powers Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex makes it easy to bring sophisticated, natural language capabilities to virtually any app. Developers can build and test bots (conversational apps that perform automated tasks like checking the weather or booking flights) directly from the AWS Management Console by typing in a few sample phrases (e.g., “find a flight,” or “book a flight”) along with instructions for getting the required parameters to complete task (e.g., travel date and destination) and the corresponding clarifying questions to ask the user (e.g., “when do you want to travel?” and “where do you want to go?”). Amazon Lex takes care of the rest, building the language model and asking the follow-up questions needed to complete the task. Because Amazon Lex is integrated with AWS Lambda, developers can configure Amazon Lex to invoke the appropriate backend service (e.g., the flight booking service) through an AWS Lambda function. Developers can also use pre-built enterprise connectors that execute AWS Lambda functions to answer questions like “what are my top 10 accounts in Salesforce.com,” by fetching data from enterprise systems like Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Marketo, Zendesk, QuickBooks and HubSpot. \nBots built using Amazon Lex can be used anywhere: from web applications, to chat and messenger apps like Slack and Facebook Messenger, or through voice in apps on mobile or connected devices. Amazon Lex handles the authentication required by different platforms and simplifies the user interface design by not requiring developers to write custom code for each platform. Moreover, developers do not have to worry about scaling their infrastructure as Amazon Lex scales automatically as traffic to a bot increases, and developers pay only for the calls made to the Amazon Lex API. \nCapital One offers a broad spectrum of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses, and commercial clients through a variety of channels. “As a heavy user of AWS, Amazon Lex’s seamless integration with other AWS services like AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB is really appealing,” said Firoze Lafeer, Chief Technology Officer, Capital One Labs, Capital One. “A highly scalable solution, Amazon Lex also offers potential to speed time to market for a new generation of voice and text interactions, such as our recently launched Capital One skill for Alexa.” \nOhioHealth is a nationally recognized healthcare organization with a network of 11+ hospitals in 47 counties. “We are excited about utilizing evolving speech recognition and natural language processing technology to enhance the lives of our customers. Amazon Lex represents a great opportunity for us to deliver a new experience to our patients,” said Michael Krouse, Senior Vice President Operational Support and Chief Information Officer, OhioHealth. “Everything we do at OhioHealth is ultimately about providing the right care to our patients at the right time and in the right place. Amazon Lex’s next generation technology and the innovative applications we are developing while using it will help provide an enhanced customer experience. We are just scratching the surface of what is possible.” \nHubSpot is a marketing and sales software leader. “HubSpot's GrowthBot is an all-in-one chatbot which helps marketers and sales people be more productive by providing access to relevant data and services using a conversational interface. With GrowthBot, marketers can get help creating content, researching competitors, and monitoring their analytics. Through Amazon Lex, we’re adding sophisticated natural language processing capabilities that helps GrowthBot provide a more intuitive UI for our users,” said Dharmesh Shah, Chief Technology Officer and Founder, HubSpot. “Amazon Lex lets us take advantage of advanced AI and machine learning without having to code the algorithms ourselves.” \nTwilio helps businesses make communications relevant and contextual by making it possible to easily embed real-time communication and authentication capabilities directly into software applications. “Developers and businesses use Twilio to build apps that can communicate with customers in virtually every corner of the world,” said Benjamin Stein, Director of Messaging Products, Twilio. “Amazon Lex will provide developers with an easy-to-use modular architecture and comprehensive APIs to enable building and deploying conversational bots on mobile platforms. We look forward to seeing what our customers build using Twilio and Amazon Lex.” \nIntelligent Speech with Amazon Polly \nAmazon Polly makes it easy for developers to add natural-sounding speech capabilities to existing applications like newsreaders and e-learning platforms, or create entirely new categories of speech-enabled products – from mobile apps to devices and appliances. Amazon Polly is easy to use; developers can send text to Amazon Polly using the SDK or from within the AWS Management Console and Polly immediately returns an audio stream that can be played directly or stored in a standard audio file format. With 47 lifelike voices and support for 24 languages, developers can choose from both male and female voices with a variety of accents to make applications for users around the globe. And Amazon Polly’s fluid pronunciation of text content means applications deliver high-quality voice output across a wide variety of text formats. Amazon Polly is scalable, returning high-quality speech fast, even when converting large volumes of text to speech. With Amazon Polly, developers pay only for the text they convert, and they can cache generated speech and replay it as many times as they like with no restrictions. \nThe Washington Post is a Pulitzer Prize-winning media and technology company that publishes more than 1200 stories a day. “We’ve long been interested in providing audio versions of our stories, but have found that existing text-to-speech solutions are not cost-effective for the speech quality they offer,” said Joseph Price, Senior Product Manager, The Washington Post. “With the arrival of Amazon Polly and its high-quality voices, we look forward to offering readers more rich and versatile ways to experience our content.” \nGoAnimate is a cloud-based, animated video creation platform, designed to allow business people with no background in animation to quickly and easily create animated videos. “Amazon Polly gives GoAnimate users the ability to immediately give voice to the characters they animate using our platform. This is especially helpful in scenarios where live voiceover is either resource or time prohibitive, such as when developing a video in many languages, or within pre-production to speed the approval process,” said Alvin Hung, CEO and Founder, GoAnimate. “The speech from Amazon Polly is integrated seamlessly with our rich set of pre-animated assets, which reinforces GoAnimate’s ease of use and affords our customers both efficiency and speed to market.” \nIntelligent Image Analysis with Amazon Rekognition \nAmazon Rekognition enables developers to quickly and easily build applications that analyze images, and recognize faces, objects, and scenes. Amazon Rekognition uses deep learning technologies to automatically identify objects and scenes, such as vehicles, pets, or furniture, and provides a confidence score that lets developers tag images so that application users can search for specific images using key words. Amazon Rekognition can locate faces within images and detect attributes, such as whether or not the face is smiling or the eyes are open. Amazon Rekognition also supports advanced facial analysis functionalities such as face comparison and facial search. Using Rekognition, developers can build an application that measures the likelihood that faces in two images are of the same person, thereby being able to verify a user against a reference photo in near real-time. Similarly, developers can create collections of millions of faces (detected in images) and can search for a face similar to their reference image in the collection. Amazon Rekognition removes the complexity and overhead required to develop and manage expensive image processing pipelines by making comprehensive image classification, detection, and management capabilities available in a simple, cost-effective, and reliable AWS service. There are no upfront costs for Amazon Rekognition, developers pay only for the images they analyze and the facial feature vectors they store. \nRedfin is a full-service brokerage that uses modern technology to help people buy and sell houses. “Redfin users love to browse images of properties on our site and mobile apps, and we want to make it easier for our users to sift through hundreds of millions of listing and images,” says Yong Huang, Director of Big Data & Analytics, Redfin. “Amazon Rekognition generates a rich set of tags directly from images of properties. This makes it relatively simple to build a smart search feature that helps customers discover houses based on their specific needs, such as a fireplace, yard, or swimming pool. And since Rekognition accepts Amazon S3 URLs, it is a huge time-saver to detect objects, scenes, and faces without having to move images around.” \nSmugMug is a safe and beautiful home for photos that stores billions of beautiful photos for millions of amazing customers every day. “SmugMug customers want to spend their time making more memories, not manually managing their photo collection,” said Don MacAskill, Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Geek, SmugMug. “Amazon Rekognition will allow us to automatically identify the content in customers’ photos, unlocking a host of features that will allow them and their visitors to have more time to focus on enjoying life and celebrating their photos.” \nDeep Learning and AI on AWS \nAmazon Polly is available today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Dublin) Regions, and will expand to additional Regions in the coming months. Amazon Rekognition is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Dublin) Regions, and will expand to additional Regions in the coming months. Customers can sign up for the Amazon Lex preview starting today. \nIn addition to these services, AWS recently announced it is investing significantly in MXNet, an open source distributed deep learning framework, initially developed by Carnegie Mellon University and other top universities, by contributing code and improving the developer experience. MXNet will enable machine learning scientists to build scalable deep learning models that can significantly reduce the training time for their applications. For more information on AWS support for MXNet, visit: http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/11/mxnet-default-framework-deep-learning-aws.html . \nAWS also makes it easy for developers to run their own deep learning and machine learning workloads to build their own AI platform on top of AWS. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), with its broad set of instance types and GPUs with large amounts of memory, is ideal for deep learning training. P2 instances, launched in September 2016, were designed for large-scale machine learning and deep learning with up to 8 NVIDIA Tesla K80 Accelerators, each running a pair of NVIDIDA GK210 GPUs that have 12 GiB of memory and 2,496 parallel processing cores. And, customers can make use of AWS’s Deep Learning AMI, which contains six pre-configured and pre-tested deep learning frameworks including all dependencies, Nvidia drivers, and data science tools like Jupyter and Anaconda. In addition, AWS CloudFormation templates are available for training deep neural networks at scale in just a few clicks. \nAbout Amazon Web Services \nFor 10 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 70 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, analytics, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and enterprise applications from 38 Availability Zones (AZs) across 14 geographic regions in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and India.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Amazon launches AWS Greengrass for IoT Amazon Web Services has launched AWS Greengrass to combat the challenges faced by devices at the edge in the new Internet of Things world. | Topic: Internet of Things Image: AWS \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has unveiled Greengrass, allowing local compute, messaging, and data caching for the Internet of Things (IoT). \nLaunching the service at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas on Wednesday, AWS CEO Andy Jassy said Greengrass will allow users to run IoT applications across the AWS cloud and local devices using AWS Lambda and AWS IoT. \n\"Device manufacturers and chipmakers will be able to build Greengrass into devices from the get go,\" Jassy explained. \nUsing AWS Lambda, Jassy said Greengrass ensures that IoT devices can respond quickly to local events, operate with intermittent connections, and minimise the cost of transmitting IoT data to the cloud. \nGreengrass is already available in limited preview, with the cloud giant explaining it will allow developers to build IoT solutions that connect different types of devices with the cloud and also each other. \nAccording to AWS, devices that run Linux and support ARM or x86 architectures can host the Greengrass Core, which enables the local execution of AWS Lambda code, messaging, data caching, and security. \nDevices running AWS Greengrass Core then act as a hub that can communicate with other devices that have the AWS IoT Device SDK installed, such as microcontroller based devices or large appliances. \nJassy said AWS Greengrass extends AWS to devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. \nAWS Greengrass Core devices and the AWS IoT Device SDK-enabled devices can be configured to communicate with one another in a Greengrass Group. If the Greengrass Core device loses connection to the cloud, devices in the Greengrass Group can continue to communicate with each other over the local network. For example, AWS said a Greengrass Group may represent one floor of a building, one truck, or one home. \nBy the end of 2016, analyst firm Gartner is expecting around 6.4 billion \"things\" -- devices from toasters and kettles to cars and hospital equipment -- to be connected to the internet . \nThat figure represents a 30 percent rise from 2015, and Gartner expects this figure will grow further to reach 20.8 billion by 2020. \nBy this year, as many as 5.5 million new things will become connected every day. As a result, the growing IoT will support total services spending of $235 billion in 2016, up 22 percent from 2015, the analyst predicted. \nAlso on Wednesday, Jassy announced AWS was giving its customers access to the artificial intelligence that's been powering Amazon products and capabilities for years, unveiling a suite of products as well. \nAWS' first new AI product is Amazon Rekognition is an image recognition and analysis service that can facial recognition on objects and scenes. AWS also launched Amazon Polly, which is a text-to-speech service powered by deep learning. \nThird, Jassy introduced Amazon Lex, which provides natural language understanding and automatic speech recognition, powered by deep learning. \nIt's effectively \"what's inside Alexa,\" Jassy said. \"This will allow you to build all kinds of conversational applications.\" AWS re:Invent 2016",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are down $4.51, or 0.6%, at $758.01, as the company’s “ re:invent ” conference for its Amazon Web Services continues in Las Vegas, with a keynote this morning, at 8 am, Pacific time, from CEO Andy Jassy , and a keynote tomorrow from AWS’s technology guru, Werner Vogels .\nYou can sign up for the live Webcast at the conference site .\nRoss Macmillan with RBC Capital Markets is at the show and today offers up his impressions, including that “the migration of workloads to public cloud continues at a torrid pace,” based on his chats with customers at the show.\nLast year GE made waves when it stated it would move 60% of its corporate workloads to AWS. This year we heard from customers such as Ticketmaster and the University of Arizona that both have an all-cloud strategy and believe they will have made the full migration in only 2-3 years from now. It is becoming clear that the corporate data center is becoming a thing of the past for a number of forward-thinking customers. Cost savings remain a key driver, but the agility and pace of innovation driven by access to the myriad of AWS services are becoming more important drivers of adoption.\nMacmillan also notes Amazon’s focus on databases :\nWe believe AWS will announce additional database services this year, potentially extending Aurora (or a similar service) to other open source databases (such as Postgres) in order to better attack enterprise workloads. We note that Postgres is better suited for the migration of mission critical database workloads, due to strength in data integrity, stored procedures and complex database designs and schemas. We expect the competitive narrative with major commercial database providers, especially Oracle and Microsoft, to intensify.\nIn the area of big data , Amazon is poised to benefit from the lack of talent to do sorting and sift of data:\nWe attended a session on the State of the Union of Big Data at AWS and were reminded of the incredibly rich array of services on offer. Moreover, with a lack of data science talent in the market, we believe customers are turning to cloud providers to help them with big data problems given the managed service capabilities AWS and others can provide.",

      "text": "Reddit \nSeagate has introduced a new portable hard drive called Duet, one that features Amazon branding on the case and supports syncing with Amazon Drive, the company’s cloud storage service. The drive itself has a 1TB capacity, and it backs up whatever data you put on it to Amazon Drive, which can then be accessed using its related mobile app. Not an Amazon customer? You’ll get free cloud storage to get you started. \nThe idea here is that a physical hard drive is a great way to store content, giving you immediate offline access and making it easier to control who has access to the data itself. However, accessing that data when you’re not physically home — or if you’re on something like a tablet — is tricky. That’s where the cloud storage comes in. \nSeagate Duet gives buyers a free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage for backing up their data to the cloud. If you already have an Amazon account, you’ll log in with your Amazon credentials and then drag and drop files onto the Duet hard drive. From there, the content will be synced to the cloud \nFiles located on a smartphone or tablet, meanwhile, can be backed up using the Amazon Drive mobile app, which can also be used to access those files later on. According to Seagate, the mobile app will provide access to videos and photos that have been saved to the Duet drive. \nYou can pre-order the Seagate Duet hard drive starting today from Amazon for $99.99 USD. As mentioned, the drive includes a year’s access to unlimited Amazon Drive storage (if you’re new to Amazon Drive, that is), which itself would ordinarily cost $59.99 USD. Story Timeline",

      "text": "up vote -1 down vote favorite \nI have a small web site that's deployed on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk. It has a really small database. The entire dataset is less than 100MB, and the database is accessed a few times every minute. \nI'm using an Aurora RDS database with Multi A-Z, and it's way too expensive. The main reason it's too expensive is that Multi A-Z seems to require large instances. My database would easily fit onto a small instance. With Multi A-Z, I'm being charged for two large instances. I like the idea of having a replica with hot failover, but not at this cost. \nWhat I really want is to use Multi A-Z using a pair of small (or micro) instances rather than a pair of large instances, but (as far as I can tell) this isn't possible. \nIf needed, I could sacrifice the hot failover, though I'd prefer not to. I'm wondering if it would be ok to spin up an EC2 instance, manually install MySQL on it, and use that, but that seems like it might be unreliable. \nWhat are my best options? (I'd prefer to use a SQL database, so I'd like to avoid DynamoDB.)",

      "text": "It appears that Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) has finally decided to come down hard on counterfeits in a bid to clean up its marketplace.\nThe retail giant has reportedly intensified its fight against counterfeits and has made this a major goal for 2017.\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Amazon is in the process of developing teams in the U.S. and Europe that will work with major brands to put a bar on the registry of fake products on its website.\nA Vicious Cycle \nSo far, the brands selling on the platform would notify Amazon of the presence of a counterfeit product. Though the process was a long drawn one, Amazon was quick to respond and suspended the counterfeiters immediately.\nBut that didn’t help matters much as new accounts could be opened quickly, taking advantage of Amazon’s simple registration procedure. Alibaba ( BABA - Free Report ) and eBay ( EBAY - Free Report ) are also facing similar challenges.\nThe New Registration Process \nIt appears that Amazon has realized the fact that its registration method is overly flexible. The company is reportedly making the method stricter by making it mandatory for marketplace merchants to prove that they have the brand’s approval to sell them online.\nThe report also stated that the initiative will try and cover thousand of companies by 2017 including even those who do not sell on Amazon. The company has already begun experimenting with the new system with Nike and a few others.\nRecently, Amazon teamed up with one of its sellers to sue three people for selling counterfeits on its site. The company has also sued a counterfeit racket based on similar allegations.\nThe retail giant recently said in a statement that “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” and that it was “aggressively pursuing bad actors.”\nAMAZON.COM INC Price \nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote \nTo Conclude \nThe growth of the e-commerce industry, with consumers increasingly buying things online, is a dynamic going in favor of Amazon. While the big brands may build their own online stores over time, a platform like Amazon allows discovery of new buyers.\nSmaller players are far more dependent on Amazon as they don’t have the resources to invest in technology and fulfillment to generate the kind of reach that Amazon can deliver. Amazon’s platform is currently being used by more than 2 million independent sellers.\nMoreover, the market is in the early growth phase (considering opportunities in international markets), so the company’s high growth rates are likely to be sustained over the next few years.\nBut that should not make Amazon overly confident about its online business. When brands hit by counterfeits lose sales and potential customers, the ripple effects will be felt by Amazon as well and earn it a bad name.\nNotably, the National Football League and Major League Baseball who were planning to sell merchandise on Amazon pulled out fearing Amazon’s lack of control over fakes. So an initiative like this was necessary before things went out of control..\nZacks Rank & Share Price Movement   \nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . \nShares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock generated a return of 12.82% compared with the Zacks Electronic Commerce Market gain of 9.94%.\nStock to Consider \nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA - Free Report ) , sporting a Zacks Rank #1. For the current year, the consensus estimate for NVIDIA has increased 33.3% in the past 30 days.\nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit \nHow you like would to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

      "title": "This 'Snowmobile' truck seems like a joke, but it's actually Amazon's newest product",
      "text": "Amazon/Business Insider \nOn Wednesday, Amazon Web Service CEO Andy Jassy had a big finish to his multi-hour keynote speech given at the AWS customer conference taking place this week in Las Vegas.\nHe had someone drive a truck onto the stage, pulling a giant container he called the \"Snowmobile.\"\nThe audience laughed and cheered. It looked like a gag, but it wasn't.\nAmazon/Business Insider This is real product from AWS , and easily the biggest (if you are measuring in feet) product announcement of the day.\nThe story of the Snowmobile basically started a year ago. Now that every business, from startups to huge companies, are rushing to the cloud as fast as they can, Amazon Web Services has turned its attention to a tricky problem.\nHow do you physically get all the data stored in a company 's massive data center into Amazon's cloud?\nLast year, it announced a solution it called Snowball, a handheld box about the size of a desktop PC. A company rents it from Amazon, stuffs it with a petabyte of data and ships it back to Amazon to unload. A petabyte is one million gigabytes and it used to be considered an insane amount of data. In this way, a company could transfer a petabyte per week into Amazon's cloud, and eventually unplug their data center altogether if they wanted to. \nJassy didn't think the Snowball would be much of a hit. He even \"chastised\" the Snowball team for manufacturing too many of them, he admitted on stage.\nBut he was wrong, big time. The team had to almost instantly \"go back and order 10 times number of Snowballs we have. I can’t believe how much data we’ve transferred with Snowball.\"\nIt became such a thing, that IT folks started talking selfies with their Snowballs and sending them to Amazon.\nAmazon/Business Insider \nThese days, there are companies that store so much more data, they measure it in exabytes. Each exabyte is one billion gigabytes.\nUsing conventional means of transferring that data, \"It will take you 26 years to move an exabyte to the cloud,\" Jassy said.\nEnter the Snowmobile. \"With 10 Snowmobiles it take six months\" to move that data to the cloud.\nSo for companies sitting on mind-boggling amounts of data, Amazon will literally drive a Snowmobile to their data centers, load it up, and haul to back to Amazon.\nAs for the popular Snowball, Amazon has upgraded it with more capacity, compute power, and other things because folks have come up with all kinds of innovate things they want to do with it besides use it to ship data to AWS.\nHere's another view of the Snowmobile.\nAmazon/Business Insider \nNOW WATCH: Why almost every pair of jeans has a zipper that says ‘YKK’ \n",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray \nAmazon.com ’s ( AMZN ) cloud computing conference in Las Vegas today offered up a Vegas-worthy stunt, a tractor-trailer truck that rolled up on stage, to much applause.\nAndy Jassy , CEO of the company’s cloud computing service, brought the truck, called “ Snowmobile ,” on stage toward the end of his keynote address. Snowmobile is an offering for companies that need to move “Exabytes” of data, he said, which turned out to be more companies than one might think.\nThe trunk is a follow-up to a data appliance that Amazon already offers called “ Snowball .”\nSnowball is a stand-alone computer that companies can take into the field to collect data, which later gets uploaded to their Amazon AWS account. Snowmobile is for companies that want to move huge amounts of data. Snowmobile drives to a customer location, plugs into the data center computes of the customer via a fiber-optic cable, and carts the data back to Amazon’s AWS facilities.\n\n\nAmazon also updated its Snowball product with a new version called “Edge,” which adds to the existing data storage capacity with on-board processing of data, so not everything needs to be immediately uploaded to AWS before it can be used.\n\nThe conference continues tomorrow with a keynote by Amazon’s colorful technical guru, Werner Vogels , at 8:30 am, Pacific time, 11:30, Eastern, and will be broadcast live on the conference site . You can check out the full schedule on the conference Web site .\nRecordings of the events after they’re broadcasted are being posted to a section of the site , in case you want to see something you missed.\nAmazon shares today are down $9.06, or 1%, at $753.46.",

      "title": "Nutanix’s CEO: What Would an Amazon Partnership Look Like?",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of enterprise infrastructure equipment maker Nutanix ( NTNX ), which went public September 30th, are down $1.37, or 4%, at $32.72, despite the company yesterday beating fiscal Q1 expectations, and forecasting this quarter higher, too, results that pleased analysts but not enough to please traders.\nA big focus on the conference call following the report were the two areas where the company said it had done especially well, those being with the U.S. federal business, and in its sales of software to OEM systems manufactures, especially Dell , where it has a longstanding partnership.\nI spoke with CEO Dheeraj Pandey a short while ago by phone. I had first talked with Pandey in his San Jose offices in mid-2014 , when Nutanix was a privately backed startup. Pandey is always pleasantly outspoken. Back then, he told me that there had been “$200 million in venture money dedicated to killing Nutanix.”\nHis thoughts during today’s conversations were more philosophical than back then. He spoke about the company’s goal to merge public cloud computing with on-premise computing. Pandey regards his firm as more than a mere box-maker , like Pure Storage ( PSTG ) or NetApp ( NTAP ). Instead, it is designing the “ operating system ” to span from an enterprise’s facilities to public cloud installations running in Amazon.com ( AMZN ) AWS, with the company’s believing that “hybrid” cloud environments will dominate for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, Nutanix right now sells mostly to enterprise customers, including those deals with Dell. Less than 10% of revenue has been to service providers. And it doesn’t have a deal with Amazon, which I suggested to him means the company’s not selling as much to one half of the public-private cloud divide.\nBut Pandey points out it’s very early in the evolution of public cloud. “Today, there is only one real public cloud company, which is Amazon,” he observes. “[ Microsoft ’s ( MSFT )] Azure is not at that scale yet, and [ Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL )] Google is doing a lot of marketing. This is a five- to ten-year journey till we know who real the real providers are.”\nIn the same vein, he notes that Amazon alone can’t address the needs of the “ Fortune 5,000 ” companies that make up 80% of global IT spending.\nBut, I pressed, is it possible for him to do a partnership with Amazon? \nPandey replied, “That question is quite nuanced — What would a win-win look like?”\nHe continued that it’s not clear much of AWS is actually used by customers:\nThese are all things we will explore in the future. I don’t know all the details of the VMware/AWS deal , but basically, it’s [AWS] mostly Amazon renting hardware to VMware, and it’s quite topical at best. You have to really go deeper into using Amazon’s capabilities. There are a ton of capabilities within the operating system that I’m not sure VMware is going to use as part of this colocation or hosting they are offering. What about networks and security? Are you able, if you have an Amazon ID, to use that Amazon ID across both sides, both public and on-premise? \nThere are no ratings changes on the Street today, that I can see, but some price target increases, here and there. In addition to lots of praise for the company’s work, the biggest concern for analysts is the current reliance on the Dell partnership , along with quibbles about stock valuation:\nRichard Kugele, Needham & Co .: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $36 price target. “In its first quarter as a public company, Nutanix did not disappoint, materially exceeding topline revenue, billings and EPS loss estimates. Further, NTNX raised next quarter’s guidance vs. consensus, demonstrating continued momentum. In our view, the only thing the company potentially did wrong was report earnings as a public company, as it appears to be in vogue to find some real or imagined fault with next-gen tech companies regardless of how well they are actually executing. We strongly contest this view, as we believe these stocks ultimately revert to growth and fundamentals over time.”\nNepal Chokshi, Maxim Group : Reiterates a Buy rating, and raises his price target to $42 from $40. “October quarter results deliver 5th quarter in a row of y/y improving sales productivity to a phenomenal level, in our view […] The only potential issue investors can take with the earnings report in our view is the rise in DSOs, which based on our AR/billings DSO metric rose 21 days y/y and 6 days q/q. Management noted that billings linearity was similar to the past two fiscal first quarters, but that linearity of shipments did not mimic billings as a result of not managing the supplier relationships crisply towards the end of the quarter.\nMark Murphy, J.P. Morgan : Reiterates a Neutral rating, and raises his price target to $35 from $33. “In its first quarter as a public company, Nutanix reported impressive results with an accelerating revenue profile that beat expectations across all metrics and provided guidance above consensus […] We are very encouraged by the results and we expect Nutanix to continue to upend the IT infrastructure playbook, however, we think the risk/reward is fairly balanced for now at current price levels.”\nMehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna : Reiterates a Neutral rating, and raises his price target to $29 from $24. “We came away encouraged with NTNX’s strong October-quarter top-line results and January-quarter guide – as well as promising cash flow dynamics; however, we remain Neutral at current levels given the confluence of appropriate valuation, potential risk from an intensifying competitive environment and the prospect of a de-emphasized Dell OEM relationship combined with NTNX’s aggressive opex strategy.”\nSimon Leopold, Raymond James : Reiterates a Market Perform rating. “Although bookings were not disclosed, management noted that software content now makes up 15% of bookings, up from 9% in the year ago quarter, implying that OEM contributions to bookings are likely up materially as well given that 66% of OEM bookings are software. Management has stated in the past that despite the growing OEM contribution to bookings, it expects OEM revenue will remain less than 20% of total sales. Investors will likely remain cautious however as the continually increasing contributions to bookings from one its own competitors will likely remain a point of focus.”",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of Amazon.com ( AMZN ) are down $4.51, or 0.6%, at $758.01, as the company’s “ re:invent ” conference for its Amazon Web Services continues in Las Vegas, with a keynote this morning, at 8 am, Pacific time, from CEO Andy Jassy , and a keynote tomorrow from AWS’s technology guru, Werner Vogels .\nYou can sign up for the live Webcast at the conference site .\nRoss Macmillan with RBC Capital Markets is at the show and today offers up his impressions, including that “the migration of workloads to public cloud continues at a torrid pace,” based on his chats with customers at the show.\nLast year GE made waves when it stated it would move 60% of its corporate workloads to AWS. This year we heard from customers such as Ticketmaster and the University of Arizona that both have an all-cloud strategy and believe they will have made the full migration in only 2-3 years from now. It is becoming clear that the corporate data center is becoming a thing of the past for a number of forward-thinking customers. Cost savings remain a key driver, but the agility and pace of innovation driven by access to the myriad of AWS services are becoming more important drivers of adoption. \nMacmillan also notes Amazon’s focus on databases :\nWe believe AWS will announce additional database services this year, potentially extending Aurora (or a similar service) to other open source databases (such as Postgres) in order to better attack enterprise workloads. We note that Postgres is better suited for the migration of mission critical database workloads, due to strength in data integrity, stored procedures and complex database designs and schemas. We expect the competitive narrative with major commercial database providers, especially Oracle and Microsoft, to intensify. \nIn the area of big data , Amazon is poised to benefit from the lack of talent to do sorting and sift of data:\nWe attended a session on the State of the Union of Big Data at AWS and were reminded of the incredibly rich array of services on offer. Moreover, with a lack of data science talent in the market, we believe customers are turning to cloud providers to help them with big data problems given the managed service capabilities AWS and others can provide.",

      "text": "  14:01 PM EST NGCodec uses Amazon EC2 F1 instances with custom FPGAs running 4k Video Compression \nLAS VEGAS , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AWS re:Invent 2016, – NGCodec® ( Sunnyvale, CA ), a pioneering company focused on FPGA-based H.265/HEVC video codec development, today announced that it will use the new Amazon EC2 F1 instance in the development of RealityCodec ™ for hardware-accelerated AWS Cloud-based video encoding and VR / AR processing. \nAWS customers will be able to buy RealityCodec when it becomes available in the AWS Marketplace and run it on Amazon EC2 F1, offering ultra-high-performance video compression (at up to 4K resolution) and ultra-low sub-frame latency cloud-based VR and AR. By running the compute function in the cloud, customers can send only the graphics pixels in the form of a video feed to the HMD (Head Mounted Display), achieving higher performance, lower cost, and longer battery life for the consumer VR/AR hardware. \nNGCodec's RealityCodec technology runs on NGCodec AMI, which runs on Amazon EC2 F1 in the cloud, presenting significant advantages compared to traditional software encoding, including: Massive acceleration and efficiency compared to traditional CPU/GPU instances Higher-quality video for live encoding Lower running costs and flexibility / upgradability, just like traditional software \n\"AWS is breaking ground as the first public cloud to add FPGA-enabled instances with Amazon EC2 F1, which offers significant acceleration over CPU and GPU instance types,\" said Oliver Gunasekara , CEO & co-founder, NGCodec Inc. \"Many large media workflows, including on-demand and live streaming content, are moving to the AWS Cloud. These can now have all the benefits of FPGA acceleration in the AWS ecosystem.\" \nNGCodec will demonstrate using cloud-based FPGA acceleration for live H.265/HEVC video encoding on December 1, 2016 11am at the AWS re:Invent 2016 event in Las Vegas, Nevada . (CMP317 Session) \nAbout NGCodec \nNGCodec® has been in passionate pursuit of next generation video compression since 2012. With the support of investors including Xilinx and NSF, NGCodec's agile startup team has created RealityCodec™, a compressor-decompressor technology optimized for ultra-low latency, high-quality applications. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California , NGCodec licenses its H.265/HEVC video codec silicon intellectual property (IP) to semiconductor and equipment manufacturers around the World.

      "text": "Amazon.com is developing a premium Echo-like speaker with a screen, a sign the world's largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple.\nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon's existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company's voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced.\nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said.\nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon's new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment.\nAmazon CEO Jeffrey Bezos: Privacy, security debate is 'issue of our age' Hayley Tsukayama Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said Wednesday that his company is wholly aligned with Apple in its fight against government investigators who asked Apple to break its own encryption programs so they could gain access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, terrorists.\n... Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos said Wednesday that his company is wholly aligned with Apple in its fight against government investigators who asked Apple to break its own encryption programs so they could gain access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, terrorists.\n... (Hayley Tsukayama) So-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon's hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014. Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating U.S. sales of more than 5 million units since 2014.\nAmazon's planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Home speaker and Apple Inc.'s interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant.\nThe new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box. The gadget will still respond to verbal commands and spoken questions, just like current Alexa devices. Amazon is also testing a feature that allows users to pin items such as photos on their speaker's screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door, one of the people said.\nAmazon plans to keep selling the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers that are typically stationed in living rooms and bedrooms, one of the people said. The current speakers cost $50, $130 and $180, respectively, while the model with a screen will likely be priced higher, the other person said.\nSome reviewers panned the current Echo for poor audio quality, which is partly due to Amazon designing it to sound better at moderate volume levels, according to one of the people. The new speaker will play high-quality audio at all volume levels, this person said. At least one prototype version of the device places the speakers below and behind the screen, they added.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon's Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tablet-like computer screen known internally as \"Knight.\"\n Amazon.com Inc.",

Post to Facebook Amazon's 'Grand Tour' comes home to England Speaking of homes, thanks to a stupid bet, Jeremy Clarkson's may not survive Episode 3.  //usat.ly/2gLf0yy   Amazon's 'Grand Tour' comes home to England Jayme Deerwester , USA TODAY 3:23 p.m. EST November 30, 2016 Clarkson, Hammond and May have traded their old Surrey hangar for a traveling studio tent. (Photo: Amazon) \nWhen Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May landed at Amazon following their messy 2015 exits from BBC's car-show juggernaut Top Gear , the trio had to strike a balance between reinventing the wheel and giving their fans what they paid to see: three goofy middle-aged men playing with cars. \n\"We had to start from scratch and build a new show,\" Hammond tells USA TODAY. \"But it can't be completely from scratch, because it's us three doing what we do. And that's who we are and what we'll always be. It's familiar. It's us three, cars, attitude and antics.\" \nThe biggest change was taking the entire show on the road with a mobile, tented studio. \n\"When we say The Grand Tour ,\" Clarkson says, \"it really is. There's probably no show on Earth apart from the news that's more global.\" \nNow, after jaunts to California, Jordan, South Africa and Portugal, they've come home to England for their new show's third weekly episode (streaming Thursday, 7:01 p.m. ET/4:01 PT), specifically to Whitby, an old whaling town on Yorkshire's eastern coast. \nAnd while it was good to be back on British soil, they had another reason for returning to the U.K.: settling a bet made in Episode 1. \nDuring a challenge involving hybrid supercars in the Nov. 18 premiere, Clarkson promised Hammond and May, \"If the McLaren isn't the fastest, you two can knock my house down.\" \nAn incredulous Hammond warned him, \"You know we will do that.\" \nWell, it turns out his car wasn't the fastest, and by the looks of the bulldozer coming through his fence in a promo, it's clear they intend to hold him to it. \nSomething else to look forward to in the episode: \"You're in for a surprise,\" Clarkson says of the as-yet-mysterious celebrity segment. \"By the end of Week 3, you'll know what's going on.\" \nRichard Hammond gets up close and personal with hundreds of Italian fans in Episode 3. (Photo: Ellis O'Brian, Amazon) \nAfter working together for more than a decade on one of the planet's most popular shows ( Top Gear aired in more than 200 territories), the trio copped to being fidgety as they waited for the Grand Tour reviews to come in. \n\"You've got to be nervous,\" Hammond admits. \"You've tried as best you can to make something, and then you put it out there for the world to see. You want people to like it. So we were all watching (social media) from behind our sofas.\" \nMay, the most scientifically-inclined of the three, was asked about a fan theory: The longer his hair, the better the season, a corollary established during the golden age of Top Gear , when he could have passed for the guitarist from Led Zeppelin. \n\"You're quite right,\" May agrees. \"I did look like Jimmy Page!\" \nClarkson moans, because May's hair is now shorter. \"Oh no. We're doomed!\" \nJames May, left, during his Jimmy Page years on BBC's 'Top Gear.' (Photo: Ellis O'Brien, BBC Worldwide) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "24 NGCodec uses Amazon EC2 F1 instances with custom FPGAs running 4k Video Compression LAS VEGAS   AWS re:Invent 2016, – NGCodec® (Sunnyvale, CA), a pioneering company focused on FPGA-based H.265/HEVC video codec development, today announced that it will use the new Amazon EC2 F1 instance in the development of RealityCodec ™ for hardware-accelerated AWS Cloud-based video encoding and VR / AR processing.AWS customers will be able to buy RealityCodec when it becomes available in the AWS Marketplace and run it on Amazon EC2 F1, offering ultra-high-performance video compression (at up to 4K resolution) and ultra-low sub-frame latency cloud-based VR and AR. By running the compute function in the cloud, customers can send only the graphics pixels in the form of a video feed to the HMD (Head Mounted Display), achieving higher performance, lower cost, and longer battery life for the consumer VR/AR hardware.NGCodec's RealityCodec technology runs on NGCodec AMI, which runs on Amazon EC2 F1 in the cloud, presenting significant advantages compared to traditional software encoding, including:• Massive acceleration and efficiency compared to traditional CPU/GPU instances• Higher-quality video for live encoding• Lower running costs and flexibility / upgradability, just like traditional software\"AWS is breaking ground as the first public cloud to add FPGA-enabled instances with Amazon EC2 F1, which offers significant acceleration over CPU and GPU instance types,\" said Oliver Gunasekara, CEO & co-founder, NGCodec Inc. \"Many large media workflows, including on-demand and live streaming content, are moving to the AWS Cloud. These can now have all the benefits of FPGA acceleration in the AWS ecosystem.\"NGCodec will demonstrate using cloud-based FPGA acceleration for live H.265/HEVC video encoding on December 1, 2016 11am at the AWS re:Invent 2016 event in Las Vegas, Nevada. (CMP317 Session) About NGCodec NGCodec® has been in passionate pursuit of next generation video compression since 2012. With the support of investors including Xilinx and NSF, NGCodec's agile startup team has created RealityCodec™, a compressor-decompressor technology optimized for ultra-low latency, high-quality applications. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, NGCodec licenses its H.265/HEVC video codec silicon intellectual property (IP) to semiconductor and equipment manufacturers around the World.

      "title": "Cyber Monday Deals Week At Amazon Continues: You Can Save 70 Percent And More This Holiday Shopping Season",
      "text": "\nBlack Friday and Cyber Monday may officially be over, but that doesn’t mean Amazon has stopped the sales. Amazon extended Cyber Monday for a week and continues to bring huge savings and deals to holiday shoppers. You can save 70 percent and more on the site through many time-sensitive deals. Amazon is releasing new deals every 5 minutes and even has a holiday shopping, deals app for savvy consumers who don’t want to miss their chance to save big. There are several ways to find the best Cyber Monday deals this week and these include navigating various categories on the site. Once you know how to track down the deals with the greatest savings, you’ll find that accessing the best deals isn’t as difficult as it might seem. If you don’t have time to navigate the entire Amazon site, you might find that downloading the free deals app is the best way to save both time and money.\nAmazon’s Cyber Monday deals week differs from other retailers, as it isn’t just a conglomeration of various items marked down in one new category. Amazon offers sales and deals on a continual basis in every category on their site. Additionally, they have time-sensitive deals on a regular basis. These include Amazon’s daily deals, gold box deals and lightning deals. Every major sale such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Countdown to Christmas, New Year’s, etc. will include the basic deals such as gold box, lightning and daily deals in addition to other specials. As Amazon is both its own retailer and an outlet for other retailers to sell their wares, deals are vast and varied. Prime members enjoy additional benefits such as free two-day shipping on Prime items and this can be a huge benefit for holiday shoppers. Prime members also get early access to select daily deals, gold box deals and lightning deals.\nAmazon's Gold Box deals are here for the holidays! https://t.co/msmVPAtpor pic.twitter.com/btfjNgWoW0 \n— Mary Turner (@thesaleswhopper) November 30, 2016 \n\nWhen first accessing the Cyber Monday deals week page, you’ll find products from the daily deals, lightning deals and gold box deals. These items are often discounted at a great price but are time sensitive. You’ll be able to see how long you have until the deal expires on each item’s description. When you browse towards the bottom of the page, you’ll find more options for searching deals, as well as more time-sensitive deals featured. The left side of the page is where you can set options for finding the best deals. There are two ways to approach this. You may look for deals based on type and features according to the options on the Cyber Monday deals week, or you can go to an Amazon department page, look at the top of the page and choose sales and deals. Both options will bring you to the same choices and items for sale.\nIf you go through one of the sales and deals link on an Amazon department page, you’ll find the same type of options as found on the Cyber Monday deals week to the left. One of these options includes setting the amount of discount you’d like to apply to the sale. Choices include finding deals that are 10 percent off and more, 25 percent off and more, 50 percent off and more and 70 percent off and more. Those who want to save the most on their holiday shopping should choose deals that are 70 percent off and more. Try going to the watches section and choosing 70 percent off. You’ll be amazed that you can save hundreds and even thousands on top, designer name brands this Christmas. Keep in mind, not every Amazon department has current sales that are 70 percent of and more, as Amazon sales come and go quickly. If you check regularly or use the deals app, you’re certain to find them. You can find current Cyber Monday deals at 70 percent off here.\nAmazon presents Oprah's Favorite Things. Each year #Oprah recommends great items! https://t.co/Vohbi2IooN #sales #deals #holiday #christmas pic.twitter.com/jcJCZZ4kaV \n— Mary Turner (@thesaleswhopper) November 4, 2016 \n\nCyber Monday deals week is a great time for holiday savings and as more retailers offer online sales, it’s possible that holiday shopping trends will change. Though Black Friday continued to draw large crowds to stores, there are many people who feel it is inappropriate to spend Thanksgiving camped out in front of a brick and mortar store in order to buy items. Some protest by waiting a week or two for their holiday shopping and others choose not to take advantage of in-store deals, sales and doorbusters entirely. Online Black Friday sales and Cyber Monday deals offer solutions to those shoppers conflicted between spending time with family in the traditional setting and racing to a store as soon as the doors open. When retailers like Walmart and Amazon extend their online Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals the response is great.\nLast year, Amazon ran Christmas sales until the day of Christmas and immediately followed with deep discounts for their after holiday sales. If these trends continue, brick and mortar shopping for the holidays may become a thing of the past. With Amazon’s Cyber Monday deals week, more people can shop from the comfort of their own home and still scoop up the best holiday deals.\n[Featured Image by Wright Studio/Shutterstock]\nCyber Monday Deals Week At Amazon Continues: You Can Save 70 Percent And More This Holiday Shopping Season is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "LAS VEGAS — Large companies have been flocking to the “cloud” to store data and run computing applications because it gives them spending flexibility and keeps them from running unwieldy data centers of their own.\nBut Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon Web Services, the world’s largest cloud computing provider, said there’s another, even more compelling reason: newly discovered abilities to create and deploy software.\n“The cloud and AWS made developers feel like they were equipped with superpowers,” Jassy said in a keynote speech at the company’s re:Invent conference, which has gathered 32,000 developers and cloud advocates in this gambling and entertainment mecca. “The cloud and AWS gives builders capabilities that they never had before.”\nJassy’s comments came amidst a series of announcements that underscore how the business of renting computing power and storage is morphing into a platform that underpins the rapid deployment of machine-learning tools and voice-activated technology.\nMore stories from re:Invent Amazon’s giant cloud computing conference kicks off Amazon’s giant cloud computing conference kicks off Amazon’s commander of the Cloud shares his vision Amazon strikes a unifying chord with holiday ad featuring pastor, imam Amazon removes negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's memoir Pilot strike threatens some of Amazon’s Prime Air cargo routes On Wednesday, Amazon.com said it would equip AWS with new artificial intelligence capabilities, one of which allows developers to use the technology that powers Alexa, Amazon’s own voice-activated artificial intelligence software, to make their own cloud-based tools.\nThere were plenty of other releases as well, ranging from improvements on storage and computing processing offerings, to a 45-foot trailer pulled by a truck that can allow companies to physically move gigantic amounts of data from their own centers into Amazon’s cloud. The device, which made its grand entrance into the meeting hall accompanied by heavy metal music, is dubbed the “Snowmobile” and can harbor one exabyte of data (the equivalent of one billion gigabytes). “We’ll drive the truck to your data center,” Jassy said.\nThe flurry of new features, experts say, highlights Amazon’s knack for building out what’s possible in its ecosystem as competition heats up with the likes of Google and Microsoft. AWS remains the largest provider at this point, with a revenue “run rate” of close to $13 billion a year.\n“The key thing here is the richness of services they offer,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst with IDC. “They listen, they add more services. That’s their biggest differentiator right now.”\nIt’s the AI and speech recognition stuff that seemed the most revolutionary. It helps Amazon approach an issue where Microsoft and Google are proud to show loads of expertise. “A lot of companies don’t realize the heritage Amazon has in the machine-learning space,” Jassy said. “That’s because we don’t talk about it very much, it’s not our style.”\nBut it also unleashes new capabilities in a realm that’s widely believed to be the future of computing.\n“This is the future of how we interact with machines and with things,” analyst Hilwa said. “Devices will be able to communicate and understand, and all of this is going to happen because of the cloud.”\nJassy, the AWS CEO, told The Seattle Times in a recent interview that the cloud has become a “movement.” Nowhere is that more apparent than at the Sands Expo and Convention Center here. Slow-moving crowds filled the hallways and packed a cavernous meeting hall with room for thousands, as a DJ greeted the attendees with an early-morning mix of upbeat music.\nHundreds applauded when Jassy spoke about new features and made digs at Larry Ellison, the outspoken co-founder of Oracle, who has said that his company can take on AWS’s cloud.\n(Oracle is also an established database engine provider that AWS seeks to unseat with Aurora, its own database engine offering for the cloud.)\n“A whole generation of builders,” Jassy said, “are going to spend their time using the cloud to build massive capabilities.”\nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .

      "text": "Amazon Withdraws ‘Offensive’ Allah Doormats and Dog Bedding Twitter/mariamkhan29 by Nick Hallett 30 Nov 2016 0 30 Nov, 2016 30 Nov, 2016 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Amazon has removed a line of doormats dog mats featuring the Arabic word ‘Allah’ following complaints from Muslims. \nThe mats, which were sold by third-party users, feature the word written in rainbow colours in Arabic script, and had been receiving complaints since June. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nThe site finally removed them after Mariam Khan, a councillor in Birmingham, complained on Twitter, causing a storm of outrage from angry Muslims. \nThe councillor wrote : “These mats are extremely offensive to Muslims & out of order. @amazon @AmazonHelp please remove these from your site immediately.” \nShoes and feet are seen as unclean in Arab culture, while some Muslim clerics also argue that dogs are ‘haram’ under Sharia law. The idea of wiping feet on the name of God, or using Allah as a dog mat is therefore deeply offensive to many Muslims. \nThe rainbow colour also caused offense as it resembles the LGBT flag as homosexuality is condemned by Islam and is illegal in many Muslim countries. \nThe Mail reports that Ms Khan called Amazon to complain about the mats, prompting the company to apologise and promise to remove the items. However, Ms Khan then tweeted to her followers telling them Amazon would remove the items faster if they complained. \nAnam Hoque called the mats “irresponsible” and “disgusting”, accusing sellers of promoting Islamophobia. \nMeanwhile, Moeed Sheikh said they were “diabolical” and “disgraceful”. \nIn August, a man from Manchester was sentenced to 180 unpaid work and a 12-month community order after offending Muslims on Facebook. \nStephen Bennett, 39, posted comments on the Greater Manchester Police page that were described as “likely to be offensive to Muslims”. He was charged under to 2003 Malicious Communications Act, which criminalises “menacing” speech. \nA Muslim witness called the comments “irresponsible” and said they were a “potential tool for radicalisation”. \nThe judge said: “Your remarks damaged the community in which you live, and it’s the community that you must repay.” Read More Stories About: \nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

      "text": "Amazon employee jumps from building to kill himself after sending email By R. Siva Kumar Nov 30, 2016 03:39 PM EST Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Advertisement \nIt was an amazing Amazon experience, when an employee sent emails to hundreds of colleagues, including CEO Jeff Bezos. He then jumped from a building at the company's headquarters in Seattle, Monday morning. \nAn inside source said that the employee, who was one of 20,000 workers in a number of buildings at the Amazon campus, had requested that he should be transferred to a different department. Advertisement \nInstead, he had been placed on an 'employee improvement plan.' This is usually seen as the initial step towards getting fired. \nUpset with Amazon's handling of his transfer request, the employee sent out a hint that he was going to harm himself, said the source. \nThe details were given later by a police spokesman. He narrated that the employee had sprung from a high pedestal four stories up on the 12-story building, but he fell just 20 feet onto a balcony. \"Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,\" Amazon said. \"He's receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.\" \nLast month, New York Times had written a critical article, reporting that Bezos had created a \"soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard.\" However, Bezos denied it quickly. \nIn the US, suicide is the 10 th leading cause of death. In 2013, 41,149 people killed themselves, at a rate of 12.6 per 100,000, explains the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nYou don't want to add to that number, do you? If you or someone you know is thinking of it, call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.",

      "text": "LAS VEGAS–-Amazon.com Inc. debuted new services intended to help coders build web-based applications that tap into the retail giant's artificial-intelligence capabilities.\nThe company's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, unveiled the offerings at its annual conference here. Amazon Rekognition will let software developers write programs that detect the number of people in a photo, spot their gender and identify objects. It can also match faces, which could be useful in comparing two images to confirm, for example, a person's identity.\nThe company also launched Amazon Polly, which converts text to speech. It lets programmers transform text input, such as \"The temp in WA is 75 degrees F,\" into spoken output that says, \"The temperature in Washington is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\" This feature, available in 27 languages, could be used to build conversational applications.\nAnother new offering, Amazon LEX, affords access to the Alexa artificial-intelligence service that runs on the company's Echo device. LEX understands spoken input, enabling developers to build software that answers questions. A pizza company, for example, could build a web-based program that asked users what toppings they wanted when they ordered a pizza. Such an application could keep track of previous orders so the system could ask customers if they wanted the same toppings again, said Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon Web Services.\n\"A lot of companies don't realize the heritage that Amazon has in the machine-learning space,\" Mr. Jassy said, referring to the area of artificial intelligence that makes such services practical.\nThe online retailer has thousands of employees focused on artificial intelligence, he added, from services that show customers who bought a particular item other items they might like to Echo's Alexa AI assistant.\n\"We do a lot of AI at the company,\" he said, something Amazon Web Services customers asked to tap into.\nWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n 30, 2016 15:15 ET (20:15 ",

      "text": "print \nAmazon/Business Insider \nOn Wednesday, Amazon Web Service CEO Andy Jassy had a big finish to his multi-hour keynote speech given at the AWS customer conference taking place this week in Las Vegas. \nHe had someone drive a truck onto the stage, pulling a giant container he called the \"Snowmobile.\" \nThe audience laughed and cheered. It looked like a gag, but it wasn't. \nAmazon Snowball Amazon \nThis is real product from AWS , and easily the biggest (if you are measuring in feet) product announcement of the day. \nThe story of the Snowmobile basically started a year ago. Now that every business, from startups to huge companies, are rushing to the cloud as fast as they can, Amazon Web Services has turned its attention to a tricky problem. \nHow do you physically get all the data stored in a company 's massive data center into Amazon's cloud? \nLast year, it announced a solution it called Snowball, a handheld box about the size of a desktop PC. A company rents it from Amazon, stuffs it with a petabyte of data and ships it back to Amazon to unload. A petabyte is one million gigabytes and it used to be considered an insane amount of data. In this way, a company could transfer a petabyte per week into Amazon's cloud, and eventually unplug their data center altogether if they wanted to. \nJassy didn't think the Snowball would be much of a hit. He even \"chastised\" the Snowball team for manufacturing too many of them, he admitted on stage. \nBut he was wrong, big time. The team had to almost instantly \"go back and order 10 times number of Snowballs we have. I can’t believe how much data we’ve transferred with Snowball.\" \nIt became such a thing, that IT folks started talking selfies with their Snowballs and sending them to Amazon. \nAmazon Snowball Selfies Amazon/Business Insider \nThese days, there are companies that store so much more data, they measure it in exabytes. Each exabyte is one billion gigabytes. \nUsing conventional means of transferring that data, \"It will take you 26 years to move an exabyte to the cloud,\" Jassy said. \nEnter the Snowmobile. \"With 10 Snowmobiles it take six months\" to move that data to the cloud. \nSo for companies sitting on mind-boggling amounts of data, Amazon will literally drive a Snowmobile to their data centers, load it up, and haul to back to Amazon. \nAs for the popular Snowball, Amazon has upgraded it with more capacity, compute power, and other things because folks have come up with all kinds of innovate things they want to do with it besides use it to ship data to AWS. \nHere's another view of the Snowmobile. \nAmazon/Business Insider",

      "text": "(Amazon/Business Insider) \nOn Wednesday, Amazon Web Service CEO Andy Jassy had a big finish to his multi-hour keynote speech given at the AWS customer conference taking place this week in Las Vegas. \nHe had someone drive a truck onto the stage, pulling a giant container he called the \"Snowmobile.\"\nThe audience laughed and cheered. It looked like a gag, but it wasn't.\n(Amazon SnowballAmazon) \nThis is real product from AWS , and easily the biggest (if you are measuring in feet) product announcement of the day. \nThe story of the Snowmobile basically started a year ago. Now that every business, from startups to huge companies, are rushing to the cloud as fast as they can, Amazon Web Services has turned its attention to a tricky problem.\nHow do you physically get all the data stored in a company 's massive data center into Amazon's cloud?\nLast year, it announced a solution it called Snowball, a handheld box about the size of a desktop PC. A company rents it from Amazon, stuffs it with a petabyte of data and ships it back to Amazon to unload. A petabyte is one million gigabytes and it used to be considered an insane amount of data. In this way, a company could transfer a petabyte per week into Amazon's cloud, and eventually unplug their data center altogether if they wanted to. \nJassy didn't think the Snowball would be much of a hit. He even \"chastised\" the Snowball team for manufacturing too many of them, he admitted on stage.\nBut he was wrong, big time. The team had to almost instantly \"go back and order 10 times number of Snowballs we have. I can’t believe how much data we’ve transferred with Snowball.\"\nIt became such a thing, that IT folks started talking selfies with their Snowballs and sending them to Amazon.\n(Amazon Snowball SelfiesAmazon/Business Insider) \n\nThese days, there are companies that store so much more data, they measure it in exabytes. Each exabyte is one billion gigabytes.\nUsing conventional means of transferring that data, \"It will take you 26 years to move an exabyte to the cloud,\" Jassy said.\nEnter the Snowmobile. \"With 10 Snowmobiles it take six months\" to move that data to the cloud.\nSo for companies sitting on mind-boggling amounts of data, Amazon will literally drive a Snowmobile to their data centers, load it up, and haul to back to Amazon.\nAs for the popular Snowball, Amazon has upgraded it with more capacity, compute power, and other things because folks have come up with all kinds of innovate things they want to do with it besides use it to ship data to AWS.\nHere's another view of the Snowmobile.\n(Amazon/Business Insider) \n\nNOW WATCH: Here's why some people have a tiny hole above their ears \n\nMore From Business Insider \nAmazon's cloud boss Andy Jassy just slammed Larry Ellison and mocked his 'hand-waving and bombast' \nAmazon's cloud boss: AWS could become 'the largest part' of Amazon's $100+ billion business \nHow Amazon snatched huge customer Motorola away from Microsoft",

      "text": "Mario Tama/Getty Images \nNo matter how you measure it, Amazon's cloud is huge and still growing at an unbelievable rate.\nAmazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy said on Wednesday that AWS was on track to do $13 billion in revenue this year and it's still growing at 50% over 2015. \nWhereas Amazon was once the bastion of startups who tended to use it until they were big enough to launch their own data centers, an astounding number of enterprises are now choosing to move their apps and data to Amazon and shut down some, or all, of their data centers. Amazon says it now has more than 1 million active customers including some of the biggest companies in the world.\nAmazon is now adding more servers to its cloud on a daily basis than it took to power all of AWS in 2003, Jassy said.\nAs we previously reported, when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google and concluded that \"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. It is much more mature in terms of functionality,\" according to Leo Wang, head of cloud computing.\nBut here's an interesting tidbit that should have competitors even more worried. As Amazon adds more customers and each one asks it to add new features, AWS is actually  accelerating in adding stuff to its cloud. \nIn 2015, it added 750 new features, nearly 3 times as many as it had added in 2013. In 2016, it has so far added 1,000, or three new features every day.\nMario Tama/Getty Images \nThe company is now such the 800-pound gorilla in the market that one of its original huge competitors, VMware, threw in the towel earlier this year and signed on to help sell AWS and make its data center software work better with the cloud. \nAnd it's even winning contracts from the big cloud companies themselves. Earlier this year, Salesforce reversed course on its chummy relationship with Microsoft Azure. (In 2014, Salesforce moved its ExactTarget business unit to Azure.) In May, Salesforce chose Amazon as its \"preferred cloud partner.\" That means it will use AWS to be its international data center in countries where Salesforce does not yet have its own data center for its biggest apps, including its flagship customer relationship management apps. That's a deal worth $400 million over four years to Amazon, the Wall Street Journal reported.  \nOn Wednesday, Amazon announced another, similar partnership with cloud HR software provider Workday, where Workday will use Amazon's international data centers as well (starting with Canada).\nIn a dig at Salesforce's and Workday's mutual rival, Oracle, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff even tweeted about the partnership.\nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/804036347111444480\nCongrats @aneelb @Workday @awscloud pic.twitter.com/PtMjJxyyOz \n \nNOW WATCH: Here's how much you need to make to be in the top 1% of every state \n",

      "text": "Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Mario Tama/Getty Images\nNo matter how you measure it, Amazon's cloud is huge and still growing at an unbelievable rate.\nAmazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy said on Wednesday that AWS was on track to do $13 billion in revenue this year and it's still growing at 50% over 2015.\nWhereas Amazon was once the bastion of startups who tended to use it until they were big enough to launch their own data centers, an astounding number of enterprises are now choosing to move their apps and data to Amazon and shut down some, or all, of their data centers. Amazon says it now has more than 1 million active customers including some of the biggest companies in the world.\nAmazon is now adding more servers to its cloud on a daily basis than it took to power all of AWS in 2003, Jassy said.\nAs we previously reported, when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google and concluded that \"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. It is much more mature in terms of functionality,\" according to Leo Wang, head of cloud computing.\nBut here's an interesting tidbit that should have competitors even more worried. As Amazon adds more customers and each one asks it to add new features, AWS is actually accelerating in adding stuff to its cloud.\nIn 2015, it added 750 new features, nearly 3 times as many as it had added in 2013. In 2016, it has so far added 1,000, or three new features every day.\nAmazon re:Invent/Business Insider\nThe company is now such the 800-pound gorilla in the market that one of its original huge competitors, VMware, threw in the towel earlier this year and signed on to help sell AWS and make its data center software work better with the cloud.\nAnd it's even winning contracts from the big cloud companies themselves. Earlier this year, Salesforce reversed course on its chummy relationship with Microsoft Azure. (In 2014, Salesforce moved its ExactTarget business unit to Azure.) In May, Salesforce chose Amazon as its \"preferred cloud partner.\" That means it will use AWS to be its international data center in countries where Salesforce does not yet have its own data center for its biggest apps, including its flagship customer relationship management apps. That's a deal worth $400 million over four years to Amazon, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nOn Wednesday, Amazon announced another, similar partnership with cloud HR software provider Workday, where Workday will use Amazon's international data centers as well (starting with Canada).\nIn a dig at Salesforce's and Workday's mutual rival, Oracle, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff even tweeted about the partnership.\nCongrats @aneelb @Workday @awscloud pic.twitter.com/PtMjJxyyOz\n— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) November 30, 2016\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nSEE ALSO: How Amazon snatched huge customer Motorola away from Microsoft SEE ALSO: This 'Snowmobile' truck seems like a joke, but it's actually Amazon's new product NOW WATCH: It’s surreal to watch this 2011 video of Obama and Seth Meyers taunting Trump about a presidential run Loading video...

Levin Partner and Co-Founder, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners \nEstimate 5 Million Units Sold in US as Awareness Soars, with Diverse Uses \nConsumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) released updated analysis of Amazon Echo from Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). \nThis analysis indicates that Amazon sold 5.1 million Amazon Echo devices in the US since its late 2014 introduction. Awareness of Amazon Echo among US Amazon customers increased dramatically in the past twelve months, as Echo buyers use it as a voice-responsive Internet query device and household controller, in addition to a high-end streaming music speaker. \nCIRP estimates that for US Amazon customers, awareness of Amazon Echo increased to 69% as of September 30, 2016, up from 20% as of March 31, 2015, the first full quarter following its introduction (Chart 1). \nChart 1: Amazon customer awareness of Amazon Echo \nAmazon continues to expand Echo, introducing two new models this year, the Dot and Tap. Amazon also promotes it heavily, with special pricing on multiple Echo device purchases and Echo devices bundled with compatible speakers and home automation devices. Amazon also offers deals available only to Amazon Prime members exclusively through Echo. \nAs a result, based on our research CIRP estimates that Amazon sold approximately 5.1 million Amazon Echo devices in the US since its late 2014 introduction, with approximately 2 million units sold in the first nine months of 2016. \nThe installed based of Amazon Echo users continues to grow at a rapid clip. We estimate that the new Echo Dot and Echo Tap models account for at least one-third of sales in the past six months, since Amazon introduced those models. And, a small but meaningful percentage of Amazon customers own more than one Echo model. \nCustomers use Amazon Echo for many purposes, with one-third using it as an information provider responding to questions and over 40% as an audio speaker for listening to streaming music (Chart 2). \nChart 2: How consumers use Amazon Echo (multiple responses allowed, percentages sum to over 100%) \nOur research shows that more than half of Echo owners use the device as more than a voice-controlled music speaker. Users report asking about weather and news, and increasingly controlling other connected devices. \nCIRP bases its findings on surveys of 3,500 US subjects who made a purchase at Amazon.com in the period from January 2015-September 2016.

      "text": "Cloud-Stored Offsite Database Backups –Oracle Corporation \nAmazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) is an Amazon Web Services tool that allows an IT professional to automatically configure virtual servers in a cloud or in on-premises data center. An IT pro uses scripts, commands or the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) console to manage EC2 instances, virtual machines (VMs) or servers hosted on other clouds, or within local environments such as Windows. Download this free guide Download Our Developers’ Guide to AWS \nAWS is not only making it easier to manage and analyze data, but did you know that AWS also offers a library of free datasets? That’s not all. Uncover two more things you may not know. Start Download You forgot to provide an Email Address. This email address doesn’t appear to be valid.

You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy . \nAmazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager includes the EC2 Run Command feature, which an IT team uses as needed to execute commands for VMs, as well as an SSM Config feature that enables a team to set configuration preferences. \nBefore using the EC2 Run Command, an administrator must register on-premises servers and VMs, which are called \"managed instances\" after registration. An instance must be launched with an AWS Identity and Access Management role to grant required permissions. \nThe SSM service includes predefined documents to remotely configure instances with a variety of actions. An IT administrator can also choose to create a document specific to his or her company. A developer then executes these actions on the Commands page of the EC2 console using AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, through the AWS Command Line Interface or through software development kits . \nEC2 Run Command records the status of each command on each instance. It also enables an auditor to see who executed the commands and when. \nSSM Config, which is only available for Windows instances, lets a developer specify a configuration setup for instances. A developer uses SSM documents to specify which actions the system should perform on instances, such as application and component installation, joining an instance to a Microsoft Active Directory domain or delivering custom log file data to Amazon CloudWatch . The system checks for a new configuration every five minutes, allowing a company to maintain consistent configurations across its instances.

The truck houses a container that can store up to 100 petabytes of data. Real-life data hoarders can contract Amazon to move exabytes of data to the cloud using the new tricked-out trucks. \nSnowmobile attaches directly to your data center with power and network fibre to move critical information to AWS, even when its size is insurmountable for mere mortals. \nDesigned to address data challenges for companies dealing with large film vaults and troves of satellite imagery, the truck consumes a whopping 350 KW of AC power. All this power fuels one terabyte per-second of data transfer speeds across a 40 gigabyte per-second connection. \nThis means a Snowmobile can be filled to the brim in roughly 10 days. After all is said and done, the truck is taken back to AWS where its contents are put in the cloud. DigitalGlobe is already contracting out trucks to move 100 petabytes of satellite imagery to AWS. dsc06995",

      "text": "'Amazon Ambassador' Daphne De Jong, on helping science inspiration take flight The News will be profiling some of Amazon's STEM ambassadors, ahead of their visits to local schools Share Daphne De Jong, technical programme manager at Amazon Prime Air Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAs part of its Amazon in the Community programme, staff from the tech firm’s Prime Air research lab here in Cambridge will be visiting local schools to spread the word about careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths). \nOver the coming weeks the News will be profiling some of the Amazon Ambassadors, to highlight the wide range of skills, backgrounds and abilities needed to get its drone delivery programme off the ground. \nDaphne De Jong, 26, is technical programme manager at Amazon Prime Air. Daphne De Jong, technical programme manager at Amazon Prime Air What is your particular area of expertise? \nI trained as a pilot and then moved into aerospace engineering before joining Amazon Prime Air. I’m really passionate about flying and it definitely has a lot of similarities to the work I’m involved in now, both in the type of work we’re doing and the teamwork it requires. How would you explain your current work to a stranger on the bus? \nI have two main jobs. First, I project manage some of the technical projects on the team, ensuring things stay on track. The second bit – and admittedly my favourite – is working with others in the drone industry to develop a system to safely integrate small drones into the airspace. The technical term is ‘unmanned traffic management system,’ and it will provide a safe and efficient model for all drone operations. NASA is helping lead this effort so the time I spent working there earlier in my career is really coming in handy. Read More Inside Amazon's Prime Air secret drone testing facility What kind of student were you at school? \nI wanted to change the world in any way possible! I was always keen to work on group projects and brainstorm all the endless possible uses of different technologies – basically thinking about how we could make the world a better place little-by-little. \nMy interest in aviation grew in my early teenage years when I had the chance to represent my native Netherlands as an International Air Cadet. I knew I wanted to build a career in aerospace after I had my first flight lesson in Namibia. \nIt was an incredible experience and inspired me to later on train as a commercial pilot on the Boeing 737. Finding my passion early in life shaped who I am now, and through the STEM Ambassador programme I hope I’ll be able to help other students find the subjects they love. What’s the most exciting part of your job? \nThe team. It’s such an honour to work with my amazing colleagues. They are all so different – being different is the norm! Bringing so many interesting people together from such a wide variety of backgrounds makes a strong team. Everyone’s passion is obvious and it’s motivating to all be working toward the same goal. What are you most proud of in your career? \nI have to say, working for Amazon Prime Air is what I’m most proud of. I strongly believe in team effort, so working together for our customers is something that’s really important to me. It’s exciting to be helping to change the way people think about and use logistics, accessibility of products and technology. \nI also cherish memories of my mountain climbing adventures. So far, I have attempted Mont Blanc, Mt. Kilimanjaro and the Inca trail in Peru. I am preparing to climb Mt. Everest in two years.

Whether it’s flying or climbing a mountain, planning things out properly in advance can allow you to do more and push yourself to the limit. What’s the best thing about working in Cambridge? \nCambridge is so beautiful in all seasons, especially in autumn. Walking around and looking at the historic architecture along with the autumn leaves is really lovely. Everyone is so friendly, and I really enjoy the university-organised events. The fact that I can spend my Monday working, doing sports, and listening to fascinating people all before midnight makes this a great place to live!

'Amazon Ambassador' Lee Browning on keeping the tech firm flying Who is your role model? \nMy role models have changed at different phases of my life – I think that they change as you change. Right now I’m really fascinated by Gwynne Shotwell from Space X. She thinks and speaks so clearly about how technology can benefit society. Like us on Facebook ",
