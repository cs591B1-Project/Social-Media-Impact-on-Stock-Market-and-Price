      "text": "New Fake Amazon Email Scam Is Incredibly Easy to Fall For Thousands receive real-looking 'Amazon' customer service email. Co-author, 'The Geek Gap' @ MindaZetlin WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nHave you ordered anything from Amazon in the past couple of weeks? Are you planning to in the next couple? If either is true, you might easily be victimized by a real-looking email, supposedly from Amazon, explaining that there's a problem with your order and asking you to re-enter some information. \nWhatever you do, don't comply. \nBoth Amazon Prime members and non-members are reporting receipt of a very legit-looking email with the subject line, \"Your Amazon.com order cannot be shipped.\" It begins: \nHello, \nThere was a problem processing your order. You will not be able to access your account or place orders with us until we confirm your information. Click here to confirm your account. \nIt goes on to request that recipients not open any new accounts until the issue is resolved and read Amazon's terms and conditions if they have further questions. \nIf you click on the link in the email, it takes you to a very real looking \"Amazon\" page where you are invited to re-enter your name, address, and credit card information. Which, of course, the scammers will now have. Just to keep you unsuspicious, when you're done it will send you on to the real Amazon website. Here's how to foil phishing scams. \nTrying to make you divulge private information such as your password or credit card numbers is called \"phishing\" and needless to say this is just one of thousands of scams out there trying to phish from all of us. Here's how to stay safe: 1. Check for the S. \nAmazon and other sites dealing with financial information should start out \"https:\" not \"http:\". Floating your cursor over the link should show you which it is, or if your browser hides those prefixes, you can copy and paste. But avoid actually going to insecure pages. 2. Look closely at the URL. \nThe domain name should begin \"amazon.com\" or possibly something like \"amazon.co.uk\" if you're shopping on Amazon outside the U.S. Most retailers start with their domain name and then add on a department. For instance, the URL for Amazon's page helping identify scams begins: \"https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/\". Watch out for anything like \"amazoncustomerservice.com.\" 3. Examine the email address. \nLikewise, the sender's email address should end \"@amazon.com\" (or something comparable for other retailers). It obviously shouldn't be anything like \"amazoncustomerservice@gmail.com\" but fake domains can be used to create fake addresses so even if the domain looks like it might be legit, be cautious if it isn't the same domain you would use to visit the retail site. Incidentally, Amazon asks that you attach (or if not, forward) scam emails so their security team can shut them down. 4. Get there by your own means. \nWe all click through from emails to websites all the time, and most of the time it won't get you in trouble. But if you receive an email announcing a problem with your account and/or asking you for further information, it's much smarter not to click the link. Go to the site using your bookmarks or history, or via search. 5. Use two-step authentication whenever it's offered. \nThe smartest websites and services help preserve your security by offering two-factor authentication when signing in. You should take them up on the offer. \nTo set that up, a site will ask for your mobile phone number and then text you a number to enter whenever you try to sign in. (Many sites also allow you to use Google Authenticator and/or a one-time code which can be very handy if you lose your phone, or it dies, or you're somewhere out of cell range.) You can set your home computer to be recognized so it won't put you through that process every time you sign in, but it will prevent hackers elsewhere from signing into your email, retail, bank, or other online accounts and causing havoc. \nThat may not help you if you accidentally share your credit card numbers with someone who shouldn't have them, but it will help you a lot if a scammer gains access to your account passwords.

      "text": "Select All Posts By This User So my original g403 from Amazon had an extremely loose and rattly mousewheel among other problems, I got a replacement from Logitech that had 0 issues except for the mousewheel wiggling back and forth if I wiggled it with my finger, which seemed good enough for me. But now after a couple months of daily use the wheel wiggles around a lot more than before(it now rattles when I shake the mouse, which it didn't before), and sometimes randomly scrolls down, which means I sometimes randomly jump in CS:GO. Should I try to get an RMA replacement for my RMA replacement? I don't have a receipt for it since I didn't buy it, they just sent it to me after approving my original RMA request, would that cause an issue with the RMA process?",

      "text": "Executives from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox will not participate in the traditional Q&A sessions at the Television Critics Association winter press tour next year. The TCA board confirmed the move by the Big Four in a note to members Tuesday.\nAmazon Studios also confirmed to Variety Tuesday that it has scuttled plans to participate in winter press tour. The streaming service had been scheduled to present Jan. 5, the first day of the more than two-week long event.\n“[TCA vice president Daniel Fienberg] and I have been in conversation with the networks and, unfortunately, given the jam-packed days ahead, Fox, ABC, CBS and NBC will not host executive sessions this tour,” TCA president Amber Dowling wrote Tuesday. “(They will resume the practice in the summer.) We’ve been assured the execs will be on hand during the networks’ respective days and that anyone needing Quote: s for their stories should reach out to the appropriate publicists. If you have any problems with access please let someone on the board know. (As ever, we encourage you to let the networks know how much you value executive sessions in both summer and winter.)”\nExecutive sessions have been a traditional cornerstone of press tour, which has for decades gathered reporters twice a year for a series of press conferences. The change of plans by the Big Four and Amazon comes after Netflix and Starz confirmed last month that they also will not participate in the coming tour.\nTelevision executives have grown increasingly uncomfortable with the tenor of TCA press conferences, complaining privately that they receive little benefit in the way of generating publicity for series while exposing executives and talent to virulent criticism on social media. TCA members have argued that the event continues to be a useful forum for industry coverage.\nNetflix and Amazon are expected to participate in the summer TCA press tour. The streaming services, which in the past have hosted their own press-tour days, are expected instead to be scheduled as part of lineup for CTAM, the cable-television industry group that hosts several days of each press tour.\nThe fifth major English-language U.S. broadcast network, the CW, still plans to hold an executive session at press tour in January.\nRelated stories\nNetflix and Starz Pull Out of Winter 2017 TCA Press Tour\nNetwork Chiefs Grilled About Diversity Records During TCA Press Tour\nFox Sets Crossover Episode for 'New Girl' and 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine'\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "(Picture: Twitter/Mariam Khan) Amazon has been forced to stop selling doormats with Allah’s name on them after they were branded ‘offensive’ by Muslims. \nMuslims ‘forced to leave Christmas market after setting up Islam information stand’ Dozens of outraged Muslims said they had been offended by the product which allowed people to wipe their feet on Allah’s name.\nThe site has since apologised and pulled the doormat and dog mat products from the site.\nThe mats were reported to Amazon by Birmingham councillor Mariam Khan, who was alerted to the offensive nature of the products by a number of constituents.\n(Picture: Mariam Khan/Twitter) Writing on Twitter, she said: ‘These mats are extremely offensive to Muslims and out of order. Please remove these items from your site immediately.’\nThe 26-year-old said the mats flew in the face of the current Amazon Christmas advert, which promotes racial and religious harmony.\nIn the ad, a Christian priest and Muslim Imam order gifts for each other from the retail giant.\nMORE: US Muslims asked to identify themselves – but not for reason you may think \nThese mats are extremely offensive to Muslims & out of order. @amazon @AmazonHelp please remove these from your site immediately. pic.twitter.com/b1syDWPDVC \n— Mariam Khan (@mariamkhan29) November 28, 2016 \n\nAmazon claims the product was placed on its site by a third party seller, who simply used the site as a platform to sell its products.\nCouncillor Khan has since praised Amazon for acting on her concerns so swiftly.\nShe said: ‘I think it would be offensive for anyone of any religious faith to have items such as this on their doorstep with their religious scriptures on them to wipe their feet on.\nDisgraceful. After such a heartfelt advert by @amazon , clearly more monitoring needs to be done. https://t.co/0j9VkfCOnm \n— Hifzha Shaheen (@hifzhashaheen) November 28, 2016 \nSuperb and well done. Wonder who produced these and thought it ok to produce? https://t.co/hf3FLI3Bfu \n— TellMAMAUK (@TellMamaUK) November 28, 2016 \n\n‘If these items had words from the Bible on them, they would be just as offensive.’\nThe councillor later tweeted: ‘After a lot of confusion, I’ve been told by Amazon that they will remove the items and apologise for offence caused.’\nA spokesman for Amazon told the Sunday Mercury : ‘We can confirm that the products are no longer for sale.’\nMetro.co.uk have contacted Amazon for further comment.",

      "text": "Home / News / Software News / Microsoft's Home Hub to rival Amazon and Google will be software not hardware Microsoft's Home Hub to rival Amazon and Google will be software not hardware \nby Ben Woods Read Comments \nScant details of Microsoft's Home Hub system have surfaced online, suggesting that the rival to Amazon and Google's smart home hubs will be a full software solution, rather than requiring a standalone device. \nDetails drawn together by Windows Central this week suggest that rather than aiming for a screenless unit activated purely by voice commands, Microsoft's Home Hub will reportedly aim at pulling together different Windows devices in a home to allow for easier access across the whole family, and home automation tasks like you can already carry out on the opposition's hardware. \nThe bonus of not tying Home Hub to a single device, and instead integrating it as a standard feature of upcoming releases of Windows 10, is that those devices already have a display built in. While voice control is an inarguable convenience that will form a core of Microsoft's Home Hub features, the ability to use alternate inputs is a smart way to approach it. \nThe Hub will also reportedly significantly revamp clunky account sharing features to make it easier for families to share certain content with everyone in the home. Right now, you can have single accounts for each user and switch between them, but the Home Hub will bring the ability to have a 'family' account that can be accessed by anyone without a password. \nWh at is Windows Hello and what can I do with it? \nWhile that might not sound too advanced, users that open the family account will still be able to get their own personal information (calendar events, for example) by authenticating via Windows Hello. An easily accessible Hub that can still show you private information when authenticated is considerably smarter sounding. \nAs part of the Family Desktop, parents will also get an easy way to control which apps everyone can access, making it particularly handy for parents. These rules will also be applicable across Windows Mobile, iOS and Android apps, apparently. \nPerhaps more intererestingly than any of that, however, is that Cortana's integration into the Hub will bring an ability to recognise and respond to different family users - providing information and services specific to that person. Naturally, it should also be able to do the same sort of home automation tasks you'd expect of a smart home system and will reportedly support OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation) and OpenT2T (Open Translators to Things) standards for controlling devices. \nNow for the bad news. Building an all-encompassing hub appears to be an iterative process for Microsoft and it's unlikely all the features will arrive at once. Given that there are now two capable smart home systems on the market, long delays could see Microsoft cede some of the advantage of the breadth of its desktop user base. \nRelated: Samsung Smartthings review \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nDo you think Microsoft is moving too slowly in the smart home space?

      "text": "E-mail \nAmazon’s Alexa has proven a smash hit for the company, not only as a simple AI assistant that can set your alarm clock and order you some bits and bobs from their website but also as a powerful IoT hub that connects your smart home with automation tech and a whole lot more. \nNow it looks like the tools Alexa offers will be getting a big expansion , and that means that developers will have expanded conversational and response skills available to play around with. This means conversation will be more natural, a greater range of triggers will be available for events, and a lot more possibilities for creating unique skills and experiences overall. \nGiven that Alexa has gone from around 100 to over 5000 skills that you can apply since launch, that number is expected to continue to blow up much further as they add hundreds of new commands, slots and intents to the Alexa Skills Kit. Unfortunately for us in the UK, this is a U.S. only release for now, but other regions will follow soon enough.",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nOn the surface, it might seem like a no-brainer to wait as long as possible to secure the highest payout you can get. But while we can sit here and crunch the numbers all day, I believe that there's a huge disconnect between what makes sense on paper and how things play out in real life. \nIf you're waiting until 67 to claim Social Security benefits just to secure more money -- especially if your basic needs will be met if you file earlier -- I think it's highly probable that you're making a short-sighted decision. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Two kinds of abundance \nIn life, there are two important types of abundance: an abundance of wealth and an abundance of time. Culturally, we are encouraged to spend much of our energy securing the former, while giving the latter very little thought, especially during prime working years. \nBut if we look at the research behind what actually makes people happy -- or simply investigate our own lives for evidence -- we would quickly come to the conclusion that money contributes to happiness only insomuch as it secures our most basic needs: food, clothing, shelter, etc. \nAfter that, however, it is through intentional activities -- like devoting ourselves to meaningful goals, taking care of our bodies and souls, practicing healthy behaviors, and nurturing relationships -- that happiness comes.The key is this: All of these \"intentional activities\" take time. \nHere's how Cal-Riverside professor and researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky has visualized it, according to her research presented in her book The How of Happiness. \nData source: The How of Happiness , Sonja Lyubomirksy. \nWhile it's possible to both earn money and devote yourself to something meaningful at the same time, that's simply not the case for everyone. The only way to guarantee you'll have the time for this is to clear your schedule -- retire and file for Social Security benefits. It makes sense, but it's still hard... \nHere at The Motley Fool, we talk a lot about not panic-selling during a market meltdown. When stocks stay the same or generally move up, everyone believes that they can easily \"be greedy when others are fearful.\" \nBut once you see your account lose $10,000 -- or $100,000 -- in a few trading days, reality hits. You can't focus on anything else; you're constantly checking your portfolio for signs of a recovery. It gets so bad that the only way that many find to relieve the emotional stress is to hit the \"sell\" button. We simply aren't equipped to ignore the moves without proper preparation. \nIn much the same way, I'm sure many of you will look at the reasoning behind this research, and think, \"that makes a lot of sense.\" But when push comes to shove, it's hard to pass up guaranteed increases in income. Those annual bumps are hard, quantifiable numbers that you can rely on. Your emotional state isn't nearly as easy to measure or count on. \nBut that's where relying on the research comes in. We know that we can hedonically adapt to both a higher and lower level of consumption. It makes far more sense to adapt down -- say, by cutting back on spending by 10% now to retire ASAP -- and focus on time affluence to provide your with satisfaction. Otherwise, if you wait until 67 to file for benefits, you'll be adapting \"up\" and are likely to either (1) count on more \"stuff\" to provide contentment -- which is a losing battle -- or (2) realize that you could've called it quits and started the next phase of your life much sooner. \nThe $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

      "text": "Amazon, Intel Partner to Advance Smart Home Tech By PC Mag ME Team Dec. 4, 2016, 5 p.m. The tech giants are coming together to 'extend natural language capabilities to consumers everywhere.' \nFrom Amazon Echo and the Nest Learning Thermostat to Philips Hue light bulbs and the August Smart Lock , there are already loads of gadgets on the market that can make your home a little smarter. Now, two tech giants — Amazon and Intel — are coming together to \"advance the Smart Home ecosystem and extend natural language capabilities to consumers everywhere.\" \nThe companies on Thursday unveiled two new technology initiatives to further that mission. For starters, they're working together on Intel-based smart speaker reference designs that will feature Amazon Alexa. The new designs are meant to \"help hardware manufacturers accelerate their development of voice-enabled devices with the Intel platform and Alexa Voice Services ,\" Intel and Amazon said . Developers and manufacturers should be able to check out the designs at some point in the first quarter of 2017. \n\"Amazon and Intel see a tremendous opportunity to bring the benefits of a personal voice experience to millions of new consumers and are collaborating to encourage developers and device manufacturers to extend natural voice interaction to more products via Amazon Alexa,\" Amazon's Ted Karczewski wrote in a blog post . Related Articles The Best Smart Home Devices of 2016 \nOn top of that, Intel is making it easier for its customers to bring voice control features to their connected products by adding Alexa to its Smart Home Hub. \n\"A truly smart home is one that provides users with experiences that ease the tasks of running a home and enrich daily life,\" Karczewski wrote. \"With voice as the central interface, customers have an even more natural way to manage the hundreds of tasks they experience every day.\"",

      "text": "December 4, 2016 • Armando Roggio \nAmazon, Walmart, Target, Costco, and other large retailers have competitive advantages over small ecommerce or brick-and-click businesses, making it difficult to compete on identical products. But this does not mean that small businesses cannot be profitable and successful. \nCompeting with ecommerce behemoths like Amazon is a popular topic in the retail community. Practical Ecommerce receives countless press releases and pitch emails describing how a new platform, new tool, or new technique will allow small ecommerce businesses to compete with Amazon and the like. \nSome of the pitch letters we receive imagine that Amazon, Walmart, and similar companies are small business killers, crushing mom-and-pop shops with extra low prices and superior logistics. They imply that these companies have unfairly usurped retail and the only way to attack and slay these monsters is to use the solution the letter is promoting. \nIn truth, many, if not most, small retail businesses online or off don’t really need to compete with Amazon or Walmart. They probably should not even try. Large Retailers Have a Competitive Advantage \nIf your small-or-medium sized ecommerce business is selling a product identical to one that Amazon carries, Amazon likely has several competitive advantages over your business. This is especially true if you are “selling” in the traditional retail sense. \nBecause Amazon is both a retailer and a marketplace, you can buy items there directly from Amazon or from a third-party retailer, and, thus, see examples of these competitive advantages. If you are selling an identical product and competing in a traditional retail sense, Amazon has significant competitive advantage. \nOn December 1, 2016, four merchants on the Amazon marketplace were selling six packs of black, Adidas men’s athletic crew socks for shoe sizes six to 12. These merchants included Amazon, Botach Tactical, ShoeMall, and Soccer Firm. \nAmazon offered the lowest price for the socks at $14.89. The highest price was $18. While these retail prices do not tell us what Amazon or any of these merchants pay (wholesale) for these socks, Amazon presumably believes that it can meet its sales and profit goals selling this package of socks for much less than its smaller competitors. This ability to offer a lower price is a competitive advantage. \nAmazon is making two free shipping offers. Amazon Prime members will simply get free shipping. Other Amazon customers will get free shipping with a total order of $49 or more. \nWhile two of the other sellers are also making free shipping offers, Amazon’s is better. Prime members who ordered on December 1 would likely receive the socks by no later than December 5 and some Prime customers could receive the socks by December 2 or 3. The earliest expected delivery date for the socks from other sellers was December 7. \nAmazon has a much larger and more developed fulfillment infrastructure. The company is built to rapidly pack and ship orders. There are few occasions when a small retailer will be able to ship more efficiently and inexpensively than Amazon. Sell Different or Protected Products \nGiven these advantages, it can be very difficult to compete with Amazon, Walmart, and other large retailers on identical products. \nRather than trying to sell directly against Amazon, small-and-mid-sized retailers may want to either sell different products not typically found on Amazon and similar sites or sell products that are, in a sense, protected with manufacturer approved pricing — MAP. \nFor example, if you wanted to purchase Topman White Cactus Badge Tube Socks, you would need to buy them from Topman. You cannot find them on the Amazon site or on the Walmart site. Thus, Topman does not have to compete with Amazon directly. Topman sells socks that Amazon does not. While the two companies do compete in the sense that both sell socks, Topman has a way to differentiate and thus does not experience the full weight of Amazon’s competitive advantages. \nCertainly, there is competition in the sense that both retailers are selling socks, but there are differences in the products offered. Topman does not need a lower price for its socks since Amazon is not offering an identical product. Topman does not have to compete against Amazon’s logistics because it is not selling an identical product. \nSimilarly, an online store that sells custom t-shirts does not have to compete directly with Amazon or Walmart. While all three — the t-shirt retailer, Amazon, and Walmart — will compete in the sense that all sell t-shirts, they do not compete for a particular shirt. For example, the Double X Colorful Offset Men’s T-shirt shown in the picture below is not available from Walmart. While many online retailers sell t-shirts, no other retailer sells this particular design. Sell Products in a Different Way \nYou can also sell products differently than Amazon or Walmart. \nBarkBox is a subscription service offering a monthly selection of curated dogs treats and toys. Each month, BarkBox customers receive a themed collection of items for their beloved pet. BarkBox sells some of the same products that other stores like Amazon or Walmart do, but it sells those products in a different manner. \nIn a given month, there will be between four and six items in the BarkBox. Some of these items will be unique to BarkBox. But many are items you can buy from large retailers like Amazon. For example, recent BarkBox shipments have included Sojos brand dog treats, which one can buy from Amazon. Amazon and BarkBox both sell, in a sense, Sojos dog treats,. But consumers shop with BarkBox for different reasons than shopping with Amazon. \nNonetheless, BarkBox is not really competing with Amazon, because it sells differently than Amazon. While it is true that both sell identical products — Sojos treats, for example — what BarkBox subscribers are buying is fundamentally an experience, not a product. \nGORUCK sells rucksacks, gym bags, fitness gear, and apparel. In general, shoppers can buy similar items from Amazon, but GORUCK doesn’t really compete with Amazon. In fact, GORUCK has, in part, built its business around customer relationships. The company hosts military style training events. GORUCK’s training events allow it to connect with its customers on a personal level. \nGORUCK customers have personal relationships with the company. They have, oftentimes, been to GORUCK events and met GORUCK instructors. When they buy a rucksack they are not comparing specs or shipping estimates. They are, instead, buying from a trusted advisor and expert in the field. Competing Differently \nThe ecommerce industry likes to talk about competing with Amazon and other large retailers. Some would even demonize them for using their competitive advantages like price and logistics. But these companies are really just using their strengths to serve customers. \nSmall-and-mid-sized retailers can also play to their strengths. They can find success and profit without trying to outsell a larger, better-equipped competitor. Armando Roggio",

      "text": "You probably caught video a few weeks back of Alexa speaking through Big Mouth Billy Bass, a singing fish that got popular in the late 1990s.\nIf you haven’t seen it yet, take a moment to watch and enjoy.\n\nThe animatronic fish is a good reminder that Amazon’s Alexa does not just come in speakers like Amazon Echo or Echo Dot.\nThe Alexa Voice Service (AVS) can be used to put Alexa inside a wide range of devices, and since it’s in the cloud, Alexa can operate without dependency on a local device for computing power.\nWith Amazon deep learning services and the Lex bot framework announced today , people can expect to see and interact with Alexa in places way beyond an Echo or animatronic fish.\nRaspberry Pi These credit card-sized computers have been used to put Alexa inside coffee makers, a toy car, and a motorized wheelchair. Amazon has templates and a guide available on Github .\nBig Mouth Billy Bass was made with Arduino Uno, a microcontroller board.\nAn update to Amazon Voice Service in October made it possible to create your own wake word , the word used to signal Alexa that it should start listening to you. A wake word means Alexa can become a truly hands free interface.\nAlexa with Raspberry Pi cannot call on music subscriptions for sites like Spotify like you can with an Amazon Echo or Tap, but it can give a user remarkable custom control, and access to thousands of skills.\nIn the United Kingdom, games room retailer Liberty Games uses Alexa and Raspberry Pi computers to control pinball machines, arcade games, and pool tables.\nhttps://www.libertygames.co.uk/videos/blog/echo-games-room.mp4 Can of Pringles If you want to MacGyver your own Alexa like and Arduino and Raspberry Pi owners, you can also make a can of Pringles into your personal Alexa.\nTurn Your Pringles Can into an #AmazonEcho with C.H.I.P.! — Blog. by Next ThingRainbow Chip Icon https://t.co/S9R6u6yxkP #IoT #Smarthome pic.twitter.com/Xi2f4AFaF4 \n— David Isbitski (@thedavedev) November 17, 2016 \n\nWatches and wearables In April the Amazon Alexa Developers blog called Cowatch the first Alexa-enabled smart watch.\nCowatch, made by iMCO Technology raised $291,000 in an Indiegogo campaign in June . It operates with native apps on the Android-based Cronologics platform .\nMeanwhile, smartwatch maker Pebble raised $12 million in a Kickstarter campaign this summer for its clip-on Core product. Core will have Alexa and will ship to customers by January 2017.\nThe Information reported today that Fitbit is in talks to acquire Pebble .\nHome robots \nOmate Yumi stands 11 inches tall and has a five-inch touchscreen for a face and speakers for a body.\nYumi does have wheels but don’t let them fool you. The diminutive creature is not intended to rove around your house like R2-D2. The wheels allow Omate Yumi to turn and face you when you talk, not to be a fully mobile robot.\nWith 16 days left, Yumi has raised $13,000 toward a $30,000 goal on Indiegogo , and doesn’t appear to have attracted many buyers.\nAbove: Samsung Family Hub Smart Fridge\nRefrigerators, home appliances, and cars Samsung’s Family Hub Smart Fridge has a giant 21-inch touchscreen. It looks like a giant Android phone on the side of a fridge, and allows you to speak with Alexa.\nOther consumer home appliances to incorporate Alexa this year include the Nucleus home intercom system (with support from the Amazon Alexa Fund ) and Sonos speakers.\nNothing strange about the idea of AI-powered assistants inside WiFi and bluetooth speakers, but home appliances are the sort of devices people can expect to hear and speak to a lot more in the future.\nAnd not be outdone by smart homes are smart cars — perhaps the most unnerving, but most obvious place to speak with Alexa. Hyundai, Tesla , and BMW have all given Alexa control their vehicles.\nIf this list tells us anything, it’s that Amazon Echo was just the beginning for Alexa. We’re already seeing the voice of Amazon trickle into all manner of other devices.\n",

      "title": "Amazon Snowmobile service is a semi-truck with a giant hard drive",
      "text": "Reddit \nLast week, Amazon announced a new service for uploading large amounts of data to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage. Dubbed Snowmobile , it’s an actual 18-wheel semi-truck hauling a storage container filled with hard drives. See, it’s not meant for times when you need to back up your photo or video collection, but rather for an entire company’s data, such as a movie studio’s archives or a government agency’s library of satellite imagery. \nFor any company that orders the service, the AWS Snowmobile truck will drive to their data center and connect its hard drives to the servers via a fiber connection. From there, the truck can carry up to 100 petabytes (that’s 1 million gigabytes) of data, drive it back to Amazon’s data centers, and upload to cloud storage. \nSnowmobile is an expansion on Amazon’s existing Snowball service, where they ship a 80TB storage unit to customers, who then load it up with data over a 10Gbps connection. When finished, the Snowball unit is shipped back to Amazon and uploaded to their servers. At an even smaller scale Amazon already lets users ship their standard hard drives to be put in the cloud. Snowmobile is just this same idea but on a massive scale. \nWhile using a physical truck to transport data around the country may seem impractical, it turns out to be faster than trying to upload it directly. Amazon points out that it would take more than 20 years to upload 100 petabytes of data, even with a fiber connection. With Snowmobile, a drive from New York to Los Angeles combined with the data transfer time is just 10 days. \nAs for pricing, Amazon charges based on how much data is on the truck per month, with rates starting at $0.005 per gigabyte. A fully loaded Snowmobile could come out to roughly $500,000, which is pretty decent deal considering the trucks are temperature controlled, tamper-resistant, and water-resistant, as well as being escorted by security personnel, with GPS tracking, alarm monitoring, and 24/7 video surveillance.",

      "text": "Microsoft is planning to build a HomeHub feature into future Windows 10 updates to better compete against devices like Google Home and Amazon’s Echo. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell The Verge that the feature is currently in the planning stages, and the software maker is expected to introduce a “HomeHub” in updates due in 2017 and 2018, and not the upcoming Creators Update. \nWindows Central reports that the feature will “crush” Google Home and Amazon Echo, but The Verge understands that HomeHub is designed to be a service and feature that will run on any Windows 10 PC and turn it into a machine where Cortana can be summoned from the lockscreen to provide useful information. Windows Central previously reported that the HomeHub was a voice-activated speaker that was supposed to be unveiled at Microsoft’s Surface hardware event back in October. Those reports were inaccurate, but Microsoft is planning a software feature with the same name.\nThe primary focus for HomeHub is to create a family environment for a PC. Microsoft has tried a variety of different methods to enable family accounts, privacy controls, and app sharing over the years, but HomeHub is part of a new Family team in the Windows group at Microsoft, sources tell us. Mary Jo Foley at ZDNet reports that Microsoft has been hiring people into this team, with a focus on a family environment for Windows.\nWindows 10 HomeHub Welcome Screen concept by Windows Central Windows Central has obtained some concept plans for HomeHub, including the ability to share appointments, apps, and other data on a PC without it being logged into an account. This would allow a PC to be used like a Google Home or Amazon Echo, for queries via Cortana and for simple access to apps. Microsoft is experimenting with the idea of a Welcome Screen, with a fullscreen interface that will display items as if they’re a virtual fridge door for families. This type of software could enable third-party PC makers to create more kitchen-like devices to compete with Amazon’s Echo.\nMicrosoft is planning to enable Cortana to be the center of its HomeHub initiative, and the integration will allow the assistant to provide HomeHub-like features across iOS and Android. This will include extending the assistant to control smart devices and manage them from the Windows 10 HomeHub feature. Microsoft’s HomeHub plans are currently in the planning phases, so many features will likely change and the interface itself could be entirely cut out of future Windows 10 updates. Microsoft has largely been left out of the emergence of the smart home, despite having Cortana running on the Xbox One . The HomeHub is Microsoft’s bet to try and control the ecosystem before Amazon, Google, or even Apple provide the best framework to manage devices in your home.",

      "text": "  Top Scientists: Amazon's Tapajós Dam Complex \"a Crisis in the Making\"   Claire Salisbury , Mongabay | Report Tweet \nThe Tapajós River, Brazil. More than 40 dams would turn this free-flowing river and its tributaries into a vast industrial waterway threatening the Tapajós Basin's ecosystems, wildlife, people and even the regional and global climate. (Photo: International Rivers on Flickr, licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) license) \nBrazil is forging ahead with plans to build a vast hydropower dam complex in the heart of the Amazon that would convert the now remote and wild Tapajós river system into a tamed industrial waterway for the purpose of transporting soybeans -- development that scientists and NGOs say will threaten Amazonian biodiversity , ecosystems, traditional livelihoods, indigenous cultures, and the global climate. \nA total of 42 large dams are planned or under construction in the Tapajós Basin, a biologically and culturally rich region, and one of eight areas of Amazonian biological endemism . Fed by tributaries in the states of Mato Grosso, Rondônia and Amazonas, the main stem of the Tapajós flows northeast through Pará state, and drains into the Amazon River at the city of Santarém. The Basin covers 189,962 square miles (492,000 square kilometers) and is more than twice the size of the UK. \nIts forests and waterways are home to species such as the jaguar, giant otter, and river dolphin, as well as little-known and range-restricted species found nowhere else in the world. Many plants and animals here remain unknown to science. Traditional river communities and indigenous people rely upon the basin's natural resources for their livelihoods. \nA lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) swimming across a river. This is just one of many threatened species in the Tapajós region, a vast area recognized as one the Amazon's eight areas of biological endemism. (Photo © Tom Ambrose) \nDams are slated for construction on the Tapajós River, as well as on its principal tributaries, the Jamanxim, Juruena and Teles Pires rivers; the 7 major dams prioritized in Brazil's 2013-2022 Ten Year Energy Expansion Plan for the Tapajós River and Teles Pires Basin would together put 1,479.5 square miles (3,831.9 square kilometers) underwater. \nAmazon Scientists: \"Effects Would Clearly Be Devastating\" \nThe recent suspension of the largest of these, the São Luiz do Tapajós dam, was hailed as a conservation and human rights victory: if it remains unbuilt, then 280 square miles (722 square kilometers) of forest will be spared inundation. There is, however, concern that this dam won't stay dead, with rumblings throughout Brazil's Temer administration that the suspension of São Luiz do Tapajós will be reversed. \nBut no matter: there will be many severe impacts from the more than 40 other dams, especially when all of them are considered together, warns Philip Fearnside, an expert on Amazonian development and deforestation. Reservoirs flood forests, displace people, emit greenhouse gases (especially in the tropics), and disrupt the flow of water downstream and between river channels and floodplains. \nIn opening up barge and ship navigation from Mato Grosso state to the Amazon River and the Atlantic Ocean, the industrial waterway will promote the expansion of the soy industry, driving further major deforestation in the Amazonian interior. Negative interactions between dam construction, industry, and additional infrastructure -- including major new roads and railways -- coupled with human migration into the region, will trigger a cascade of indirect impacts on the forest ecosystem, unless plans are changed drastically to mitigate these impacts. \n\"The effects would clearly be devastating, both for the ecology and connectivity of the greater Tapajós Basin as well as for its diverse groups of indigenous peoples,\" William Laurance, a professor at James Cook University, Australia, and a leading authority on tropical rainforest ecology, told Mongabay. \"It is not overstating matters to term this a crisis in the making.\" \nA female jaguar (Panthera onca) pauses on a riverbank. Even species that aren't typically associated with rivers, such as jaguars, make use of riverbanks to hunt for prey. (Photo © Tom Ambrose) \nStewart Maginnis, global director of IUCN's Nature-based Solutions Group, and former director of its Forest and Climate Change Program, shares this concern: \"The impacts on freshwater biodiversity, indigenous people, and the opening up of new areas for agriculture bring the risk of further deforestation and land-use changes in the Amazon Basin.\" \nDespite the immensity of these potential impacts, the public is still mostly unaware of the \"complexity and ambitions\" of the plans in the Tapajós, says prominent Amazon conservation biologist Thomas Lovejoy, director of the Center for Biodiversity and Sustainability at George Mason University, and senior fellow at the UN Foundation. \nPlan Benefits Construction Firms, Energy Industry and Agribusiness \nOne factor driving the so-called \"Tapajós Complex\" forward is the Brazilian government's appetite for hydroelectric energy production and for funding big infrastructure projects . \nFearnside argues that these national energy needs have not only been \"greatly exaggerated,\" but that they could easily be met by alternative power sources. \"The projections [of Brazil's future energy needs] ignore all limits, [and forecast] astronomical electricity use within a few years,\" statistics that are then used to justify the planned hydroelectric projects, he says. \nThe building of mega-dams (including the recently completed but controversial Belo Monte Dam ) has hugely benefited Brazil's gigantic construction firms , along with the nation's ruling political parties, who in the past have received very generous campaign contributions from contract-winning companies. \nConstruction is already underway at the São Manoel dam site on the Teles Pires river, with three other dams completed or nearing completion. The Teles Pires is a major tributary of the Tapajós River. (Photo by International Rivers on Flickr, licensed under an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) license) \n\"The first priority [for Brazil should be] to use less electricity,\" argues Fearnside, a professor at Brazil's National Institute of Research in the Amazon (INPA). And if the country needs to move beyond energy efficiency to increase production, then \"Brazil has enormous potential for wind and solar power.\" \nAnother driving force behind the Tapajós Dam Complex is the \"tremendous pressure\" from the soy industry, which stands to reap major benefits from the cheap improved transportation afforded by the industrial waterway. That is coupled with the importance of soy exports to the Brazilian economy, significance vastly magnified by the current urgency of Brazil's severe economic crisis. \nTogether, these factors mean that \"there is much political willingness to facilitate [Tapajós development] regardless of the consequences\" asserts Fearnside. Links between government and agribusiness are stronger than ever, with one of Brazil's largest soy planters, Blairo Maggi, recently appointed as the Minister for Agriculture. \"The largest of the Maggi family's 12 properties would be served by the first branch of the planned waterway, the Teles Pires branch,\" Fearnside notes. \nBecause hydroelectric projects facilitate lock-building and the flooding of otherwise impassable rapids, the 40+ new dams are inextricably linked with, and vital to, the planned industrial waterway. Laurance and Fearnside see the resulting \"all-or-nothing\" approach to dam construction as especially dangerous. Without the need for the industrial waterway some hydroelectric dams might not be a priority for the government at all. \nIn the Name of National Security \nA major concern in the Tapajós Basin is that the government will turn a blind eye to potential social and ecological impacts, bulldozing a path forward. In the past, the Brazilian government has repeatedly used national \"security suspensions\" as a means of overturning environmental licensing restrictions and thwarting social resistance to major infrastructure projects including dams, opting instead for economic growth -- which is deemed a national security imperative. \nThis legal provision is a holdover from Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship. Indeed, the \"security suspension\" provision has already been used to make way for four new dams already under construction on the Teles Pires River, a Tapajós tributary. Though a judge ordered two of those dams stopped, the decision was overruled via a \"security suspension.\" \nSoy and forest in the Brazilian Amazon. The soy industry will be one of the main beneficiaries of the Tapajós industrial waterway, which will open up barge and ship navigation between Mato Grosso state, the Amazon River, Atlantic ports and beyond. Because dams facilitate lock-building, and the flooding of formerly impassable rapids, they and their reservoirs are inextricably linked with the plans for the waterway. Scientists are concerned about the resulting \"all or nothing\" approach to this rapid infrastructure development. (Photo by Rhett A. Butler) \nMeanwhile numerous measures are being moved through the Brazilian Congress that, if passed, could fast track the dams. In addition, the government -- apparently in preparation for Tapajós Complex construction -- has in recent years quietly reduced the size of major federally protected areas along the region's rivers, eliminating protections to floodplains in order to anticipate and prevent any legal conflict with the dams and their reservoirs when the projects were finally initiated. \nThe fear among NGOs and indigenous groups is that government officials are setting the stage to quickly green light dam construction throughout the Tapajós Basin. \"Governmental indifference, bordering on hostility, to the natural systems in the earth's last large tropical forest ecosystem is nothing short of outrageous,\" says Lawrence Hurd, a professor at Washington and Lee University, USA. \nHydrological Impacts \nOne of the most immediate and direct effects of any dam is the obstruction of water: downstream flow, seasonal fluctuations, and natural flood pulses are all diminished and controlled by dams and reservoirs -- doubly so in rainforests which can fluctuate between very wet flood seasons, and very dry seasons with low water. \nDams interrupt essential natural connections, blocking the flow of nutrients, sediments, and aquatic life between headwaters and river channels downstream, and across floodplains. \n\"Hydrological connections sustain the ecological, economic and cultural integrity of the Tapajós River system,\" Woods Hole Research Center, USA, scientist Marcia Macedo explains. \"The Tapajós Hydroelectric Complex would fundamentally change the flow of water\" in the basin. \nMichael Coe, an earth system scientist also at Woods Hole, sees the \"complete re-engineering of the free-flowing river system\" as a real cause for concern, because \"even very small changes in flow timing and magnitude can cause very large changes in ecosystem processes. In particular, I worry about the health and viability of the riparian zones along these rivers,\" says Coe. \nA nesting beach used by the Giant Amazon River Turtle (Podocnemis expansa). The reservoirs created by Tapajós Basin dams will flood hundreds of square miles, and radically alter the flow of water within the river systems. Aquatic and floodplain habitats will be altered and destroyed, including nesting beaches such as this one.

Once consumed by fish, the toxin bio-accumulates up the food chain; those at the top, such as large predators and people, consume the highest quantities of this toxic metal which poses a serious health risk. Amazon dams have sometimes shown dangerous levels of methylmercury -- a real risk on the Tapajós , which already sees high concentrations of this toxic compound in some parts of the river. \nAll of these negative hydrological impacts are compounded and magnified when multiple dams are built in series along the same river, or in a river system, which would happen all across the Tapajós Complex. \nBut despite these clear cumulative impacts being \"much larger than the sum of the parts\" as Coe puts it, threats are always evaluated by the government on a dam-by-dam basis, and cumulative impacts are not considered. \nMany scientists argue that for the Tapajós Complex to be evaluated properly, all the dams must be analyzed together and in advance, in order to gain a clear perspective regarding the cumulative environmental effects of altered flows. \nBiodiversity Impacts \nThe hydrological changes wrought by the construction of the Tapajós dams will have profound effects on the species living within the freshwater ecosystem: connectivity is crucial for healthy and genetically diverse populations. \nA rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum) caught in the act. Species such as this will see both their habitat and their fish prey impacted by dam construction. (Photo © Tom Ambrose) \"It is easy to predict the overall impact of dams on fish species communities: diversity will decrease both above and below the dams, some species will go extinct locally and, because tropical fish often have limited ranges of occurrence, regionally as well,\" Hurd, who studies tropical fish diversity, told Mongabay. \nMitigating these impacts is all but impossible, he explains. That's why he sees the development of the Tapajós as a looming \"environmental disaster.\" Dams change water flow, depth, temperature, sedimentation, and oxygen levels, and Amazonian \"[f]ish species are exquisitely adapted to these environmental characteristics.\" \nThe dams would also act as barriers to movement and migration, making annual spawning runs upstream impossible for many species, says WWF-Brazil's science program coordinator Mariana Napolitano Ferreira. Dam-obstructed migration has already been documented for giant catfish elsewhere in the Amazon basin. Although some efforts to incorporate fish ladders into dams have been made in the past, these have not been successful . And even if fish are able to somehow return upstream to spawn, juvenile fish coming back downstream may find their way past dams impassable. \nChanges in fish populations will be felt by their predators, including two species of river dolphin, says researcher Claryana Araújo, of the Federal University of Goiás, Brazil. Freshwater dolphins also risk population fragmentation and isolation by some of the planned dams, she says. \nTurtles will lose habitats and nesting beaches to dam reservoirs. \"[I]nundating such massive areas of forest will destroy the populations of 11 species of turtles,\" with 6 facing complete extirpation due to the destruction of their foraging habitat and nesting areas, Richard Vogt, turtle conservationist at INPA, told Mongabay. \nSome species, such as the giant Amazon river turtle ( Podocnemis expansa ) migrate hundreds of kilometers to return to their historic nesting beaches over their 80-100 year lifespans, Vogt explains, so \" destroying these sites will affect the integrity of these populations\" and \"disrupt the ability of these species to find mates.\" \nA pair of capped herons (Pilherodius pileatus).

(Photo © Tom Ambrose) With Tapajós Basin reservoirs putting thousands of hectares of forest underwater, hundreds of species living on river islands, along riverbanks, and within the floodplain forest would see their habitat disappear. Numerous protected conservation areas and their forests and wetlands would be affected too. \nThreatened species in the region include the giant armadillo ( Priodontes maximus ), giant anteater ( Myrmecophaga tridactyla ), white-cheeked spider monkey ( Ateles marginatus ), and oncilla, or little spotted cat ( Leopardus tigrinus ). \nConstruction of the Tapajós Complex would also see the \"[d]irect loss of habitat for many bird species,\" Alexander Lees, an ornithologist at Cornell University, USA, told Mongabay. \"The region is home to a suite of restricted range bird species, all of which are poorly known and already at risk of global extinction because of forest loss.\" \nThose at greatest risk include the Golden-crowned Manakin ( Lepidothrix vilasboasi ); the Tapajós Hermit ( Phaethornis aethopygus ); the Tapajós Scythebill ( Campylorhamphus cardosoi ), which was only recently described by science; and the Cone-billed Tanager ( Conothraupis mesoleuca ) \"which remains Critically Endangered and very poorly known,\" Lees says. \nOnce indirect deforestation is taken into account -- due to the building of dam service roads, electric transmission lines, plus towns to support construction workers -- habitat loss and fragmentation becomes even more serious. \nLaurance, who has studied the impacts of road construction on deforestation, sees this indirect impact as an even greater threat to forest cover than the dams themselves. \"Such roads frequently open a Pandora's Box of illegal activities, such as forest encroachment, wildfires, poaching, illegal logging, that are highly destructive to forests and wildlife,\" he states. \nSocial and Economic Impacts \nFor the many thousand people belonging to indigenous groups and traditional riverine communities in the Basin, rivers and forests are central to their way of life, and the Tapajós Complex will bring unwelcome change. But even people living in cities are being affected by the vast undertaking. The cities of Santarem and Itaituba have, for example, already been impacted as soy port infrastructure has been put in place, bringing new jobs, but also adding to urban problems such as pollution, crime and overcrowding. \nIndigenous Munduruku living on the Teles Pires River taking part in a mapping workshop.

Their loss would force the Basin's human population to look elsewhere to meet its protein needs. \nCamila Jericó-Daminello, a research analyst with the Conservation Strategy Fund (CSF), studied the possible economic impacts of just one of the dams, the São Luiz do Tapajós project, were it to go ahead. \"Considering negative economic impacts on household incomes, water provision, and climate regulation, the environmental costs associated with the project, but not formally accounted for [in official environmental assessments], are at least BRL $1.9 billion (USD $590 million) considering a 30 year timeframe,\" she observes. \n\"Despite the scale of these costs, almost no information about the dam had until recently been shared with civil society and local populations,\" says Jericó-Daminello. \nThe main stem of the Tapajós River, one of the last great undammed rivers of the Amazon.

The full social and economic price of the Tapajós Complex have yet to be analyzed, and no overall evaluation has ever been put before the people most likely to be impacted. \nAs Isabel Rosa, a researcher at the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research notes, Brazil has a large indigenous population deeply reliant on the Amazon rainforest: \"If the Brazilian legal system is not doing its job in protecting its citizens' interests, who will?\" \nClimate Impacts \nAlthough dams are traditionally promoted as clean energy sources, there is increasing recognition among scientists and policymakers that hydropower reservoirs (especially in the tropics) are far from green: carbon dioxide and methane -- a greenhouse gas more than 20 times as potent as CO 2 -- are both released in significant amounts from organic matter in submerged soils and decaying vegetation. \nThe Amazon's living forest usually acts as a carbon sink, sequestering CO 2 and keeping it out of the atmosphere. \"Accelerated forest loss\" due to reservoirs and further forest clearance for roads, from illegal logging and other causes, will therefore \"have significant impacts in terms of carbon emissions,\" Rosa notes. Coe adds that \"Brazil's contribution to global climate change\" would increase as a result. \n\"The worst-case scenario indicates an indirect effect of infrastructure development [in the Tapajós] of over 200,000 square kilometers [77,220 square miles] of deforestation,\" reveals climatologist Carlos Nobre, program scientist of Brazil's National Institute for Climate Change, which would be \"very serious,\" with \"some level of regional climate change, such as increased temperatures,\" expected if deforestation on this scale takes place. \nA storm over an agricultural landscape in the Braziliam Amazon. The Amazon forest generates more than half of its own rainfall, and deforestation affects the way water is recycled into the atmosphere, with forest clearance leading to more drought.

Butler) \nScientists know that the loss of forest cover changes the way water cycles through an ecosystem, with less water returned to the atmosphere. Because the Amazon generates much of its own rain through this evapotranspiration process, major deforestation can lead to rainfall reductions, and, in the extreme, to severe drought. \nThese rainfall losses won't only be felt in the Amazon: 'Well over half of the rain that falls over Southern Brazil [beyond the Amazon's boundaries] is originally put into the atmosphere by trees in the Amazon Basin,\" says Abby Swann, a scientist studying the links between ecosystems and climate at Washington University, USA. \nOne consequence of this forest clearance/reduced rainfall relationship is significantly lower river levels, which would reduce the generating capacity and economic viability of the hydropower dams that triggered the deforestation in the first place. \nThe outlook over the longer-term is uncertain, but these climatic impacts could be devastating, not just for Brazil but for our planet. \n\"I think the Amazon is pretty close, at 20 percent deforestation, to the tipping point of unraveling the hydrological cycle right now,\" said Amazon researcher Lovejoy. \"The historic droughts of 2005 and 2010, and the drought this year, are, I believe, early flickers and warnings.\" \nLovejoy sees the combined deforestation impacts of the Tapajós Complex as potentially sufficient to \"push the system beyond the tipping point,\" meaning that rainfall levels would decrease to the extent that they could no longer maintain the current Amazon ecosystem. The rainforests would begin to die. \nIf that happens, another tipping point is of concern to scientists: the time at which the Amazon rainforest as a whole stops sucking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and ceases being a carbon sink, and instead becomes a carbon source, sending the greenhouse gases long held in its trees into the sky. \nA night monkey ( Aotus sp .). With the coming of dams, indirect deforestation due to additional infrastructure (transmission lines, roads, enlarged settlements, etc.), pose an even greater threat to forest cover than the dams and reservoirs themselves. Amazon dams and the roads they spawn also increase access for illegal loggers. Rainforest wildlife suffer widespread habitat loss and fragmentation as a result. (Photo by Rhett A. Butler) \nAlarmingly, indications of such a shift are already showing up, even without the massive deforestation projected for the Tapajós Basin. Record 21 st century droughts have temporarily shut down the Amazon carbon sink -- another example of those SOS \"flickers and warnings\" coming from the Amazon ecosystem. A permanent shutdown would have huge implications for the global climate, but predicting when this tipping point will be reached is not easy. \"[T]here is still a lot of uncertainty in how tropical forests are, and will, respond to climate change,\" Swann emphasizes. \nNobre's studies indicate that the threshold may lie not close to 20 percent deforestation as Lovejoy suggests, but at 40 percent deforestation. \"From that perspective, one should be cautious not to encourage further deforestation because there are other drivers of change [that are] also reasons of concern,\" he says. For example, warming of 4 degrees Celsius would also trigger serious feedbacks within the forest system, so \"unchecked global warming presents a great danger of reaching a tipping point.\" \nThe truth is that our science isn't yet robust enough to know precisely where these tipping points are. But scientists like Lovejoy and Nobre warn that our wholesale destruction of Amazon forests is playing with fire. In a recent interview , when asked what he saw as the greatest threat to the Amazon, Lovejoy responded: \"The intersection between uncoordinated infrastructure and the hydrological cycle.\" \nCalls for Action \nScientists and NGOs say that Brazilian hydropower development needs to change in two major ways if this \"crisis in the making\" is to be averted. First, the infrastructure licensing process must be strengthened, not weakened. Second, the cumulative effects of multiple dam development across entire drainage basins must be considered and respected during the planning process. \n\"The biggest policy priority for freshwater conservation in the Amazon is restructuring the legal process for approval of large hydroelectric projects like the Tapajós Dam Complex,\" Macedo says. \n\"Social and environmental externalities need to be included in cost benefit analyses and used during decision making processes,\" Jericó-Daminello adds. \"Indigenous people's rights must also be recognized, including [their] involvement throughout the licensing process and in providing consent (or not!) for projects.\" \nA royal flycatcher ( Onychorhynchus coronatus ). Scientists urge Brazil to take an integrated, basin-wide approach to hydropower development in the Amazon, and to pursue alternatives to hydropower for energy production in order to protect the region's vast web of life. (Photo © Tom Ambrose) \nFearnside sees a vigorous defense of the existing dam licensing process against the many attacks now underway in Brazil's Congress as an urgent priority. \"Despite its many problems, [the licensing system] is essential to keeping consideration of environmental and social impacts in the picture, as shown by the recent archiving of the São Luiz do Tapajós [dam],\" he asserts. \nEspecially alarming to Fearnside and others is that the Congress, partly under the aegis of Agriculture Minister Maggi, has gone so far as to propose a constitutional amendment (PEC 65) that would essentially gut environmental and indigenous protections. \nIntegrated, basin-wide assessments of dam impacts, and the maintenance of free-flowing rivers within watersheds, are just some of the approaches scientists are urging Brazil to adopt. \"It is of fundamental importance that the set of dams now being planned should be assessed as a set,\" says WWF-Brazil, in a report outlining their conservation vision for the Tapajós basin. \nScientific tools exist to facilitate this approach, which could form \"part of a proactive planning process for Brazil's energy infrastructure,\" says Jericó-Daminello, pointing to CSF's Hydrocalculator Tool, which includes evaluation of the social, economic and climate implications of proposed infrastructure developments -- an analysis that can be performed to include and compare multiple projects. Using this tool during the planning stage \"would greatly improve environmental and likely economic impacts.\" \nBut ultimately, a shift from hydropower to other sources of energy production is called for, say experts: \"Alternatives exist that allow the country to have a diversified energy matrix that is clean and secure and that would be competitive from the economic and environmental standpoint,\" WWF-Brazil states in their report. \n\"What is needed is forest restoration not further deforestation,\" concludes Lovejoy. \"I think it is time to rethink the plans for Amazon energy.\"   Claire Salisbury \nClaire Salisbury is a freelance environmental science writer regularly contributing to Mongabay , blog coordinator with the tropical reforestation research network People and Reforestation in the Tropics ( PARTNERS ) and volunteer consultant for nonprofit community forestry and carbon offset organization Taking Root , developing a protocol for biodiversity monitoring in their Nicaraguan project sites.

Pictures of The Grand Tour star's massive noggin on a truck have started circulating on Twitter, prompting speculation about what it's all for. Driving through Washington State. WTF? Is that @JeremyClarkson looking at me? pic.twitter.com/7iDt5Bzp3m \n— Charles John (@INeed_AnAdult) December 2, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n— Killa Can (@JudgmentalNYer) December 2, 2016 Fans on Reddit have suggested that the giant head is for filming in Washington State (and have been analysing the truck's number plate for clues). But others have pointed out that Amazon's offices are based in Seattle... leading to the possibility that the company is about to pay tribute to The Grand Tour 's success with a Mount Rushmore-esque giant statue of Clarkson (and possibly Hammond and May to boot). And while some have said it might not actually be Clarkson's head, others have spotted the letters \"JE\" and \"C\" on one of the truck's crates. Driving behind this giant stone head. Is it @JeremyClarkson ?? Anyone know what it’s for? pic.twitter.com/DhkyJl4nps ",

Those days are long gone, and now, of course, the online retailer sells pretty much everything.\nIn recent years, though, Amazon has moved well beyond just selling stuff, becoming a huge provider of cloud hosting through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. It's also a major maker of devices, with the various Echo and Fire TV models joining the Kindle e-reader and tablet lines. The company has also become an increasingly large player in the original content creation market as its Prime Video service has begun competing with major networks and Netflix for high-profile projects.\nAmazon has been more than an online retailer for many years, but its non-store businesses have become even more important in the past year.

      "text": "Amazon 12 Days of Deals Begins Today with Deals on Games and Toys December 4, 2016 by Will Run For Miles Leave a Comment \n\nEach year, in the days leading up to Christmas and Chanukah, Amazon presents 12 Days of Deals , divided into categories. \nHere are the 12 Days of Deals categories for the first 6 days: \nToday – Day 1 – is, of course, Toys and Games !! \nAs is often the case, some sales are good and some are just average. It is best to sift through the offerings each day, and see what exactly is presented. \nSome credit cards offer additional points or miles for purchases at Amazon. Discover offers 5% cashback on Amazon purchases this quarter, so that is the card I will use. If you are interested in applying for a Discover credit card, see the Credit Card Links tab at the top of this blog. \nDisclosure: I may receive compensation for some of the links on this blog, including certain credit card offers and other products displayed on this website.

      "text": "Day 7 to 15 Â - Take advantage of Amazon's freebies to authors to do promotions at no cost. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez Notice that so far, there is no cost to you to do this except time and maybe a larger SD card for photos and video. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez So check out what Amazon offers for authors and do all of them, including buying the printed version and getting the e-book at half price, discounts using a code, and much more. Reading and making sure you set this up may take you some time. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez However, if you get this activity done in a shorter time, use the remaining time to create more content to push out to your audience via the social media management platforms and your web site - Use this time to also create giveaways and contests for your audience. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez A platform such as Rafflecopter is really cool to work with, and there's a free plan, so take advantage of it. Â Day 10 to 20 Â - This may be the only time you really spend some money, and it wouldn't be a lot. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez mundinews.com I would say around US$30.00 for an ad campaign with Linkedin preferably. I would hold back on doing ads with Facebook . It's more social and for being viral, but LinkedIn has professional communities that you want to target and to increase your book's visibility. - Create more videos at this time and post on YouTube and make sure that you put in a text description with a link back to your book, authorcentral, giveaway, contest, and post. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez Facebook offers Facebook live video. I say, go for it! This is live interaction with your audience and you can share the link and giveaways or you can combine a giveaway with Facebook live. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez politica-venezuela.com Play around with the idea to make it fun. It's Christmas after all! Make it a party! Now, some of you reading this may think it's too much work, while others may go for it. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez What do you have to lose? Whip yourself into action for the next 20-days, starting today. You may get at least one book sold, and many eyes would definitely have seen and /or heard about you and your book. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez seguros-guia.com I know you will see results. Just be consistent, believe, have faith in your work, and have fun with it. The other thing is that this outline of a simple marketing plan for 20-days may seem linear, but many activities are happening at the same time, so there is some juggling involved, but take your vitamins, have a drink of your favourite beverage, and tell yourself that you can do this! I would be excited to hear the results you get from applying this. Feel free to email me and/or invite me to get involved in the blitz. ÂŠ Francisco VelĂĄsquez Consider it my way of giving back to you, my readers, both new and those who have remained loyal over the years. Wishing you well! - Corine La Font is a Speaker, Author, Coach and Self Publishing Consultant.

      "text": "Posted: Dec 4 2016, 10:21am CST | by Ahmed Humayun , in News | Technology News \nDon't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale \nPokémon Go team has accepted delayed loading issue in the game. While the permanent fix is being worked on, the team has suggested the workaround for the time being. Nintendo and Niantic’s Pokémon Go might not be the big aspect that it was a few months ago, but it still has a strong fan base that continues to roam the streets looking to pick up that different Pokémon before anyone else can. Don't Miss: How to Find NES Classic at Target Stores \nThe game is still hugely famous and known in the world over, so when gamers start to experience obstacles during their Pokémon hunting, Niantic is sure to hear about it. It is something that you need to know. What is happening right now exactly, with this many Pokémon Go fans reporting that they are facing the problem with the game that creates delayed loading? \nNobody likes latency, especially when they’re in the excited mode to catch them all. At least the internet, goes into full-blown meltdown mode or before the world in an attempt to get out ahead of the story, Pokémon Go team has ventured to overcome doubts that the game is lined-up for good by letting the user-base know that developers are apprised of the issue and that a dilemma is being served on. Trainers, there is a known bug causing delayed loading. We are working on a fix. As a workaround, you can restart the app in order to play.— Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) December 1, 2016 \nAnother good news is that there’s a workaround that users can follow to get things moving. The bad news? That workaround is just starting the game again. “Trainers, there is a known bug creating delayed loading. We are operating on a fix. As a workaround, you can just initiate the app again to play.” As far as workarounds go, that’s one of the biggest cop-outs going, but if it does make the game which could be played again, then it’s certainly better than nothing. \nThough, so here’s wishing the developers at Niantic have their thinking caps on for this one, A real fix is far better. It is also a possibility that the delay so far has been because of the Generation 2 update reported to be just around the edge. We were pretty much sure that a fix would appear soon enough because as we know that the developers have tweeted out the statement of the issue.",

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale New study suggests that changes in gut microbes can affect brain regions associated with controlling movement. \nFor the first time, researchers have found a connection between Parkinson’s disease and microbes living inside the stomach. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 \nBy conducting experiments on a mouse model, researchers from multiple institutes have showed how changes in gut microbes can affect the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. The findings could lead to better treatments for the brain disorder that continues to worsen over time. \n“We have discovered for the first time a biological link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease. More generally, this research reveals that a neurodegenerative disease may have its origins in the gut, and not only in the brain as had been previously thought, ” said senior study co- author Sarkis Mazmanian from California Institute of Technology. \n“The discovery that changes in the microbiome may be involved in Parkinson's disease is a paradigm shift and opens entirely new possibilities for treating patients.” \nParkinson’s is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in United States after dementia. The disease is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of protein called α-synuclein in the brain. The protein affects the brains regions that control the movement of the body, resulting in rigidity, muscle stiffness, shaking and slowness of movement. \nMany previous studies have also suggested connections between gut bacteria and Parkinson’s as well as other diseases but they could not show how the two might be interlinked. \nTo find out, researchers used genetically modified mice with Parkinson’s like disease and divided them into two sets. One set of mice had bacteria in their digestive tract while other was free of bacteria. \nThe germ-free mice were not accumulating protein in their brain cells. Thus, they showed fewer symptoms of the disease and performed better in motor skills test. Whereas, the mice with microbes begin to produce high levels of the protein in their brain cells and damaged brain areas attributed to controlling movement. \nNext researchers fed both sets of mice with chemicals replicating gut bacteria activity. At this time, germ-free bacteria also started to show symptoms of the disease in their brain. The study indicates that gut bacteria may play an important role in developing Parkinson’s disease. \n“Although exact causes of Parkinson’s disease are unknown, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays a strong role in the development of the disease.” Dr Nic Dzamko from Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA) said. \nIn the future, researchers are hoping to replicate the trail in humans, so they can get more insight into Parkinson’s disease causes and its possible treatment.",
