      "title": "Microsoft Surface Dial ads show the wonders you can create",
      "text": "Reddit \nAs fascinating as the Surface Studio might be, without one particular optional accessory, it’s really just a gigantic, but well endowed, Surface tablet. Microsoft all-in-one computer’s spellbinding appeal is thanks partly to the Surface Pen but probably more importantly thanks to the odd but fancy Surface Dial remote control. And to hammer down on how game changing this little puck can be, Microsoft has released not one, not even two or three, but five ads that show how, with the right app mixed with the right tool, great things can happen. \nWhen Microsoft unveiled the Surface Dial, one of the first apps it demoed was Sketchable. This third-party painting app made by a small startup exploded in popularity in the Windows Store, especially for the Surface Pro tablets, making it the perfect poster boy for the new device. In Sketchable, the Surface Dial takes on the role of a precision instrument, allowing artists to pick colors, select brush sizes, and rotate the canvas in a way that’s more precise than using touch but feels more natural than entering hard numbers. \nDrawboard was another app that was showcased early on. Unlike Sketchable, Drawboard is more of a document editing and annotation app. That doesn’t mean, however, that it won’t have use for the Surface Dial. Particularly interesting is how its developers have taken advantage of the accessory’s round nature and turned it into a digital protractor. \nSome within the same subject is Bluebeam, which is an engineering and architecture program. The interesting bit here is how the Dial becomes a sort of magnifying glass. When placed on the screen, its splits the view of the current document and where the Dial is place on one side will show zoomed up on the other side. \nMental Canvas takes the Surface Dial from 2D into the realm of 3D. While the Dial also functions like on Sketchable, allowing users to select colors and brush sizes at the twist of the, well, dial, it also has another function specific to Mental Canvas. In particular, it allows users to fly through the app’s unique 3D-esque space. \nAnd if you thought that the Surface Dial makes sense only to visual creatives, StaffPad would prove you wrong. The music writing apps has already been featured before in Microsoft’s Surface Pro marketing, and here it’s back for the Surface Dial. As the app has no need for colors and brushes, the Dial takes on a different duty in StaffPad, aside from interface navigation and playback controls. Amusingly, it functions like a rubber, cloning notes and measures from one place to another. \nWhile the Surface Studio itself won’t be available until next year, or late this year at the earliest, the Surface Dial will become available first. That’s because the rotary control can also be used by itself as a Bluetooth remote. That said, its magic really happens when you place it on a screen, but only the Surface Studio and, through a firmware update, the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book, are supported.",

      "text": "\nThe Garage started out in 2009 in Office Labs with a simple vision of giving people at Microsoft an opportunity to embrace their inner innovator and explore grassroots projects, mostly as side projects. Later, it was expanded company-wide allowing employees to experiment with their ideas. It connects Microsoft engineers and engineering projects with real customers to evaluate how technologies are being received. The Garage is now a global community of more than 10,000 hackers, coders and makers. Today, Microsoft is celebrating two years of The Garage.\nIn the last two years, The Garage has evolved from a 24-hour idea factory to a program dedicated to encouraging all employees to take their ideas and bring them to life. The Garage provides resources such as expert advisors, maker spaces, hackathon tools, workshops, an intern program, and product-market fit testing to empower employees to follow their passion and create a project that might just make it all the way into a Microsoft product.\n“The Garage is very focused on the bleeding edge of experimentation, moving forward at all times. We help Microsoft be better at experimenting, to be faster, to test ideas and to learn by doing,” says Jeff Ramos, partner director of The Garage. “We’ve really taken Satya Nadella’s challenge to be more customer obsessed seriously, putting projects in the hands of real customers.”\nRead their full feature story on Microsoft Garage here .

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft created the digital assistant Cortana to keep your calendars, notify you of texts and emails, and launch your applications through voice activation. But a new patent discovered by Network World reveals that her artificial intelligence might be getting improved in the future. \nThe patent published on November 3, 2016, is titled Providing Personalized Greetings on a Digital Assistant. Microsoft Technology then shares that the premise is to build greetings that draw from user-specific and contextual information. This means that Cortana would know the account’s name, birthday, work, weather, hobbies and more to say ‘Hello’ in different ways. \n“A goal of the personalized greeting system described herein is to mimic a human experience with the user. Providing the same greeting to the user twice in one day is not typical of how the user would be greeted by a human. As such, embodiments provide for mechanisms to alternate or rotate through a list of personalized greetings so that the experience is heightened for the user.” \nOne example is to say Happy Birthday to the user when they first check their email for the day, but then to wish them a wonderful day the second time they interact with Cortana. \nAnother example shows that the personalized greetings aren’t exclusive. Some could be combined such as “Welcome Home! The temperature is expected to be above 85 today!” loading location values and weather. Interests, hobbies, and even how busy you are on your calendar will all play a part in the selection of greetings thanks to a ranking system. \nIt looks like Cortana’s personalized greetings would be available across all devices and includes audio, text, voice, images, etc. This very well could be the next step for Cortana but as it is still a patent, we might not see it too soon.

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nBlockchain technology has plenty of potential to redefine how many different markets interact with data. Including Webjet, a travel booking website that handles transactions for hotels and sunhotels. \nToday, ZDNet reported that Webjet has announced a collaboration with Microsoft to reinvent hotel bookings. For them, the cost of data mismatches is getting too high. The industry standards currently leave much to be desired with millions of transactions that can result in 5%-10% discrepancies and cost billions of dollars. \nThe company hopes to use the blockchain technology released by Microsoft earlier this year as a means to correct those errors and make the industry more efficient. As John Guscic, managing director of Webjet, explained: \n“Blockchain eliminates transaction errors by having an indisputable record of truth. As we’ve tested the technology, we quickly realized it had the potential to improve processes with the rest of our travel partners who face similar complexities. It didn’t just benefit the Webjet environment; it could potentially assist every one of our partners in the supply chain to improve their efficiency.” \nCurrently, Webjet is still in the proof of concept phase. Soon, it will be switching over to phase 2 where trials of blockchain’s automated features to process transactions weekly will roll out across Hotels and Sunhotels. This all works forward to the ultimate goal of establishing the technology across the travel industry. In this story stream:",

      "text": "  \nBlockchain technology has plenty of potential to redefine how many different markets interact with data. Including Webjet, a travel booking website that handles transactions for hotels and sunhotels. \nToday, ZDNet reported that Webjet has announced a collaboration with Microsoft to reinvent hotel bookings. For them, the cost of data mismatches is getting too high. The industry standards currently leave much to be desired with millions of transactions that can result in 5%-10% discrepancies and cost billions of dollars. \nThe company hopes to use the blockchain technology released by Microsoft earlier this year as a means to correct those errors and make the industry more efficient. As John Guscic, managing director of Webjet, explained: \n“Blockchain eliminates transaction errors by having an indisputable record of truth. As we’ve tested the technology, we quickly realized it had the potential to improve processes with the rest of our travel partners who face similar complexities. It didn’t just benefit the Webjet environment; it could potentially assist every one of our partners in the supply chain to improve their efficiency.” \nCurrently, Webjet is still in the proof of concept phase. Soon, it will be switching over to phase 2 where trials of blockchain’s automated features to process transactions weekly will roll out across Hotels and Sunhotels. This all works forward to the ultimate goal of establishing the technology across the travel industry.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft’s updated Surface Book is a big, powerful brute of a laptop The Surface Book 2 this isn’t share \nA year ago, Microsoft set out to prove to the world that a Windows laptop could hang with the best MacBooks from Apple. The Surface Book, with its head-turning design, wild hinge technology, and detachable screen was just that laptop. Microsoft largely succeeded: though it wasn’t perfect, the Surface Book showed that a powerful, well-designed, and attractive Windows laptop was possible. \nA year later, the company hasn’t changed much with the Surface Book formula, not that it really had to. In fact, most of the Surface Book line is entirely unchanged: the only update is happening to the top-of-the-line model, while everything else remains the same. If you’ve been hoping for a Surface Book 2, this is not the machine you’ve been waiting for. The new, king-of-the-hill Surface Book is $100 more than last year’s model (a hefty $2,399 for 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD; $2,799 for one with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD; or an even heftier $3,299 for 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD) and has the same sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor; same 13.5-inch \"PixelSense\" display with 3000 x 2000 pixels of resolution; same Surface Pen capabilities; same port selection (two USB-A 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, a DisplayPort, a headphone jack, and power); and the same capability to turn into a tablet in a pinch. Microsoft has only made two internal changes: the graphics processor has been bumped up to a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 memory and the battery has been increased in capacity to provide an estimated 16 hours of stamina, four hours more than last year's model. The updates make the Surface Book even bigger and heavier Those two changes are minor in the long list of Surface Book specs, but they forced Microsoft to adjust the base of the Surface Book to accommodate them. The new Performance Base (the one that comes with the high-end Book and houses the discrete graphics card) is thicker and heavier than last year’s, pushing the already sizeable laptop’s weight up to 3.6 pounds. The extra thickness helps to minimize — but not fully eliminate — the dreaded lint-collecting gap that forms when the laptop is closed. The Book was not the slimmest nor lightest laptop you could get, and these changes only make it more substantial — this is a beefy 13-inch laptop by any definition. I’ve been using the new Surface Book as my main machine for the past week and despite those changes, the experience is mostly the same as last year’s version. Part of that is due to my workflow — Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom are the heaviest apps I use, and they pose no challenge to this level of machine — but most of the reason the experience is the same is because Microsoft just didn’t change much. Microsoft says it increased the graphical performance of the high-end Surface Book in response to customer demands, so it might be noticeable to someone, but it’s not to me. \nMicrosoft does not advertise the Book as a gaming machine, but its new graphics card is capable of handling some lightweight gaming. But if you’re going to spend this much money on a laptop and are a serious gamer, there are much better options available to you, including ones that have the latest chips from Nvidia and can support VR (the Surface Book cannot, at least when it comes to powering the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift). The promised battery life increase did not materialize in the real world Also missed on me is the increased battery life. In our rundown test, the Surface Book lasted 10 hours and 21 minutes, which is quite good. But in my real-world usage, browsing the web, jumping between a half-dozen apps, writing email, monitoring social feeds, etc., it struggled to last a full work day before calling it quits. Most days, the Surface Book would last between six and eight hours, which is about average for a laptop of this size. (Using the Book as a tablet worked for about two hours before it died, which is unchanged from last year.) That’s a far cry from Microsoft’s claimed 16 hours and less than my colleague Vlad Savov could get with the new 13-inch MacBook Pro . Fortunately, this Surface Book has no issues going to sleep when it’s closed and in my bag, which is a problem I’ve encountered with numerous Windows 10 laptops over the past year. Otherwise, the new Surface Book is a joy to use. The powerful processor and copious RAM let me switch between apps with ease, load dozens of tabs in my browser, and process images speedily, while never really having to wait for anything. The keyboard is wonderful to type on, and the large trackpad is the best you can get on a Windows machine. And it actually works well on my lap: I used the Surface Book numerous times on my commute without worrying that it would slide off my lap. It’s not entirely rational, and this Surface Book is certainly way more computer than I need to do my job, but I just like working on it. A USB-C port would have been a nice addition There are a couple of things I do wish Microsoft had added for this update, though. I appreciate the SD card slot and full-size USB ports, but it would have been great if Microsoft added at least one USB Type-C port, since I’m already using a phone and other accessories that rely on it. And while the hinge has been slightly modified to accommodate the larger base, it still doesn’t flex back as much as I’d like, making it awkward when using the Surface Book at a standing desk. Others might lament the fact that the processor hasn’t changed, though the new seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors aren’t yet available in the quad-core versions used by this Surface Book. (This is the same reason why Apple’s new 15-inch MacBook Pro uses Intel’s older chips.) Or you might not like that you can’t get more than 16GB of RAM in the new Book, even if you max out all of the specs. (This, too, is a common complaint with the new MacBook Pro.) Or you might wish that Microsoft had gone all the way up to Nvidia’s GTX 1060 graphics card, like Razer did with its new Blade. (Also a frequently cited complaint with the MacBook Pro.) If you were hoping that this new Surface Book would be a complete overhaul, you’ll have to keep waiting. It is quite truly a midlife cycle spec refresh and nothing more. Most people will probably be just fine with one of the less expensive Surface Books, which haven’t been updated, but if you want to pony up to the top of the line, that top is slightly higher than before. Still the king of the Windows hill The question now is do you plunk down $3,000 for this ultimate Surface Book, or do you wait for the inevitable Surface Book 2 that will likely come next year? If you have a Surface Book already, it doesn’t make much sense to upgrade this soon into its lifespan. And there is certainly a good argument to be made to wait for the Microsoft’s next revision, which will likely have Intel’s seventh-generation processor. But if you can’t wait, and you’re looking for the ultimate Windows laptop, it’s hard to look past Microsoft’s latest Surface Book. \nPhotography by Amelia Krales.",

To celebrate its 10 year anniversary, Microsoft is holding a day long PowerShell Celebration Event on Channel9 , and everyone from across the world is invited to join in and watch the live stream on November 14th . \nThe live stream event will feature segments about PowerShell and SQL, PowerShell and Azure, and the directions PowerShell can go in the future. You also will be able to hear from PowerShell team members, and hear about how PowerShell has evolved over the last 10 years. Of course, there also will be live demonstrations which show off how to use PowerShell for Minecraft, and how it can be used for everyday stuff such as controlling sprinklers, an IOT-based Theramin, and even a Tesla. \nSo, be sure to head over to Channel 9 on November 14th starting at 8:00am (PST.) And, let us know if you’ll be watching by dropping us a line in the section below! In this story stream:",

      "title": "The rich and us",
      "text": "Nov 9, 2016 ( … ) \nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, having a net worth of $81.8 billion, and Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, having a net worth of $70.4 billion, are the nation’s two richest men. They are at the top of the Forbes 400 list of America’s superrich individuals, people who have net worths of billions of dollars. \nMany see the rich as a danger. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert wrote, ‘’It doesn’t really matter what ordinary people want. The wealthy call the tune, and the politicians dance.’’ His colleague Paul Krugman wrote, ‘’On paper, we’re a one-person-one-vote nation; in reality, we’re more than a bit of an oligarchy, in which a handful of wealthy people dominate.’’ It’s sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich. For without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention, we might be able to concentrate on what’s best for the 99.9 percent of the rest of us. \nLet’s look at the power of the rich. With all the money that Gates, Bezos and other superrich people have, what can they force you or me to do? Can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot? Can they force us to pay money into the government-run — and doomed — Obamacare program? Can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity? Can they force us to buy our sugar from a high-cost domestic producer rather than from a low-cost Caribbean producer? The answer to all of these questions is a big fat no. \nYou say, ‘’Williams, I don’t understand.’’ Let me be more explicit. Bill Gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity. He has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot. Unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off, rich people have little power to force us to do anything. A lowly municipal clerk earning $50,000 a year has far more life-and-death power over us. It is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house, ply a trade, open a restaurant and do myriad other activities. It’s government people, not rich people, who have the power to coerce us and rip us off. They have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey. This coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption. \nTake just one of thousands of examples. The Fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers, and they co-own the world’s largest refining company, American Sugar Refining, which markets its product under the brand names Domino, C&H, Redpath, Tate & Lyle and Florida Crystals. During the 2014 election cycle, Florida Crystals contributed more than $860,000 to candidates and political spending groups. It spent more than $1 million lobbying Congress, the U.S. departments of Agriculture and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Here’s my question to you: Do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution? Nonsense. The Fanjuls and other sugar producers want Congress to use tariffs to keep foreign-produced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge Americans two to three times the world price of sugar. \nSo here’s the ultimate question: If some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us, who’s to blame? I think it’s we, the people, who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town — and that’s most of them. But that might be deceitful of us, for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others. \nWalter E. Williams is a professor of economics at George Mason University. \n(C) 2016, Creators Syndicate",

      "text": "The fall always holds something special for owners of Microsoft’s Xbox One entertainment console. It’s when the best-selling games – titles like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Watch Dogs 2 – arrive on store shelves. Microsoft also uses the season to debut a number of bundles all aimed at luring in those looking for a good deal. To that end, it’s already stocked stores with a handful of Xbox One S consoles bundles that come with free games. Late yesterday, the company revealed what it’s calling the Xbox One Holiday Update. This fall’s large software update for all owners of the Xbox One and Xbox One S has arrived.\nMostly, the Xbox One Holiday Update consists of things that we already knew where in the works because Microsoft announced them at its Electronic Entertainment Expo briefing this past June. The software upgrades two headlining features connect people in new ways. With the Xbox One now switched over to the same storefront that Windows 10 users enjoy and Xbox One apps slowly starting to get traction, Microsoft has turned back to focusing on quality of life improvements for Xbox Live.\nAdvertisement\nRead: 33 Xbox One Tips for a Better Experience\nIf you haven’t been prompted to install the Xbox One Holiday Update, you will be over the next few days. Here’s all the new features and software changes that you can look forward to once you have the software installed.\nAdvertisement\nXbox One Holiday Update: How Xbox Hopes You Make New Friends When the Xbox One launched in 2013, Microsoft said that its engineers had rebuilt Xbox Live for a new generation of gaming. They introduced new features like sharing digital games with your friends and more reliable messaging. For all of the upgrades this new version of Xbox Live included, the way users interacted with each other went mostly unchanged. Later on, Microsoft added ways to follow specific users and a showcase for highlighting accomplishments.\nAdvertisement\nLooking for Group and Xbox Live Clubs are the biggest things to happen to interactions over Xbox Live in years. One makes it incredibly easy to make new friends. The other makes it easy to stay in contact with those new friends outside of your gaming sessions.\nXbox Live Looking for Group\nSometimes abbreviated to just LFG, Looking for Group sort of behaves like a manual matchmaking service outside of a game. Users find a title that they enjoy, then fill in a few parameters about what they’d like to do with other people while playing that game. Details include how many people they need and what requirements they have for those participating. For example, gamers can emphasis a specific mode or having a microphone. They can even highlight the Achievement that they’re trying to piece together a squad to unlock.\nLooking for Group posts can be created a week ahead of when gamers want to play. In the run up to the gaming session, Xbox Live sends alerts every time someone expresses interest. Users decide whether they want everyone across Xbox Live to see their LFG entry, or whether they want to limit it to an Xbox Live Club.\nAdvertisement\nThe easiest way to create an LFG entry and to check for entries you might want to look into is to go to a title’s Game Hub.\nXbox Live Clubs Xbox Live Clubs are exactly what their name says they are. Anyone on Xbox Live can create a special group that’s as open or as closed as you want it to be. Clubs have their own Activity Feed, Group Messaging and Looking for Group entry so that it’s easy for users to play together.\nLike Looking for Group, clubs have a tag system for communicating what kind of community users want to build there. There are tags for only encouraging those above the age of 18 to join. You can require that users have a microphone so that you’re better able to strategize.\nXbox Live Clubs don’t require an Xbox Live Gold subscription to create or to join, though playing online with club members certainly does. You can create a Club from the Community area. They’re also tied into the Game Hubs so that you can find your favorite games, then see what Clubs that play those games are accepting new members.\nAdvertisement\nXbox One Holiday Update: Achievement Rarity & Gamescore Leaderboard After the success of Achievements with the Xbox 360, some thought that the Xbox One’s Challenges would catch on. That never happened though, developers stopped creating new Challenges for their titles regularly. Soon they were gone from Xbox Live entirely. Two new features in the Xbox One Holiday Update sort of make up for their loss.\nThe first is Achievement rarity. Every game has Achievements that are very tedious or difficult to get. Xbox Live now knows how many people that played a game unlocked a specific Achievement and uses those statistics to decide when an Achievement should be classified as rare. Rare Achievements have a special sound and diamond emblem.\nAdvertisement\nThe Gamerscore leaderboard isn’t new. It’s been around for years. This updated Gamerscore Leaderboard changes the method it uses to calculate who’s at the top. Whereas the old leaderboard monitored the last 30 consecutive days, the new leaderboard monitors the current calendar month. The change means it’s for players that aspire to be at the top of the leaderboard to make their way there.\nXbox One Holiday Update: Group Messages, Emojii and Xbox on Windows 10 The Xbox One used to rely on a Party Chat to send a message to more than one user. Now Group Messages allow you to add multiple users to a message directly from the Xbox Guide, whether you’re in a Party with them or not.\nGroup Messaging’s release corresponds with two other changes in the Xbox One Holiday Update. The on-screen keyboard uses the same predictive text engine that other Windows 10 devices to help you type quickly. Microsoft also added support for Emojiis.\nRead: Xbox One Backwards Compatibility: Call of Duty & More\nAll of these features are coming to the Xbox apps on Windows 10, iPhone and Android this week as well.\nOf course, the Xbox One Holiday Update is absolutely free. Users with the Always Connected power mode turned on will get the upgrade installed automatically. Those without it will be asked to install it the next time that they connect to Xbox Live.",

Nokia Moonraker is a smartwatch that was developed by Nokia for the Lumia series of phones, but which was eventually discontinued by Microsoft after purchasing the Devices and Services unit from the Finnish firm. And in a video published today by Nokibar, we finally have a closer look at the Moonraker, confirming what we already knew: this smartwatch was a pretty exciting rival to the Apple Watch, as it was supposed to come with similar design and features.

      "text": "11/12/16 AT 6:02 AM Close \nMicrosoft has developed an app that will help colorblind people see the world better. The Color Binoculars iOS app will help them differentiate between different wavelengths of color by using the iPhone's camera. \nThe app works by imparting deeper tones to colors and replaces color combinations, which are difficult to look at for colorblind people with easier to look at combinations. For example, it replaces red and green with pink and green. \n\"We read about special lenses that helped colorblind people distinguish colors, however, that’s expensive. So we thought, let’s code something on a phone for free,” Tingting Zhu, a Microsoft engineer who helped develop the project, said . Related Stories Microsoft HoloLens Helmet In The Works For Ukranian Army \nThe force majeure behind the project is Tim Overton, a Microsoft software engineer who works on Cortana experiences. He also happens to be colorblind. \n\"Anything with red or green messes me up, It’s not so terrible, but it does affect you. For instance, fall leaves don’t look any different for me than other leaves. They look like they always do. It takes a lot of color out of my life – metaphorically, that is,” he said. \nBeing colorblind is a condition in which people cannot distinguish between the different wavelengths of light that make up colors. Color Binoculars solves this problem by using filters and the iPhone's camera to help users differentiate between colors. The app's name is a metaphor for seeing the world “more zoomed in.” It doesn't save any videos or photos, and is rather aimed at providing the user, a more colorful view of his/her surroundings. The app will be able to support screen sizes across the iPhone range of devices. \nOverton and Zhu worked together to develop the app, which was conceived at the 2015 Microsoft Hackathon, the annual Microsoft employee event. It was developed under the aegis of Garage, the company's employee innovation space that helps its global workforce pitch and work on innovative projects.

      "title": "Updated Microsoft Surface Book May Just Be A MacBook Pro Killer",
      "text": "\nLast year, Microsoft released the powerful Surface Book. Some people paid more than $2,000 for a device that felt like a beta experiment. The video drivers, touchpad, keyboard, screen, Surface Pen, and just about everything else caused problems. Finally, by December, the Sunday Express reported that Microsoft finally acknowledged the issues .\n“Unfortunately the Surface Book is not yet available in the UK, but early customers are prorating a number of issues with the Surface Book, including flickering displays, system instability and power problems. Microsoft quickly responded by releasing a slew of firmware and software updates within weeks of the release of the new device.”\nAs the article adds, even after Microsoft issued the drivers, there were still complaints. Microsoft then apologized for the Surface Book issues and promised to fix them by early 2016. It actually wasn’t until the spring of 2016 that the Microsoft notebook realized its full potential.\nWhile Microsoft is scheduled to release the Surface Book 2 next spring, they have updated the higher-end versions of the Surface Book. The Verge has the news.\nThe updated Microsoft Surface Book is more powerful and has a better battery life, but it is heavier as well. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Microsoft has only made two internal changes: the graphics processor has been bumped up to a Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 memory and the battery has been increased in capacity to provide an estimated 16 hours of stamina, four hours more than last year’s model.”\nThe article adds that Microsoft was forced to adjust the base of the updated Surface Book, and it is now heavier than last year’s model. Still, some of the commenters after the article aren’t impressed.\n“Worst thing is that Microsoft exaggerated battery life by 10 hours or so! That’s not exaggerating, that’s plane deceiving!” screams MindYourMind.\n“I’m really disappointed about how misleading Microsoft is with their Surface marketing,” says P_giguere1.\nForbes is impressed with the updated Surface Book.\n“Microsoft has taken another direction with the Surface Book. It has the luxury to make a machine for power users. it can pack in battery life, it can put a huge focus on graphics horsepower and it can work with a wide range of ports for the professionals,” says columnist Ewan Spence , who adds that although the new Surface Book isn’t for everyone, it serves the top end of the market very well.”\nMicrosoft is trying to compete with Apple’s new MacBook Pro. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The updated Surface Book comes out just in time to provide competition to the higher-end versions of the 2016 MacBook Pro. Even though the new Pro doesn’t have touchscreen capabilities, it has a “Touch Bar” to replace the Function keys. According to Laptop Magazine, the touchbar is anything but a gimmick.\n“The MacBook Pro is supposed to be for serious work, but the new Touch Bar is a lot of fun. Actually, it’s a lot more than that. After spending just 20 minutes with the new 13-inch ($1,799) and 15-inch ($2,399) models, I’ve found it be a real time-saver.”\nColumnist Mark Spoonauer adds that the Touch Bar is especially useful when it is configured for different apps, such as Microsoft Office, Final Cut Pro, or Adobe Photoshop. Unfortunately, many OS X programs still need to be updated in order to take advantage of the MacBook Pro’s new addition.\nFor those waiting for a Mac OS X device with digital inking capabilities, it is highly rumored that the next 12-inch MacBook will be that device. However, that’s not likely going to be released until next spring. For now, the Surface Book or the Surface Pro 4, which both run Windows 10, are considered top-of-the notch devices.\n[Featured Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images]\nUpdated Microsoft Surface Book May Just Be A MacBook Pro Killer is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

Enter: Color Binoculars.\n\"Since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious,\" Tom Overton, a colorblind Microsoft engineer who helped develop the app with Tingting Zhu, said in a blog post . \"It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.”\nImage: microsoft garage\nThe refreshingly simple app offers three viewing modes — Red/Green, Green/Red and Blue/Yellow — and doesn't allow for taking photos, as it's meant to be a color window to the world rather than a photo app.\nMost colorblind people are aware of their status, but if you have suspicions that your color perception might be off, you can try the popular Ishihara color blindness test . Of course, it's always best to consult a doctor for a medical vision evaluation, but using that test, some users have left reviews claiming that the app helped them see distinctions in colors better.\nColor Binoculars is available now for iOS as a free download.",

      "text": "Teams from Beijing security firm, Qihoo and South Korean Hacker Lokihardt both managed to compromise the Microsoft Edge browser on Windows, and bagged bounties of $120,000 each. Each team or contenstant is given three attempts to compromise the target, with each attempt having a time limit of four minutes. Lokihardt managed to gain system level access in as little as 18 seconds.\nThe hacks were showcased at PwnFest , an event related to the ongoing Power of the Community information security conference in Seoul, Korea, according to a report in The Register . It was the first time that a VMware Workstation was successfully attacked with only remote code execution, and no interaction by the end user.\nThe PwnFest is a yearly event where major tech companies offer rewards to hackers for owning certain products. Targets for the hackers this year included Microsoft Edge, Google Pixel, Microsoft Hyper-V, Google Chrome, iOS, the Safari browser, Adobe Flash and VMWare Workstation. The event also has a Lord of Pwn trophy given to the team with the most successful attacks, and if there is a tie, the award is decided based on technical merit of the hacks.\nThe prize money ranges from $80,000 for the Safari hack, to $150,000 for the VMWare and the Hyper-V attacks. The exploits are not publicly disclosed, and the companies usually take measures to plug these security holes.\nThe post Microsoft pays hackers $120,000 for compromising the Edge browser appeared first on Tech2 .",

In last week’s Halo Community Update , the team over at 343 Industries teased what the game studio is planning the do to celebrate fifteen years of Halo. \nIf you’ve been a longtime Halo fan, get ready to discover “some incredible content to help celebrate this huge milestone” during a Twitch webcast that will kick off at approximately 3:43 p.m. PST tomorrow: \nDuring the jam-packed show we’ll have a special walkthrough of the Halo Museum, talk Halo Wars 2 with Dan Ayoub & Max Szlagor, hear about some of the team and community’s fondest Halo memories, play Halo 5 with fans, talk HCS with Tashi & Strongside, take a look at the upcoming Halo Loot crate with James, answer your tweets and whatever else we end up doing when we inevitably stray from script. \nIf you haven’t done it yet, we invite you to subscribe to the Halo channel on Twitch and you can also join the brand new Halo Club on Xbox Live which is managed by 343 Industries. While we’re just a few months away from the release of Halo Wars 2 on Xbox One and Windows 10, feel free to share some of your dearest Halo memories over the last 15 years in the comments below.  ",

      "text": "Today, we’re announcing Microsoft Surface devices, including the new Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base, are all certified to run Siemens NX™ software, one of the world’s most advanced product design software applications.\n\nWe’ve seen great momentum across a range of industries and use cases for Surface devices – especially from engineers, who are some of the most creative people in the world. They are often responsible for designing some of today’s most complex and sophisticated products – from trains and planes, to automobiles and medical devices.\nToday, we’re announcing Microsoft Surface devices, including the new Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base, which are all certified to run Siemens NX software, one of the world’s most advanced product design software applications. This will give engineers the confidence in their ability to utilize Surface devices to help them design and create such innovative products.\nThe Siemens NX team joined us in New York City for our recent launch and I was fortunate enough to sit down with Joe Bohman, Vice President of Product Engineering Software for Siemens’ product lifecycle management (PLM) software business, where he told me more about why he thinks Surface represents the future of devices for engineers like himself.\n\nHow do you think the new Surface devices will change how Siemens NX customers work? With the new generative design approaches of Siemens NX Convergent Modeling and Siemens NX Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing), the latest Surface devices allow people to completely rethink the way they design and develop products. For the first time, they can use their device to simultaneously design and edit scanned, organic and engineered shapes, allowing engineers to create products that could never have been manufactured before. With Surface, they can fully immerse themselves and create directly with their hands, making the process more tactile and creative.\nSurface Studio and Surface Book offer our users a more flexible and creative platform for design thanks to a combination of touch, pen and traditional inputs to develop ideas in a more natural manner. \nSurface Studio and Surface Book offer our users a more flexible and creative platform for design thanks to a combination of touch, pen and traditional inputs to develop ideas in a more natural manner. The high-resolution display on Surface Studio really gives a greater sense of confidence and precision when looking at complex shapes and offers a better understanding of the aesthetics during the design process. Adding Surface Dial brings a whole new degree of flexibility and control especially when interacting and changing designs.\nWhat are the unique use cases you see for each of the devices? With Surface Book, it’s about flexibility and performance. People have the combination of power and mobility that lets them take their work from the office to the manufacturing floor without missing a beat.\nOn the other hand, Surface Studio is perfect for designers who have, up until now, been relegated to pen and paper, or multiple devices, to do one job. Studio is ideal for those who want to mix activities such as complex modeling with Siemens NX™ software and freehand sketching with Siemens Catchbook™ software, on a device that feels natural and comfortable. Surface Dial enhances both devices by offering an entirely new way for engineers to view, edit and render their designs.\nIn one Surface Studio use case, we created a fabrication of an engineered plate to repair damage to a human skull. With Siemens NX, we brought in a 3D scan of the injured individual’s skull, designed the plate needed to repair it, and then combined to accurately and precisely make edits for a perfectly designed fit. This type of simultaneous “Convergent” modeling has never been possible before. The potential is truly incredible.\nWhat does the Siemens NX certification mean for Surface? What is the significance? We’ve worked closely with Microsoft and feel confident in certifying both Surface Book and Surface Studio to run Siemens NX software. \nThe Siemens NX certification is granted only to devices that have passed our series of hundreds of tests, which weigh a device’s ability to deliver a highly satisfactory end-user experience. Our customers, including numerous major airplane and auto manufacturers, require and depend on this certification to tell them what devices will offer their team the best user experience. To do so, our team tests device capabilities like processor performance, graphics systems and more.\nWe’ve worked closely with Microsoft and feel confident in certifying both Surface Book and Surface Studio to run Siemens NX software. For us, the most important outcome of these certifications is that our customers have the confidence that Siemens and Microsoft are committed to them.\nWhat type of functionality does Siemens NX have for Surface Dial? Surface Dial lends itself to a number of key functionalities within Siemens NX™ software – including manipulating view attributes, zooming, panning and rotating of 3D models – all of which are a massive part of a typical Siemens NX user’s daily routine. Going a step further, we also looked at how Surface Dial can support dynamic geometry manipulation, such as changing sizes and adjusting attributes. These functions can all be performed more smoothly and reliably with Surface Dial versus traditional mouse dragging or even touch, allowing for much finer control over changes.\nWe also looked at how people can access their favorite, most commonly used commands via Surface Dial; this increases productivity by removing the need to move to the ribbon UI to select common commands and ultimately saving time.\nOverall, the numerous uses of Surface Dial make it a very powerful accessory for any Siemens NX user.\nWhat business problems are Surface Studio, Surface Dial and Surface Book helping to solve? We have had a lot of feedback from our customers about devices like Surface Book and trust when they tell us that Surface Book’s power and mobility are exactly what they’re looking for in a device. These factors are so important for the needs of engineers and designers who have to be more flexible about their work locations due to the need to visit customers and/or remote factories. We see this as a result of the increasing globalization of business and the increased levels of partnership between companies around the world. They need a device that supports this changing landscape.\nWe’ve heard from our customers through our social media channels and they’re very excited about Surface Studio and Surface Dial. The high resolution and high power combined with the flexibility to run Surface Studio in both traditional and flat configurations is turning heads in our community. We expect more and more people to ask, “How can I try one of these new devices?”\nHow does Siemens software take advantage of the best of Surface devices? Siemens has been in the business of manufacturing for over 150 years. Design, engineering and manufacturing are all about the ability of users to create, participate and collaborate. Powerful mobile devices like the new Surface Book with Performance Base enable engineers to use NX to design and revise products in locations they never could before, like in the field or sitting with customers.\nDrawing naturally, yet accurately, on digital devices and enabling anyone to participate in design has been a longstanding goal. Surface devices have enabled us to realize this with our new Siemens Catchbook™ mobile app that you can download from the Windows Store.\nSiemens NX is arguably the most powerful and capable design application on the planet and is on the forefront of this next generation of rich, immersive, touch and stylus interaction. Surface devices give us the new direct and precise interaction methods that our customers want, and we at Siemens are thrilled to see this manifest and allow Siemens NX to become even more powerful and accessible.\nThe team here at Microsoft is so proud of how Surface Studio, Surface Book with Performance Base and Surface Dial can help engineers and professionals get things done, no matter where they are. We love hearing how our partners like Siemens see Surface benefitting their customers, and how Microsoft can help bring their vision to life. Thanks to Joe and the full Siemens NX team for their partnership and letting us tell their story.\n  10:33 am",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 15 minutes ago with 3 comments \nMicrosoft used to be the epitome of a dull, beige multinational corporation. It built functional and incredibly useful software that powered most of the world’s computers, but it offered little to excite or inspire the hundreds of millions of people who used its products around the world every day. \nThere was once a time when the company rarely made its way into the headlines except perhaps when launching a new version of Windows or a major update to its Office productivity suite, or when embroiled in some high-profile antitrust scandal . For many users, the only time they would even think about Microsoft was to curse it when something went wrong on their PCs. \nSince then, Microsoft has changed in many ways, although it seems fair to say that not everyone has noticed. Many people speak passionately about their love for Apple products, claiming that everything ‘just works’. Others hold Google in high regard for how its search engine has made their lives easier or how useful Google Maps is, for example, and even some less technically minded folks speak with genuine excitement about its efforts with self-driving cars , or balloons bringing internet connectivity to remote locations or impoverished nations . \nHowever, people have long memories, and many still regard Microsoft as the dull, beige multinational corporation of yesteryear, churning out boring software that they must use at work, or which happens to be installed on their laptops at home. \nBut Microsoft is a very different company today to how it was two decades ago. It’s less complacent; where once it could rely on huge revenues from Windows and Office sales, greater competition and the rise of highly capable free alternatives has pushed Microsoft to stop resting on its laurels. It’s more innovative; the relentless pace of change in the tech world has made the firm realize that it can’t afford to be left behind by its rivals, prompting it to invest more in trying new things. And it’s more open; greater transparency in its software development, and its cross-platform strategy – including multi-OS dev tools, and a growing commitment to open source – stand in stark contrast to how Microsoft used to do things in the old days. \nOf course, Microsoft still has many faults, and there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Its high-profile failure in the mobile space, recently acknowledged by CEO Satya Nadella , is a potent example of the lessons that Microsoft still needs to learn. \nBut there’s still a great deal to be excited about. \nBelow, we consider ten reasons to be optimistic about Microsoft’s future. It isn’t unique in working on these areas – you don’t have to search too hard to find other companies, large and small, making their own investments in one or more of these spaces – but they highlight why Microsoft is now so much more than the boring corporate leviathan it once was, and why it’s worth paying close attention to what it does next. \nAnd with Microsoft now structuring all its activities around a single, all-encompassing mission –“to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more”, whether at work or at play – it's now more focused than ever before on bringing its products to every type of user as a cohesive set of software, services, hardware and tools that meets all their needs. \nThere’s still a long way to go on that front, but the list below represents a pretty good start. HoloLens \nOne of the most visible examples of the ‘new’ Microsoft is its Windows Holographic efforts, which have already come to market in an early form as the HoloLens headset. The mixed reality device brings digital objects to your view of the real world, and while it’s unmistakably a first-generation product, it offers a tantalizing taste of what’s to come. \nUsing HoloLens is a genuinely engaging experience , and it’s not hard to imagine how it might be developed in the future for scenarios like gaming, or even to enhance productivity. Indeed, many companies have already embraced it with open arms: industrial engineering giant thyssenkrupp is equipping 24,000 of its technicians with HoloLens in an effort to transform the $54 billion-a-year global elevator industry; SketchUp recently launched a new version of its software for HoloLens to help architects and civil engineers; Japan Airlines has explored using HoloLens to improve training for its fleet engineers ; and the headset has even been used by NASA aboard the International Space Station . \nThe product isn't perfect, by any means. The limited field of view when using HoloLens could do with being expanded a bit, and the $3,000 price tag of the headset puts it way beyond the reach of most consumers, and even some small businesses. But at this stage, HoloLens isn’t intended as a consumer device, and the price will no doubt fall as the technology matures. \nMicrosoft is also working on lower-cost Windows Holographic devices with its partners to make virtual reality more affordable , and we expect to hear more about those plans next month . Microsoft Research \nIn some ways, HoloLens feels like a research concept showcasing a far-off idea that you can’t quite believe is a real-world product. Microsoft, like its rivals, spends huge sums on research and development, and some of those efforts are very exciting indeed. \nIn just the last couple of years, Microsoft Research has shared details of some extraordinary developments across a wide range of disciplines. Technology developed to help eliminate bugs in the Windows OS, for example, was applied to help scientists improve their understanding of stem cell behavior , which could lead to significant breakthroughs in medical research. \nAnother example is Project Platypus, which can help robots to locate humans using the body’s own electrical field ; imagine that technology being applied to help in the search for survivors after a major disaster. And from a digital ‘tattoo’ to allow users to control their devices , to the quest to detect and ‘solve’ cancer in the next ten years , Microsoft Research teams around the world are exploring ways to apply technology to any number of problems, whether to improve life expectancy, or just to make life a bit easier. Artificial intelligence and machine learning \nOne area in which the firm certainly isn’t alone in its research efforts is that of artificial intelligence. Microsoft itself has made huge investments in AI and machine learning in recent years; in May, the company’s chief envisioning officer in the UK, Dave Coplin, described AI as “the most important technology that anybody on the planet is working on today” . \nCortana is perhaps the most visible componen t of its efforts for many users; but the digital assistant, which is integrated into Windows 10 - and available to a less integrated extent on other platforms - is just one element of its AI investments. From predicting the future with its Azure cloud platform , and preventing cyberattacks , to product personalization , image recognition , natural language processing and cognitive services , Microsoft’s work in AI is far-reaching and its potential is virtually limitless. \nIn September, Microsoft announced the formation of a new AI and Research Group with over 5,000 computer scientists and engineers , in an effort to \"democratize AI for every person and organization\". Among its aims, the company said that it will \"build the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with Azure and make it available to anyone\". Bots \nMicrosoft is bringing some of its AI research efforts to users through the development of its Bot Framework , which it announced at its Build 2016 conference in March. If you’ve ever used a bot – for example, those built into Facebook Messenger or Microsoft’s own Skype platform – you’ll no doubt be aware that a good deal more research is needed before these digital agents become truly useful. \nBut like many of its rivals, Microsoft is convinced that bots will become increasingly important and relevant as the underlying technology develops and matures. Imagine being able to have a chat with an ‘intelligent’ customer service bot to change the delivery time of a package, or to order a pizza, or book a flight, by answering a few simple questions, rather than having to navigate endless web pages and fill in one form after another. \nOf course, like its rivals, Microsoft still has a lot of work to do to improve its ‘conversation as a platform’ efforts. The embarrassing episode of its racist Tay chatbot earlier this year was an unfortunate example of that. Cloud + privacy \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella famously described his vision for the company as ‘mobile first, cloud first’. While some would disagree with the first part of that mantra, there’s no doubting the company’s commitment to the cloud. \nMicrosoft has made huge investments in its Intelligent Cloud business, and they’re certainly paying off, with Azure revenue recently rising by 116%, and Azure compute usage more than doubling , year-over-year. But as the firm continues to encourage its customers to leap into the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ and embrace cloud computing across their operations, Microsoft has also demonstrated a keen awareness of the need to establish best practice for this digital age. \nLast month, for example, Microsoft published a book titled A Cloud for Global Good , discussing how nations and organizations might wish to approach the challenges of online security, government access to data, and digital privacy. Microsoft has been a champion and vocal proponent of issues surrounding user privacy , and the need to modernize laws to deal with the global flow of data. Cross-platform development and open-source \nThe failure of its Windows phone efforts so far, and the scaling back of its mobile hardware portfolio, has led many to believe that the company has abandoned the ‘mobile first’ part of its mantra. Of course, the company is continuing to develop Windows 10 Mobile , but it’s also been focusing more heavily on developing software for other mobile platforms. \nIts efforts in that area have been two-fold. First, the company has brought more of its own software to rival operating systems, including core applications like its Office suite . Through its experimental Garage software, developed by the company’s employees as ‘side projects’ , many more apps have also made their way to other platforms under the Microsoft brand. \nBut Microsoft has also embraced cross-platform software for other developers too. The greatest example of this came with its acquisition of Xamarin earlier this year , with the aim of offering the world’s leading set of tools to create software for all platforms, not just for Windows. In another extraordinary move, Microsoft announced a month later that it was open-sourcing its Xamarin developer tools , and making them free for everyone to use. This week, it announced the imminent launch of Visual Studio for Mac too. \nFrom the Chakra JavaScript engine to its PowerShell command line tool , Microsoft has been increasingly embracing open source in recent years. In fact, it’s now the top contributor on open source community GitHub. Universal Windows Platform \nBut while its cross-platform software development continues, Microsoft has also made significant improvements in creating apps for its own platforms. With Windows 10, the company has finally realized the vision of apps that can run across all Windows devices with only minimal changes. \nThe Universal Windows Platform lets developers create a single piece of software that can run on phones, tablets, PCs, HoloLens, and even Xbox One consoles, along with any number of other devices that run Windows 10 – from IoT devices and dongle-style micro-PCs , to media boxes and smart TVs . Of course, devs still need to make some changes to take advantage of the capabilities of each type of device, and to customize the user interface around the different ways that users will interact with their software – but there’s no denying the versatility of the core ‘write once, run anywhere’ proposition of UWP. \nThat said, not everyone has been won over by the idea of UWP development yet. The rise of smartphones – and the gradual demise of Windows phones – has left a big gap for developers; after all, most of the 400 million Windows 10 devices out there are PCs, for which apps designed for mobile devices aren’t always well suited. Not all PC apps will be ideally placed to run on an Xbox One or smart TV either. \nBut while Microsoft still clearly faces challenges in convincing developers of UWP’s value, it’s certainly done a lot to enhance its appeal. Makers of ‘classic’ desktop applications can now convert their apps for the Windows Store , and those who develop for iOS are being offered tools to easily port their apps to Windows 10 through its ‘app bridge’ . Windows 10 \nAs with UWP, it's no exaggeration to say that not everyone has been won over yet by Microsoft’s latest operating system for all devices, Windows 10. Microsoft did its best to convince owners of older PCs running Windows 7 and 8.1 to switch to the newer OS with a free upgrade offer , but its clumsy, heavy-handed approach in doing so won the company few friends . Its increasingly aggressive methods may well have pushed some of those on the fence about switching to Windows 10 back towards their older versions, such was the level of distaste for the tactics that it employed to encourage people to switch. \nBut while some remain determined to stick with Windows 7 or 8.1, most objective observers would find it hard to deny the advantages of Windows 10, on paper at least. Aside from its modern application platform, the OS is much faster and more power-efficient than earlier versions, and also a great deal more secure, with new security features and enhancements being added regularly. \nAdditionally, Microsoft has now moved to a cadence of ‘continuous improvements’ with Windows 10, delivering maintenance updates once a month, and from next year, it plans to deliver two major feature-enhancing updates twice a year, starting with its recently-announced Creators Update , which is expected to arrive around March 2017. \nOf course, Microsoft hasn’t quite perfected the process of keeping the OS up-to-date. Its recent Anniversary Update caused millions of webcams to stop working , while many other PCs were afflicted by a ‘freezing’ issue after installing the same update . Clearly, this is something that Microsoft must improve upon, and it appears determined to do so with the help of millions of Windows Insiders around the world , who get early access to new features to test them before their release. Surface \nWhen Microsoft unveiled its first Surface tablets in 2012 , many wondered if the company was doing the right thing, raising concerns about Microsoft competing with its hardware partners. Four and a half years later, most now agree that it was a wise move. \nOver the last few years, many manufacturers have seen the appeal – for consumers and businesses alike – of the Surface range; in its latest quarterly financial report, Microsoft revealed that Surface revenues had increased by 38% year-over-year . It’s no great surprise, then, that from Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S , to the Huawei MateBook and ASUS' Transformer series , numerous OEMs have launched their own takes on the successful Surface formula. \nThe Surface range has grown into more than just tablets too. With the Surface Book , Microsoft attempted to blend a more conventional laptop form factor with the detachable screen of its tablets, and it recently launched updated versions with more powerful graphics capabilities . The Surface Hub evolved from the company’s acquisition of Perceptive Pixel in 2012 , and such devices are becoming more commonplace from the likes of InFocus , and even Google . And the new Surface Studio all-in-one desktop PC aims to make Windows 10 a more attractive proposition for creative professionals, while the Surface Dial interaction device was introduced alongside it as “a new tool for the creative process”. \nSurface hasn’t been a runaway success since day one , but the company has demonstrated its resolve in trying new things to broaden the appeal of its ecosystem. And with enhancements like the Ink Workspace in Windows 10 , Microsoft has also been striving to boost the usefulness of hardware features like the touchscreen and Surface Pen. \nThat certainly bodes well for the future of the Surface range, and sets an encouraging tone for the possibility of the mythical ‘Surface phone’ . That device is widely expected to build on the company’s Continuum vision of a handset that can also function as a PC, but it may be a while before it finally makes its debut . Gaming \n“With Windows 8,” Alienware co-founder Frank Azor said this week, Microsoft “really stepped away from gamers in a big way”. But with Windows 10, he added, “Microsoft learned a very valuable lesson” and it’s now considerably “more gamer focused” . Indeed, even when Microsoft launched the Xbox One in 2013, many felt that the company was beginning to lose its way with gaming, placing far less emphasis on the games, and far more on the entertainment features of its console. \nBut after listening to the feedback from user community, Microsoft has made a much greater commitment to improving its offering for gamers, including this year's launch of its Xbox One S , at which the spotlight was shining brightly on the games themselves. After bringing Windows 10 to the Xbox One last year, its consoles are now part of the Universal Windows Platform for apps, of course, but gaming remains the firm focus for Xbox, to the delight of its fans. \nAnd after years of half-hearted efforts for PC gaming, Microsoft has greatly increased its efforts on that front too. From the buy-once Xbox Play Anywhere program , and availability of top titles in the Windows Store , to cross-network play with Steam , and performance improvements , Microsoft has strived to further enhance the appeal of gaming on Windows 10 PCs. In the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, too, PC gamers can look forward to Beam integration , making it easier to stream gameplay to the web. \nThere’s still plenty more work to do, of course – gamers always want more, and they want it now. But it seems that Microsoft has indeed learned some important lessons about the importance of gaming to its customers worldwide. \nAnd while there’s undoubtedly room for more improvements - in gaming, and across the rest of the company, too - it now appears to be heading in the right direction.

      "text": "The newest announcement from Microsoft will let users easily connect with users, even without creating an account or downloading the client. So, you can simply join in as guest to access its features such as chat, voice and video calls.\nTo get started, one will have to head to Skype.com, tap to start a conversation and add your name. Skype will then provide you with a unique conversation link, something similar to how Google let you invite non-Google users to Hangouts. The link can be shared with contacts. You can do so using email and social media, and share with individuals as well as groups. On sharing the links, you can then join the conversation as well as as the guest.\n\nMicrosoft will let users invite up to 300 people to chat, while up to 25 people on voice and video calls. And, all of this for free. Skype for web supports several features which include one to one group instant messaging, voice and video calls, screen sharing, file sharing and more.\nSkype is down since 08:46 AM EST https://t.co/FLexr9Lncf \nRT if it's down for you as well #skypedown pic.twitter.com/IQuqkXTVks \n— Outage Report (@ReportOutage) November 14, 2016 \n\nThere is another set of reports circulating online that claim Skype suffered outage on 14 November. The reports furthermore add that some people are still facing difficulty sending messages on Skype chat. However, the engineers claim the problem has been ‘temporarily’fixed.\nThe post Skype lets you connect with others without creating an account appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "How to Remove a Border From Your Word Document",
      "text": "By James Marshall Updated October 17, 2016 . \nMicrosoft Word users know that it is fairly easy to insert a border or a line in a document to separate different sections. For example, you can insert three dashes, asterisks or equal signs on a blank line. When you press return, voila! Word will insert a particular type of line in your document. \nUnfortunately, if you want to remove this line, things aren't so easy. If you try deleting it, only the surrounding text is affected. And clicking on the line only lets you move it. It's a head-scratching conundrum. So, what do you do? Removing the Border \nYou do not have to be stuck with this annoying line in your document. You just need to use the right tools to remove it. And that means you need to understand the line. It isn't like other elements in your document. Rather, it is a border.To remove the border from your document, position your cursor immediately above or below the line. Then, on the \"Home\" ribbon, click the \"Borders and Shading\" button in the \"Paragraph\" section. \ncontinue reading below our video Top 10 Most Addicting Mobile Games Select the icon with no borders. Presto! This will remove the border from your document. Wrapping Up \nSo, you see, while it's easy to insert a line in your Microsoft Word document, taking it out is a multi-step process. Just follow the steps in this review to remove it. Alternatively, if you'd rather skip the process altogether, reconsider using a border in the first place.",

      "text": "\nErgonomic keyboards are an oddity in the world due to their divisive design. The biggest hurdle is that it can take a few weeks to get used to and many people would rather stick to the familiar. It's akin to learning to walk in those orthopedic rocker shoes.\n\nThe new Surface Ergonomic Keyboard ($129.99) is not cheap, but it does earn its Surface branding with high-quality materials and excellent typing.

      "title": "Windows Tweaker: disorganized but powerful",
      "text": "Windows Tweaker is a software program for Microsoft Windows devices that you can use to fine tune various features of the operating system.\nThe open source program is compatible with all supported versions of Windows starting with Windows Vista and up to Windows 8.1. While Windows 10 is not mentioned, most of the tweaks work fine on the newest version of Windows as well.\nWhile there are plenty of tweak apps out there for Windows, there is always room for one more especially if it does not just rehash what other programs already offer.\nWindows Tweaker \nWindows Tweaker ships with more than one hundred tweaks sorted in more than a dozen main categories and dozens of sub-categories.\nWhile that may sound neat, it makes it difficult to keep an overview and navigate the program. See, the categories that it supports are listed on the left, and sub-categories as tabs in the main interface. It happens more often than it should that you end up with a single tweak on a page.\nWhile I'm no fan of throwing all tweaks on a single page, less categories would mean faster access to the tweaks without losing anything in the process.\nThe current layout means that you have to click a lot to check out all the tweaks Windows Tweaker offers. There is no index of tweaks available that would allow you fast access, nor is there an option to change the layout to be more user friendly.\nThe built-in search is probably the closest that you get to that. Click on the search icon, type a phrase or word, and get suggestions in list form right on the same page.\n\nCheckboxes are provided to enable or disable certain operating system features. You need to click on one of the save buttons to apply them to the system.\nOne shortcoming is that Windows Tweaker does not create a system restore point before it makes those changes. It is recommended that you create one , or a backup of the system , before you run the program.\nYou find a \"create system restore point\" option under the options button, but it needs to be activated manually.\nAs far as tweaks are concerned, there are plenty of them. Here is a short selection:\nEnable Automatic Sign-In to Windows. Change the border width of windows. Add or remove context menu items in Explorer. Schedule custom tasks. Hide specific folders, and create special folders that cannot be deleted. Disable certain operating system features (thumbnail caching, all Windows-shortcuts..) There is plenty more. It is probably best to click through all the menus that the program offers on first start as it is the only way you get a complete overview of what Windows Tweaker offers.\nClosing Words Windows Tweaker could use an interface overhaul, or at least a second layout mode that improves the accessibility and visibility of the tweaks it ships with. If you look beyond that, you get a capable program for Windows to change more than a hundred operating system features.\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon .

      "text": "Kaspersky eyes launching a real-time back-up service for social media leavers Posted Microsoft officially launches the first preview of Visual Studio for Mac \nVeteran security firm Kaspersky Lab is looking at launching a real-time encrypted back-up service for social media users to store their data outside the walled garden of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google+. \nAt this point it’s testing how much appetite there might be for such a service — launching a website with details of the potential app, which it’s calling FFForget, where people can sign up to express interest and provide feedback on the sorts of featured they’d like to see. Any beta launch would not be before early 2017, it says. \nKaspersky’s thesis is that while social media remains wildly popular there are also very widespread feelings of disaffection with how social giants such as Facebook monopolize people’s time and attention, and how they lock users in by merit of holding both their friendship networks and their personal data. \nKaspersky commissioned its own research on the topic, polling more than 4,800 web users across nine different languages, and says it found a large majority of respondents (nearly 78 per cent) reported they had already considered ditching social networks. While more than a third (39 per cent) reckon they are wasting time on social networks. \nThe poll was conducted before the current controversy about the impact on democracy of social networks helping to spread misinformation online — but that could stoke further disaffection with tech platforms which algorithmically filter content to maximize user engagement and ad clicks. \nFFForget is envisioned as a fix for the data lock-in issue — by providing a mechanism to free users of major social networking platforms from the fear of leaving their information behind should they decide to pull the plug and close their accounts. Kaspersky found around a fifth (21 per cent) of survey respondents worry about losing things like their photos should they quit a network. \nA lot more respondents (62 per cent) were concerned about losing contact with friends. Although, for some of these social platforms, you could argue the friendship networks in question involve a lot of weak bonds — when you consider how sprawling these sorts of quasi-public social networks tend to be, and how many users can be seen pruning connections on such services (rather than seeking to preserve every person they ever added), vs, say, the relative intimacy of mobile messaging apps. \nAlthough the public following element of an network like Instagram is obviously also a draw for those posting content in the hopes of building an audience. As ever with social networks, it’s a case of horses for courses — and the FFForget service clearly won’t appeal to everyone. \nIt’s worth noting that some social networks do already let users export data. Twitter, for example, has an option in settings for users to ‘request your archive’ — which creates a downloadable file of all your tweets. However it’s a manually triggered process that can take as long as a few days before the file is available. \nFacebook also lets users download an archive of their info — but again it’s necessary to manually request this. Whereas the FFForget’s paid subscription service would be real-time, letting a user close an account immediately, should they wish, without having to also jettison their data. \nThe premium version of the service (envisaged costing $1.99 per month) would also offer a content browsing and organizing interface, and real-time sync API access to allow for access to a user’s social network content to third party apps and services of their choosing — again freeing up some of their locked in social media data for alternative uses. \nA freemium version is also planned, with fewer features and what’s billed as “basic encryption” vs the premium service’s “military-grade encryption of your choice, with DES, AES, Blowfish”. \nA spokeswoman for Kaspersky confirmed data backed up via the freemium version would still be client side encrypted — so there’s no intention of Kaspersky trying to data-mine users’ social networking archives. On the contrary, the service is billed as having ‘no tracking, no ads’. \nAs well as positioning FFForget as a fix for social network fatigue, Kaspersky touts it as a way to safeguard social network data against an account being closed or taken over by hackers. 0",

      "text": "Share Print/PDF \nThe promise of big data has sparked a new age of intelligence. New levels of computation is delivering innovation and answers by people and machine alike, with algorithms and high-performance computing combining for amazing results. \nWe are collecting an increasing amount of data each day – so much so that nearly 90% of the world’s data has been created in the last couple of years alone. IBM confirms that we create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data daily, which can be estimated as one new Google entry every four days. The need to use, interact with, and learn from all of this stored information will continue to grow and play an increasing role in how people do business. Big Data Meets Big Compute \nWhile massive amounts of data are collected and stored, the users’ ability to analyze and utilize it effectively can still become a bottleneck. Many modern tools reflect a dated, batch-oriented time that depends on specialized programs and queries to extract information. With the speed and velocity of data aggregation the mechanism to derive answers is evolving and new platforms and frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark have arisen to eliminate the bottlenecks. \nFor business to derive the most value of Big Data stacks, they should be considering their Big Compute platform to power their analysis. The tradtional approach to supercomputing and HPC environment required massive amounts of project planning, investment, and resources due to individual applications and research group requirements. Another bottleneck which can reduce agility unless the resources and environment in place can readily support the data-sets and applications to power new types of machine learning or high-performance data analysis. \nThe traditional approach, combined with the fact that in recent years IT departments have seen a significant drop in their budgets has led to an increasing number of businesses resorting to more cost-effective ways of managing large amounts of data. Instead of using traditional super-computing, on-demand services are becoming more popular not only with businesses who are just beginning to explore HPC and high-performance data analysis as a new possibility but also for traditional super-computing centers and research groups who are facing capacity issues and are actually enabled to spin up THOUSANDS of GPU instances on-demand without having to think of planning and capacity. This capability, delivered by hyper-scale public cloud platforms like that of Microsoft Azure are truly revolutionizing how we take advantage of the data explosion. Microsoft Azure and HPC Capabilities \nThrough Microsoft’s public cloud computing platform , Azure, businesses gain access to a wide range of cloud services, including analytics, computing, networking, and storage. Through Microsoft Azure, users can choose from these services to scale and develop new applications or run existing applications in the cloud. It also empowers users to cloud-enable and produce self-service batch and HPC applications; instead of setting up and managing a cluster, Microsoft Azure assists users in provisioning VMs, scheduling jobs, and handling failure. Tasks can range from multistep workflows, parallel compute via MPI, or running numerous program iterations. \nAzure supports Linux RDMA technology on A8 and A9 compute instances, so users running HPC workloads on Linux can also tap into the power of this platform. The combination of Microsoft Azure and SUSE – and Enterprise Linux Serve r – is a platform that offers superior security and reliability for cloud computing. The versatility of this Linux platform allows it to seamlessly integrate with Azure cloud services to deliver a cloud environment that users can easily manage. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server supports nearly 11,500 certified applications on Azure’s ever-expanding network of global data centers. \nTogether, Azure and SUSE offer unparalleled cloud computing reliability that businesses can count on. For only the highest performing solutions that join Big Data and Compute in the cloud – get started with SUSE on Azure today. Your first step? A test-drive of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for HPC on Azure that you can complete in 15 minutes without even having to swipe a credit card.

      "title": "Word's Formatting Secret",
      "text": "By James Marshall Updated September 15, 2016 . \nMicrosoft Word power users understand the advantages of using the often-overlooked Format Painter tool to copy the formatting of text or paragraphs from one area of their document to other areas of the document. This tool delivers real time-savings to users, particularly those working with lengthy or complex documents. The Format Painter applies the same color, font style and size, and border style to selected text. Formatting Text and Paragraphs With Format Painter \nFormat one section of your document by applying the desired color, font size, border and style. When you are happy with it, use Format Painter to transfer the same formatting to other areas of your Word document. Select the text or paragraph that has the completed formatting. If you are selecting an entire paragraph, include the paragraph mark. Go to the \"Home\" tab and single-click the \"Format Painter\" icon, which looks like a paintbrush, to change the pointer to a paintbrush. Use the paintbrush to paint over an area of text or a paragraph to which you want to apply the formatting. This works only one time, and then the brush reverts to the usual pointer. \ncontinue reading below our video Choosing the Best Smartphone for YOU If you have multiple areas you want to format, double-click the \"Format Painter.\" Now the brush can be used over and over throughout the document. Press ESC to stop formatting if you are using the brush on multiple areas. When you are finished, click the \"Format Painter\" icon one more time to turn off the formatting and return to the usual pointer. Formatting Other Document Elements \nAs for graphics, the Format Painter tends to work best with AutoShapes and other drawing objects. You can also copy the formatting from a border on an image. \nFormat Painter copies the formatting of text and paragraphs, not page formatting. Format Painter doesn't work with the font and size of WordArt text. Format Painter Keyboard Shortcuts \nWhen you are working with small areas of text formatting, you may prefer to use keyboard shortcuts . Place an insertion point into a properly formatted word. Use the Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard combination to copy the character format. Click on another word in the text of the document. Use the Ctrl+Shift+V keyboard combination to paste the character formatting into place.",

      "title": "Naughty or Nice? Microsoft adds new holiday list feature for Cortana",
      "text": "Microsoft has released a new skill for making and maintaining lists using its digital assistant Cortana , just in time for the holidays.\nIn a blog post published Thursday, Microsoft said the new feature comes with to-do and shopping lists pre-installed. Users can create a variety of list types, either by saying, “Hey Cortana, create a holiday list” or by typing them out the old fashioned way.\n“Whether it’s planning a holiday meal, buying gifts, getting things done before you head out for vacation, or keeping track of who’s naughty or nice, you can use your voice or type to quickly create a new list, add to an existing list when inspiration strikes, and pull up your lists just when you need them on any device,” according to the blog post.\nThe feature can be integrated with a productivity app called Wunderlist that Microsoft acquired last year . That allows for deeper use, including attaching due dates to tasks and sharing lists with friends, family and co-workers.\nMicrosoft touts the feature as “one of the ways that Cortana remembers, so you don’t have to.” These kinds of skills are becoming commonplace in the AI assistant race among tech giants. Amazon, Google and Apple each have their own digital brains, with a variety of features and skills. Things like to-do lists, news and weather updates are within the capabilities of most digital assistants, and integration with popular smartphone apps is also on the rise.",

      "title": "Cortana can now create to-do lists on Windows 10, Android, and the iPhone",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft today introduced a new feature on Cortana: ability to manage to-do lists. The company is currently rolling out a new update to the personal assistant, which will it allow it to create and manage to-do lists for you on Windows 10, Android and iOS. For example, when you are creating a to-do list for your upcoming holiday, you can simply say “Hey Cortana, create a Holiday list”. Once the to-do list is created, you can add things to it simply by saying “Hey Cortana, add book flight to my holiday list”. In addition to adding that task to your to-do list, Cortana will also display all the other tasks that are on the to-do list which is very nice.\nWhat’s even more interesting is that Microsoft also allows users to create to-do lists via Wunderlist “to do more”. When you create a list or add an item to an existing list, Cortana will show a button for Wunderlist where you can download and install the app. Once installed, you will be able to use Wunderlist to create more organized to-do lists and be able to control that right from Cortana thanks to the Cortana integration on Wunderlist’s Windows 10 app.\nCortana’s to-do list may not sound very useful at the moment — but Microsoft may have plans to do something big with it in the near-future. The company was recently rumored to be working on an Amazon Echo-like device for your kitchen powered by Cortana which will allow you to perform basic tasks using Cortana. As Cortana can now create and manage to-do lists along with creating and managing reminders, an Amazon Echo-like device from Microsoft will, indeed, be very nice.\nOnce again, Cortana’s to-do list feature is rolling out to Windows 10, Android and iPhone users in the United States — and it’ll likely head to other regions in the near-future.",

Microsoft's new iOS app lets you see the world the right way Posted: 17 Nov 2016, 09:29 , by Peter K. From time to time, an app comes along that truly has the potential to change people's lives for the better. Color-blind folks have likely learned to live with their condition, but it's 2016 already, and technology is here to aid us in our endeavors. If you don't have a pair of those neat EnChroma glasses but have an iOS device, then lucky you â Microsoft's brand new Color Binoculars app will let you see the world as it is straight through your iPhone or iPad. It's said that the app works with all three types of color blindness. There are: protanomaly, reduced red light sensitivity deuteranomaly, reduced green light sensitivity tritanomaly, reduced blue light sensitivity Color Binoculars will shift the colors and let you distinguish them a bit more clearly than usual without having to resort to custom-tailored glasses or eye lens. For example, it makes red brighter and greens darker in order to help those unable to distinguish reds from greens see things a bit more clearly. No idea when the app's coming to Android, though. Thanks, Microsoft!",

      "text": "Microsoft's Surface Studio proves desktops can still be cool But it's also a reminder of why they're not for everyone. System RAM 8 GB From $3,000 \nThe most interesting computer released this year isn't an ultrathin laptop. It's a desktop made by Microsoft. Seriously. The Surface Studio is Microsoft's bigger and bolder follow-up to its Surface hybrid laptops. And while it might look at first like a typical all-in-one, it hides a unique ability. Give the screen a bit of a nudge and it starts bending -- all the way down to a 20-degree angle, in fact. Try doing that with an iMac. Like Microsoft's previous Surface devices, the $3,000 Studio is an attempt at evolving how we use computers. And together with the new Surface Dial accessory, it might just be the powerful modern rig creative professionals have been waiting for. But of course, there are a few first-gen stumbling blocks to deal with. Gallery: Surface Studio review | 23 Photos 23 Powerful for most creative tasks Gorgeous display Screen tilting function is genuinely useful Responsive stylus Dial has the potential to be very useful Cons Expensive for the hardware you get No upgradeability Summary The Surface Studio is exactly the sort of twist on desktops you'd expect from Microsoft. It's fast and sports a gorgeous screen, but most importantly its screen-bending gimmick is actually useful. Just be prepared to spend a lot for the privilege of owning one. Hardware \nThis is one gorgeous computer. And that's not just my opinion: Many people who walked by my office desk commented on the the Surface Studio's good looks. Its design is one of elegant simplicity. The focus is entirely on its 28-inch screen, which is connected to the short aluminum base with a pair of chrome hinges. That's pretty much it. But what's really intriguing about this computer isn't readily apparent at first glance. \nThose chrome hinges, for example, house an elaborate 80-spring mechanism that makes bending the Studio's display up and down practically effortless. The display outputs a sharp 4,500 x 3,000 (13-million-pixel) resolution -- 63 percent more than 4K, and 1.2 million fewer pixels than 5K. And all of the Studio's hardware is located in its slim base, which is basically just a mini-PC with some serious specs. There's also touchscreen support, as you'd expect, and the Surface Pen once again makes an appearance. \nAnd, just so we can get this out of our systems: Yes, this is a desktop computer that transforms. Yes, it's more than meets the eye. Let's move on. \nPractically everything about the Surface Studio's build screams refinement. The aluminum used around the sides and back of the screen, as well as the base, feels smooth to the touch. The chrome hinges reflect their surrounding environment, almost disappearing into your desk. And, despite having a delicate bending mechanism in its hinges, the Studio felt sturdy as I lugged it to different locations in our office. There was no flexing or creaking to be found. \nAt around 21 pounds, it's easy to move the Surface Studio around your home. (I wouldn't call it portable; more like relocatable.) While the base mostly gets out of the way, it might seem a bit chunky if you're used to all-in-ones that shove their hardware behind their screens. \nAround back, there are four USB 3.0 ports (one of which is high-powered), a gigabit Ethernet jack, a Mini DisplayPort connection, a full-size SD card reader and, of course, a headphone jack. I realize Microsoft is basically following in the footsteps of Apple and most other all-in-one PC makers, but it would have been nice to have a few ports along the sides of the Studio's base. At the very least, I would have liked to connect headphones without blindly fishing around the rear ports. (Though I suppose I should be grateful the 3.5-millimeter jack is there at all.) \nThere's a 5-megapixel camera for videoconferencing along the front face, right near an IR camera for fast logins using Windows Hello. You'll also find volume and power buttons on the right side. Beyond that, the Studio is a pretty minimalist device. The only bit of branding on the machine is a mirrored Windows logo on the back. \nAccompanying the Studio are the new Surface Keyboard and Mouse. Both sport the same gray aesthetic as Microsoft's computers, and they're basically just minor refreshes of the company's existing wireless input devices. Microsoft doesn't really get enough credit as a keyboard and mouse maker, but I've been a fan of their hardware for years. These new devices don't disappoint either: The Surface Keyboard has some satisfying feedback in its island-style keys, and it easily kept up with my angry post-election typing. The mouse curves into your hands well, and it works smoothly across a wide variety of surfaces. Its scroll wheel is also fairly smooth, though I wish it included horizontal scrolling like some of Microsoft's other mice. Display \nWith its PixelSense displays on the Surface Pro 4 and Book, Microsoft proved it could build some truly vibrant LCD screens. For the Studio, the company applied that concept on a larger scale. The result is a 28-inch screen that's among the sharpest and most colorful I've ever seen. It makes just about everything look good, be it 4K video, photos or simple Office documents. Its 3:2 aspect ratio feels a bit awkward now that we're used to widescreen monitors everywhere, but the display itself is also a mere 12.5 millimeters thick. It's honestly a bit hard to see from the side. \nArtists will likely appreciate the Surface Studio's ability to switch from SRGB and wider DCI-P3 color gamuts on the fly. Apple made a big deal about the iMac's support for the P3 gamut last year, and the same benefits apply here. Simply put, it'll let you view an even wider variety of colors. And since it's a standard backed by Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI), it's particularly helpful for editing digital video. Typical consumers will likely just notice that some photos and videos will appear much richer than before. \nMostly, I appreciate the Surface Studio simply for having a big freaking screen. After spending years writing on ultraportables and reading news apps on smartphones and tablets, I sometimes forget how nice it is to use a large screen where you can have a pile of windows thrown about, or simply view a full-size webpage next to a document for note taking. It might just be me, but I've found that bigger displays simply let me be more creative. Surface Dial \nOn the face of it, the $100 Surface Dial seems like an oddity. We've already grown used to keyboards, mice, touchscreens and even styluses like the Surface Pen; who has time for another accessory? Artists, that's who. Wacom has already gotten plenty of digital illustrators used to the notion of remote accessories, which let them quickly access tools they use often. But those remotes have generally been hard to use, with far too many buttons. \nThe Dial simplifies that concept. It's a small metallic puck that resembles a large volume button on an AV receiver. Give it a spin and you'll be able to control things like the volume or zoom. You can also click the Dial to select options and move between its functions. But the coolest thing? Plop it on the Surface Studio's screen and a ring of contextual options immediately appears. It's up to developers to bake in support for the Dial, but at launch you'll be able to change tracks in Spotify, zoom and rotate in Microsoft Maps and access a wide variety of settings in Sketchable. Performance \nI tested the top-of-the-line $4,200 Surface Studio, which packs in a 2.7GHz Core i7 6820HQ CPU, 32GB of RAM (!), a hybrid drive consisting of a 128GB SSD and 2TB HDD, and NVIDIA GTX 980M graphics with 4GB of VRAM. As you can imagine, it was one of the most powerful PCs I've ever tested. I was able to juggle dozens of browser tabs, 4K video playback and Minecraft running with high-quality settings all at once without breaking a sweat. The massive screen size practically encourages extreme multitasking. The only major downside is the Studio's slow disk speeds, which stem from its hybrid SSD/mechanical hard drive approach to storage. PCMark 7",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Cortana makes it easier to create a list and check it twice this holiday season",
      "text": "Microsoft’s Cortana personal digital assistant offers a nice set of functionalities today. She provides a machine-intelligence-backed voice response system for searches, roots through email to offer up suggestions for upcoming events and package deliveries, and ties systems together with reminders that can be set on one device and show up everywhere.\nCortana is also largely a back-end system, meaning that adding features and functionality to the personal assistant is as easy as flipping a switch on Microsoft servers. This is particularly helpful as holidays and other important events roll around, and a new list skill is being rolled out just in time for the upcoming holiday season, as Microsoft lets us know via a Windows blog post.\nMore: Cortana wants to get to know you better to improve her interactivity\nGiven that December brings a number of holidays that involve gift-giving worldwide, of which Christmas is just one, PC users around the globe are likely already cleaning up their shopping lists. Now, Cortana is hoping to make the task of managing the hectic process of matching loved ones, business associates, teachers, and others with their wish lists just a little bit easier.\nView photos\ncortana_list_holiday_survival_ More Starting today, you can simply ask Cortana to make a new list and she’ll respond accordingly. Once a list has been created, you can ask Cortana to add an item and she’ll do so, and opening a list is just a “Hey Cortana” away. Because Cortana runs on iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices, she’ll also keep your lists synced and up to date no matter which of them you’re using.\nFor even more complex lists, Cortana also works with Microsoft’s Wunderlist task manager. Connect Cortana to your Wunderlist account, and you can use Cortana to create tasks in that app for even more list-management functionality.\nYou can give the new Cortana list skill a try by saying, “Hey Cortana, create a holiday list.” Stay tuned to the Microsoft blog for more holiday fun, as the company is known for using Cortana as the conduit for adding some personality to Windows 10 as holidays roll around.\nHow to take control of the Action Center in Windows 10 Microsoft's new speech recognition system achieves human parity in audible words MacOS Sierra review",

      "text": "Next month, The Game Awards 2016 will be held at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles. Ahead of the event itself, the nominees for the various awards that are up for grabs have been announced.\n“The Game Awards is all about celebrating the state of video game art,” said producer and host of the show Geoff Keighley. “In just a few short weeks we will recognize the most outstanding games of 2016 in unexpected ways, and preview the most anticipated games of 2017 and beyond with the longest, most in-depth world premieres we’ve ever attempted — including surprises and new game announcements.”\nDoom , Inside , Overwatch , Titanfall 2 , and Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End make up the race for Game of the Year. Uncharted 4 is the frontrunner for a sweep with eight nominations overall, while Inside , Overwatch , and Firewatch aren’t far behind with five apiece.\nMore: The Witcher 3 and Splatoon win big at The Game Awards 2015\nElsewhere, the focus shifts to the biggest releases of next year with the Most Anticipated Game award. The titles nominated for the gong are God of War , Horizon: Zero Dawn , Red Dead Redemption 2 , The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild , and Mass Effect: Andromeda — the first gameplay footage of the latter is also set to be aired as part of the show.\nOther categories include Best Art Direction, Best Narrative, and the Games for Impact award, which casts a spotlight on releases that tackle real-world social issues. Individuals will be honored in categories like Trending Gamer, Best eSports Player, and the Best Performance award for voice actors.\nThe Game Awards will be broadcast live on December 1, with streams available via Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook Live, and more. In addition, the entire event will be viewable in virtual reality through the NextVR app — head to the show’s official website for more details.\nDT’s Top Tech of CES 2017 Award Nominations Game Awards return in December with live-streamed broadcast available in VR Who won big at the Emmys and who got shafted?",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Book at Amazon.com | Was $1,499 | Now $1,239 Screen resolution – what is it and why is it important? \nThe size of the screen isn’t everything; resolution should also be taken into account. The minimum resolution you’ll generally find is 1,366 x 768 pixels. This is fine for the majority of tasks. It’s even possible to work on two applications side by side with this many pixels, especially since so many modern web pages reformat themselves to suit the available screen space. \nThe Dell XPS 13 has a high-resolution 13.3-inch screen, which means you'll have to scale it up to see it clearly \nOn laptops with smaller screens, a larger resolution doesn’t always mean more space. When a laptop has a greater number of pixels in a small area, the operating system has to scale everything up, or else text and icons would be too small to see properly. \nThere isn’t a huge amount more space for applications on a 15-inch laptop with a 1,920 x 1,080 screen than on a 15-inch model with a 1,366 x 768 screen. However, the higher resolution does mean that text and icons will be far smoother, and therefore easier to see. \nTo get an idea of exactly what it is you’re looking for in a screen, it pays to go into a store and try a few out. Your eyesight and working preferences will decide what sort of screen you go for. Hybrids and Two-in-Ones \nMost laptops still offer a traditional clam-type design, with a screen that folds down onto the keyboard and touchpad. There are a few that buck the trend, however. Some laptops keep the traditional shape but add a touchscreen, which can be fun for creative tasks such as drawing or making music. Others have a touchscreen that can fold back behind the keyboard, turning the laptop into a tablet. Models such as Microsoft’s Surface range and the various Asus Transformers have a screen that detaches entirely, to make a proper tablet free from the weight and bulk of a keyboard. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book is the most expensive 2-in-1 you can buy \nThese specialist tablets are fine if you want to use the specific applications that take advantage of a touchscreen, such as design or music programs, but they’re far more expensive than standard laptops. If you're not 100% sure you what or need this flexibility, you're probably better off sticking with a normal laptop. Keyboard \nDue to the constraints placed on them by the laptop’s physical size, laptop keyboards tend to be more varied than desktop models. For a start, there’s room for a numeric keypad on only larger laptops, and then only on certain models. \nAlso, many laptops have small arrow keys, or backslash keys that are on the right rather than the left of the keypad. Only some laptops have Home, End and Page Up and Page Down keys, too; if there isn’t a physical key for such functions, you’ll need to use a Function (Fn) key combination instead. If you rely on these keys to navigate around a text document look for a laptop where all these functions are replicated by separate physical keys. \nThe 12-inch MacBook has 'Butterfly' keys, but their shallow travel won't suit everybody \nLaptop keyboards can vary wildly in quality, too. Some are unpleasant to type on thanks to horrid flex in the middle of the keyboard tray when you type. If you’re unable to try out the keyboard for yourself in a shop, we’d recommend that you at least read some reviews to see if there are any major problems. After all, you’ll have to live with a sub-standard keyboard as long as you have the laptop. Touchpad \nThe same is true of a laptop’s touchpad. This is one of the foremost ways in which you interact with your laptop, so it needs to work well. Unfortunately, many laptop touchpads are awful. There’s a trend for making the buttons part of the main touchpad, which, when implemented poorly, can mean your cursor jumps all over the place when you perform a click. \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 4 has an excellent Precision Touchpad \nPlenty of touchpads don’t respond accurately to finger movement, or have squishy buttons that make it difficult to determine whether you’ve registered a click. Most modern touchpads support gestures, where you can use two fingers to scroll or to pinch-to-zoom – but, again, how easy these gestures are to use varies widely between laptops. \nNowadays, many laptops come with Microsoft-approved Precision Touchpads, putting an end to years of mediocre Windows laptop touchpads that were massively outclassed by those found on Apple’s MacBooks. If you do pick up a laptop with a poor touchpad, there’s always the option of carrying a USB travel mouse in your bag, which brings us to… USB Ports \nA laptop has limited room around its base, so has far fewer ports than a desktop PC. For this reason, think carefully about what you need to plug in. For a start, some laptops have as few as two USB ports. If you have a printer and a mouse plugged in and want to grab some photos off your camera, you’ll need to unplug something – unless your laptop has a built-in SD card reader, as many do. Many current laptops have at least one USB 3 port for faster data transfers, too. \nLarger laptops tend to have at least three USB ports, which will be fine for most people. Also bear in mind that many modern laptops don’t have built-in DVD drives, so if you want to read and burn discs then you’ll need to budget around £20 for a USB model – and make sure you have enough spare ports. \nThe Asus ZenBook Pro UX501VW has a decent selection of ports \nUSB 3.1 ports are starting to appear on the latest high-end laptops. These ports are usually of the smaller Type-C variety, but they open up a world of possibilities when it comes to transfer speeds and peripherals. A single USB 3.1 port can host a load of high-power and high-performance peripherals such as displays and external hard disks via an external dock, which can be expensive but extremely practical. Networking \nAlthough all laptops have built-in wireless networking (if you have a fancy 802.11ac router, check your laptop’s wireless chip supports AC, so you get the best transfer speeds), not all have an Ethernet plug. We find this is an issue mainly when travelling, since some hotels offer poor wireless connections but fast Ethernet networking in each room. USB-to-Ethernet adapters are available for as little as £10, but bear in mind that this will use up one of your precious USB ports. Video outputs \nHDMI is the most common video output on laptops, which will serve to connect to most TVs and monitors (if not 4K models – very few laptops have the necessary HDMI 2.0 connector). Only some business models now have VGA outputs, which you may need to connect to an office projector in the boardroom. HDMI-to-VGA connectors cost less than £10, so this isn’t a big deal. Performance \nHopefully by now you have an idea of what the outside of your laptop should look like, so now it’s time to worry about the innards. First up is RAM. Unless you’re buying a seriously cheap laptop, opt for at least 4GB, so you don’t have to worry about how many browser tabs you have open at once. If you’re going to be editing video, you’ll ideally need at least 8GB, although this amount of RAM is now common even in inexpensive laptops. \nYou don't need a beefy gaming laptop to get things done, but it helps \nProcessor choice is trickier. You should aim for at least an Intel Core i3 processor, which will comfortably cope with web browsing and office work, and consider a Core i5 chip for more intensive tasks such as dealing with large images and editing and encoding video. Laptops with Core i7 chips are expensive but super-quick, so are worth considering if you want the best possible performance. \nVideo: Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 processors explained \nBe aware that not all Core chips are created equal – special low-voltage versions can muddy the waters. See our Core i3, i5 and i7 Explained article for more detail. \nThere are, of course, AMD-powered laptops on the market, but these are still much less common. Look for an AMD A8 or A10 processor to make sure you’re not getting an underpowered laptop. Graphics \nMost laptops rely on their processor’s integrated graphics chipset, usually called something like “Intel HD Graphics”. This can play simple 3D games at low resolution at low to medium detail settings, but if you’re serious about games then you’ll need a laptop with a dedicated Nvidia or AMD graphics chipset. It’s hard to determine how quick a graphics chipset will be from the model number, so we recommend searching for graphics benchmarks online to see how a chipset performs in the latest \ntitles. \nOnly very expensive laptops can play the latest games at very high detail levels, so if you have the space it may be worth buying a normal laptop and a gaming desktop PC (or a games console) instead. \nRelated: Best graphics cards 2016 Battery life \nAlong with size and weight, this should be a priority if you’re planning to travel with your laptop. It isn’t always possible to get a seat on a train or in a café near a power socket, after all. Small, light laptops generally offer superior battery life to larger models, chiefly due to being equipped with less powerful low-voltage processors and a smaller screen. \nAgain, read reviews to see how long a laptop’s battery will last; expect five to seven hours for a general-purpose 15-inch laptop, and eight to 10 hours or more from a small, highly portable one. Storage \nFinally, we come to storage. As is the case on a desktop PC, an SSD will make your laptop boot faster and feel far quicker and more responsive, so is worth looking out for if you can afford it. Unlike on a desktop PC, you can’t just buy a small SSD for your operating system and stick in a cheap hard disk for your personal files. \nIt's not hard to upgrade your laptop's hard disk to an SSD . Read our guide to find out more \nThe vast majority of laptops have room for only one disk, so you need to make sure it’s big enough. Some very cheap netbook-style laptops such as the Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 14 have 32GB of storage, which is barely enough for Windows 10 and some downloaded updates. We’d recommend a minimum of a 120GB SSD, and that’s only if you store most of your files in the cloud. \nIf your laptop is destined for home use and storing gigabytes of photos and music, you should opt for a model with at least 500GB storage. Some have hybrid “SSHD” drives, which combine a slow mechanical hard disk with a small SSD cache. These drives store frequently used data, so can speed up boot times and make the programs you use most often load faster. They’re a good compromise if you can’t stretch to a large SSD. \nOver the next few pages, we've listed the best laptops you can buy in a variety of form factors and prices. Read on to find out more.",

      "title": "Windows 10 Build 14971 is out",
      "text": "Microsoft is really pushing it with new builds for its Windows 10 operating system. The company released build 14971 to the Fast Ring Insider channel yesterday.\nThe last couple of builds have not been all that exciting in regards to new features. In fact, some introduced bugs, like the weird one that some apps, like Photos, Store or People, launch automatically after some inactivity, have still not been fixed in this build.\nWindows 10 Build 14971 ships with a couple of new features and changes though that stable Windows 10 users may look forward to when the next feature update of the operating system is released (likely in March 2017).\nWhat’s new in Windows 10 Build 14971 \nOne of the big feature additions in this build is EPUB support in Microsoft Edge. As you may know, Edge can be used to display PDF documents directly in the browser.\nThis works similar to other browsers, Firefox or Chrome for instance, handle native PDF reading. The newly added support for the EPUB format works in the same way.\nTo read an EPUB book click on it in Edge. If it is unprotected -- which means no DRM basically -- it will be opened and you can start to read it right in Edge without requiring a third-party viewer application for that.\nEdge displays a toolbar at the top that offers quite a few functions. You may use it to change the text size, font type or theme of the page, set page bookmarks, browse the table of contents (if provided), or use the built-in search to find words or phrases.\nYou can still download the EPUB file instead if you prefer that. Simply right-click on the link and select the save option that appears in the context menu.\nPaint 3D Preview \nThe new Paint 3D Preview app, showcased recently on a Microsoft event, is integrated in the latest build now.\nYou can run it directly as any other native Windows 10 application provided that you are on the link. This app will be one of the new apps that Microsoft will ship with the Windows 10 Creator's Update.\nThe app does not seem to have received an update though. Please note that it is still only available in English. The Remix 3D Preview, the community feature that is integrated in Paint 3D, is available in additional countries now though including Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Austria.\nFocus on PowerShell \nIf you use the Win-X menu regularly to open the command prompt, you may have noticed already that it is no longer listed in the menu.\nMicrosoft replaced the Command Prompt -- both the standard and elevated -- with PowerShell in the Win-X menu.\n\nThe Settings app has an option right now to undo the change. If you don't like it -- tell us why you don't please -- you can do the following to restore the command prompt links:\nRight-click on the Windows 10 taskbar and select Settings. Find \"Replace Command Prompt with Windows PowerShell in the menu when I right-click the start button or press Windows key + X\". You can still launch the command prompt by launching cmd from the start menu.\nOther changes The new Windows 10 build ships with a couple of other changes. Microsoft announced that it has improved the typing experience with Japanese and Chinese Input Method Editors in this build.\nAs always, make sure you read the known issues and what is been fixed on the official Windows blog before you start the update.\nThe auto-launching issue of apps can be quite annoying for instance.\nNow You: What's your take on the changes?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Windows 10 Build 14971 is out appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

Undesired productivity boost when run under VirtualBox on Ubuntu \nMicrosoft Windows , or simply Windows , is the collective name for a series of operating systems that began in 1985 as a means of reversing the stagnation of the computer hardware market. Borrowing and improving on features from competing platforms, Windows began as an add-on to MS-DOS , but eventually came to dominate the desktop market as one of the most popular software products of all-time. Contents edit History \nIn the year 1981, Microsoft and IBM took the first steps of a relationship that would eventually dominate the personal computer industry. The marriage of Microsoft's virtually bulletproof MS-DOS with IBM's premium hardware was an instant success, and soon gave birth to a host of clone manufacturers who later became industry giants in their own right: Zenith, Heathkit, and Tandy, to name a few. Unfortunately, the explosive growth had the side effect of completely saturating the slowly emerging market. While plenty of satisfied customers were happily number crunching with VisiCalc, many manufacturers including IBM itself were left with mountains of unsold inventory. It was until Rowland Hanson, the head of marketing at Microsoft, who inadvertently hit upon the answer when he pondered aloud at an executive meeting: “ It's too bad we couldn't make people so irritated that they'd throw their computers out of their windows. It'd be their own fault, and they'd have to buy a new unit complete with software once they came back to their senses. ” \nThis view was vocally supported by then-business manager Steve Ballmer, who observed: “ Just because we can build a computer that can run for 100 years doesn't mean we should. I mean, look! It almost fucking killed the light bulb industry! ” \nWithout so much as another word spoken, it was understood by the whole room that Microsoft would begin the process of systematically removing all the improvements it had made to QDOS , the \"Quick and Dirty Operating system\" it had purchased from Seattle Computer Products in 1980, and proceeded to initiate the development of a new software product without the involvement of IBM. The then-CEO William Henry Gates III argued: “ And the name? Well, why not \"Windows\"? Let's capitalize on peoples' urges to throw their computers out the window, shall we? ” \nEarly on, there were a number of critics who suggested that the name \"Windows\" was a reference to the product's fragility. Technology writer Dick Hertz observed: “ I mean, it's obvious, isn't it? Like a window, it seems perfectly clear and simple to use, but it crashes with the slightest pressure, or sometimes breaks inexplicably. ” \nThis speculation was largely curbed when Mr Hertz was found stabbed, burned, electrocuted, strangled, shot, and floating in the East River. Gates refused to comment directly to the press about the incident, but though his press secretary he stated that the death appeared \"accidental\". For those without comedic tastes, the so-called experts at Wikipedia have an article about Microsoft Windows . edit Culture shock A product placement by Microsoft in the popular sci-fi series Star Trek . \nTearing a page directly out of the Steve Jobs' Book of Corporate Culture Creation - or perhaps it was the Jim Jones' one, no matter - Bill Gates printed up a scores of T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan \"style, not substance\" and set his minions to work. Their mission, if they chose to accept it, was to dial up the eye-candy while systematically rebugging the software infrastructure. It was a punishing endeavour: writing bad software is easy, but writing software that runs like a gazelle but occasionally trips and falls and loses its memory, or collides in spectacular fashion with some unseen predator who devours it whole, lashes to limbs proved to be extremely difficult. Early efforts on test subjects also yielded poor results, with participants eager to throw their computer out of the nearest non-ground-floor opening but reluctant to visit ComputerLand for a replacement. In 2001, Windows XD was introduced. \nThe test code was subjected to ongoing in-house peer-reviews - \"VFI\", or \"Vote For Inclusion\" - with programmers choosing the bugs they liked best. Unexpectedly, it was not always the most clever or most well crafted coding that drew the most votes. Often, innocuous bits of writing that struck blindside by delivering an unforseen playload walked hand-in-hand with obviously chaotic monsters of destructive programming, and with stupidly crafted pieces of clumsy kludge following in tow. As it turned out, this carefully selected blend of predictable error and random terror developed into something akin to the corporate secret sauce. By allowing test subjects to have an occasionally pleasant experience (provided that they took certain steps to avoid known pitfalls), they developed an increasing tolerance to the built-in mix of random hardware and software fault messages, and at times even blamed their own stupidity for the crash. Before the Environmental Protection Agency was able to substantiate their half-baked conspiracy theory about some causal link between Microsoft and the sharp increase in the volume of silicon waste accumulating in municipal landfills, people began to quit throwing their computers away and instead looked to Microsoft for answers. The name Windows was retained for marketing reasons, but also to remind programmers of the development imperative: make it look clear and easy to use, but easily breakable. \nIBM, on the other hand, began their downward spiral into OS/2 and was eventual taken over by the Chinese . Bill has screwed people over before, as whatshisname from Seattle Computer Products insists; although he is currently under a legally-binding non-disclosure agreement to not divulge any further related details. edit Marketing A keyboard layout designed by Microsoft marketing department features an \"Any\" key for responding certain system messages such as \"press any key to continue\". \nMarketing Windows may seem pointless, since it is not what one pays for and has the right to receive. Even then, it is simply nuances. Fetish marketing. People who used to go into San Francisco bathhouses, put a ball gag in their mouths, cover their heads in a hood, bend over a table, put a can of Crisco on their butt , handcuff their hands behind their back, and wait to feel who came in, were left high and dry for a while in the 1980s, until they found something better — surfing with Microsoft Internet Explorer! After dozens of years of development, Microsoft has managed to make a browser that in full security mode with all the latest updates to everything simply cannot find a cleavage picture of Rose McGowan on a Web search without installing two keyloggers in the process, and they are only the ones the unscrupulous \"anti spyware\" program developers have not been paid to not report. While this method of discouraging visits to any \"subversive\" or \"non-standard\" site is less efficient for the national economy than the Great Firewall of China, it nevertheless generates dozens of times more revenue for Microsoft. License competitions. The International Olympic Committe is currently entertaining competitions for how many licenses for Windows a single person can accumulate for personal use. Every time the hard drive on a Windows machine gets irretrievably obliterated (per an average of approximately six months) the respective user gets tempted to spend another $500 or more on another computer with another Windows license. However, some people often outperform others as they are somewhat more careless than the latter. Plus, some actually pay to upgrade their software version, as though they would not be stuck doing it anyway the next time the computer crashed. In this competition, users are not allowed to bypass validation by clicking the cancel button. edit Development \nA longevity studies demonstrated that the error-tolerance and self-blaming observed in laboratory studies was short-term, and the development team were forced to reevaluate their strategies. After closely examining the implementation illustration created by the marketing department, their error was immediately apparent: software designers had created the rider and the stick, but had failed to produce the carrot for the donkey to follow. \nThe developers addressed the problem by by providing new software and a new service support plan: Support type Translation \"Bug Fixes\" Code previously approved by vote of the \"VFI panel\" is then removed by the Vote for Removal (VFR) panel. \"Telephone support\" Charge $3.99 per minute to read the customer the chapters on \"Reboot\" or \"Reinstall\" verbatim from the book How to use Windows: New User Experience ™. If that fails, direct them to \"Bug Fixes\" (q.v.) and hype the upcoming \"New Version\" (q.v.). \"New Versions\" Using the management technique of creeping featurism , publish a version of Windows that seems better than its predecessor, both aesthetically and functionally, but in fact does none of the same things but instead introduces a new set of VFI'd bugs along with some cherished favourites . \"Killer Apps\" Notepad, Minesweeper, Calculator, 3D Text screensaver, Ms Paint , and the ubiquitous solitaire . These are called \"Killer Apps\" because they take lives, or at least social lives. edit Internet \nBelieving the Internet to be nothing more than a glorified Bulletin Board system (BBS) of use only to a handful of nerds , Gates and company were late-comers to the browser wars. Their lateness not only cost them the opportunity for software patents but also threatened them to return the product back to the dark days of stability. Worldwide communication meant virus and trojan alerts through newsgroups, file trading in illicit software (like patches and fixes), and worst of all, troubleshooting by expert users during their free time free of charge . In short, with the Internet it had never been easier to ensure that a copy of Windows was running in tip-top shape. Early versions of Internet Explorer proved unusable, but by installing it by default with every copy of Windows, it offered the hope of re-establishing imbalance towards the Windows line. \nBut Microsoft's masterstroke was its gradual integration of Internet Explorer as the operating system's file browser, and the wide use of \" DirectX \" technology. This not only provided users with direct access to the Internet from any window but also provided hackers with direct access to the user's computer from any virus. Combined with its own in-house \"anti-virus\" software, a truly attractive but sub-standard software package which developers used their extra time to carefully construct, Microsoft guaranteed a cycle of dependence for years to come. edit Activation \nWith growth of the internet and p2p, software piracy became rife with versions of Windows such as Windows XD: Pirate Edition that were stripped of its \"New Versions\" and VFI'd bugs. This had severe consequences for the company, who no longer had control over what bugs a user was entitled to keep and/or remove. Microsoft responded by releasing its activation system, along with propriety adware in the guise of \"must-have\" software such as Windows Movie Maker and Windows Live Messenger, among others. \nAutomatic software updates were also turned on automatically, so all the latest bugs were always available to the end user. This was in addition to a new killer-app for Windows Fiesta and beyond; the restart computer reminder. A user could no longer keep a Windows computer on for more than four hours without being reminded that their machine needs to be restarted. This is a testament to the amount of bugs created every minute by Microsoft Employees which need constant editing; however, a user can enjoy exactly the same behaviour from their computer by installing Windows 666 without activating it. Microsoft are working on this problem. edit The Past \nIn we're-pretending-to-develop-it versions, the different levels were called null, fail, craptastic, windows WTF edition (WTF stood for a new Windows Text Format), and \"almost works.\" However the marketing team decided that this wasn't very user friendly so these were changed to the more comprehensible and accurate names student, home, professional, business, ultimate, and a new secret edition could be unlocked by typing \"windows_is_so_awesome.exe -like bill.gates into a terminal window which could be unlocked by typing \"windows_is_so_awesome.exe -like bill.gates into a terminal window which could be unlocked by typing \"windows_is_so_awesome.exe -like bill.gates into a terminal window which could be unlocked by [[X] LOOP ERROR - ATTEMPT RECOVERY] \nThis included some suggestions for improvements to be made by the user. unfortunately some bright spark noticed that releasing the source code would result in it being turned into something that worked by evil penguins. The bonus version can now only be activated by sending your bank account details to M****$** who will deal with them under the company privacy policy.",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft Edge recently received a new feature that will definitely make it more appealing to users . The latest Windows 10 build brings EPUB file format support to Edge, allowing users to read their favorite EPUB books directly in the browser. \nAll Windows 10 users will be able to use this new feature in early 2017, when Microsoft launches the awaited Windows 10 Creators Update . Microsoft Edge offers a complete reading experience to users, allowing them to customize the browsers’ reading interface and change the font and text size. Also, users can choose between 3 themes and inserts bookmarks. Microsoft Edge lets you read EPUB books \nThe reading experience will get even better with the Windows 10 Creators Update! In addition to providing a great reading experience for PDF files – you can now read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge. When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. \nYou can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser to navigate through an e-book. Moreover, you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. \nIf you’re not an Insider, you still need to use a third party application or extension to read EPUB files. Until the Windows 10 Creators Update is released, you can check out our dedicated article on the best EPUB readers to use on Windows 10. \nOf course, if you don’t want to download a third-party EPUB reader, you can enroll in the Windows Insiders program at any time and test the brand-new Microsoft Edge EPUB reader feature for yourself. \n ",

      "text": "News Analysis Microsoft embraces open source in the cloud and on-premises Microsoft is positioning itself as the software vendor of choice for enterprises that maintain hybrid cloud environments, and it's opening its arms to Linux and open source software to do it. Senior Writer, CIO | Nov 21, 2016 12:28 PM   Credit: Thinkstock Why you need Open Source \nWith the announcement of a broad swathe of new data products and services at Microsoft Connect in New York City last week -- including that the next release of SQL Server will support Linux (and Docker) -- the software giant has signaled a renewed focus on customer choice and flexibility, underscoring the increasing importance of cloud computing as a central pillar of its business. \n\"We've been on this journey for the last few years now,\" says Rohan Kumar, general manager, Database Systems, Microsoft. \"It's really a company about choice right now. We really want to meet customers where they are.\" \nMicrosoft has offered multiple flavors of Linux on its Azure cloud public cloud platform and infrastructure for several years now. \n\"Microsoft loves Linux,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the 2014 announcement of new Azure services. \"Twenty percent of Azure is already Linux. We will always have first-class support for Linux [distributions].\" Redmond meets The Linux Foundation \nMicrosoft took that love another step last week. In a move that would have been stunning more than a decade ago, it joined The Linux Foundation — which sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds and plays a central role in the promotion of open source software — as a platinum sponsor. \n\"As a cloud platform company, we aim to help developers achieve more using the platforms and languages they know,\" Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Microsoft Cloud and Enterprise Group, said in a statement last week. \"The Linux Foundation is home not only to Linux, but many of the community's most innovative open source projects. We are excited to join The Linux Foundation and partner with the community to help developers capitalize on the shift to intelligent cloud and mobile experiences.\" \nAs part of its sponsorship, John Gossman, architect on the Microsoft Azure team, is joining the board of directors of The Linux Foundation. \nOnce the tireless defender of proprietary software against the insurgency of the open source model, Microsoft has come around in recent years. It contributes to a variety of Linux Foundation and Apache Software Foundation projects, including the Linux Foundation's Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative. It also maintains a repository of its own open source code . \n\"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,\" Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, said in a statement last week. \"The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" It's messy out there \nThe reason, Microsoft's Kumar says, is simple: In the messy, real world of enterprise IT, hybrid shops are the norm and customers don't need or want vendors to force their hands when it comes to operating systems. Serving these customers means giving them flexibility. \nThat philosophy has spread from Microsoft's cloud business to its on-premises infrastructure business as the company seeks to make support for hybrid environments a key differentiator of its cloud and on-premise offerings ( an idea Nadella pushed as Microsoft's executive vice president of Cloud and Enterprise before his ascension to CEO). Last week, Joseph Sirosh, corporate vice president of the Data Group at Microsoft, announced that the next release of SQL Server would, for the first time, support Linux. \n\"Now you can also develop applications with SQL Server on Linux, Docker or macOS (via Docker) and then deploy to Linux, Windows, Docker, on-premises or in the cloud,\" Sirosh wrote in a blog post . \"This represents a major step in our journey to making SQL Server the platform of choice across operating systems, development languages, data types, on-premises and in the cloud.\" \nKumar adds that customers tell Microsoft, \"I want to use SQL and don't care about what's underneath it. I don't want to worry about it, I just want to know that whenever I want to install SQL, I have the choice to do that.\" \nAll major features of the SQL Server relational database engine are coming to Linux, Sirosh said, including advanced features such as in-memory online transactional processing (OLTP), in-memory columnstores, Transparent Data Encryption, Always Encrypted and Row-Level Security. There will be native Linux installations with familiar RPM and APT packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. He noted that the public preview of the next release of SQL Server, in both Windows and Linux flavors, will be available on Azure Virtual Machines and as images on Docker Hub. \nIn addition, as a further sign of its commitment to flexibility, Sirosh announced SQL Server 2016 SP1, a service pack that introduces a consistent programming model across SQL Server editions, meaning programs written to exploit in-memory OLTP, in-memory columnstore analytics and partitioning will work across the Enterprise, Standard and Express editions. \n\"Developers will find it easier than ever to take advantage of innovations such as in-memory databases and advanced analytics — you can use these advanced features in the Standard Edition and then step up to Enterprise for mission critical performance, scale and availability — without having to re-write your application,\" Sirosh wrote. \nMicrosoft has also published its JDBC Connector as 100 percent open source and updated its ODBC for PHP driver and launched a new ODBC for Linux connector, all to make it easier to work with Microsoft SQL-based technologies regardless of the underlying OS. Additionally, Microsoft VSCode users can now connect to SQL Server, including SQL Server on Linux, Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. The company has also updated its SQL Server Management Studio, SQL Server Data Tools and Command line tools to support SQL Server on Linux. \n\"I'm excited about Microsoft as a company truly embracing choice,\" Kumar says. \"We're clearly seeing the base getting energized in a big way. People are giving us a chance again.\"  ",

      "title": "Home Hub may be Kids Corner for your PC and hopefully a new class of hardware for Microsoft",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s kitchen of the future. \nMicrosoft’s Home Hub is believed to be a “ project aimed to build a smart kitchen based on the Microsoft’s Cortana and Azure Cloud. ” We have long believed that this will be an Amazon Echo-style device , but some text from what appears to be an app manifest appears to indicate the project is part of a more comprehensive system called the “Family Desktop”, which looks like a kind of Kids Corner for your PC.\nlol, apparently HomeHub is a family oriented feature of Windows 10 PC, called \"Family Desktop\", basically a shared account pic.twitter.com/kkEJalD1Tq \n— WalkingCat (@h0x0d) November 22, 2016 \n\nAccording to the text from the manifest:\nA Family Desktop, along with the Family Features on your PC, makes it easy to get to common tasks without logging in. You also get a quick View of all the things your family uses every day like shared calendar, lists, music, and more.\nIt seems likely that this will be available to every Windows 10 PC, but given that Home Hub also appears to be a hardware product, and that Microsoft has been releasing some spectacular hardware recently, it does not seem unlikely that Microsoft will also be releasing some compelling hardware to support the software features.\nOf course the PC-based family notice board has long been pursued by many Windows OEMs, but has always faltered by being too expensive for the amount of value Windows users saw in the feature. It would take a rather amazing piece of hardware from Microsoft to convince us to shell out the thousand plus dollars such a device from Microsoft will cost. On the other hand the Surface Studio has already wowed us, so the odds seems good Microsoft will be able to pull another rabbit out of the hat, particularly given that Microsoft appears to be working at making all their visions a reality .\nWould our reader shell out for an expensive kitchen PC, no matter how cool? Let us know below.\n",

      "text": "Three years ago today Microsoft’s Xbox One entertainment console wasn’t in a good place. Microsoft had botched the console’s announcement and failed to provide need to know details about how it worked. If you’d have asked anyone whether they thought the console might be able to recover, you’d have gotten a “maybe.” Today, the Xbox One stands tall. It hasn’t just survived. It’s thrived.\nIt’s midway through one of its biggest exclusive game line-ups in history, with the holiday only providing a brief pause on the steady stream of Halo, Gears of War, Forza and other franchise favorites. This year’s high-profile fall launch, Gears of War 4 , has some of the most critical acclaim we’ve seen of any Xbox One game. September’s Forza Horizon 3 managed to garner more glowing reviews by remixing the Forza racing formula into something new and fresh.\nAdvertisement\nRead: PS4 vs Xbox One – All the 2016 Details\nThe company’s software teams have gone back to focusing on what makes Xbox One unique: its software. Xbox Live is set to get two features that will change how the console’s online gaming community finds friends and people to play with. Looking for Game makes it easy to let everyone know exactly when you want to play your favorite multiplayer games. With Clubs it is simple to hold a group of friends together through messages, regular playdates and basic community building. Xbox One Backwards Compatibility allows you to play your older titles absolutely free. The library titles available there keeps growing and growing.\nAdvertisement\nXbox One’s launch was a debacle. You can’t debate that. On the other hand, Microsoft has managed to steadily improve the Xbox One’s standing by delivering titles and features that users want and need. Here are 12 exciting things you can do with Xbox One.\nAdvertisement\nSync Your Saves 1 / 13 There was a time when going to play video games at someone else’s house required you to bring over a copy of the game and your game save. Thankfully, that’s no longer the case.\nXbox One syncs both your game purchases and game saves over the internet, meaning you don’t have to keep track of your game save on your own. The console reaches out to Xbox Live’s servers to download your character progress.\nDigital games can transfer between consoles when you log in too, but the amount of time it takes to download the latest games means you’re probably better off still putting those on an external hard drive.\n1 / 13",

      "text": "The start of the current console generation was not kind to Microsoft. As PlayStation 4 sales rapidly outpaced the Xbox One, it seemed as if the console might be dead on arrival. After a rough few years, the Xbox One has endured, and indeed seems to be thriving. Sales are up and, more importantly, the console has a good, diverse selection of games, granting access to both AAA spectacle and infinitely replayable indies. We’re always keeping our eyes out what’s new and interesting on the Xbox One, and as such, we’ve compiled a list of the best games the console currently has to offer.\nRelated: Gamers don’t need Microsoft’s new Xbox One S, but videophiles will love it\nBattlefield 1 ($55+) After two lackluster campaigns in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4 , Electronic Arts and DICE finally managed to pull it all together and deliver the complete package in the World War I-themed Battlefield 1 . Focusing on several soldiers’ experiences during the “war to end all wars,” the campaign delivers emotional, heartfelt moments that contrast with the large-scale, destructive warfare for which the series is known.\nAs polished and exciting as the campaign may be, multiplayer remains the real star of the show. Returning modes such as “Conquest” and “Rush” feel right at home in their World War I setting, with wide-open spaces, armored trains, heavy tanks, and “Behemoth” vehicles help create what is possible the most chaotic Battlefield game ever made. The new “Operations” mode, which takes teams across a series of multiplayer maps in an all-out, extended version of Conquest, is where Battlefield 1 is at its absolute best. The 64-player firefights see both teams clawing forward to try to get the advantage, while the game’s environmental destruction system sends buildings plummeting to the ground left and right. Read our full review here .\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nHalo: The Master Chief Collection ($18+) Halo: The Master Chief Collection is the perfect introduction for Xbox One owners new to Microsoft’s console line. Containing the four numbered games in the series — sorry, Reach — it’s enough content to keep you busy for weeks on end. Halo 2: Anniversary , a remastered classic with new cinematics and sound effects, is an incredible game that occasionally even shows up Halo 5.\nAs you may have heard, Halo: The Master Chief Collection was a bit of a mess at launch, but the game’s server issues have stabilized. There are more than 100 maps to choose from, spanning from the original Halo to Halo 4 , and though the majority are remastered versions of old favorites, a select few were rebuilt from the ground up specifically for the collection. Of course, if you’re like us, you’ll be spending all your time blowing your friends up in “Blood Gulch” anyway. Read our full review here .\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nDark Souls III ($34) Taking inspiration from Bloodborne , the studio’s PlayStation 4 exclusive, Dark Souls III speeds up the Souls series’ distinctive tough-as-nails combat, without sacrificing what made fans fall in love with the franchise in the first place.\nThough Dark Souls III continues the series’ legendary difficulty, even the most menacing foes can be dispatched through a mixture of practice and patience. The loop of killing enemies, trading in their souls to upgrade your character, and venturing back into the unknown will keep you glued to your console for hours at a time. If you ever get really frustrated, you can always summon a stranger to join in on all the fun.\nIt’s unlikely that we’ll be seeing another game in the Dark Souls series from From Software and mastermind Hidetaka Miyazaki, but we couldn’t be happier with Dark Souls III as a conclusion to the series. It’s the work of a genius who has only further refined his art over time, and a shining example of how to make a franchise successful without sacrificing the more “hardcore” gameplay elements.

Its puzzle-solving gameplay blends elements of science-fiction with creepy, trial-and-error death traps, and emergent gameplay mechanics seamlessly into its narrative.\nWhile just as nihilistic as Limbo , Inside ‘s story contains an element of strange, twisted beauty that only Playdead can deliver. The unnamed protagonist — a small child who wears the only bright item of clothing — reacts with fear, anxiety, and determination to the events transpiring in this depressing world. By the end you may wonder, “what did this person do to deserve this?” And what did we do to deserve a game as refreshing as Inside ?

Returning to Mars and the depths of Hell, the game’s narrative is simple, but still manages to be a perfect nod to the ’90s. The original “Doomguy” returns, conveying emotion and a twisted sense of humor without saying a word. Flipping off your enemies has never felt so satisfying.\nBut if its combat didn’t deliver, Doom would have been forgotten as soon as it arrived. Fortunately, an arsenal of ridiculous weapons, such as the Super Shotgun and the BFG, make their glorious return, and an army of vicious demons provide a level of challenge not often seen in today’s shooters. The whole experience moves at blistering speed, too, forcing you to stay on your toes and rapidly switch between your weapons as demons swarm to your position.\nDoom also features a small but very memorable selection of boss battles. Using every trick and strategy you’ve learned up to each fight, these high-intensity moments can end in your death with just a few slips of the thumbsticks. Yet, at the same time, finally conquering them will stand among your proudest gaming achievements.

The team-based “hero shooter” features a refreshing take on objective-based multiplayer action that emphasizes teamwork and strategy over brute force.\nWith a selection of more than 20 playable heroes, plus at least one additional character added for free through post-release updates, Overwatch encourages you to experiment with different styles of play. Though Soldier: 76 may appeal to longtime shooter fanatics and Reinhardt seems like the obvious choose for RPG lovers, you’ll quickly find that keeping teammates alive as Mercy or holding down a crowded area with Hanzo can be just as rewarding.\nRecently, developer Blizzard also revealed a plan to make Overwatch a much more varied game than what was initially advertised. Its “main” mode is certainly a class-based shooter, but the addition of the “Lúcioball” — a take on soccer very similar to Rocket League — has turned the game into a very viable sports destination. With more surprises in store and a growing community of players, Overwatch may very well go from being the best multiplayer shooter of the year to the best multiplayer shooter of the decade.

Amidst a plague of disappointing franchises and broken open-world games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt emerged, a savior every bit as welcome as its weathered protagonist. Developer CD Projeckt Red’s commitment to its audience (a slew of updates and free DLC followed the game’s release) stands out at a time when most big games seem hastily assembled or even exploitative, but make no mistake: in any era, no matter how great, The Witcher 3 would stand out.\nFollowing up on the events of The Witcher 2 , the game follows the continuing adventures of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter searching for his lost lover, Yennefer, and Ciri, the child they raised. Although its central plot offers a long and entertaining quest, there’s far more to the game than finding Geralt’s loved ones. The world is massive, dense with characters great and small who have their own problems they’d like Geralt to solve. Whether its exorcising a spirit haunting a village or helping a blacksmith rebuild his business, there are hundreds of little adventures to go on, and some even intersect in surprising ways.\nThe world of The Witcher is dark. An early scene finds Geralt riding into a war-torn province, the camera pulling back to reveal a massive tree from which prisoners of war have been hanged. It’s a grim image, and it sets the tone for much of what is to follow. Often the game will present choices that can have wide-ranging, unforeseen consequences. Not everyone gets a happy ending. Despite all the gloom, there are moments of warmth: an orphan reunited with relatives, drinking games with Geralt’s war buddies, a night of passion with an old flame. Wildly ambitious and epic in scope, The Witcher 3 is a watershed moment for role-playing games, setting a new gold standard the genre.

After more than twenty years and a feud with publisher Konami, Kojima’s final game, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain , is hell of a note to end on, as MGSV refines the series’ signature stealth gameplay to near perfection, while expanding the the setting from confined military bases to an open world.\nThe Metal Gear series has a long and winding plot, but newcomers will find MGS V relatively easy to slide into, as Kojima has jettisoned much of the mythology in favor of a more straightforward revenge tale. Nine years after the events of the prequel Ground Zeroes , in which the mercenary crew led by protagonist Snake was destroyed by the mysterious organization Cipher, Snake awakens from a coma, missing an arm and under threat from assassins. After a harrowing escape from the hospital he’s been sleeping in (a nightmarish opening that shows off Kojima’s directing chops), Snake joins up with his old comrades to rebuild their mercenary army and take revenge on Cipher.\nAlthough story has always been the main draw for Metal Gear, MGS V eschews lengthy cutscenes and monologues, instead focusing on open world gameplay that provides the player with countless ways to approach any mission. Tranquilizers, sniper rifles, shotguns, a remote controlled robot arm; all this and more is available, giving the game an endless sense of replay value. After completing a mission using a stealthy, nonlethal approach, one may feel the urge to replay the same mission, marching into an enemy outpost with a machine gun and a rocket launcher, burning the whole thing to the ground. Few games encourage experimentation like MGSV . Some questionable narrative choices aside, MGSV is a powerful ending to one of gaming’s most important franchises, setting a new bar for open-world gameplay.

Reimagining iconic protagonist Lara Croft as a young archaeology student, the game took a more grounded approach to the adventure genre, requiring Lara to scavenge for supplies and try to survive harsh environments. The sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider , builds on the foundation laid by the first game, with a more mature Lara building weapons from scrap and spelunking in some gorgeous tombs.\nThe tombs are perhaps the most notable feature. The reboot was light on ancient puzzles and grandiose booby traps, with players spending most of their time running through jungles. Rise makes up for this, scattering tombs big and small around the world for players to explore. This emphasis on puzzles and platforming make Rise feel action-packed without needing to throw hundreds of enemies at the player.\nWhich is not to say that the game lacks for combat. As in the first game, Croft is not the only person rummaging around ancient cities. In Rise , she is at odds with the mysterious organization Trinity, an order dedicated to unearthing supernatural artifacts, and one with no compunctions about killing intrepid archaeologists in their way. Lara has a variety of weapons at her disposal, including bows, knives, and guns. Lara can dispose of enemies quietly or run around guns blazing. This tactical freedom, as well as the game’s slick controls, makes combat in Tomb Raider a tense, thrilling experience.

Seeing classic characters reunite with newcomers adds a layer of heart that was missing from the 2013 prequel Gears of War: Judgment , and with plenty of set pieces and the series’ excellent cover-based shooting.\nMultiplayer fares even better, with each and every mode encouraging players to keep moving and engaging the enemy. The introduction of goofy weapons such as the ricocheting “Buzzkill” and the “Dropshot,” which can decimate players hiding behind cover, also create new opportunities for firefights that just aren’t possible in most cover-based shooters. This is on top of the new “yank” ability, which allows you to grab an enemy from cover and drive a knife into their throat. If anything screams “Gears” more than that, we don’t know what it is.\nWhether you decide to venture into the campaign, play a few rounds of multiplayer, or try the latest iteration of “Horde” mode, you’ll also be experiencing one of the prettiest games on the Xbox One. Colors are vibrant and varied, marking a departure from the drab browns and grays of the original trilogy, and environmental effects look so good that you may accidentally get yourself killed as you stare in awe.

The original film is still held up as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, and the sequel set the template for pretty much any sci-fi action film that involves space marines. From those hallowed origins, however, the franchise has declined deeper and deeper into B-movie schlock. It seemed improbable that the franchise would ever be scary, or even competently made, again. Those fears were assuaged (and others rekindled) with the release of Alien: Isolation , a survival horror game that traps players aboard a derelict space station with the iconic xenomorph.\nRecent horror games have experimented with preventing the player from fighting enemies, in stark contrast to older games (i.e. Resident Evil ) that allowed players to mow down enemies with various guns, provided they had the ammo. Alien: Isolation splits the difference, providing players with weapons and tools that they can use to fight the various denizens of the station (rogue androids and human scavengers,) but the titular alien cannot be killed, only driven off at best. The alien is persistent, stealthy, and disturbingly quick, so players will need to keep their wits about them and keep an eye out for places to hide. Isolation is a harrowing experience, hopefully a blueprint for horror games to come.

No longer are you playing as a vigilante out for revenge on those who wrong his family, but as a young, mayhem-causing hacker who believes that the underground “DedSec” organization is the best line of defense against increasingly invasive automation and surveillance systems. Hacker hero Marcus Holloway cracks jokes, taunts his enemies, and does backflips off of walls instead of just climbing down — he’s the polar opposite of Aiden Pearce, and that’s a very good thing.\nThe hacking tools offered in the original Watch Dogs have also been significantly expanded, allowing you to directly control other citizens’ (or the cops’) cars to cause chaos and a major distraction as you attempt to escape from a crime scene, and the “Profiler” tool has been enhanced, now letting you hack nearly every person you encounter. Read our full review here .\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nFallout 4 ($34+) What is there to say about Fallout that hasn’t been said before? The latest game from Bethesda has everything one expects from their games: a massive open world, hundreds of ways to customize a character, quests and stories hidden in every nook and crannie, and of course an unfortunate (if funny) slew of bugs. Fallout 4 doesn’t reinvent the Bethesda formula, but it does build upon it in some interesting ways. As with Fallout 3 and New Vegas , the game drops players in the middle of a postapocalyptic wasteland with a big overarching goal (in this case, to find your kidnapped son.) From there, players are free to explore the world, doing whatever quests they feel like, and treating the wasteland like one big sandbox. There are guns to collect, mutants to fight, wacky characters to talk to (or murder, if that’s your thing.)\nThis should all sound familiar to fans of the series. Perhaps the biggest addition is that players can help build settlements, constructing homes, defenses, and other things a community needs to thrive in the wastes. The crafting system encourages obsessive scavenging, and provides a regenerative aspect to a series that has so often seemed bleak. Watching towns rise from the rubble provides a sense of hope, echoed by the relatively lush environments, where the gray and brown are tinged with fauna returning to the world. Fallout 4 won’t convert anyone who has disliked Bethesda’s past games, but veterans of the wastes will feel like coming home.

Tolkien, much like Star Wars and Marvel , seems less like a franchise and more an empire these days. From humble beginnings as fantasy novels, the series has spread into every medium: two epic film trilogies, one largely forgotten animated film, a colony in the Lego universe, and quite a few video games. The games have long been the weak link in the Tolkienverse, including passable brawlers, shoddy platformers, and a shockingly long-lived MMORPG. Given the glut of Middle-earth games, Shadow of Mordor only needed to be competent to stand out. The fact that it transcends expectations, crafting a fresh adventure with tight gameplay and an intriguing new system for designing enemies, makes it a delight.\nShadow of Mordor is an open world game, with many quests to complete and abilities to unlock. Taking a lot of cues from the recent Batman games, Shadow of Mordor often surround the player with enemies that have various abilities and weakness. The player has their own arsenal of tools, and fights develop a rhythmic quality as they progress; cut down one enemy, parry an incoming attack in time, roll out of the way of a sword and dispatch an orc with an arrow through the eye. The variety of weapons and fluid combat keep things interesting throughout the game.\nWhile the combat and progression are well executed, the most compelling aspect of Shadow of Mordor is the nemesis systems. Among the hordes of enemies in the game are orc leaders, stronger named characters whom the player can kill or be killed by. Dying to an orc means they will become more powerful. Moreover, a rank-and-file orc who kills the player can be promoted to a leadership position. On the flip side, the player can wound or even manipulate the orc leaders. The game keeps track of the various leaders as well as their relationship to the player; an orc whose face you burned in a fight may have some choice words when next you meet. It’s a revolutionary system, giving life to enemies that would, in most games, simply be mindless mobs. Read our full review here.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth ($15) One of the most interesting trends in indie games recently has been the rise of “roguelikes,” a genre named after the early PC game, Rogue . It’s a strange trend because the philosophy of rogue-likes seems so at odds with mainstream games, the most notable example being how death factors in. In most games, death is an inconvenience, a temporary setback, alleviated by systems like checkpoints. In rogue-likes, death is permanent, requiring players to start the game anew. One of the leaders of this resurgence has been The Binding of Isaac , a charming yet grotesque game from indie dev Ed McMillen, which has been iterated on a few times since its first release in 2011. BoI drops players in a procedurally generated dungeon, requiring them to survive numerous hazards and defeat bosses in order to descend further. There are randomly generated items to collect which provide a variety of odd abilities, as well as dramatically altering the player’s appearance.\nIt may be more accurate to describe The Binding of Isaac as a rogue-lite, as while death does end the player’s current run through the dungeon, new items and characters can be permanently unlocked, giving the game a sense of progression even in failure. This is a welcome mercy, as the game can be quite difficult, especially if the player is stuck with weak or double-edged items against the later bosses. However difficult it can get, the fun in BoI comes from making the most of what the game gives you, just managing to scrape by against the odds. Moreover, the random nature of the dungeon layout and items spawned means that the game has nigh infinite replay value.

It’s apt-titled sequel, XCOM 2, makes that game look like Kirby’s Adventure . More powerful enemies, including upgraded “Sectoids” and the new “Viper” class, are capable of decimating your small squad in a single turn, and an increased emphasis on robotic warriors requires you to keep your squad’s weaponry balanced and ready for any situation.\nStressful as XCOM 2 can be, however, there is no greater feeling than finally completing a particularly tough mission and evacuating your squad to the safety of The Avenger . This mobile base allows you to research and build some truly dastardly creations, including plasma rifles, powered exosuits for your soldiers, and “Psionic” units that are capable of turning the occupying alien force against itself while the rest of your squad picks off the survivors. The attachment you’ll feel to your soldiers, particularly if you choose to rename them as your friends and family, will make every decision you make carry weight, and the late-game abilities your more experienced units can learn make a few of the game’s characters completely indispensable. Read our full review here .\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nForza Horizon 3 ($49+) The Forza Horizon series separates itself from other racing games with its increased emphasis on open-world exploration and best-in-class driving controls, and Forza Horizon 3 exemplifies this more than any other game in the series. This time around, the Horizon Festival is being held in the gorgeous and diverse country of Australia, in which you can race amid dense forest, the unforgiving outback, and metropolitan areas that rest beside the ocean. The entire country is a blast to explore, in large part because Forza Horizon 3 makes the most of its open world with challenges and events tailored for specific regions of the map. While most open-world games are full of “things to do,” you’ll actually want to do them here.\nIf you’re more interested in just jumping into a race and testing your skill against other drivers, Forza Horizon 3 is still a fantastic option. The return of the “Drivatar” system lets you challenge your friends, even when they’re not playing the game, and you can even draft them to form your own “team.” The “rewind” feature also accommodates newer drivers perfectly, letting you try the same stretch of a race over and over again until you understand how to execute a drift properly or avoid overshooting a turn. Once you’re ready to race with your friends, you’ll never want to play solo again — after all, the entire campaign is playable in multiplayer.\nMusic, particularly licensed tracks, often get overlooked in video games, but this would be a mistake with Forza Horizon 3 . Given the game features tracks from the Descendents, Bad Religion, Pennywise, Aesop Rock, Beethoven, CHVRCHES, and dozens of other artists, it’s worth loading it up just to sit and listen to a few tunes. If you use Groove Music, you can even import your collection to create your own personal playlist. Read our full review here .\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nOri and the Blind Forest ($20) So much is made of the technical aspects of graphics, it is easy to forget how far a strong grasp of style can go. With striking watercolor backgrounds and character designs that evoke Miyazaki films, Ori and the Blind Forest is among the most beautiful games of this or any other generation, putting many AAA titles to shame. The sensuous visuals would suffice to make a great film, but a game needs gameplay, and Ori shines there as well. Inspired by classic games like Metroid, the game puts the player in control of the nimble forest spirit Ori, who must navigate a large 2-D world, collecting items and abilities that allow Ori to reach new areas. Certain abilities are necessary to complete the game and thus are easy to find, but there are many things hidden off the beaten path, rewards that adventurous players will find useful.\nDespite its adorable protagonist, Ori and the Blind Forest is a viciously difficult game. Combat often requires the player to dodge numerous projectiles, pirouetting through the air as they fight enemies, and some sections add difficult platforming into the mix. Thankfully, the game is generous with checkpoints, a welcome gift from an otherwise harsh mistress. For those who long for the challenges of old-school games, Ori and the Blind Forest is a revelation, infusing Metroid’s style with modern sensibilities.\nBuy it now from:\nMicrosoft\nMortal Kombat X ($18+) The Mortal Kombat series has always been more famous for its cartoonish violence (it was one of the games that led to the creation of the ESRB rating system) than for its gameplay. That’s a shame, as Mortal Kombat is one of the most consistently fun franchises in the fighting game genre. Mortal Kombat X , the sequel to 2011’s reboot of the franchise, represents a change in course for the series, replacing many of the series’ iconic characters with new faces, and mixing up the gameplay by adding a new version of the fighting styles system from Deadly Alliance. For those unfamiliar with the notorious franchise, Mortal Kombat pits two players against each other on a 2-D plane. There are more than 20 characters to choose from, each with a unique set of skills that can greatly alter how matches play out. Each character has three different “variations” which affect how they are played. For example, Scorpion’s Ninjutsu variation allows him to dual-wield swords, while his Hellfire variation gives him a suite of fiery attacks. The variations allow players to tailor their characters abilities based on their playstyle.\nIn addition to standard 1v1 fights, MKX has a number of different modes to keep players entertained. A lengthy story mode follows up on the events of the last Mortal Kombat , which left much of the cast dead with a new threat looming on the horizon. This time, the core cast are the children of the former protagonists. The Living Towers provides a series of odd challenges for players to complete, while the game’s Faction Wars provides a persistent online competition between players. For as much as Mortal Kombat refuses to grow up (the Fatalities only seem to grow more clownish with every installment,) MKX mixes things up in some interesting ways, a good sign for the series going forward. Read our full review here.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nDivinity: Original Sin – Enhanced Edition ($24+) Originally released on the PC in 2014, Divinity: Original Sin was an attempt to resurrect the CRPG genre, bringing back the complex skill trees and character choices of classics like Baldur’s Gate , but more accessible to modern audiences. The experiment was a success, resulting in a game possessing incredible depth without being too difficult for beginners to grasp. For their next trick, developer Larian Studios decided to port the game to consoles, an astounding proposition that never should have worked out. Somehow, they made it work. Original Sin’s controls easily map to the XBOX controller, and the in-game text and menus have also transitioned well. The game’s dense world and quests are a rare sight on consoles.\nCombat is a huge part of Original Sin , with an incredible mix of systems that makes every fight improvisational. In addition to the many abilities at their disposal, players can also use the environment to their advantage, such as by using a pool of water to spread an electric current. Likewise, players must be wary of how natural features can be used against them. Divinity’s combat is refreshingly deep, rewarding players who can learn its intricacies and think on the move. Perhaps the biggest draw for console owners is the addition of local multiplayer, a feature sorely lacking in console game these days. So robust is Original Sin’s multiplayer that both players can participate in dialogue. RPG fans who own an Xbox may have felt like they were wandering a desert the last couple years; for them, Divinity: Original Sin will be manna from heaven.\nBuy it now from:\nAmazon Microsoft\nMissing out on ‘Westworld?’ Watch online with these streaming services and devices Save $10 on the 2016 Roku Streaming Stick, a DT Editors’ Choice pick Buy an Xbox One S bundle with a free game and $50 credit",

While the game as existed on Windows for more than 25 years, the modern Solitaire Collection will now be available outside of Windows for the first time. Microsoft is offering its Solitaire Collection on iOS and Android free of charge, as the company hopes to gain more players to add to the 119 million who have played the game on Windows 8 and Windows 10.\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection for iOS and Android includes Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid,and Tripeaks game types, alongside daily challenges for players. Microsoft is integrating Xbox Live into the game so you can sign into Solitaire and play with friends or earn achievements. Microsoft is also offering a “Premium Edition” for $1.99 per month without ads, and which includes double coin rewards for daily challenges and game boosts.\nWhile there are lots of Solitaire games already available on iOS and Android, Microsoft counts its version as the “world’s number 1 Solitaire game” thanks to its loyal following on Windows. You can download the iOS version from Apple’s App Store , or the Android equivalent over at Google’s Play Store .",

      "text": "by Kevin Mark Rabida . November 23rd, 2016 0 SHARES The key to a great career is… Microsoft Excel. Who knew? \nMicrosoft Excel is one of the most used software in business. In fact, most of the job listing in the market these days needs to at least have a basic understanding of how this particular spreadsheet program works. \nBut how exactly can your career benefit from learning Excel? Business learning solutions company SkilledUp prepared a nifty infographic to explain exactly that. Courtesy of: SkilledUp Additional Notes on Excel Burning Glass Technologies recently conducted the study on the divide between jobs that demand digital skills and the ones that don’t. The result was not surprising. Those that require digital skills are outpacing those that do not require it. They found out that: Nearly eight in 10 middle-skill jobs require digital skills. Spreadsheet and word processing proficiencies have become a baseline requirement for the majority of middle-skill opportunities (78%). Digitally intensive middle-skill occupations are growing faster than other middle-skill jobs. Digitally intensive jobs have grown 2.5 times more rapidly than middle-skill jobs that do not require spreadsheets, word processing, or other digital skills (between 2003 and 2013, 4.7% growth for digitally intensive jobs compared to 1.9% growth for other positions). Digitally intensive middle-skill jobs pay more than middle-skill jobs that do not require a digital component. Digitally intensive middle-skill occupations offer 18% higher wages on average: $23.76 per hour compared to $20.14 per hour for all other middle-skill jobs. The pivot table which is listed as an advanced skill but in my opinion, it’s probably the most important Microsoft Excel skill that you should master. Dave Bruns from Exceljet has an excellent story on exactly why there should be no exceptions in learning how to manipulate data with pivot tables. Lifehack compiled a list of tips and tricks that you could learn in order to be a Microsoft Excel power user. The best quality of life improvement that Microsoft put on Excel is probably the ability to view two spreadsheets side by side . It’s not common knowledge so be sure to check out their step by step guide to do it. This improved my productivity by a lot. If you’re bored with all the business stuff that you, you can learn how to use Excel to produce works of art, like this work of this 74 year old Japanese artist or Pikachu below. \nHow do you use Excel in your work?

      "title": "Microsoft and Sensoria partner with PGA pro Bryson DeChambeau to create ‘smart’ golf grip",
      "text": "Embed from Getty Images \nThe golf grip is getting geeky.\nPGA Tour golfer Bryson DeChambeau worked with Microsoft and Seattle-area startup Sensoria over the past eight weeks to create a prototype “smart grip” that analyzes how much pressure he applies to the golf club throughout a swing.\nAs detailed by Microsoft in this blog post , DeChambeau let Microsoft and Sensoria — a smart-garment maker based in Redmond, Wash. — build sensors into his grips that measure force and pressure exerted.\nIn golf, how tight or loose a player grips the club can be a key determining factor for ball flight. There are different schools of thought on how one should grip the club from shot-to-shot, including putts.\nWith eight embedded sensors, which each weigh less than half an ounce and measure one square inch, DeChambeau was able to receive real-time data analyzed in the cloud by Microsoft Azure that shows how exactly he held the club throughout a swing.\nVia Microsoft/Sensoria. The sensors, using a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, also provide data on club movement in space and “graphically renders pressure of the hands in relation to the golf grip,” Microsoft noted.\n“The data collected from Bryson over time will be analyzed during future phases of the project in a Machine Learning environment to build new intelligent golf data streams, helping him determine the right grip and club usage, swing speed, rhythm, plane, and other performance and swing-mechanics variables,” Microsoft added in the blog post.\nVia Microsoft/Sensoria. It comes as no surprise that DeChambeau is testing new technology, given that the 23-year-old is a serious geek. He majored in physics at Southern Methodist University and his passion for science has influenced an unconventional golf swing . In 2015, DeChambeau became the fifth player ever to win the NCAA Championship and the U.S. Amateur in the same year; he finished in the top 25 for both The Masters and U.S. Open this year.\nFor Microsoft, meanwhile, this is another foray into the golf world. In 2015, the company inked a three-year deal with the PGA Tour to use to improve how shots are tracked and how fans engage with content , among other applications. It’s part of Microsoft’s push into sports .\nFounded in 2011 by former Microsoft employees, Sensoria develops an array of “smart” garments that can track your movements and measure how well you’re walking or running. The company just updated its app with an artificial intelligence-powered real-time personal trainer . It partnered with Microsoft earlier this year to develop “smart soccer boots” and partnered with Renault last year to build a smart racing suit for professional racecar drivers.",

While the game as existed on Windows for more than 25 years, the modern Solitaire Collection will now be available outside of Windows for the first time. Microsoft is offering its Solitaire Collection on iOS and Android free of charge, as the company hopes to gain more players to add to the 119 million who have played the game on Windows 8 and Windows 10, The Verge reports. \nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection for iOS and Android includes Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid,and Tripeaks game types, alongside daily challenges for players. Microsoft is integrating Xbox Live into the game so you can sign into Solitaire and play with friends or earn achievements. Microsoft is also offering a “Premium Edition” for $1.99 per month without ads, and which includes double coin rewards for daily challenges and game boosts. \nWhile there are lots of Solitaire games already available on iOS and Android, Microsoft counts its version as the “world’s number 1 Solitaire game” thanks to its loyal following on Windows. You can download the iOS version from Apple’s App Store, or the Android equivalent over at Google’s Play Store. Related links:",

      "text": "Microsoft is offering big Black Friday savings on Xbox products. (Microsoft screenshot) Shoppers still stuffed with turkey and all the trimmings can start stuffing stockings with electronics ranging from laptops to televisions to virtual reality headsets to video games and much more as Black Friday deals kick into gear on Thursday.\nIf you’d rather not follow REI into the woods and #optoutside during the huge shopping day, opting inside will afford you the chance to get in on a number of deals from manufacturers and retailers including Amazon, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Nintendo and Steam to name a few.\nAmazon (Amazon screenshot) You’ve seen those videos of people climbing over one another and throwing punches to get at TVs and other gadgets on Black Friday. Amazon encourages shoppers to avoid the potential for a black eye on Black Friday and shop from your couch instead.\nFrom its special Deals landing page , the online retail giant is hosting limited timed deals on a wide variety of merchandise. Lightning Deals and Deals of the Day are there one minute and gone the next, so shoppers are encouraged to act fast and check back often.\nFor example, a Black & Decker cordless Dustbuster was 50 percent off at $25 during a site visit on Wednesday. But the clock was ticking, and there was less than nine hours left on that deal.\nOn the Amazon devices page , prices have been slashed on Kindles, Echo Dot speakers, Fire tablets and more. A 6-inch black Kindle E-reader is $30 off for a price of $49.99, for example.\nMicrosoft (Microsoft screenshot) The deals started early Thursday morning on the Microsoft website as shoppers looking for PCs and laptops and Xbox consoles had a variety of offers to choose from.\nThe Surface Pro 4 is discounted from $1,179 to $829; the Surface Book is $300 below its normal price at $1,699.\nGamers can snatch deals on Xbox consoles, games and accessories in exclusives being offered through the Microsoft Store. The Xbox One S is offered at its lowest price ever, starting at $249. Games such as “Gears of War 4” are up to 50 percent off and controllers are as much as $35 cheaper.\nVirtual reality fans cans also score on HTC Vive and Oculus Rift gear through Microsoft, with $100 promo codes and store credits.\nSonos Sonos’ entry-level speaker — the Play:1 — will be available on Friday at a number of retail outlets, including Best Buy, Amazon and the Apple Store, for just $149. That’s $50 off the normal price, reports the Verge , which notes the special sale will run from Nov. 24 to Nov. 28 .\nT-Mobile (T-Mobile screenshot) T-Mobile CEO John Legere — known for his wild promotional stunts — is at it again this holiday season. The Bellevue-based wireless carrier is offering a free iPhone 7 to those who trade in a select phone. As always on deals like this, just make sure to read the fine print.\nCostco Costco is going hog wild with deals, as the discount retailer is offering a plethora of discounts on TVs and other electronics.\nFor example, Costco members can buy a Samsung 75″ Ultra HD Smart LED LCD TV for just $1,999 . The deal is available through Nov. 28 , while supplies last. Here’s the bad news: You can’t buy more than three of them!\nValve (Steam screenshot) Valve, the Bellevue-based video game company, is running a host of deals via its Steam storefront through Nov. 29. The site says there are currently 13,399 titles on sale — if you can’t find something worth playing in that lot, perhaps you should pick up a book.\nWe’re just going to go ahead and play “Grand Theft Auto V,” which is 50 percent off and priced at $29.99.\nNintendo (Nintendo screenshot) Nintendo started offering 3DS and Wii U video games at up to 50 percent off in its eShop on Wednesday. 3DS games such as “Hyrule Warriors Legends” ($27.99) and “Fire Emblem Awakening” ($19.99) and Wii U games “The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD” ($34.99) and “Super Mario Galaxy 2 ” ($9.99) were among the deals.\nBest Buy If you do decide big box is best for your shopping experience, some of Best Buy’s biggest deals are highlighted in this Business Insider story . There are big TVs and little iPads and headphones and cameras to be gotten. Let’s go with the GoPro Hero5 Black 4K action camera for $399 with a $35 Best Buy gift card and 64GB memory card thrown in.\nApple (Apple screenshot) As we previously reported , Apple is getting back in the Black Friday swing of things after not offering any deals on the day after Thanksgiving (or on Cyber Monday) last year. The Apple website doesn’t tease anything that might be discounted, but it’s a good bet that the deals could center around Apple Watch, Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, iMac, MacBook and so on. You know, stuff Apple makes. So check back .",

Customers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems.…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft UK is offering some sweet deals on a couple of Xbox One games for Black Friday. The company is offering discounts on Forza Horizon 3, Gears of War 4, Halo, and even ReCore.\nForza Horizon 3 is probably the best deal available right now as the game has been out for a few months now. The game received fantastic reviews from critics, and it also picked up some sweet updates over the past few months. It’s set to get a Winter update later this year, which should also be very exciting. If you are yet to play the game on your Xbox One, this might be the best time to pick one up from the Microsoft Store. As part of its Black Friday deals, Microsoft is offering Horizon 3 for only £29.99 which is £20 less than the usual price of the game. Do keep in mind that this is only for the Xbox One — if you want to be able to pay the game on your Windows 10 PC via the Xbox Play Anywhere program, you’ll need to buy the game digitally.\nIf you want to get Forza Horizon 3 you can grab it from the links below:\nForza Horizon 3 [Xbox One] – Microsoft Store, £29.99 Forza Horizon 3 [Xbox One] – Amazon, £23.99 ] Forza Horizon 3 [Digital: Xbox One, Windows 10] – Amazon, £31.99 The Microsoft Store is also offering some sweet deals on other Xbox One games, which you can find below:\nKiller Instinct: Definitive Edition (£19.99) ReCore (£19.99) Gears of War 4 (£25.00) Halo 5 Limited Edition (£19.99) Halo 5 Limited Collectors Edition (£80.00) Rise of the Tomb Raider (£19.99) Quantum Break (£29.99) Gears of War: Ultimate Edition (£19.99) Halo: The Master Chief Collection (£14.99) Forza Motorsport 5 (£14.99) ",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nIt’s that time of the year again, and people are all geared up for the great Black Friday sale. While some head to buy their favorite pair of shoes or pick up that beautiful dress, others sit around and hope that they can get some big discounts on the games of their choice. \nYes, you read that right! Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank and of course, The Last of Us Remastered are now all available for only $249.99 and less! These games will help you go through the holiday season without having to worry about how to spend your time. \nSony UK has started on their PlayStation deals with a large number of PS3, PS4, and PS Vita titles. Microsoft has also followed suit and opened the Xbox Live sale. There are a large number of titles available under the sales section, and the players are spoilt for choice. \nHowever, it needs to be kept in mind that the prices are only for online purchase. Players should remember that when the Black Friday sale starts in stores, the same games will be available at lower prices. So, you have to decide whether you want to buy the title online or take a risk and wait to purchase it from a nearby store. \nSome games have almost 76% off. Go through the list of games and their discounted prices, provided by Metro and select the ones you want to lay your hands on. Hurry if you want to put your hands on discounted games since many would flock to buy them, and the stock might get over! \nUncharted 4: A Thief’s End packs in a significant number of stunning features. The recently launched HDR support for the game greatly enhances the visualization. Players have compared the two versions of Uncharted 4, and they realize what a huge difference HDR support makes to the game. \nHere is a word of caution, if you are planning on getting your hands on Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, with HDR support, make sure that you have a television set that supports HDR. The experience of the game can’t be enjoyed without an HDR supported television set. iTech Post reported that there is a lot of difference in playing the game in an HDR supported TV set and in one that doesn’t support the feature. \nThey have even provided a video for the players to understand the difference between the two. The HDR support enhances the graphics and makes it clearer. The clouds and the reflected sunlight looks a little unnatural without the feature. The HDR support gives the gameplay a natural feel. \nFor the players who want to enjoy the HDR feature to the fullest should go for the Samsung KS7000 UHD 4K HDR TV. It supports 4K HDR option as well. The television is currently ruling the charts when it comes to a TV that is perfect for the latest and remastered games, available in the market. \nNaughty Dog will release Uncharted 4: Survival mode in December, this year. With Gears of War 4 set to release during the same time, players are hoping that Uncharted 4 can share Gears of War 4’s monopoly over co-op survival modes. \nUncharted 4 will allow the players to face AI enemies while they try and build defenses, help the characters to rank up and coordinate with their fellow teammates. If you think that Uncharted 4 is entirely similar to Gears of War 4, then you are wrong! Uncharted 4 will also force the players to other interesting things on the side of the main gameplay, which keeps the interest intact. Page 1 of 2 1 2 »",

      "text": "Anton Watman/Shutterstock\nWindows 10 offers a number of enhancements that makes it perhaps the best Windows operating system version yet. There is the Cortana digital personal assistant , Universal Windows Platform for apps that run on desktops, notebooks, 2-in-1s, and phones, and significantly improved security .\nOne area where Windows 10 hasn’t quite made the mark is in its user interface, which could be called simplistic and underwhelming in its design cues. It appears that Microsoft is well aware of these deficiencies and is planning to improve the UI with Project Neon in the Redstone 3 update in late 2017, according to Windows Central .\nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Update cements its status as the best operating system ever\nThrough the Creators Update set to arrive in early 2017 and slowly rolling out now via the Windows Insider program, Windows 10’s user interface has been a continuation of the Metro design concept that start with Windows 7 Media Center and continued through various iterations of Windows Phone. Dubbed Microsoft Design Language 2, or MDL2, the current look and feel of Windows 10 is just more of the same.\nBeginning with the Redstone 3 update due in the early fall of 2017, however, Windows 10 will receive a more streamlined facelift via Project Neon. The focus of Neon will be adding some excitement to a flatter UI without the kind of enhancements that make an OS more interesting to look at.\nAccording to Windows Central, “Details are still scarce, but we hear some of the new designs in the plans include adding more animations and transitions, with the overall goal of making the UI very fluid and ‘beautiful’ compared to the current, almost static UI that is MDL2. One source familiar with Microsoft’s plans described Neon as, ‘Very fluid, lots of motion and nice transitions.'”\nIn addition, Neon could incorporate some design concepts to bridge Windows Holographic and HoloLens with the Windows 10 desktop. Details are sketchy on how 3D concepts would translate to 2D displays, but textures, 3D models, lighting effects, and more could be involved.\nMore: Windows Holographic will be on your PC by the end of 2017\nProject Neon looks to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary, holding onto the relatively simple UI that Windows 10 enjoys but making it more attractive to look at. The refresh will also offer developers more direction in how to make apps that are more visually appealing than current Universal Windows Apps.\nAccording to Windows Central, Project Neon should show up with Redstone 3 early in the fall of 2017. Redstone 4, which will arrive in 2018, will offer developers the ability to implement Project Neon in their own apps. It looks like it won’t be too terribly long, then, before Windows 10 users will have an operating system that is as nice to look at as it is to use.\nCreators Update will begin rolling out to Insiders soon starting with Paint 3D HP plans to make good use of the 3D tech in the Windows 10 Creators Update Windows 10 Preview Build points to March 2017 release date for Redstone 2",

      "text": "0 0 \nOutlook is a great tool used by many, especially in business orientated environments, which allows users to manage their email accounts right from their desktops. Through Outlook , you can have a general perspective of all your email addresses and manage them. \nCreate new emails, read and receive emails on all your accounts, or just move some stuff from spam to trash. Whatever you can normally do on your email via browser is possible with Outlook, but with a much more convenient access point. \nAs of late, Outlook has been experiencing some technical difficulties, with enough users that it caught Microsoft’s attention. Once word was received that Outlook is not performing like it should, Microsoft further looked into the situation and uncovered that this had been going on as early as November 17. \nUser would reach a dead end when trying to either use Outlook or access their website. Some complained about email syncing between platforms being down, while others claimed they couldn’t access Outlook altogether. \nThe problem seems to have had been resolved, as Microsoft has started to roll out a fix for Outlook. Not everyone has received the fix yet, but it is presumed that it will eventually reach all devices. You might be prompted about an update which contains the Outlook fix in the near future if you still haven’t received any word. \nThe good thing is that Microsoft managed to find out what the problem was and act accordingly, although a public announcement that states the problem has yet to be issued. Some speculate the perpetrator is the update of the entire Outlook service , which might have left some bugs behind. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "\n2016 has been a great year for Microsoft, especially with the success of the Surface Pro 4. There have been rumors that Microsoft is producing a Surface Phone, and now it looks like those rumors may become a reality. The Australian Financial Review interviewed Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who talked about bringing something “unique” to the market .\n“We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.”\nNadella adds that this mobile device will be geared towards a specific set of customers who need specific capabilities. Although Nadella didn’t specifically say he was talking about the Surface Phone, many believe that’s the product he was definitely referring to. Forbes looks forward to the new Surface Phone.\n“These are all good strategies, and are being put into good effect by the teams in Redmond. But the obvious conclusion here is that Microsoft will be debuting a smartphone in the near future that demands an ‘ultimate’ moniker. Everyone not living under a digital rock knows what that device would be. The Surface Phone,” says columnist Ewan Spence, adding that he believes Microsoft will likely deliver that product during the first half of 2017.\nThere is a lot of excitement for the Surface Phone on Twitter.\nVital signs of the possible @surface phone. So excited for it, still using @Windows phone and I'm so happy with it! https://t.co/pxSedS47fl \n— Christian Söllner (@chris_soellner) November 26, 2016 \n\n@GabeAul Gabe, on a selfish note I'd be really excited if u said you've been using a Surface Phone for a few months, oh well, we can dream\n— Steve B (@SteveW40b) October 26, 2016 \n\nThe Surface Phone is widely expected to run Windows 10, which may be a problem. In the past, running full desktop operating systems on pocketable devices has been a disaster for consumers. The 2007 Ultra-Mobile PC (UMPC) was a perfect example.\nWhile many thought it would be really cool to have Windows on such a small device, using it, especially because of the poor battery life, was a different story. The UMPC failed, but perhaps the Surface Phone won’t. After all, Windows 10 has been made to work well on mobile devices. As many have noted, the Surface Phone could take complete advantage of the mobile aspects of Windows 10 and end up being a very useful phone for business users.\nBesides the Surface Phone possibly being released in the first half of 2017, we will likely see a Surface Pro 5 release as well. Microsoft could have released the new Surface Pro 5 in time for the holiday season, but it is likely waiting for the brand new 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors to become more readily available — this would help improve the battery life, which has been highly criticized on the Surface Pro 4.\nThe Surface Pro 4 has been highly criticized for its poor battery life. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Most rumors have the Surface Pro 5 coming out in the spring of 2017, right around the time the second major Windows 10 update happens. According to Tech Radar , we could see an updated rechargeable stylus, a 4K screen (on at least one of the models), and maybe an even larger screen. There may be a newly improved Type Cover as well, although many feel that the Type Cover for the Surface Pro 4 is already excellent\nMicrosoft may not have a full hold on the laptop/tablet hybrid business this spring. As the Inquisitr reported last month, Apple may be getting ready to release the third generation MacBook with Apple Pencil support. Apple users have been asking for this for a long time, and even though Steve Jobs was always against the use of any type of stylus with Apple devices, the marketplace has changed.\n2016 was a rather boring year for laptop/tablet hybrids, but we won’t be able to say the same about 2017. The Surface Pro 5 and the MacBook may finally break this category into the mainstream.\n[Featured Image by George Frey/Getty Images]\nMicrosoft Surface Phone And Surface Pro 5 Excitement Builds is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "The first fashion shoot with the iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode \nAs it ever has been , as yet unseen products coming some day from Microsoft are the best. \nWriting for the Forbes contributor network and elf on a shelf fan fiction den, Ewan Spence says “Microsoft’s Surface Phone Could Be The Ultimate Mobile Device.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Peter Ryan .) \n2017 will see Microsoft release what CEO Satya Nadella describes as “the ultimate mobile device.” \nWell, if the CEO of Microsoft described this unseen device that way… must be! \nPundits about Apple: “Phones are commodities now! No one will continue to pay for Apple devices!” \nPundits about Microsoft: “ZOMG EXCITING NEW PHONEZ!” \nSpeaking to the Australian Financial Review, he talks about how Microsoft missed getting on the first mobile train… \nDon’t worry! There’s always a mobile train leaving the mobile train station! \n…but is determined to deliver something unique, and will continue to be in the phone market. \nWere they ever really in the phone market? \nFor many people the ultimate mobile device is the one they currently have in their pocket… \nWhich is to say, not something made by Microsoft. \n…Microsoft’s current focus on the cloud could mean making that mobile device “ultimate” by getting that user signed up and using Microsoft apps such as Outlook or OneNote. \nSo, ultimate for Microsoft, not the user. Got it. \nThe Surface devices are pretty nice, although it helps them stand out in the Windows world that their competition can be best described as plastic tied up with a bow of crapware. \nNow take all those [Surface] design touches and put them in a smartphone chassis. \nNow give it a stylus. Put a cupholder on it. Ship it in brown. \nThere. Perfection. \nDon’t worry about meeting a low price to reach a significant number of consumers, just worry about making it the best smartphone possible and if that means it won’t sell tens of millions of units so be it. \nDoes that sound like some other company to you? Spence was all about market share when it was Apple that was supposedly losing it to Microsoft. \nThat really would be an ultimate mobile device. And I expect Microsoft to deliver on its vision in the first half of 2017. \nFuture Microsoft products can never fail! Aw, man. The Macalope wishes he was a future product from Microsoft. That’d be amazing. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed. Related:",

      "text": "Forced updates in Windows 10 have their appeal. For Microsoft, it helps keep the majority of its users on the same build of Windows 10, reducing legacy support issues. For users, it keeps your system up-to-date and reduces the chances of getting hit with malware that takes advantage of unpatched systems.\n\nBut some folks resent the idea of having updates forced on them—especially when some of those updates cause problems or won’t install properly. If you’re running Windows 10 Home you’re at the mercy of Microsoft’s update schedule (though we have some tips for you at the end of this article). Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise users, however, have the opportunity to defer certain types of updates.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "\nApple and Microsoft both announced new laptops within the past few months and naturally these machines are being pitted against each other. The new MacBook Pro rocks the much-talked about Touch Bar and the Surface Book comes with that unique hinge and touch display. They’re both fantastic computers with beautiful displays and premium specs.\nBut which one is better?\nIt all comes down to personal preference, but that’s the easy answer. The real answer is more complicated than that, and Jon tries to break it down as best as he can in the latest episode of Ask the Buffalo.\nWhich one would you choose? What are the best features? How do they compare to previous generations? What is the best use of the Touch Bar?\nJon answers all of those questions and more in the video above.\nSee full gallery on TechnoBuffalo ",
