      "text": "Google Will Block Ads On Fake News Sites, Cutting Off Revenue Alphabet's Google announced plans Monday to restrict ads from false news sites. (Google) Reprints \nAlphabet ( GOOGL )-unit Google says it is working on an update to restrict ad-selling software on fake news sites, after misinformation online become an issue during the presidential election. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Google said in a statement. \nAmericans increasingly get their news from Facebook ( FB ), Twitter ( TWTR ) and other social networks or search engines, rather than via established media players. That's opened the door for the spread of false news stories. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said false stories didn't sway the outcome of the presidential election. \nGoogle itself served up fake news on Sunday, with search results for \"final election numbers\" highlighting a false news story that claimed Trump won the popular vote. \nGoogle's AdSense network is a major source of revenue for many sites, so the policy could curb the financial incentive for fake news sites. \nGoogle, which said it's been working on the new policy since before the election, has similar bans on sites with pornographic or extremely violent content. \nAlphabet shares fell 2.4% on the stock market today while Facebook lost 3.3%, both tumbling below their 200-day moving averages as investors dump big-cap techs. Twitter rose 3.2% after hedge fund Jana Partners disclosed a small stake. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "Google also gets fooled into promoting fake election news Google News Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press Google said late Monday that it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” Google said late Monday that it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” (Marcio Jose Sanchez / Associated Press) Associated Press \nGoogle's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the Internet's gatekeepers. Even as that story continued appearing high up in its search results, however, Google announced a move to punish purveyors of fake news. \nThe incorrect election results were shown Monday in a 2-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump website 70 News. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. \nGoogle acknowledged that its search engine misfired. “In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” the company said in a statement. \nAs of Monday afternoon, the link to the 70 News story — which had the misinformation in both its headline and the body of the text — remained prominent in Google’s search results. \nBad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53% of the people who land on a Web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to online analytics firm Chartbeat. \nAlthough Google rarely removes content from its search results, the Alphabet Inc.-owned company is taking steps to punish sites that manufacture falsehoods. Late Monday, it said it will prevent its lucrative digital ads from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information.” The action could give sites a bigger incentive to get things right or risk losing a valuable source of revenue. \nGoogle's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60% of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada.

It didn’t matter. \nWhen it comes to influencing public opinion, the 2016 presidential election demonstrated with sobering effect the weakening role of traditional media and the ascendant power of social networks... (David Pierson) \nFalse information is nothing new on the Internet. But the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election. \nFacebook Inc. has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its “trending” news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend. \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism, calling it “crazy” last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that “more than 99% of what people see” on Facebook is authentic. He said that more must be done to block bogus information, but that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task. \n“Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated,” Zuckerberg wrote. “While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.” \nThe stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas called algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms, which the company regularly revises to thwart sites that try to artificially boost their prominence. \nIncorrect information is bound to ripple across the Internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, media analyst Ken Doctor said. \n“These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do,” Doctor said. “But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings, and they have all the failings of human beings.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nTrump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides , California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses , UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years , and L.A.

      "text": "Google is restricting AdSense ads on fake-news sites Cutting off advertising revenue could help constrict the supply of misinformation. Save Oleksiy Maksymenko via Getty Images \nGoogle made headlines recently about the top search result for 'final election numbers' being patently false. Now the company is going to keep fake-news sites from using its nigh-ubiquitous AdSense program according to the Wall Street Journal . In a statement, the search giant says that as part of an update to its publisher policies, that it will restrict ad serving on websites that \"misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose\" of the site. \nWith the surfeit of questionably sourced-or-written articles that popped up during this year's election cycle, it's refreshing to see at least one of the largest players in tech taking responsibility and addressing how information is distributed and presented. That sound you hear is the ball bouncing around on Facebook's court . We've reached out to Google for additional information and will update this post should it arrive.",

      "text": "share Apple is working on a wearable device similar to Google Glass that would blend an augmented reality display with a standard pair of glasses, according to a report from Bloomberg News . The company is still exploring the smart glasses market, the report states, so it’s unclear when a finished product will materialize. The earliest time frame for a product reveal is 2018, yet Apple could sit on the project for much longer or change its direction as it has with its automotive ambitions . Apple is exploring both AR and VR It’s been well known for months now that Apple has been collecting AR talent and putting minds to work in secret on some type of consumer product. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly answered AR-related questions on quarterly earnings calls , saying he thinks the technology has more potential than its virtual reality counterpart and coyly hinting at Apple’s plans to enter the space. However, as of September of this year, Apple continues to hire both AR and VR experts , leaving open the possibility that it could develop products in both categories. According to Bloomberg , Apple has already had talks with potential suppliers for components like near-eye displays. It also has the expertise behind companies like PrimeSense, Metaio, and Flyby, all startups that were focused on AR software, 3D mapping, and computer vision before Apple acquired them over the course of the last three years. The goal is to develop a pair of glasses that could connect wirelessly to an iPhone and overlay information on the wearer’s field of vision. Apple has acquired a number of startups specializing in AR software AR is not without its hurdles. Google Glass was a massive flop, giving AR a sour public image and showing just how far the technology needs to go before it can be worn on our face. The most capable headset available to the public right now is the developer version of Microsoft’s HoloLens, which costs $3,000. Another startup, Magic Leap, continues to work in secret on AR technology it will not discuss in detail. Meanwhile, the rest of the tech community has turned its focus to VR. Google has its Daydream platform and new View headsets , while Facebook-owned Oculus VR and Samsung are working on all manner of high-end and mobile headsets. It’s unclear where Apple will fall on the spectrum, but Cook remains bullish on AR. “There are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” he said of AR last month .",

      "text": "If you’re still looking for a good laugh after the election, Google’s new Cheeseburger extension is it.\nOn Google Chrome, users can download the “ Make Trump Burger Again ” extension to replace almost any picture of the president-elect with a burger. Daragh Kan, the co-founder of an Australian burger chain called Mr. Burger , created the extension.\nThe inspiration for the extension, Kan first told Mashable , comes from wanting to “brighten people’s days, and after Trump’s win we thought we’d create something small to make the internet fun again.”\nToday we tried to make the Internet great again! https://t.co/eiqb6mBNZg\n— Mr Burger (@mrburgertruck) November 11, 2016\nHowever, the extension isn’t foolproof: To work properly, the image must have the word “Trump” in its alternative text, notes Mashable.\nHowever, if users would prefer to remove the president-elect from their Internet browsing altogether, there are Chrome extensions for that, too. Technologist Rob Spectre created “ Trump Filter ” to completely eliminate Trump, or minimize how often Trump-related content is seen based on the user’s preference, from any webpage the extension-user is visiting. Similarly, there’s “ Trump Blocker “: A Trump filter that not only removes Donald Trump from webpages, but it also filters and removes Trump from Facebook and YouTube.",

      "text": "Alphabet’s Google said on Monday it is working on a policy update to restrict its ads from being placed on fake news sites as concerns mount about the rapid spread of inaccurate information online.\nThe policy change is imminent, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters.\n“Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” she said in a statement.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nThe policy change comes amid an intensifying debate over how much responsibility technology companies bear for monitoring the accuracy of content as more and more people access news through sites such as Facebook fb rather than traditional media companies.\nFacebook, in particular, has been criticized over the spread of inaccurate articles promoting U.S. president-elect Donald Trump on the site. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election.\nGoogle’s goog AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nWell, I guess we can all do a Google search and find articles that warned Democrats that their urban-centered strategy is going to eventually sink them, and this is one of those moments. In March of 2016, National Public Radio touched upon how the Democratic Party was slowly being eaten from the inside, especially at the state and local level, where the GOP has flourished under the Obama presidency. The president has done next to nothing to encourage a Democratic offensive to retake the ground. After the 2016 election, the GOP retained Congress, won the presidency, clinched 69/99 state legislatures, and 33 governorships. The Democratic Party has been decimated under Obama . And Democrats have a mere four years to reverse historic gains made by the GOP at the state and local level. \nWhile heavily underreported, the state and local elections are some of the offices where economic impacts are felt immediately. State legislatures redraw congressional districts, with offices like county commissioner/executive and secretary of state being springboards for higher executive office. Scott Walker followed that track. He was a county executive, who became a governor, and then became a presidential contender. These offices have untapped power, which Democrats have ignored. Moreover, as with Walker and others, they form the talent pool from which new leaders of the party emerge. Some Democrats know this, but its fallen on deaf ears. \nMara Liasson, who wrote the NPR post, noted that if Democrats refuse to venture past metropolitan areas, they could be left out in the cold . Flash forward to November 9 th , that’s precisely what happened: It's not only bad timing and gerrymandering that have hollowed out the Democratic Party. Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic National Committee official, says Democrats have never put enough effort and resources into state legislative races. Republicans, on the other hand, make those races a top priority.\nToo many Democrats live in cities \nThis is another problem that makes it easier for Republicans to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantage Democrats. Democratic voters are clumped together in urban areas. You could say that for the purposes of winning elections, Democratic voters are just not efficiently distributed. \nIts why even in red states like Texas and Utah there are cities that are solidly Democratic — and why lesbian mayors were elected in Houston and Salt Lake City. When Democrats cluster in and around cities, they win local elections, but that doesn't help them win suburban or rural congressional seats. \nThis November, the stakes for Democrats couldn't be higher. Without the White House, assuming party control elsewhere remains the same, Democrats would be truly out in the cold. \nThere is another America that exists outside the Beltway and the bubbles that dominate the liberal bastions of power (i.e. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco), which angrily got a seat at the table this cycle. They’re tired of being ignored. They’re tired of suffering under economic hardship . Hillary Clinton, like Romney, didn’t resonate with these people, partially because her won campaign thought that white working class voters weren’t worth the time. That was a fatal error. And because Democrats only focused on their voters, while mocking and viewing with scorn those who aren’t like them, we now have the Republican Party being the dominant political force in the country. They got swallowed up by the working class.",

      "text": "\nGoogle’s recently released Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones include some improvements for camera performances in both hardware and software, compared to its older Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P devices. However, if you are willing to side-load apps on those older Nexus phones, you have a chance to get a mod to Google Camera that offers some performance improvements.\nSee also: Best Android smartphone cameras 2 weeks ago The mod itself was developed by Charles Chow and is called Camera NX V4 and it’s main goal is to offer close to the same amount of shutter lag for the older Nexus phones that are available for the new Google Pixel phones. And by “same amount of shutter lag”, we mean zero.\n\nAs you can see in the demo video above with the Camera NX V4 mod running, the amount of shutter lag on the Nexus is a lot faster compared to using the regular Google Camera app. Chow states:\nMy phone is running Android 7.1.1 beta, in the video, Camera is stock Google Camera, Camera NX is the mod version. You can notice the lag on stock camera, when using the modified version, no lag while I continuously tap the shoot button, but due to the hardware limitations, the camera slow down a bit at the end.\nAgain, this app is not available via the Google Play Store, so you are downloading and installing this app on your Nexus device at your own risk. If you own a Nexus 5X or 6P, will you be trying out this mod?\nDownload from Chromloop ",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition Google to Prohibit Fake News Sites From Using Its Ad Software 5:04 PM PST 11/14/2016 by Natalie Jarvey The search giant's move comes after a fake news article topped some search results on Sunday. \nGoogle is cracking down on fake-news sites. \nThe search giant plans to prohibit websites that publish false news from using its ad software, a product called Adsense that allows publishers to place Google ads on their websites. \nGoogle's move, which will cut off a key revenue stream for these sites, comes as fake news has proliferated online, especially on Facebook, throughout the election. Google, too, has dealt with the rise of fake news. Several outlets have reported that on Sunday an inaccurate news story claiming that Donald Trump would win both the popular vote and the electoral college was the top result for some election-related searches. \nOn Monday, Google responded swiftly. The Wall Street Journal , which first reported on the move, says the changes are imminent and are in line with Google's existing policies. \nA Google spokesperson sent the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter : \"We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies. Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.\" \nFacebook in particular saw the proliferation of fake news during the election, prompting some critics to question the role the social network played in helping Trump become elected. Last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called that notion \"a pretty crazy idea.\" He then took to Facebook on Saturday to clarify his position, writing that \"more than 99% of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\" \nBuzzFeed reported on Monday that some employees at the social network would like to see Facebook clamp down on fake-news posts. Quoting unnamed sources, the online outlet reported that a group of employees have formed a renegade task force whose goal is to offer recommendations to Facebook's senior management about how to handle fake news.",

      "text": "News \nYou probably know as well as I do that the internet is littered with low-resolution images, either a limitation of a device's camera or purposely-downgraded for faster loading on slow connections. Unfortunately, enlarging an image many times over while still preserving detail is something only possible in episodes of CSI . But thanks to the magic of machine learning, Google has been developing a solution - RAISR, short for Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution. \nExisting methods of upsampling (generating a larger image from a smaller one) use simple algorithms to fill in detail with values from surrounding pixels. Most of these methods result in a blurry image that loses the fine details of the original image. Left : Original image, Right : Bicubic upsampled version \nThat's where RAISR comes in. Essentially, Google trains RAISR on 10,000 pairs of images (one low quality, one high) to create filters that recreate details close in approximation to the original images. There is a far more technical explanation at the source link below, but that's the general idea. The steps of RAISR's algorithm, applied to an existing upscaled image. \nGoogle hopes this can be used to restore images taken with low-resolution cameras, or as an improvement to pinch-to-zoom on mobile devices. This could even allow for less mobile data usage by transmitting images at a lower resolution and upsampling them on the recipient's end. I can't wait until the practical applications of this start to take shape, but it could be a while. Source:",

      "text": "  @10:30PM from the straight-from-the-source dept. According to The Wall Street Journal , Google is working on a policy update that will prohibit fake news websites from using its ad-selling software . The move would ultimately make it more challenging for those fake news sites to earn revenue. Reuters reports: The policy change is imminent, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville told Reuters. \"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" she said in a statement. The policy change comes amid an intensifying debate over how much responsibility technology companies bear for monitoring the accuracy of content as more and more people access news through sites such as Facebook rather than traditional media companies. Facebook, in particular, has been criticized over the spread of inaccurate articles promoting U.S. president-elect Donald Trump on the site. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election. Google's AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said.",

      "text": "Google, Facebook Employees Plan to Crack Down on Fake News After Criticism by Josh Feldman | 9:20   \nIn the past few days, there has been renewed attention on the prevalence of fake news on Facebook and Google. Mark Zuckerberg said last week that he doesn’t think fake news swayed the election at all. \nAnd as Mediaite’s Dan Abrams wrote yesterday , a pretty glaring piece of fake news appeared when searching for the final Election 2016 vote count. \nWell, The Wall Street Journal reports today that Google plans to take action: \nGoogle said Monday that it is updating its policies to ban Google ads being placed “on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose” of the website. The policy would include sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said. \nMeanwhile, over at Facebook, BuzzFeed has a report out tonight saying that there are Facebook employees who are setting up an “unofficial task force” to combat fake news. \nThat task force is apparently very upset with Zuckerberg completely dismissing the impact of fake news on the election: \n“It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” said one Facebook employee, who works in the social network’s engineering division. \nZuckerberg said in a post this past weekend that he wants Facebook to do more to crack down on fake news. \nFor the record, back in early 2015 Facebook said it was going to crack down on fake news . And now there are employees concerned that they haven’t done nearly enough: \nThe group plans to formalize its meetings and eventually make a list of recommendations to Facebook’s senior management. Another Facebook employee said while the task force remained small, “hundreds” of Facebook employees had expressed dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on fake news in private online chats, and wanted to support efforts to challenge that position. \n[ image via Evan Lorne/Shutterstock, tanuha2001/Shutterstock ] \n——",

By: FE Online | Updated: November 14, 2016 12:54 PM The doodle designed by Anvita put across the message of “enjoy every moment of your life”. Anvita loves drawing. (Image Source: Website) \nOn the occasion of Children’s day today, the Google India surprises its readers with a fascinating, multicolored and well decorated doodle. The design was framed by 11-year old Anvita Prashant Telang from Pune, who won the ‘Doodle 4 Google’ contest this year. Google India organised a competition on the theme — “If I could teach anyone anything, it would be” – the competition is an annual event. \nThe doodle designed by young Anvita put across the message of “enjoy every moment of your life”. Anvita loves drawing. She is a sixth standard student from Vibgyor High School in Balewadi. With her beautiful artwork Anvita wanted to showcase “how to value little and simple things in our lives as they are great sources of happiness”. She believes people need to slow down to lead a happy and fulfilling life. \nAnvita coloured the doodle with illustrations and focussed especialy on making the surroundings green. She displayed the little cheerful kids having fun — hanging from trees, flying, swimming, playing with water, balloons and kites, and even daydreaming. \nIndia is also celebrating Bal Diwas on November 14. This is the birth anniversary of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India known as Chacha Nehru. Nehru is known for loving children and this day also represents a tribute a loving population pays to him. Schools and some colleges too celebrate the day with cultural programmes and by organising fun activities. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "Facebook will also cut off fake news sites from ad money It's all thanks to Google. Share Save \nFacebook has followed Google's example and finally banned fake news sites from using its ad network to generate revenue, according to The Wall Street Journal . Fake news websites now fall under the \"misleading, illegal and deceptive sites\" category, which are already prohibited from using the company's Audience Network. Facebook's Audience Network shows its customers' advertisements not just on the social network itself, but also on other mobile apps and websites. \nIf you'll recall Mark Zuckerberg and co. came under fire after the elections, with people accusing the tech titan of helping skew the results by allowing election-related fake news to propagate. Zuckerberg strongly denied the accusations, claiming that 99 percent of the content you see on the website is authentic. According to a Gizmodo report , though, the company knew it had a problem with fake news websites and had the tool to block them. Facebook decided not to use that tool, because it would prevent most conservative news sources from showing up on people's News Feeds. The company also denied that allegation. \nAs for this new development, a company spokesperson told The WSJ : \n\"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\" ",

      "title": "At Sundar Pichai's Google, AI Is Everything--And Everywhere | Fast Company | Business + Innovation",
      "text": "Sundar Pichai is huddling with five Google staffers in a room next to his office that’s known—appropriately enough—as \"Sundar’s Huddle.\" The employees are members of the Google Photos team, and they’re here this morning to update Pichai on something they’ve been working on for months.\nThe group has barely begun its presentation when Pichai starts peppering them with questions, opinions, and advice. For half an hour, the discussion careens from subject to subject: the power of artificial intelligence, the value of integrating Google Photos with other products such as Google Drive, the importance of creating an emotional bond with the users of an app. After the team shows Pichai a rough cut of a promotional video, his feedback is unguarded and heartfelt: \"That’s awesome!\"\nGoogle’s bearded, 44-year-old CEO is, unmistakably, in his element. \"Nothing makes me happier than a product review in which I can sit with the team and they’re showing me something they’re building,\" Pichai had told me a few days earlier. \"Being able to react to it and think through, ‘When users get this, what will their feedback be?’ I’m always on a quest to do that better and do more of it.\"\nPichai’s tone at the meeting—affable, engaged, ambitious—encapsulates his approach to running Google. In the year since he was named CEO, he’s been busy reshaping the company into a more harmonious, collaborative place in a quest to improve the productivity of an already inventive culture.\nPichai took charge at a pivotal moment. In August 2015, cofounder Larry Page split what had been Google into multiple units that now live under a new corporate umbrella , Alphabet, run by Page as CEO. Pichai’s Google is responsible for most consumer services and products, including search, Gmail, YouTube, Android, and hardware such as phones. With his distinctive blend of enthusiasm and curiosity, Pichai has shuffled many of the business’s moving parts, putting longtime Googlers in new roles and hiring fresh talent.\nGoogle&apos;s new hardware lineup: the Google Wi-Fi router, Chromecast Ultra media streamer, Home speaker, Pixel phones, and Daydream View VR headset Results are starting to arrive at a fast clip. This fall, it held two major product launches in San Francisco less than a week apart. At the first, it unveiled Google Cloud, a big expansion of offerings for business customers, such as the G Suite assortment of productivity tools (formerly known as Google Apps). The second was an Apple-esque hardware extravaganza at which the company announced the first Google-designed smartphones (the Pixel and Pixel XL ), as well as a competitor to Amazon’s Echo speaker ( Google Home ), a virtual-reality headset ( Daydream View ), a wireless router ( Google Wifi ), and an upgrade to its video-streaming gizmo ( Chromecast Ultra ).\nThe wide scope represented by that lineup may suggest that Pichai isn’t picking his competitive battles. But his key ambitions are bound by a core prediction: that the world is moving from the smartphone age into, in Pichai’s phrase, an \"AI-first\" era, in which Google products will help people accomplish tasks in increasingly sophisticated, even anticipatory ways. The Pixel phones and Google Home, for instance, are the first devices with embedded support for Google Assistant , a rival to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa that is designed not only to handle straightforward commands but also fuzzier requests such as \"Play that Shakira song from Zootopia. \" The Assistant is also designed to engage in relatively complex conversations related to tasks such as making vacation arrangements.\n\"We think of the Assistant as of an evolution of Google search,\" says John Giannandrea, who, as senior VP of search, research, and machine intelligence is responsible for the technologies that power both Google search in its classic form and the Assistant. \"It&apos;s a superset in some senses. If you said to Google search, &apos;Get me a pizza,&apos; nothing happens. Our aspiration is that the assistant will go and get you a pizza. We don&apos;t today, but that&apos;s our aspiration.\"\nRelated Video: Why Google CEO Sundar Pichai Is Doubling Down On Machine Learning Each of the tech titans Google competes with in various ways—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft—has sweeping AI initiatives of its own, and Siri and Alexa have major head starts with consumers. But Google—which built the Assistant using concepts it&apos;s already been exploring in Google Now and Google voice search—has more experience teaching computers to understand language, photos, and other forms of information than anyone else. Google Assistant will be able to call on those technical underpinnings as it battles it out in the marketplace. \"We’ve invested in machine learning for a long time, in anticipation of this moment,\" Pichai says.\nThough the most out-there moonshots that Page has championed have been spun out into other parts of Alphabet, Pichai thinks that Google&apos;s present efforts have plenty of epoch-shifting potential. \"Larry always challenges all of us to think on a much, much bigger scale,\" says Pichai of his boss. \"He has a healthy disregard for constraints and wants us to stay focused on solving big problems. He cares deeply about using technology to help others, and reminds me of the immense responsibility we have as Google to help make the world a better place.\"\n\"Building general artificial intelligence in a way that helps people meaningfully—I think the word moonshot is an understatement for that,\" Pichai says, sounding startled that anyone might think otherwise. \"I would say it’s as big as it gets.\"\nGoogle&apos;s AI-centric October product launch , introduced by Pichai The CEO As People Person Pichai’s aspiration to build hyper-ambitious products is classic Google. His managerial style, however, is strikingly different from that of Page, who is legendary for setting expectations so high that meetings can be scary as well as inspiring. When you discuss Pichai with people who work closely with him, they mention his empathy, his humor, his eagerness to encourage teamwork across the company—and how he uses them to achieve his lofty goals for the company.\n\"We&apos;re proud that this is a nice guy who&apos;s gotten to the top—someone who cares about other people,\" says Caesar Sengupta, a longtime Pichai protege and VP in charge of Google&apos;s efforts in emerging markets. \"But at the product strategy level, he&apos;s been an amazing visionary.\"\nPhilipp Schindler , chief business officer: \"We&apos;re not pushing hard for monetization too early on but we want to understand it. We want to lay the groundwork.\" According to Philipp Schindler, an 11-year Google veteran who, as the company’s chief business officer, manages a 15,000-person sales and operations group, Pichai \"is as smart and thoughtful as you can be. He also has this ability to change perspective and look through other people’s eyes. That’s something that you don’t find so much in our world.\"\nThough Pichai is not a spotlight-hogger—at the San Francisco hardware launch, he briefly introduced the proceedings and then got off the stage—he claims to relish being a public face of Google, a responsibility that Page mostly sidestepped. Which is why, when Schindler was entertaining the CEO and chairman of one of the world’s largest consumer-goods companies at home, he didn’t hesitate to invite his boss over to help tell Google’s story over dinner. (Fortunately, he notes, \"Sundar lives two minutes from my house.\")\n\"I really care about communicating what we are trying to do, our intent behind it,\" says Pichai, who can stroll in seconds from his desk, through a door, and into Google’s sprawling \"Partner Plex\" welcome center, allowing him rapid access to Google’s many visitors, from advertising clients to foreign dignitaries. But he underlines that these interactions are as much about listening as talking. \"I’ve done many customer meetings in which I’ve felt that I’ve walked away with a better understanding of their perspective on us.\"\n\"Sundar didn’t ask, ‘How can you compete with Internet Explorer?’ He said, ‘We think we can build a better web browser.’ \"\nPichai seems to have settled into the CEO role with aplomb. Though his ascent is often described as \"meteoric,\" he spent 11 years at Google before getting the top job. Born in 1972 in Tamil Nadu, India, he came to the U.S. as an engineering student in 1993, earned degrees from Stanford and Wharton, and worked at chip-manufacturing-equipment company Applied Materials before scoring a job as a McKinsey consultant. When his colleague Nick Fox left for Google in 2003, Fox’s new boss, Susan Wojcicki—then Google’s advertising chief, now the CEO of YouTube—asked if any other McKinsey-ites were worth recruiting. \"The best one,\" Fox recalls telling her, \"is this guy Sundar.\"\nAt the time, Google was in a very different place. \"We had long discussions about whether he should take the job,\" says Stefan Heck, another McKinsey colleague who is now CEO of autonomous-driving startup Nauto. \"It’s funny in hindsight. Google was pre-IPO. You’d have been crazy not to join, but that was far from obvious.\"\nOnce he took the plunge and signed on in April 2004—initially as product manager for the Google Toolbar—Pichai was immediately \"struck that at Google, when you walked around, if you had an idea and shared it, people around you were naturally optimistic,\" he remembers. \"They would tend to build on it. They would say, ‘You know, it would be even cooler if you did this...’\"\nFrom early in Pichai&apos;s days at Google, he was known as a low-key manager who tackled projects of ever-increasing scale with quiet persistence. \"He was always given the toughest problems,\" says Fox, who points to Pichai&apos;s spearheading of the Chrome web browser as a career-defining success. When Google started work on Chrome in 2006, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer had more than 80% of the market. The simpler, speedier Chrome went on to become the world’s most-used browser; even Microsoft eventually gave up on IE, ditching it for the decidedly Chrome-like Edge.\nThat unlikely victory helps explain the fearlessness with which Google is now taking on entrenched products: Google Home vs. Echo, Google Assistant vs. Siri, Allo vs. Facebook Messenger. \"Sundar didn’t ask, ‘How can you compete with Internet Explorer?’ \" says Fox. \"He said, ‘We think we can build a better web browser. Let’s go do that.’ \"\n\"There’s never a month which goes by without me having moments of being a kid in a candy store , even today at Google,\" says Pichai [Photo: Mark Mahaney ] Organizing The Organization Despite all the changes at Google, the company’s Mountain View, California, campus remains the same quirky corporate Xanadu it’s always been. When I wander around during a visit one October afternoon, I encounter both a \"Chrometoberfest\" party (Googlers enjoying steins of beer and an oompah band) and a tiny patch of simulated beach where a few staffers are playing volleyball.\nGoogle’s playful creativity and bottom-up innovation—exemplified by \"20% time,\" which encourages workers to follow their passions—remain central to the company’s view of itself. As an example, Pichai proudly mentions the new Daydream VR platform, which grew out of Cardboard , the VR headset that two engineers had whipped up without seeking permission. Still, there’s no denying that Pichai’s Google, which now has more than 66,000 employees, aims to go after its overarching strategic goals in a more thoughtful, disciplined manner than in the past. \"At our scale, it’s important to focus and do it well,\" he says. \"[You need to have] a clear sense of where you’re going as a company, and then work toward that in a prioritized way.\"\nJen Fitzpatrick , VP, Geo: \"The Google Assistant wouldn&apos;t exist without Sundar—it&apos;s a core part of his vision for how we&apos;re bringing all of Google together.\" Officially, Google has always advocated for collaboration. But in the past, as it encouraged individual units to shape their own destinies, the company sometimes operated more like a myriad of fiefdoms. Now, Pichai is steering Google’s teams toward a common mission: infusing the products and services they create with AI.\n\"Ultimately this stuff comes out in product features for users,\" says Giannandrea of the machine-learning technologies that his group spearheads. \"Being about to talk to your smartphone, being able to search your photos, being able to ask Google to tell you a joke.\"\nAs disparate groups intermingle their efforts, \"Sundar has brought a new emphasis to [collaboration], particularly at the senior leadership level,\" says Jen Fitzpatrick, who joined Google as one of its first interns in 1999 and now oversees Google Maps. \"He’s made it a core value of how he wants to run the company.\"\nGoogle’s top executives are \"emailing and talking and meeting and coordinating constantly now,\" says Diane Greene, the celebrated computer scientist and VMware cofounder who joined the company shortly after Pichai became CEO and led the reimagining of Google Cloud. \"We all have a really clear understanding of what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and what we’re trying to achieve.\"\nPichai opening the event at which Google introduced a bevy of new hardware on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco [Photo: Ramin Talaie/Getty Images] In some instances, Pichai’s plan for Google involves not just collaboration, but centralization. In the past disparate groups at the company tackled hardware projects on their own, and the results—such as various Nexus phones, tablets, and media streamers—didn’t have much of an impact on either Google or the market. (One big exception: Chromecast, which has sold more than 30 million units.)\n\"In the past, we would say, ‘Okay, to do that, let’s go build this,’\" says Pichai. \"Now, we’re deeply committed to doing hardware over multiple product cycles. It’s very hard, when you just do one-off product efforts here and there, to tackle longer-term problems.\"\n\"Giving access to technology, computing, knowledge to everyone is something which I’m passionate about.\"\nTo make sure that future gadgets are built for the AI-first era, Pichai has collected everything relating to hardware into a single group and hired Rick Osterloh to run it. Osterloh was already a Google vet, having served as CEO of Motorola Mobility during the brief period when Google owned the phone maker. But back then, the company isolated that smartphone business from the rest of its operations to avoid ticking off Android partners such as Samsung. \"We were completely at arm’s length,\" Osterloh says. \"That’s just how it was. It’s a different time now.\"\nSince starting in April, Osterloh has scrapped works-in-progress that weren’t central to the company’s future, such as Project Ara , a Lego-like smartphone with snap-together magnetic components that had already failed to meet its original 2015 ship date. \"AI and machine learning are very critical, so if we were going to emphasize something, I wanted us to emphasize that as opposed to modularity, which was interesting but super-complicated,\" he says.\nThe Google Home smart speaker will compete with Amazon&apos;s Echo, a category-creating device that it closely resembles. But Osterloh says that the idea is less about going head-to-head with Amazon than advancing the bigger goal of making Google Assistant pervasive: \"Kudos to Amazon for coming up with the Echo product first. It was very clear to us that we needed to do something within the home that accomplished the goal of getting the Google experience to our users.\"\nRick Osterloh , senior VP, hardware: \"When we ship hardware now, we want to make sure that the full user experience is really good.\" Even with this new, more concentrated vision, Google&apos;s hardware team has its work cut out for it. The Pixel phone has gotten excellent reviews , but it&apos;s extremely late to a smartphone market in which Apple gobbles up nearly all the profits and many makers of Android phones are struggling.\nOsteloh says that the Pixel phones are \"about emphasizing the best that Google has to offer,\" which is another way of admitting that other manufacturers&apos; Android phones don&apos;t necessarily show off Google&apos;s apps and services to their best advantage. By taking on more responsibility for hardware, the company can ensure that a phone&apos;s microphones, for instance, are tuned to perform well with Google Assistant.\n\"That’s the old Apple line—you can’t build the best experience unless you control both software and hardware,\" says Greg Sterling , a contributing editor to Search Engine Land . \"And it’s really true as an objective matter. There are a lot of nice Android phones, but something&apos;s lacking because of the lack of total integration between both sides.\"\nThe Pixel phones are being marketed like iPhones, with slick TV ads, and will be sold at Verizon stores. But Osterloh acknowledges that it will take multiple generations of phones to make a dent in the market, and that even then Google is unlikely to become one of the biggest players. \"It&apos;s very early for us,\" he says. \"I think our main goal for this generation of work is to deliver experiences that people are super-happy with.\"\nGoogle Home The Assistant is also part of Google’s new messaging app, Allo , which was created by a communications group that Pichai formed in 2015 and asked his old friend from McKinsey, Nick Fox, to run. Given that Facebook already has two messaging apps with more than a billion users apiece (Messenger and WhatsApp), Allo might seem to be engaged in a near-impossible game of catch-up. Still, Google is betting that the app­—which includes both a built-in version of Assistant and the ability to suggest AI-generated, situation-based automatic replies such as \"sounds good\" and \"not really\"—will be a leader in the race to redefine messaging around automation. \"We think that’s a paradigm shift in technology,\" says Fox. \"It&apos;s one that we think we&apos;re well suited to address and well suited to solve because of our deep investment in machine learning and AI over the years.\"\nNick Fox , VP, communications: \"With Allo, we have a lot of the assets to make something that&apos;s better and different and really, really useful.\" Early reviews for Allo have been mixed . Like many new Google initiatives, it’s a rough draft of an idea that will take time to develop, and it’s not a given that the company will be committed for the long term. (Exhibit A: The would-be Facebook killer Google+, which, under Page, went from company-wide priority to afterthought within a few years.) But the people who work most closely with Pichai frequently bring up his patient approach to product development.\n\"Sundar often talks in terms of 10-year cycles in technology and history,\" says Giannandrea. \"I find him very easy to work with, because he thinks about the larger picture, rather than just ‘what decision are we making today?’\"\nBillions To Go Still another way in which the current incarnation of Google reflects Pichai’s long-term priorities is the attention it pays to consumers in emerging economies, an initiative it calls Next Billion. \"Giving access to technology, computing, knowledge to everyone is something which I’m passionate about,\" says Pichai, who, in a memorable bit of biographical detail, was twelve when his family got its first telephone—a rotary-dial model. \"I’ve tried to instill that at Google, across everything we do.\"\nIndia is a particular emphasis, mostly because of the huge number of consumers there. However, Pichai acknowledges there’s a personal aspect, too. \"I’ve benefited a lot from India,\" says the CEO, who earned a degree in metallurgical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology before emigrating. \"If there’s any thoughtful way that we as a company can do the right thing and pay it back, we’re committed to it.\"\n\"When you can align people to common goals, you truly get a multiplicative effect.\"\nIn India, Facebook’s Free Basics apps were widely regarded as Silicon Valley imperialism and eventually shot down by regulators . By contrast, Pichai’s efforts to democratize internet access in the country—including hotspots at train stations and data-scrimping versions of apps such as YouTube—have been welcomed.\n\"People are really proud that someone of Indian origin is leading a huge company,\" says Sengupta, who runs the Next Billion effort from Singapore. \"But more important, Sundar’s approach to India is in many ways very humble.\"\nRather than feeling dumbed down, what Google is creating for consumers in new markets often turns out to be useful in more developed countries. \"Maps was one of the earlier teams at Google to embrace the next billion mantra,\" says Fitzpatrick. Her team built a version of Google Maps that could store maps on the phone, a plus in areas where data access is spotty or unaffordable. It turned out that the feature was also valuable for people trying to pull up driving directions in their cars, where phones often try to connect to a home Wi-Fi network that&apos;s too distant to provide a strong signal. Now it&apos;s part of the core Maps experience.\nBuild Now, Monetize Later\nFor all of Google&apos;s idealism, there&apos;s another unglamorous but essential reality to the business that Pichai runs: It makes billions in profits from advertising, which subsidize not only Alphabet&apos;s not-yet-profitable moonshots but also Google&apos;s own new initiatives.

      "title": "At Sundar Pichai's Google, AI Is Everything--And Everywhere | Fast Company | Business + Innovation",
      "text": "Sundar Pichai is huddling with five Google staffers in a room next to his office that’s known—appropriately enough—as \"Sundar’s Huddle.\" The employees are members of the Google Photos team, and they’re here this morning to update Pichai on something they’ve been working on for months.\nThe group has barely begun its presentation when Pichai starts peppering them with questions, opinions, and advice. For half an hour, the discussion careens from subject to subject: the power of artificial intelligence, the value of integrating Google Photos with other products such as Google Drive, the importance of creating an emotional bond with the users of an app. After the team shows Pichai a rough cut of a promotional video, his feedback is unguarded and heartfelt: \"That’s awesome!\"\nGoogle’s bearded, 44-year-old CEO is, unmistakably, in his element. \"Nothing makes me happier than a product review in which I can sit with the team and they’re showing me something they’re building,\" Pichai had told me a few days earlier. \"Being able to react to it and think through, ‘When users get this, what will their feedback be?’ I’m always on a quest to do that better and do more of it.\"\nPichai’s tone at the meeting—affable, engaged, ambitious—encapsulates his approach to running Google. In the year since he was named CEO, he’s been busy reshaping the company into a more harmonious, collaborative place in a quest to improve the productivity of an already inventive culture.\nPichai took charge at a pivotal moment. In August 2015, cofounder Larry Page split what had been Google into multiple units that now live under a new corporate umbrella , Alphabet, run by Page as CEO. Pichai’s Google is responsible for most consumer services and products, including search, Gmail, YouTube, Android, and hardware such as phones. With his distinctive blend of enthusiasm and curiosity, he has shuffled many of the business’s moving parts, putting longtime Googlers in new roles and hiring fresh talent to pursue a forward interpretation of the company&apos;s foundational mission: organizing the world’s information and making it universally accessible and useful.\nGoogle&apos;s new hardware lineup: the Google Wi-Fi router, Chromecast Ultra media streamer, Home speaker, Pixel phones, and Daydream View VR headset Results are starting to arrive at a fast clip. This fall, it held two major product launches in San Francisco less than a week apart. At the first, it unveiled Google Cloud, a big expansion of offerings for business customers, such as the G Suite assortment of productivity tools (formerly known as Google Apps). The second was an Apple-esque hardware extravaganza at which the company announced the first Google-designed smartphones (the Pixel and Pixel XL ), as well as a competitor to Amazon’s Echo speaker ( Google Home ), a virtual-reality headset ( Daydream View ), a wireless router ( Google Wifi ), and an upgrade to its video-streaming gizmo ( Chromecast Ultra ).\nThe wide scope represented by that lineup may suggest that Pichai isn’t picking his competitive battles. But his key ambitions are bound by a core prediction: that the world is moving from the smartphone age into, in Pichai’s phrase, an \"AI-first\" era, in which Google products will help people accomplish tasks in increasingly sophisticated, even anticipatory ways. The Pixel phones and Google Home, for instance, are the first devices with embedded support for Google Assistant , a rival to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa that is designed not only to handle straightforward commands but also fuzzier requests such as \"Play that Shakira song from Zootopia. \" The Assistant is also designed to engage in relatively complex conversations related to tasks such as making vacation arrangements.\n\"We think of the Assistant as of an evolution of Google search,\" says John Giannandrea, who, as senior VP of search, research, and machine intelligence is responsible for the technologies that power both Google search in its classic form and the Assistant. \"It&apos;s a superset in some senses. If you said to Google search, ‘Get me a pizza,’ nothing happens. Our aspiration is that the assistant will go and get you a pizza. We don&apos;t today, but that&apos;s our aspiration.\"\nRelated Video: Why Google CEO Sundar Pichai Is Doubling Down On Machine Learning Each of the tech titans Google competes with in various ways—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft—has sweeping AI initiatives of its own, and Siri and Alexa have major head starts with consumers. But Google—which built the Assistant using concepts it&apos;s already been exploring in Google Now and Google voice search—has more experience teaching computers to understand language, photos, and other forms of information than anyone else. Google Assistant will be able to call on those technical underpinnings as it battles it out in the marketplace. \"We’ve invested in machine learning for a long time, in anticipation of this moment,\" Pichai says.\nThough the most out-there moonshots that Page has championed have been spun out into other parts of Alphabet, Pichai thinks that Google&apos;s present efforts have plenty of epoch-shifting potential. \"Larry always challenges all of us to think on a much, much bigger scale,\" says Pichai of his boss. \"He has a healthy disregard for constraints and wants us to stay focused on solving big problems. He cares deeply about using technology to help others, and reminds me of the immense responsibility we have as Google to help make the world a better place.\"\n\"Building general artificial intelligence in a way that helps people meaningfully—I think the word moonshot is an understatement for that,\" Pichai says, sounding startled that anyone might think otherwise. \"I would say it’s as big as it gets.\"\nGoogle&apos;s AI-centric October product launch , introduced by Pichai The CEO As People Person Pichai’s aspiration to build hyper-ambitious products is classic Google. His managerial style, however, is strikingly different from that of Page, who is legendary for setting expectations so high that meetings can be scary as well as inspiring. When you discuss Pichai with people who work closely with him, they mention his empathy, his humor, his eagerness to encourage teamwork across the company—and how he uses them to achieve his lofty goals for the company.\n\"We&apos;re proud that this is a nice guy who&apos;s gotten to the top—someone who cares about other people,\" says Caesar Sengupta, a longtime Pichai protege and VP in charge of Google&apos;s efforts in emerging markets. \"But at the product strategy level, he&apos;s been an amazing visionary.\"\nPhilipp Schindler , chief business officer: \"We&apos;re not pushing hard for monetization too early on but we want to understand it. We want to lay the groundwork.\" According to Philipp Schindler, an 11-year Google veteran who, as the company’s chief business officer, manages a 15,000-person sales and operations group, Pichai \"is as smart and thoughtful as you can be. He also has this ability to change perspective and look through other people’s eyes. That’s something that you don’t find so much in our world.\"\nThough Pichai is not a spotlight-hogger—at the San Francisco hardware launch, he briefly introduced the proceedings and then got off the stage—he claims to relish being a public face of Google, a responsibility that Page mostly sidestepped. Which is why, when Schindler was entertaining the CEO and chairman of one of the world’s largest consumer-goods companies at home, he didn’t hesitate to invite his boss over to help tell Google’s story over dinner. (Fortunately, he notes, \"Sundar lives two minutes from my house.\")\n\"I really care about communicating what we are trying to do, our intent behind it,\" says Pichai, who can stroll in seconds from his desk, through a door, and into Google’s sprawling \"Partner Plex\" welcome center, allowing him rapid access to Google’s many visitors, from advertising clients to foreign dignitaries. But he underlines that these interactions are as much about listening as talking. \"I’ve done many customer meetings in which I’ve felt that I’ve walked away with a better understanding of their perspective on us.\"\n\"Sundar didn’t ask, ‘How can you compete with Internet Explorer?’ He said, ‘We think we can build a better web browser.’ \"\nPichai seems to have settled into the CEO role with aplomb. Though his ascent is often described as \"meteoric,\" he spent 11 years at Google before getting the top job. Born in 1972 in Tamil Nadu, India, he came to the U.S. as an engineering student in 1993, earned degrees from Stanford and Wharton, and worked at chip-manufacturing-equipment company Applied Materials before scoring a job as a McKinsey consultant. When his colleague Nick Fox left for Google in 2003, Fox’s new boss, Susan Wojcicki—then Google’s advertising chief, now the CEO of YouTube—asked if any other McKinsey-ites were worth recruiting. \"The best one,\" Fox recalls telling her, \"is this guy Sundar.\"\nAt the time, Google was in a very different place. \"We had long discussions about whether he should take the job,\" says Stefan Heck, another McKinsey colleague who is now CEO of autonomous-driving startup Nauto. \"It’s funny in hindsight. Google was pre-IPO. You’d have been crazy not to join, but that was far from obvious.\"\nOnce he took the plunge and signed on in April 2004—initially as product manager for the Google Toolbar—Pichai was immediately \"struck that at Google, when you walked around, if you had an idea and shared it, people around you were naturally optimistic,\" he remembers. \"They would tend to build on it. They would say, ‘You know, it would be even cooler if you did this...’\"\nFrom early in Pichai&apos;s days at Google, he was known as a low-key manager who tackled projects of ever-increasing scale with quiet persistence. \"He was always given the toughest problems,\" says Fox, who points to Pichai&apos;s spearheading of the Chrome web browser as a career-defining success. When Google started work on Chrome in 2006, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer had more than 80% of the market. The simpler, speedier Chrome went on to become the world’s most-used browser; even Microsoft eventually gave up on IE, ditching it for the decidedly Chrome-like Edge.\nThat unlikely victory helps explain the fearlessness with which Google is now taking on entrenched products: Google Home vs. Echo, Google Assistant vs. Siri, Allo vs. Facebook Messenger. \"Sundar didn’t ask, ‘How can you compete with Internet Explorer?’ \" says Fox. \"He said, ‘We think we can build a better web browser. Let’s go do that.’ \"\n\"There’s never a month which goes by without me having moments of being a kid in a candy store , even today at Google,\" says Pichai [Photo: Mark Mahaney ] Organizing The Organization Despite all the changes at Google, the company’s Mountain View, California, campus remains the same quirky corporate Xanadu it’s always been. When I wander around during a visit one October afternoon, I encounter both a \"Chrometoberfest\" party (Googlers enjoying steins of beer and an oompah band) and a tiny patch of simulated beach where a few staffers are playing volleyball.\nGoogle’s playful creativity and bottom-up innovation—exemplified by \"20% time,\" which encourages workers to follow their passions—remain central to the company’s view of itself. As an example, Pichai proudly mentions the new Daydream VR platform, which grew out of Cardboard , the VR headset that two engineers had whipped up without seeking permission. Still, there’s no denying that Pichai’s Google, which now has more than 66,000 employees, aims to go after its overarching strategic goals in a more thoughtful, disciplined manner than in the past. \"At our scale, it’s important to focus and do it well,\" he says. \"[You need to have] a clear sense of where you’re going as a company, and then work toward that in a prioritized way.\"\nJen Fitzpatrick , VP, Geo: \"The Google Assistant wouldn&apos;t exist without Sundar—it&apos;s a core part of his vision for how we&apos;re bringing all of Google together.\" Officially, Google has always advocated for collaboration. But in the past, as it encouraged individual units to shape their own destinies, the company sometimes operated more like a myriad of fiefdoms. Now, Pichai is steering Google’s teams toward a common mission: infusing the products and services they create with AI.\n\"Ultimately this stuff comes out in product features for users,\" says Giannandrea of the machine-learning technologies that his group spearheads. \"Being about to talk to your smartphone, being able to search your photos, being able to ask Google to tell you a joke.\"\nAs disparate groups intermingle their efforts, \"Sundar has brought a new emphasis to [collaboration], particularly at the senior leadership level,\" says Jen Fitzpatrick, who joined Google as one of its first interns in 1999 and now oversees Google Maps. \"He’s made it a core value of how he wants to run the company.\"\nGoogle’s top executives are \"emailing and talking and meeting and coordinating constantly now,\" says Diane Greene, the celebrated computer scientist and VMware cofounder who joined the company shortly after Pichai became CEO and led the reimagining of Google Cloud. \"We all have a really clear understanding of what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and what we’re trying to achieve.\"\nPichai opening the event at which Google introduced a bevy of new hardware on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco [Photo: Ramin Talaie/Getty Images] In some instances, Pichai’s plan for Google involves not just collaboration, but centralization. In the past disparate groups at the company tackled hardware projects on their own, and the results—such as various Nexus phones, tablets, and media streamers—didn’t have much of an impact on either Google or the market. (One big exception: Chromecast, which has sold more than 30 million units.)\n\"In the past, we would say, ‘Okay, to do that, let’s go build this,’\" says Pichai. \"Now, we’re deeply committed to doing hardware over multiple product cycles. It’s very hard, when you just do one-off product efforts here and there, to tackle longer-term problems.\"\n\"Giving access to technology, computing, knowledge to everyone is something which I’m passionate about.\"\nTo make sure that future gadgets are built for the AI-first era, Pichai has collected everything relating to hardware into a single group and hired Rick Osterloh to run it. Osterloh was already a Google vet, having served as CEO of Motorola Mobility during the brief period when Google owned the phone maker. But back then, the company isolated that smartphone business from the rest of its operations to avoid ticking off Android partners such as Samsung. \"We were completely at arm’s length,\" Osterloh says. \"That’s just how it was. It’s a different time now.\"\nSince starting in April, Osterloh has scrapped works-in-progress that weren’t central to the company’s future, such as Project Ara , a Lego-like smartphone with snap-together magnetic components that had already failed to meet its original 2015 ship date. \"AI and machine learning are very critical, so if we were going to emphasize something, I wanted us to emphasize that as opposed to modularity, which was interesting but super-complicated,\" he says.\nThe Google Home smart speaker will compete with Amazon&apos;s Echo, a category-creating device that it closely resembles. But Osterloh says that the idea is less about going head-to-head with Amazon than advancing the bigger goal of making Google Assistant pervasive: \"Kudos to Amazon for coming up with the Echo product first. It was very clear to us that we needed to do something within the home that accomplished the goal of getting the Google experience to our users.\"\nRick Osterloh , senior VP, hardware: \"When we ship hardware now, we want to make sure that the full user experience is really good.\" Even with this new, more concentrated vision, Google&apos;s hardware team has its work cut out for it. The Pixel phone has gotten excellent reviews , but it&apos;s extremely late to a smartphone market in which Apple gobbles up nearly all the profits and many makers of Android phones are struggling.\nOsteloh says that the Pixel phones are \"about emphasizing the best that Google has to offer,\" which is another way of admitting that other manufacturers&apos; Android phones don&apos;t necessarily show off Google&apos;s apps and services to their best advantage. By taking on more responsibility for hardware, the company can ensure that a phone&apos;s microphones, for instance, are tuned to perform well with Google Assistant.\n\"That’s the old Apple line—you can’t build the best experience unless you control both software and hardware,\" says Greg Sterling , a contributing editor to Search Engine Land . \"And it’s really true as an objective matter. There are a lot of nice Android phones, but something&apos;s lacking because of the lack of total integration between both sides.\"\nThe Pixel phones are being marketed like iPhones, with slick TV ads, and will be sold at Verizon stores. But Osterloh acknowledges that it will take multiple generations of phones to make a dent in the market, and that even then Google is unlikely to become one of the biggest players. \"It&apos;s very early for us,\" he says. \"I think our main goal for this generation of work is to deliver experiences that people are super-happy with.\"\nGoogle Home The Assistant is also part of Google’s new messaging app, Allo , which was created by a communications group that Pichai formed in 2015 and asked his old friend from McKinsey, Nick Fox, to run. Given that Facebook already has two messaging apps with more than a billion users apiece (Messenger and WhatsApp), Allo might seem to be engaged in a near-impossible game of catch-up. Still, Google is betting that the app­—which includes both a built-in version of Assistant and the ability to suggest AI-generated, situation-based automatic replies such as \"sounds good\" and \"not really\"—will be a leader in the race to redefine messaging around automation. \"We think that’s a paradigm shift in technology,\" says Fox. \"It&apos;s one that we think we&apos;re well suited to address and well suited to solve because of our deep investment in machine learning and AI over the years.\"\nNick Fox , VP, communications: \"With Allo, we have a lot of the assets to make something that&apos;s better and different and really, really useful.\" Early reviews for Allo have been mixed . Like many new Google initiatives, it’s a rough draft of an idea that will take time to develop, and it’s not a given that the company will be committed for the long term. (Exhibit A: The would-be Facebook killer Google+, which, under Page, went from company-wide priority to afterthought within a few years.) But the people who work most closely with Pichai frequently bring up his patient approach to product development.\n\"Sundar often talks in terms of 10-year cycles in technology and history,\" says Giannandrea. \"I find him very easy to work with, because he thinks about the larger picture, rather than just ‘what decision are we making today?’\"\nBillions To Go Still another way in which the current incarnation of Google reflects Pichai’s long-term priorities is the attention it pays to consumers in emerging economies, an initiative it calls Next Billion. \"Giving access to technology, computing, knowledge to everyone is something which I’m passionate about,\" says Pichai, who, in a memorable bit of biographical detail, was twelve when his family got its first telephone—a rotary-dial model. \"I’ve tried to instill that at Google, across everything we do.\"\nIndia is a particular emphasis, mostly because of the huge number of consumers there. However, Pichai acknowledges there’s a personal aspect, too. \"I’ve benefited a lot from India,\" says the CEO, who earned a degree in metallurgical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology before emigrating. \"If there’s any thoughtful way that we as a company can do the right thing and pay it back, we’re committed to it.\"\n\"When you can align people to common goals, you truly get a multiplicative effect.\"\nIn India, Facebook’s Free Basics apps were widely regarded as Silicon Valley imperialism and eventually shot down by regulators . By contrast, Pichai’s efforts to democratize internet access in the country—including hotspots at train stations and data-scrimping versions of apps such as YouTube—have been welcomed.\n\"People are really proud that someone of Indian origin is leading a huge company,\" says Sengupta, who runs the Next Billion effort from Singapore. \"But more important, Sundar’s approach to India is in many ways very humble.\"\nRather than feeling dumbed down, what Google is creating for consumers in new markets often turns out to be useful in more developed countries. \"Maps was one of the earlier teams at Google to embrace the next billion mantra,\" says Fitzpatrick. Her team built a version of Google Maps that could store maps on the phone, a plus in areas where data access is spotty or unaffordable. It turned out that the feature was also valuable for people trying to pull up driving directions in their cars, where phones often try to connect to a home Wi-Fi network that&apos;s too distant to provide a strong signal. Now it&apos;s part of the core Maps experience.\nBuild Now, Monetize Later\nFor all of Google&apos;s idealism, there&apos;s another unglamorous but essential reality to the business that Pichai runs: It makes billions in profits from advertising, which subsidize not only Alphabet&apos;s not-yet-profitable moonshots but also Google&apos;s own new initiatives.

      "text": "Check it out \nThe new comes after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg refuted claims of fake news on the social network influencing the results of the election, stating that “more than 99% of what people see is authentic.” \nEven if we take Zuckerberg at his word, it’s possible that stories from those sites may have been targeted towards voters for greater impact. Plus, 1 percent of all content circulated on Facebook still amounts to a ton of misinformation. \nIt isn’t yet clear if the move will help stem the flow of fake news across the Web. Neither company has committed to improving their methods for detecting and blocking such content. \nHowever, Gizmodo reported that its sources informed it of a Facebook update that aimed to identify and remove hoax news stories. The feature is believed to have been shelved as it disproportionately impacted right-wing news sites. \nEarlier this month, BuzzFeed News found that several teens and young adults in Macedonia were running sites with that published fake news stories deriding Hillary Clinton, purely as a means to make money from ad revenue. It’s possible that Google and Facebook’s move to block such sites from their ad networks will curb their growth, but they’re not the only ones running such businesses. \nHopefully, tech firms and media platforms will be able to figure out more sophisticated ways of sniffing out bogus content. Whether they want to admit it or not in these difficult times, search engines and social networks are major destinations for people looking for news, and that means working to create an environment where hoaxes are easier to stamp out than it is to circulate actual facts. It’s not going to be easy, but that’s all part of the job.",

Photo: Shutterstock \nGoogle and Facebook have announced measures aimed at halting the spread of \"fake news\" on the internet by targeting how some purveyors of phony content make money: advertising. \nGoogle said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, while Facebook updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news. \nThe shifts comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter Inc face a backlash over the role they played in the US presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. \nThe issue has provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. \nFacebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. \n\"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance. \nGoogle's move similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. \nNor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. \nRather, the change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Google said in a statement. \nThe company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy. \nMacedonia News \nAdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. \nA report in BuzzFeed News last month showed how tiny publishers in Macedonia were creating websites with fake news - much of it denigrating Clinton - which were widely shared on Facebook. \nThat sharing in turn led people to click on links which brought them to the Macedonian websites, which could then make money on the traffic via Google's AdSense. \nFacebook has been widely blamed for allowing the spread of online misinformation, most of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. \n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 per cent of what people see is authentic,\" he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. \"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\" \nGoogle has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. \nThe company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. \nThe issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. \nGoogle has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. \nFil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. \n\"One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,\" he said. \"This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.\" \nHowever, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. \"What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialised knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale,\" he said. « Russian jet fighter crashes in Mediterranean - agencies Advert \n ",

(Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Amid criticism that fake news sites have contributed to misinformation and increasing polarization among the American public, Google announced Monday night that it will stop allowing fake news sites to use its ad software. \nFacebook followed with a similar policy, according to the New York Times. \nThat shift could be a death-knell for popular click-bait sites, cutting off their access to the ads that make them lucrative. \nIn a statement, Google said it will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property. \nThe announcement came after criticism earlier in the day that searching on the phrase \"who won the popular vote\" on Google returned a false news story on an obscure right-wing blog that Republic presidential nominee Donald Trump had won the popular vote in last week's election. \nTrump lost the popular vote by nearly 700,000 votes but won the Electoral College, according to the Associated Press.

      "text": "Google Will Ban Websites That Host Fake News From Using Its Ad Service The New York Times 7 hrs ago By NICK WINGFIELD © Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A display of Google devices. Google said it would ban purveyors of fake news on the web from using its online advertising service, AdSense. Google announced it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service, a decision that comes as concerns mount over the impact online hoaxes may have had on the presidential election.\nThe decision relates to the Google AdSense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers. More than two million publishers use Google’s advertising network.\nFor some time, Google has had policies in place prohibiting misleading advertisements from its system, including promotions for counterfeit goods and weight-loss scams. Google’s new policy, which it said would go into effect “imminently,” will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on.\n“Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content or the primary purpose of the web property,” Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement.\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\nMs. Faville said that the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to a growing debate over the last week about whether fake news stories had influenced the outcome of the election.\nFacebook has been at the epicenter of that debate, accused by some commentators of swinging some voters in favor of President-elect Donald J. Trump through misleading and outright false stories that spread quickly via the social network. One such false story claimed that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr. Trump.\nMark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has played down the role of fake news in the election. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 percent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount of it is fake news and hoaxes.\n“Over all, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote.\nGoogle, too, faced criticism after last week’s election for giving prominence to false news stories. On Sunday, the site Mediaite reported that the top result on a Google search for the words “final election vote count 2016” was a link to a story on a website called 70News that falsely stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote.\nBy Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to the No. 2 position in a search for those terms. Google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories on the site.\n“The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,” said Ms. Faville of Google. “In this case, we clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.”\nIt remains to be seen how effective Google’s new policy on fake news will be in practice. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake. Although satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is not clear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humorous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google’s change.\nGo to MSN Home",

Back Story Two Chinese astronauts expect to leave their space lab this week, after a monthlong stay that is a first for their nation. China has poured billions of dollars into its space program, aiming to rival the United States and Russia in reaching Mars. Photo The astronauts Jing Haipeng, left, and Chen Dong are due to return to Earth this week. Their mission is the longest to date for China’s manned space program. Credit China Network, via Reuters Such programs are enormous drivers of technological innovation. So it might come as a surprise to know that space communications rely on an old standby: radio waves . Speech from an astronaut, video from cameras and data from sensors flow into a transmitter, which emits radio waves picked up by a terrestrial receiver. Terrestrial transmitters reverse the favor. The same basic technology sends music to your radio, YouTube videos to your cellphone and photos from Pluto. There really isn’t an alternative until we figure out how to use lasers to convey data. There has been a lot of fine-tuning of radio capabilities over the 125 years or so that scientists have been playing with electromagnetic radiation. We now have great antennas and efficient, secure encoding. But the technology is also good for a simple call from home. Last week, China’s president, Xi Jinping, called the space lab . \nAdvertisement “Everyone across China cares very much about both of you,” Mr. Xi said. One astronaut proudly said, “I will go forth, and successfully complete the mission.” Andrea Kannapell contributed reporting.",

      "text": "November 15 at 6:57 AM\nA 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of a displayed stock graph in this illustration photo taken November 3, 2016. (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) Responding to growing concerns over the spread of misinformation online in the weeks and months before Election Day, Facebook and Google have announced plans to restrict sites that publish fake news from using online advertising.\nFacebook updated its advertising policy on Monday to make clear that it will not display ads in websites or mobile apps that contain fake news. Such outlets will now be included under the already banned category of misleading, illegal or deceptive sites. Earlier Monday, Google announced a similar policy prohibiting ads from being placed on websites that publish fake news, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n“We clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,” a Google spokeswoman said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal.\nOn Monday morning, The Washington Post reported, the top news link on Google in a search for “final election results” led to a fake news website incorrectly claiming that Donald Trump won both the popular vote and the majority of votes in the electoral college.\nThe announcements from both Internet giants came after Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, denied Thursday that fake news on the social network could have influenced the result of the presidential election. He called it a “crazy idea,” and insisted that fake news “surely had no impact” on voters’ decisions.\nIn a Facebook status posted Saturday, Zuckerberg wrote that more than 99 percent of the content people read on Facebook is authentic, and the fake content that does exist is not limited to one partisan view or to politics in general.\nBut, he wrote, “We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.”\nHe continued to say everyone would need to proceed carefully to make sure they don’t become “arbiters of truth.”\n“While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted,” he wrote. “An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual.”\nSome Facebook employees countered Zuckerberg’s statements that fake news likely had no influence on the election, BuzzFeed News reported Monday. A group of “renegade employees” have reportedly formed a task force to call out the fake news being spread through the network and voice dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on the issue.\nIn a statement Monday, a Facebook spokesperson said the company would take “swift action” against sites and apps found to violate its ad policy.\n“Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance,” the Wall Street Journal reported.",

      "text": "Sauce Labs sops up $70 million round Posted Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from their advertising networks \nSauce Labs , a cloud-based software testing service, announced a $70 million round today. The investment is more than double the $31 million the company had raised across four previous rounds and brings the total investment to $101 million. \nCenterview Capital Technology, IVP, and Adams Street Partners all participated. Under the terms of the deal, Buno Pati, partner at Centerview and Sandy Miller, general partner at IVP, will join the Sauce Labs Board of Directors. \nSauce Labs has been around since 2008, but CEO Charles Ramsey says in some ways the company was offering an automated approach to software testing before the broad market was ready for it. Back in the dark ages of 2008, many companies were still using the Waterfall approach to development. It was a deliberate methodology in which you finished one release before you started the next. In that world, testing was done manually by a QA department who checked each feature to make sure it worked across a number of devices and browsers. \n“What we provide essentially is infrastructure as a service and software that allows developers to write their own tests and to manage the [testing] process,” Ramsey explained. Once the script is written, it can automatically test across whatever devices, browsers and operating systems the developer chooses. \nAs we’ve moved forward, the world has changed and moved more toward Sauce Labs’ automated approach. Companies have embraced Agile development methodology, which is more of a continuous development approach than a defined one. When you combine this with a growing number of devices, operating systems and browsers (and a legacy history to support), the idea that you could manually test against all of these contingencies became much more challenging. As companies moved to Agile, they couldn’t have testing be the bottleneck. \nIn essence, the market has caught up with Sauce Labs, Ramsey explained, and they believe they are poised to take off, being a company in the right place with the right product at the right time. Apparently their investors saw it that way too because they wrote an enormous check to give them the cash to take the company to the next level. \nThe company currently has 3500 customers and 140 employees. With this influx of money, they plan to hire engineers, sales people and customer success personnel over the next year, which should allow them to take advantage of the growing demand in a more controlled fashion. \nAs for why the company took so long to get to this point, Ramsey says things always move more slowly in the wider industry than we think. There is a tendency among technologists to think everyone is moving en masse to the next big thing, whether that’s the cloud, mobile or Agile development. Large companies tend to be more cautious than that (or at least they have been until recently). \nCompanies are recognizing that to be competitive, they have to update their development methodologies, and when they do, Sauce Labs now has $70 million to help convince them to move to their testing products.

      "title": "Google Will Punish \"Fake News\" Websites By Halting Ads",
      "text": "Nov 15, 2016 7:01 AM 0 SHARES \nOne of the more perplexing theories to emerge explaining the failure of Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, is that popular news curators and aggregators such as Google and Facebook had distributed news created by \"fake\" and \"false\" websites, thus influencing public opinion. So, in an attempt to curb such websites, a move some consider tantamount to censorship, Google and Facebook announced measures aimed at halting the spread of \"fake news\" on the internet by targeting how the creators of this alleged \"phony content\" make money: advertising. \nGoogle said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent content from using its AdSense advertising network, while Facebook updated its advertising policies to spell out that its ban on deceptive and misleading content applies to fake news. Considering the amount of fingerpointing by much of the liberal press in the aftermath of Nov. 8 we wonder if websites such as CNN would be captured by this filter. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Google said in a statement. The company did not detail how it would implement or enforce the new policy, which some accuse is the monetary equivalent of censorship. \nThe shifts comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump. Of course, others have repeatedly accused both Google (which chairman Eric Schmidt's collaboration with the Clinton campaign was revealed courtesy of the Podesta emails), and Facebook of doing everything in their power to promote a Clinton win, so the narrative is not exactly clear on this one. \nReuters reports that the issue provoked a fierce debate within Facebook especially, with Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg insisting twice in recent days that the site had no role in influencing the election. Facebook's steps are limited to its ad policies, and do not target fake news sites shared by users on their news feeds. \n\"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" Facebook said in a statement, adding that it will continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance. \nGoogle also does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results. That happened in the last few days, when a search for 'final election count' for a time took users to a fake news story saying Trump won the popular vote. Votes are still being counted, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton showing a slight lead. Nor does Google suggest that the company has moved to a mechanism for rating the accuracy of particular articles. Instead, Google's change is aimed at assuring that publishers on the network are legitimate and eliminating financial incentives that appear to have driven the production of much fake news. \nEffectively, Adsense is hoping to starve providers of \"fringe\" news by cutting them off from what to many is their chief source of funding. \nAdSense, which allows advertisers to place text ads on the millions of websites that are part of Google's network, is a major source of money for many publishers. \nFacebook has been widely blamed - by the left-leaning mainstream media - for allowing the spread of online misinformation, amusingly much of it pro-Trump, but Zuckerberg has rejected the notion that Facebook influenced the outcome of the election or that fake news is a major problem on the service. \"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic,\" he wrote in a blog post on Saturday. \"Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.\" \nAs Reuters adds, Google has long had rules for its AdSense program, barring ads from appearing next to pornography or violent content. Work on the policy update announced on Monday began before the election, a Google spokeswoman said. The company uses a combination of humans and artificial intelligence to review sites that apply to be a part of AdSense, and sites continue to be monitored after they are accepted, a former Google employee who worked on ad systems said. Google's artificial intelligence systems learn from sites that have been removed from the program, speeding the removal of similar sites. \nThe issue of fake news is critical for Google from a business standpoint, as many advertisers do not want their brands to be touted alongside dubious content. Google must constantly hone its systems to try to stay one step ahead of unscrupulous publishers, the former employee said. \n\nGoogle has not said whether it believes its search algorithms, or its separate system for ranking results in the Google News service, also need to be modified to cope with the fake news issue. \n\nFil Menczer, a professor of informatics and computing at Indiana University who has studied the spread of misinformation on social media, said Google's move with AdSense was a positive step. \n\n\"One of the incentives for a good portion of fake news is money,\" he said. \"This could cut the income that creates the incentive to create the fake news sites.\" \n\nHowever, he cautioned that detecting fake news sites was not easy. \"What if it is a site with some real information and some fake news? It requires specialized knowledge and having humans (do it) doesn't scale,\" he said. \nWhile Google and Facebook have every right to tweak their ad policies however they see fit - especially if in the process their own ad revenue decline, as both companies retain a portion of the ad proceeds they pay out to content providers - the move is yet another step on a slippery slope, one which begins with determining just what is considered \"fake news\" and end with blanket internet censorship along ideological lines. Which we find especially ironic considering much of the \"pro Clinton\" press was terrified that it would be Trump who would be the one to hint at or enforce censorship. It seems the media does not need Trump for that: it can do it quite well on its own.",

      "text": "15 November 2016 at 12:57pm Google and Facebook unveil measures to clamp down on fake news online Facebook and Google have been accused of profiting fro fake news Credit: PA \nGoogle and Facebook have unveiled plans to curb fake news reports on their websites after they were widely criticised for profiting from lies and even faced claims they had helped swayed the US election results. \nThe internet giants have tightened their rules with the aim of preventing content producers from getting advertising revenue from false or misleading reports. \nIt comes after they faced growing protests for failing to take decisive action over the growing number of fake news being distributed through social media and search results. \nBoth companies were also accused of swaying the US election result by facilitating a huge surge in entirely false stories about the presidential candidates being shared online in the run up to the vote. \nResearchers have found a vast underbelly of websites producing entirely false content which have apparently drawn in many credulous social media users. \nSome are intended to promote political campaigns - such as news sites detailing the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton carried out a murder. Others are simply designed to be 'clickbait' which can draw in revenue from advertising placed alongside the content. Most people read news articles shared online - but are they trustworthy? Credit: PA \nThe problem is made even worse by a technique used by both Facebook and Google known as 'filter bubbles' in which they attempt to learn users' interests and promote content which they think they will like. \nIt means that people who rely heavily on social sites or google search for news may fail to get a balanced view of contentious or political issues. \nAnd if they share one false news story, they are likely to see any more along the same lines, shoring up their belief despite there being no basis in the reports. \nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has denied claims that the social network played any role in influencing the election result, claiming that \"99%\" of the content on Facebook was authentic. \nHowever there are reports that some staff at the social media network have set up an unofficial task force to combat the problem. \nFacebook said that it was now updating its policy to restrict adverts from appearing alongside \"misleading or deceptive\" content - though this will not impact on fake news that is shared by users on their news feeds. \nMeanwhile Google said it would restrict adverts from being placed on websites and pages that \"misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property\".

      "text": "  Google, Facebook Say They Won't Serve Ads to Fake News Sites Published on November 15, 2016 . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seen during a session at the Techonomy 2016 conference in Half Moon Bay, Calif., on Thursday, has said that 'more than 99 percent' of what people see on Facebook is authentic. Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Most Popular \nGoogle and Facebook took steps to punish fake news websites amid growing scrutiny of technology platforms for permitting false information to spread online. \nOn Monday, Alphabet Inc.'s Google said it's implementing a new policy that pulls its popular advertising tool from websites that run \"misrepresentative content\" although it stopped short of banning fake news from its pages. Facebook clarified existing rules that it won't integrate or display ads in apps or sites that are illegal, misleading or deceptive. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Andrea Faville, a Google spokeswoman, wrote in a statement. Related Stories How Did Hillary Clinton Screw This Up? For Starters, Her Advertising Was All Wrong \nGoogle's AdSense for publishers, which facilitates web display ad sales, is the dominant service in the industry and a primary source of revenue for most online publications. The incoming policy will not necessarily scrub false articles from its search pages, which surface from complex algorithims. But the move could send publications behind fake news scrambling for cash. \nReuters first reported on Google's policy change. Google was working on the policy prior to the U.S. presidential election last week, according to Ms. Faville. \nDonald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. election has sent shock waves across Silicon Valley. Geoff Lewis, an investor with venture firm Founders Fund, pinned some of the blame for the results on the tech industry on Sunday, arguing that social media sites had grown too cloistered. Facebook, in particular, has been the target of criticism for hosting false stories that circulated before the election. \nOn Sunday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded, claiming that \"more than 99 percent\" of what people see on the social media site is authentic. \"Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,\" he wrote. \nGoogle faced similar heat on Monday morning. The top search result for a query around the election result directed users to a Wordpress blog citing unverified information. Google copped to the error. \"In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,\" Ms. Faville said. \n-- Bloomberg News",

      "text": "Screengrab via Google/Instagram The change comes on the heels of an embarrassing search result blunder. \nGoogle says it plans to crack down on the number of fake news sites found in its search results by prohibiting those sites from using its ad-selling software, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nGoogle will be updating its policies to ban \"pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose\" from using Google Ads, as a means to put a dent in the revenue of fake news sites. Google’s AdSense is the most popular tool for monetizing websites, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nThe move comes a day after the Washington Post reported that Google's leading \"in the news\" search result for final election numbers came from fake news blog called 70 news. \nThe post alleged that President-elect Donald Trump had won the popular vote over Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by 700,000 votes. Clinton won the popular vote, and the margin between her and Trump stands at about 700,000 votes . This guy's tweet has thousands of likes and retweets. His source for these numbers is the site https://t.co/HvheqglyZW pic.twitter.com/ZUelzRhPUo \nAlongside Google, Facebook is also responding to assertions that the spread of fake news played a role in the outcome of the election . \nThough Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg originally said the idea that fake news distributed on the platform affected the election was \"crazy,\" the company is targeting fake news through ad sales, too. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , Facebook will explicitly ban sites that peddle fake news from using the Facebook Audience Network. A spokesperson said these sites fall under the category of misleading, illegal, or deceptive sites already barred. \n“While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesman said. “We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”",

      "text": "share Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, is perhaps best known for coming up with the phrase \"net neutrality.\" In his last book, The Master Switch , Wu traced the history of modern communications and media consolidation. In his new book, The Attention Merchants , Wu delves into the history of advertising, propaganda, and media. Wu writes a history that begins with Benjamin Day’s idea to sell his paper, The New York Sun , for less than the cost of production and make up the difference through advertising; now, ads are even displayed in public schools. Many media companies — including this one — aim to attract the attention of readers or viewers. That attention is then directed, at least theoretically, toward the ads the company serves. That model has expanded, however, with companies that consider themselves the tech sector — like Google or Facebook — borrowing the media model of serving ads to a captive audience, either through search results or through your social media feed. Ad tech has come a long way since 1833! I spoke to Wu about the long view on advertising, the role of propaganda in politics, and the rise of celebrity culture. \nThis interview was condensed and edited for clarity. It also took place before the presidential election on Nov. 8. The New York Sun’s November 26th, 1834 front page. Public domain I wanted to start by talking about what I came to think of in reading your book as the original sin of news, which was The New York Sun in 1833. I think is the first ad-subsidized newspaper, is that right? As far as I know. It was a cheaper way of producing papers so that more people would buy them, right? It’s the model that has gone on to form everything in so much of our lives, which is giving away something at very low cost to free, and then hoping you’ll gain enough of an audience that you can resell the audience and make money that way. That’s why I call Benjamin Day the first attention merchant. I think it was the original sin, and he was the first to do it. From there, things went in a couple of different directions, because obviously you have patent medicine advertisements, and then you also have propaganda developing very early on in the 20th century. Can you tell me a little bit more about the development of propaganda? One of the undercurrents of my book is that advertising, or even more fundamentally trying to get access to people's minds, was a fairly obscure business model restricted to the tabloid press. Advertising wasn't really used by respectable corporations. The only institution that I would say used propaganda regularly, consistently prior to the 20th century, was the church. In fact, the Catholic Church came up with the word \"propaganda,\" in the sense of propagating the faith. No, I don't mean the church advertised, but I do mean the church was very interested in getting access to people's minds and the way they were thinking. Governments, there were occasionally leaders who would give speeches or have big rallies. But the systematic effort to gain access to people's minds to persuade them of things didn't really develop until the British government in WWI made the discovery that they needed an army. The original government propaganda campaign was really a recruiting campaign for the British army. That started more out of necessity than anything else, and many other historians believe that the credibility and success of the British propaganda effort, and later the American propaganda effort, is part of what drove the development of a true advertising industry of the time we talk about today. James Montgomery Flagg’s recruitment poster for the US Army. James Montgomery Flagg / Library of Congress Strategies for manipulating attention got more sophisticated with political propaganda and have been used to political ends ever since. How is that playing out here in the US with the election? There's long been a learning relationship between government and commercial propaganda or advertising. Earlier in the 20th century, they used the same word: everything was called propaganda. Commerce learned greatly from the efforts of the British propaganda in the First World War. Later on you could see very clearly the German Third Reich learning from American advertising techniques in the '30s, and also some of the dissemination techniques: the idea of prime time, the use of radio en masse. In our time in the United States, there is less government propaganda. There was urging people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, a kind of government urging, but a lot more money spent on political campaigns. If you've been alive in the United States this past year, it's impossible to escape, essentially, the propagandizing of both sides and other primary candidates. The general rule is if they use all the methods they can, these are now campaigns with very large budgets, they use the most sophisticated advertising techniques available: micro-targeting of groups, very careful tailoring of messages, you name it. People specialize in political work or commercial work can easily go between the two. \"One candidate... can really appear like five different candidates\" One of the advantages in politics is often you want to say different things to different people but still be the same person. There's been a rise in politics of efforts to target voters with exactly the right message on the thing that matters to them. One candidate, whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, can in some ways really appear like five different candidates. For some people it's really they're the immigration candidate. For another one they really care about women's rights. For another one it's all about trade. Exactly what people care about. That's been a big development in politics over the last 10 years or so; 10 or 15 years. \nOne of the things that you wrote about government propaganda was \"What the audience most wants is an excuse to experience fully the powerful feelings already lurking within them, but that their better selves might lead them to suppress.\" I'm curious to know how that plays out with online news organizations, social networks, and public life. That quote was part of the book reflecting on Hitler's appeal, so it's somewhat a dark fact. I think that there's no question that holding an audience and really attracting attention — you can see this from this election cycle very clearly — it is to speak to people's unconscious fears, their humiliations, their darkest impulses, is an incredibly effective way of both gaining attention and also gaining support. It was shown in the 20th century that a group is the best, most effective way of concentrating those feelings. I think you can see in Donald Trump's case, he's very effectively used rallies where people are united with these really powerful, dark feelings to drive his base. In previous times, the idea was you'd then translate that same message to radio or to television. It’s a little more difficult with an independent media to do this, but certainly something that Trump in particular tried to do. I wouldn't say he's the only one. Many of the populist politicians, even Bernie Sanders, sometimes tap into a certain anger that people feel and want to express. I'd say those techniques have not changed at all and are still being used in politics very often today. Wikimedia One of the things that you talk about is that in propaganda in particular — and this is also from the Hitler section of your book — that reductive, emotionally engaging rhetoric works a lot better than complex thought. That seems depressing to me. Here we are, I'm an academic, I hope to appeal to rational people's minds at times, but it is depressingly true, as Mein Kampf pointed out, that many times it's easier — and advertisers know, too — to appeal to people a very simple message repeated over and over, and one that appeals to their emotions. Now, you can also appeal to uplift-like emotions, but you certainly get a rise out of people appealing to dark emotions. Many of the successful internet content companies of the 21st century have similar appeal. They're a little different: they're beautiful cats, heroic pictures, things like this. The fact, I think, that's proven over and over in history: if you want to get people's attention, you begin with emotional appeals. That will stick very straightforward things like incredibly cute kittens or \"we hate this group\" will get you far. Writing this book is a depressing fact about the mass media and about us, but one that I think is better to know about than ignore. You mentioned that often online companies and online new organizations make an attempt to appeal directly to emotionality in order to capture attention just as much as politicians do. This seems to be very much a feature of a lot of public speech. Has it had any effect on discourse? There's an ethical line. I hope this answers your question. I don't think it's unethical or wrong to try to get people interested in your topic by simplifying it to some degree. The question is: I think at a second level, once you have someone engaged, is whether you present the issue in its full complexity, or whether you keep it at this distorted, simplistic, stereotype, as Walter Lippmann said, way of looking at it? The people I respect do use attentional hooks because this is a world where we're incredibly ... For all of human history, getting people's attention has been hard, but it's particularly hard now. The question is whether you stick with that, or whether you acknowledge some of the complexity in the situation you're talking about. If you're discussing something like the conflict in Syria, is it a straightforward, simple thing you say, \"These people are evil, we need to get them,\" or is it a more complicated undertaking? I think there's more ethical ways to handle these situations. I notice in this book that you spend a lot of time dealing with the folks who produce advertising, who produce propaganda. I'm curious to know: to what degree are we as audience members complicit in this process? We're highly complicit. We have trained ourselves to expect content to be free. There's some nice things about free content. It reaches more people, and in that way might facilitate broader readership, but I don't think it's a sustainable. I think it's a pipe dream that you can have high-quality stuff and hope it to be free forever. There are some very narrow instances where I think it's sustainable. Somehow Wikipedia has managed to keep things going. \n\"I am somewhat blaming us, the readers, for being so demanding that we never pay for anything.\" In most cases, the price of free is going to involve a lot of advertising and increasing demand by advertisers that the platform deliver ever more viewers and guarantee what it's doing, which ultimately, usually leads to degradation of the product. If we're talking about media or content, increasing moves toward clickbait, simplistic messages, and also content designed to keep you clicking away. The pressure to do that, I think you look at the story of the web, that has been the evolution of content on the web over the last 15 years or so. I'm not blaming anyone involved. Actually, I am somewhat blaming us, the readers, for being so demanding that we never pay for anything, and so resistant to any micropayment or subscription schemes. One of the things I say in this book is, \"Listen, we've got to suck it up and start paying for stuff if we want our media to be better.\" There's a duty to present good subscription programs that are ad-free and really deliver value, but this idea that we can coast around, never pay for anything and expect great journalism is a pipe dream and a bad joke. I think it's time to come to grips with that. There are times that audiences have rebelled. There was the initial rebellion against patent medicine, and then there was a fizzled rebellion in the 1960s that wound up being co-opted by advertising itself. Is it possible that these rebellions will inevitably be co-opted by advertising? A lot of advertisers seem to have read Naomi Klein's No Logo , and have been basing advertising strategies basically around an anti-advertising book. I'm curious to know how that interplay works. One of the most remarkable things about capitalism is how adaptive it is. For example, if someone is themselves an anti-consumerist, you can sell them a T-shirt that says they're anti-consumerist, or they'll have their own motive. You can sell to anything, even impulses that are against buying or selling. That's why I think it's so interesting. The story on revolts against advertising is they do happen periodically. They tend to be, I think, because the industry expands, expands, expands, and at some point, people go crazy. It's not everybody, but a certain number of people say, \"This is too much.\" I reached that level probably before other people. I was on an airplane yesterday. It was an airline that I don't fly very often, Air Canada. They started running full volume ads over the PA system when you're sitting there. I said, \"I can't believe you actually run this. This is crazy.\" That's an example. What can I do in that situation? \"People do get fed up.\" People do get fed up. They feel that their minds are being intruded upon. In the first half of the book, those movements tend to led to legislative responses; government crackdowns of one kind or another. Over the last 50 years, that hasn't really happened. As you pointed out, advertisers have become incredibly sophisticated at trying to read the revolution and join it, so that somehow they're on your side. They confuse the whole thing until it disappears or collapses of its own weight. The '60s are the strongest example where the countercultural impulses, which were originally very anti-consumerist, gave birth to a new round of consumption of groovier stuff. That drives Marxist theorists crazy. I think it's where things are. Knopf \nI am curious to know if you feel that we're in a revolt, particularly because it seems at the end of the book, you believe that we might be, but the very beginning of the book shows advertising moving into a relatively new realm, which is the public school. I'm curious how those two things are brushing up against each other. I think we are in a state of at least partial rebellion against advertising. There are little signs. There's a lot of people who swear off advertising altogether as if it's a lifestyle. There's prevalence of ad blockers. There's cord-cutting, which is its own way of getting away from advertising. There's subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon, HBO Go are alternative ways of getting content. There's been an enormous shift in television revenue. Part of what that leads to, however, is as people try to get away from ads and find ways to avoid or ignore them, advertisers get more desperate and look for different areas to put ads. That's part of what drives the moves into places like schools or state parks are becoming advertised to. It also drives the efforts to try to make advertising more secretive or surreptitious. The efforts to less put an ad right in front of you, but more influence your decision making one way or another, whether it's what products are recommended for you on Amazon, or in the future, you think about self-driving cars or Internet of Things. What is your refrigerator going to order? What options does it show you? I think the market for subtle influence is one that promises to be quite lucrative as advertising is seen to be less effective because of the extent of rebellion. On the other hand, even though we have these revolts, there's still a lot of money being spent on advertising. I believe that some of it is getting through. There's also demographic breaks going on, which is very interesting. Older people tend to more patiently watch television and sit there through the ads, while you can't say this generally, the general trend is that younger, especially very young people, the idea of sitting through advertisements is unthinkable. There's a sense of the demographics of who is maybe watching the ads is shifting as well. I like that we're getting the demographics, because I want to talk with you a little bit about targeted in tracking campaigns, which is something that recurs in your book. It first starts with targeting women with advertising, and then it gets more sophisticated with the zip code mapping, and then of course now with Facebook and Google. I'm curious to know what what effects these tracking efforts have and what that means for us as consumers? Let me begin with what you discussed, which is it is fascinating to take the very long view on targeted advertising and how it evolved because it shows you how amazing it is where we've gotten. In the beginning of advertising there was just ads, and they weren't targeted specifically to any group. Then there was a big split between men and women advertising. There was a feeling in the 1920s particularly that the key was to target female consumers, and that you had to do so differently. They hired women to do so, or created things with more colors and so forth. That was their thinking. Then things started to be racially distinguished advertising. Mainly in the '40s, '50s, Pepsi advertised to African Americans. Then the '70s, you start to see the beginning of geographically targeted advertising. \"We think on the Upper West Side, this kind of person is living there, and the Upper East Side is a different kind of person, so we'll target people by zip codes.\" You go further and further until you're in our present day where you're targeting individuals or types of individuals. Then even more interesting, in my opinion, is the effort to try to target particular mental states. Google's success as an advertising platform has a lot to do with the promise that they're delivering you a customer right when they're trying to make a decision. They're in that mental state of being on the lookout for something and considering their options. Getting at that state, that moment, you're not necessarily when you're watching television thinking about life insurance, but if you're searching for life insurance on Google, it's pretty clear that you are. That has always been their promise. It's a lot more sophisticated. As you know, tracking and other spying technologies have led to great development of profiles among ad tech firms, which try further to get at what might be of interest to you based on a rough guess as to what you are or who you are. \n\"Boy, it's been a lot of invasion of privacy to get there.\" I have mixed feelings about those types of advertisements. They have always promised to be more relevant to you, but I don't know if people have found that experience to be as gratifying as was promised. I'm not sure they've really delivered. Boy, it's been a lot of invasion of privacy to get there. The whole enterprise of ad tech, to me, has been a depressing undertaking for everyone involved. I think we might all look back on it and regret it. You do spend a lot of time talking about Google's ad words. I think since you probably shipped the book, it came out that Google has started tracking personally identifiable data I think in an effort, probably, to catch up with Facebook. Is there any way to avoid this kind of surveillance when most of the web carries Google ads, Facebook \"Like\" buttons or things like that? There's one way: Google could start selling its product. You could subscribe to Google for a $1 month and be completely tracking, completely ad-free. I would certainly sign up for that. We don't have to. Even if you love the internet and web, the difference between advertising and the web, they're not the same thing. I think you can love the promise of the web even, but not feel like you have to love advertising models. There's been obviously a lot of failures to come up with micropayment systems. Not every subscription system has worked, but just because something doesn't work once doesn't mean it can't work at some point. I think the lovers of the web really need to be on the lookout for better ways to fund what we want to see out of this technology. It's ultimately ours. I think we're all in a bad place here. I know how we got here, we needed funding and there we go, but a lot of sites have gotten in these situations, Google among them. Google was originally very opposed to advertising, thought it was a corrupting influence, and now they're breaking all of their own rules that they set up for themselves. It's tragic in some ways, because they thought they could avoid it, just have a few ads and be fine. But when they went public and promised increasing revenues, it means they've had to devote an enormous amount of their engineering ability into making better ads instead of making better products, or making themselves a better platform for ads. I think we're in a bad place, and I think it'd be great if companies like Google and Facebook could get back to trying to improve their products as opposed to improving themselves as an ad platform. What role does celebrity culture and personal branding fit in all of this? There is some sense in which we're all advertisers now. We're using social media to advertise our identity. I'm curious to know the degree to which this has bled through the culture. The rise of celebrity as the sine qua non of attracting attention is really an interesting, fascinating development in the 20th century culture. I think there was once upon a time a headline was good enough for something. The people started realizing by the '70s the degree to which people pay attention to a celebrity versus anything else is orders of magnitude different. All of us are vulnerable, or some of us will say, \"Oh, I just want substance,\" but most people have their own celebrities. Just to take one example, Trump proved completely irresistible to anyone, even people who hated him. Over the last election cycle, his ratings were over the top. I have to say, I think in a world where getting attention is the first step for almost every venture, in a world where celebrities get attention more than anyone else, the value of celebrity is only going to increase, and in fact, become even more integrated. It may become in the future that it's unthinkable to run for office before developing a celebrity reputation, that that's where you start; you build your fame and then you go for it. Or no nonprofit maybe in the future will have a president other than someone who is already world famous because that's how you get attention to causes. I think we're probably in for more of that. The celebrity industrial complex isn't going away, that's what I hear you saying. No, I think it's becoming more central to things. Part of it has to do with us. I'm not blaming us; I'm saying it's the way we're wired. Having done all of the research on the book, and I've read a lot of the literature on celebrity, I feel like still no one completely understands why people are so obsessed with relatively normal people who are on the screen or in office, but there's no question about the effect of it. Even in journalism at all, you write one story that's about this promising proposal, another story that's about you know how Harry Potter teaches us about something, or anything about Donald Trump, and you notice the traffic numbers are so different. It's unavoidably the case. It's here we are, and I think more to come. Next Up In Entertainment",

      "text": "Facebook, Google, and Twitter urge Trump to support encryption and immigration reform Internet Association outlines policy positions in a letter to the president-elect share Spencer Platt/Getty Images \nA group of tech companies including Facebook, Google, and Twitter has called on President-elect Donald Trump to protect encryption, reform immigration policy, and curtail surveillance during his administration. The Internet Association, whose members also include Uber, Amazon, and Netflix, outlined its policy positions in a letter published on Monday. \nTech executives have been wary and sometimes openly critical of Trump, in part due to the president-elect's divisive campaign rhetoric and positions on immigration and encryption. In June, more than 100 Silicon Valley leaders said in a letter that a Trump presidency would be a \" disaster for innovation .\" The letter released Monday strikes a more optimistic tone. \n\"The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,\" the letter reads. \n\"Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nDuring the Republican primary, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company refused an FBI order to unlock an iPhone that belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters. He dismissed the company's argument that unlocking the phone would threaten the privacy and security of all iPhone users, saying in a February interview: \"Who do they think they are?\" The Internet Association hopes he'll reconsider. \n\"Laws that require companies to engineer vulnerabilities into products and services harm personal privacy and endanger national security,\" the letter reads. \"Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nThe letter also calls on Trump to support net neutrality and implement stronger reforms on government surveillance programs. Trump has been critical of net neutrality in the past, and his transition team includes two prominent defenders of the National Security Agency (NSA). But he may be more sympathetic to some of the Internet Association's other policy priorities, including its calls to ease regulation of the sharing economy and lower regulatory barriers in Europe. \nOn immigration, the Internet Association wants Trump to \"expand and improve the green card program,\" and to create a green card system for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates. Trump built much of his candidacy around a hardline anti-immigration position, and although his position on expanding the H1-B visa program for skilled workers remains vague , there are concerns that the program could be curtailed under his administration. \nYou can read the Internet Association's full letter and list of policy priorities here .",

      "text": "The HTC-made Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL are fiercely marketed under the “Phone By Google” campaign. Since Google did exert a heavy influence on the design and continues to put forth large budgets on marketing and advertising the Pixels, mores so than it did for any Nexus so far, we would not blame the average user if they did not know that HTC is actually manufacturing the devices.\nAnd that is exactly why Huawei declined to produce the Pixels. Back in October, reports originated that Huawei was apparently Google’s first choice for producing the Pixel duo. Talks originated between Google and Huawei for the production of three devices, but the parties could not come to any agreement on the same. Google then had to approach HTC for the manufacture of the Pixel, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nHuawei Executive Colin Giles, speaking to WinFuture , confirmed the reports on Huawei being given the opportunity. He also mentions that the reason why an agreement could not be reached is because it was unacceptable for the company to produce a device with no influence on the branding or promotional material. Huawei wished to expand its brand presence in the US market as noted in earlier reports, so the lack of branding would have created little awareness of the brand within the average consumer. Huawei had also decided some years ago that it would not be a contract-job OEM for other brands to ride on, so Google’s demands of a Google-heavy smartphone were not in line with Huawei’s vision.\nIs this the end of the road for Huawei-Google? Apparently not. Huawei continues to insist on its partnership with Google, and leaks have pointed that the company is in line to produce the hardware for the upcoming 7″ tablet that will feature Google’s unannounced Andromeda OS. We will have to see whether Huawei has budged from its position and given in to Google branding, or if Google has relaxed its demands for the partnership.\nWould you have preferred a Huawei-made Google Pixel? Let us know in the comments below! \nSource: WinFuture \n",

      "text": "11/15/16 AT 9:42 AM Close \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat billionaire Donald Trump in the general election's popular vote by a considerable margin. But that fact is still up for debate — at least, according to Google. \nThe Democratic nominee reportedly garnered at least 61,324,576 votes as of Tuesday, or 47.9 percent of the total vote, compared to Trump’s 60,526,852, or 47.2 percent. The gap between those numbers could grow even bigger as left-leaning counties continue to send in the last of their ballots, giving Clinton upwards of a 2 million-vote lead. Still, Trump secured more than the 270 Electoral College votes required to take the White House without receiving the majority of votes from individual Americans, scoring 290 to Clinton’s 232. \nBut if one were to have missed last week's presidential election entirely and simply searched \"who won the popular vote?\" on Google, the first page of results would yield starkly different answers. \nA right-wing WordPress site titled 70News.com managed to land itself at the top of Google's election results in the wake of the contest, reporting Trump received the majority of votes instead of his opponent. The site called for the shutdown of a \"loony petition\" on Change.org urging the Electoral College to vote in line with the majority of the country. Above the unfounded results are tabs to different sections of the site, including \"Hillary’s Health\" and \"Religion,\" which argues the Republican president-elect is a prophetic entity who has come to save the White House. \nThough Google does not remove search results save for malware or illegal content, the search engine took responsibility for the circulation of the unfounded reports. \n\"The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users. In this case we clearly didn’t get it right,\" a Google spokesperson told International Business Times in an email. \"We are continually working to improve our algorithms.\" \nFor some, the inaccurate webpage's priority placement was a fault on Google’s end to not provide the genuine results of the general election for users. One week after the election, 70News.com remains on the front page of Google’s search results, along with similar headlines like \"Hillary did NOT win the popular vote – Trump won landslide by the numbers\" and YesImRight.com ’s \"No Liberals…Hillary did NOT win the popular vote.\" \nFor others, the divisive search results are just another example of the political echo chambers that have characterized the election. Related Stories Conservative Talk Show Host Laura Ingraham Could Join Trump Cabinet \nDespite securing well over the votes needed from the Electoral College, Trump’s first official days as president-elect have seen a bevy of protestors and activists demanding the real estate magnate be kept out of the White House entirely. \nSome demonstrations have been motivated by Clinton's popular vote victory. However, she was unable to garner votes from across the Electoral College to pass the 270-vote threshold. Though Trump said himself in 2012 such an outcome would be a \"disaster for democracy,\" both candidates have accepted the results of the election. \nThe rest is (much debated) history.

      "title": "GE Wants To Be The Next Artificial Intelligence Powerhouse",
      "text": "When you hear the term \"artificial intelligence,\" you may think of tech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, or Facebook. Industrial powerhouse General Electric is now aiming to be included on that short list. It may not have a chipper digital assistant like Cortana or Alexa. It won&apos;t sort through selfies, but it will look through X-rays. It won&apos;t recommend movies, but it will suggest how to care for a diesel locomotive. Today, GE announced a pair of acquisitions and new services that will bring machine learning AI to the kinds of products it&apos;s known for, including planes, trains, X-ray machines, and power plants.\nThe effort started in 2015 when GE announced Predix Cloud —an online platform to network and collect data from sensors on industrial machinery such as gas turbines or windmills. At the time, GE touted the benefits of using machine learning to find patterns in sensor data that could lead to energy savings or preventative maintenance before a breakdown. Predix Cloud opened up to customers in February, but GE is still building up the AI capabilities to fulfill the promise. \"We were using machine learning, but I would call it in a custom way,\" says Bill Ruh, GE&apos;s chief digital officer and CEO of its GE Digital business (GE calls its division heads CEOs). \"And we hadn&apos;t gotten to a general-purpose framework in machine learning.\" \nToday GE revealed the purchase of two AI companies that Ruh says will get them there. Bit Stew Systems , founded in 2005, was already doing much of what Predix Cloud promises—collecting and analyzing sensor data from power utilities, oil and gas companies, aviation, and factories. (GE Ventures has funded the company.) Customers include BC Hydro, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Scottish & Southern Energy.\nThe second purchase, Wise.io is a less obvious purchase. Founded by astrophysics and AI experts using machine learning to study the heavens, the company reapplied the tech to streamlining a company&apos;s customer support systems, picking up clients like Pinterest, Twilio, and TaskRabbit. GE believes the technology will transfer yet again, to managing industrial machines. \"I think by the middle of next year we will have a full machine learning stack,\" says Ruh.\nGE Wants to Give Industrial Machines Their Own Social Network With Predix Cloud GE is selling a new service that promises to predict when a machine will break down...so technicians can preemptively fix it. GE also just bought ServiceMax , maker of software for dispatching field service agents, for a cool $915 million. \"It&apos;s a unicorn, essentially,\" he says.\nThough young, Predix is growing fast, with 270 partner companies using the platform, according to GE, which expects revenue on software and services to grow over 25% this year, to more than $7 billion. Ruh calls Predix a \"significant part\" of that extra money. And he&apos;s ready to brag, taking a jab at IBM Watson for being a \"general-purpose\" machine-learning provider without the deep knowledge of the industries it serves. \"We have domain algorithms, on machine learning, that&apos;ll know what a power plant is and all the depth of that, that a general-purpose machine learning will never really understand,\" he says.\nGE Healthcare lobbed a shot across IBM&apos;s bow in announcing a deal with UCSF to develop AI-driven apps for the care of various diseases. (See my colleague Chrissy Farr&apos;s full coverage [[TK-Link here]] .) Health is the first industry IBM Watson targeted (starting with years of studying cancer data), and UCSF is a nice prize.\nNot synonymous with health is another new GE customer, McDonald’s, which is using a Predix service called Current to lower energy costs on items like heating and lighting. Most of GE&apos;s new offerings are in the energy realm, such as Digital Substation, which promises to use monitoring and AI to reduce downtime for power companies.\nOne especially dull-sounding new Predix service—Predictive Corrosion Management—touches on a very hot political issue: giant oil and gas pipeline projects. Over 400 people have been arrested in months of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The issue is very complicated, but one concern of protestors is that a pipeline rupture would contaminate drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.\n\"I think absolutely this is aimed at that problem. If you look at why pipelines spill, it&apos;s corrosion,\" says Ruh. \"We believe that 10 years from now, we can detect a leak before it occurs and fix it before you see it happen.\" Given how political battles over pipelines drag on, 10 years might not be so long to wait.",

      "text": "With help from Nancy Scola and Margaret Harding McGill GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK SQUEEZE FAKE NEWS SITES — Both tech companies announced Monday evening that they would ban fake news sites from using their respective advertising platforms, a strategy aimed at cutting off some of the revenue sources for the sites, which have been under fire for stoking fears during the campaign, The Wall Street Journal reports. Facebook will bar all fake news sites from its Facebook Audience Network, while Google will ban them from using its AdSense ad-selling software, both of which are tools websites can use to place ads. The moves to thwart phony news outlets, which have been called out for potentially influencing the outcome of the presidential election, come after mounting criticism of Facebook and Google for sitting idle while their platforms are being used to perpetuate untruths and hoaxes.\nStory Continued Below\nCLINTON DIGITAL STRATEGIST: FB FAKE NEWS A ‘BIG PROBLEM’ — Over the final weeks before Election Day, Hillary Clinton campaign staffers grew alarmed by the spread of misinformation about their candidate on Facebook, says Hillaryland’s chief digital strategist, Teddy Goff. Campaign officials and other Democrats began talking then about how to tackle post-election the viral spread of completely untrue headlines, like “FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead.” Nancy has the story , including what Goff thinks are possible remedies for what he calls a “solvable problem.” He says a strategy is in the works that could target “one or two people” at Facebook, including Mark Zuckerberg, who appears to have inflamed the debate by saying last week that it’s “a pretty crazy idea” that dissemination of bogus and misleading “news” items swayed the election in Donald Trump’s favor.\n— A group of Facebook employees has formed a secret task force to address the fake news problem, sources tell BuzzFeed . The unofficial group, which one staffer told the site includes “more than dozens” of Facebook staffers, has met twice in recent days and plans to present senior management with a formal list of recommendations for combating the sham news scourge. “It’s not a crazy idea,” a Facebook employee told BuzzFeed, referring to the argument that fake news affected the election. “What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.”\nANOTHER TRUMP TRANSITION AIDE TO WATCH — That’d be Joshua Wright, the former GOP commissioner at the FTC, who’s been advising the team on related matters, according to a source familiar with effort. Wright didn’t respond to MT on Monday night, but he comes to the transition as executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University, which he rejoined in 2015 after serving at the FTC during the Obama administration. He’s also senior of counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati’s D.C. office.\nGOOD TUESDAY MORNING! Welcome to Morning Tech, where we’re going nuts with the Westworld fan theories.

Witnesses in line to testify include NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind, Consumer Technology Association President Gary Shapiro and Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers CEO Mitch Bainwol. The hearing is part of the committee’s Disrupter Series, which has also looked at other emerging tech fields, including wearable devices, advanced robotics and blockchain tech.\nEISENACH REFUTES INDUSTRY TIES — The Trump transition’s lead on telecom, Jeffrey Eisenach, pushed back against the notion that he’s a lobbyist-turned-adviser, tweeting on Monday: “Not wanting to engage on this, but the facts are: Not a lobbyist; not consulting for Verizon; no consulting business before the FCC at all.” He was the online face of a recent New York Times story about Trump calling on lobbyists and corporate consultants to serve on his transition team. Lesley Stahl questioned Trump in Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview about his campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” of lobbyists in Washington; the president-elect, backpedaling, replied: “Everybody’s a lobbyist down there.” Eisenach declined to elaborate on his tweet.\nFTC GETS SMART ON SMART TVS — The Federal Trade Commission is set to evaluate how smart television devices are tracking consumer data and targeting advertising, during a Fall Technology event on Dec. 7. Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, is expected to open the discussion, which will also feature a panel on how the devices leverage analytics to promote ads to users, and another on the regulatory policies that could be put in place to shield the privacy of consumers who use them.\n** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: It’s time for America to come together.

IPHONE SALES — The Global Times, a Chinese state-run publication, ran an editorial on Sunday suggesting the country would go “tit-for-tat” if Trump were to enforce tariffs on Chinese exports, a move that the publication argued would adversely affect U.S. product sales , including those of Apple’s iPhone. Michael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, spoke with MT about the likelihood of this scenario, and said the stakes are higher for China in a trade standoff. “If President-elect Trump were to impose tariffs to respond to [China's] unfair trade practices, China will probably respond. China, however, has a lot more to lose in a tit-for-tat approach,” Wessel says. “China’s leaders depend a lot more on keeping their people employed to stay in power than Americans need an iPhone.”\n— Following Trump’s phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, The Global Times published an editorial on Monday that took a different tack and emphasized goals of collaboration between the two nations.\nNAMES FLOATING AROUND FOR TRUMP COMMERCE SECRETARY — Several business leaders and lawmakers are among the names being floated as contenders for the top gig at Commerce. Here’s a rundown:\n— Several of those suggested are Republican leaders who have stood by Trump, even as other members of the party distanced themselves from him. They include former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (whose star may have fallen, since he was booted from his transition role) and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry .\n— Another group of potentials is comprised of business leaders, including billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who’s also said to be one of the final two contenders being considered for the Treasury Secretary role. Others include Nucor Corporation CEO Dan DiMicco , Granite Capital International Group head Lewis Eisenberg and Former World Wrestling Entertainment Executive Linda McMahon . \nTRANSITIONS — TechNet, a trade group representing members of companies including Apple, Facebook and Google has named Joanie Deutsch as its executive director for Washington State and the Northwest. She’ll oversee the organization’s state advocacy and political activities in these regions. \nUpgrading Washington: Technology in the Next Administration — Join POLITICO for a deep-dive conversation on what it will take for the next generation of Washington leaders to bridge the government technology gap.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild not just our transportation infrastructure but also modernize our energy infrastructure, and pipelines, and broadband infrastructure—to boost America’s quality of life. Less than 1/2 of households in the bottom quintile of the economy have high-speed broadband. With “Building To Win,” we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy. America is falling behind the rest of the world, but with a serious, targeted plan we can secure our economic leadership, spur real economic growth and offer more people the dignity of work.

      "text": "Google and Facebook finally announced steps to tackle fake news on their respective platforms this week following increasing pressure from critics eager to halt the flow of falsehoods online.\nBoth companies said they will prohibit fake news websites from advertising on their platforms, thus reducing the exposure of such articles to the public while also starving the companies of an important source of advertising income.\nThe move comes after the companies received a wave of criticism over its role in propagating misinformation, particularly in this election cycle in which many observed that a bitter partisan war was potentially worsened by polarizing news sources touting untrue assertions. While the technology companies have in the past been hesitant to mediate the flow of news, this change might signal a change in thought as they come to grip with the real-life implications of lackluster surveillance on their platforms.\nRecommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news ,” a Facebook spokesman said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nTest your knowledge Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. Facebook said it will explicitly ban fake news sites from using the Facebook Audience Network, a system that places ads on other websites and mobile apps. On Monday, Google said it will prevent Google ads from being placed on “pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” the company’s spokesperson said, a category that includes fake news sites.\nTechnology and social media companies are increasingly seeing themselves as victims of those who game the system to spread misinformation either with purposes to mislead the public or for personal profit, as Buzzfeed recently exposed in an investigation.\nMost recently on Monday, the top result for a Google search for the final results of the presidential elections is sourced to a random website that says Donald Trump has won both popular and electoral votes , The Washington Post reports (in fact, Hillary Clinton leads the popular vote). On the same day, another false Facebook trending story with more than 10,000 shares claimed that Denzel Washington backs Mr. Trump and that he called President Obama “anti-Christian,” as the Post points out. These come after a string of false news that trended throughout the campaign season that ranged from Hillary Clinton calling for civil war to Mike Pence insulting Mrs. Obama.\nTechnology companies have historically been hesitant to play editor to the information flowing through their platforms.\nLast week, Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that Facebook influenced the elections, emphasizing the role the technology company played was to disseminate information, not decide on content – a painful experience the company had with editors with its Trending topics previously. The company does prohibit certain content, such as nudity.\nBut a growing sense of responsibility among employees of tech companies may continue to add pressure on executives to take more drastic actions. As Buzzfeed reported on Monday, a group of Facebook employees took initiative to form an unofficial task force to investigate whether the company, used by 150 million Americans, is doing enough to address the problem.\n\"It’s not a crazy idea,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed of the assertion that Facebook influenced the election. \"What’s crazy is for [Mr. Zuckerberg] to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed.\nCritics say even with the new policy, Facebook still has not addressed the proliferation of false news in the News feed. Both Facebook and Google have been taking steps over the years to label news sources as “satire” or “opinion,” while also allowing users to flag false content.",

      "text": "Julian Assange —‘Google is Not What it Seems’— They ‘Do Things the CIA Cannot’ Home / Badge Abuse / Video Catches Cop’s Wish to Kill Teens —“If I could get away with it, I woulda put a bullet in their…heads” Video Catches Cop’s Wish to Kill Teens —“If I could get away with it, I woulda put a bullet in their…heads” Matt Agorist   \nWeiser, ID — A concerning video was uploaded to YouTube this week, from an alleged Weiser police officer’s body camera demeaning a teenager for no reason. After a brief period of unprofessional and disrespectful behavior, the officer’s body camera then catches him wishing he could shoot teenagers. \nThe video was uploaded to YouTube Monday night and it has since garnered over 5,000 views. As the video begins, the alleged Weiser police officer is berating a teenager, claiming they were at a location at which they deny being. \nWhen the officer asks the teen for their ID, he begins acting like a drill instructor. \n“Where’s your license at?” barks the officer. \nWhen the teen turns to retrieve the license, like 99 percent of all people would have, the officer begins playing demeaning games. \n“I didn’t say to go get it! I asked you where it was!” yells the cop. \nAs the teen struggles to comply with the belligerent officer, the cop continues his verbal abuse. \n“Do you not understand English?” asks the tyrant. “Do you know how to comprehend?” \n“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean any disrespect in that,” the teen apologizes as the cop continues the abuse. \n“No, you’re disrespecting me!” asserts the officer attempting to imply that a teen trying to curtsey to every one of his orders is somehow ‘disrespect.’ \n“I thought that meant to go get my license. If that was wrong of me….” \n“No!” interrupts the officer. \n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” continues the teen. \n“Since when does, ‘where is your license?’ mean walk away and go get your license?” asks the officer, ignoring the fact that anyone could have interpreted that statement in such a way. \nThe cop then continues to demean the teen before the scene cuts to what appears to be the inside of the dispatch office. \n“Mouthy little bitches,” utters the officer as the person at the desk uncomfortably smiles. \n“Oh my fucking god. If I could get away with it, I would’ve put a bullet in the center of each one of their heads.” \nThe video then ends. \nOn Tuesday, the Free Thought Project reached out to the Weiser police department to confirm whether or not this was one of their officers and if they wanted to make a statement on the matter.

Photograph: Google Tuesday 15 November 2016 17.13 GMT Last modified on Tuesday 15 November 2016 17.15 GMT Share on Messenger \nGoogle is finally going ahead with its plans to build a “landscraper” headquarters in London’s King’s Cross, more than three years after the project was first announced. \nThe development, which will be Google’s UK headquarters, was reportedly thrown into turmoil in 2015 when bosses in California threw out the original plans, by London-based architects AHMM, for being “too boring”, and brought in a Thomas Heatherwick, designer of a new London bus, the Olympic cauldron , and the Garden Bridge . \nFurther questions were raised in the wake of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union about whether or not the search engine would want to base up to 7,000 employees in London . \nBut in a speech on Tuesday at Google’s current campus in King’s Cross, chief executive Sundar Pichai confirmed the plans were going ahead. “Here in the UK, it’s clear to me that computer science has a great future with the talent, educational institutions, and passion for innovation we see all around us,” he said. “We are committed to the UK and excited to continue our investment in our new King’s Cross campus.” An artist’s impression of the inside of Google’s new offices. Photograph: Google \nLondon’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the announcement, and argued that it put paid to fears that Brexit would damage the capital’s position as the leading European technology hub. “This is a vote of confidence in our great city – creating high-skilled jobs, supporting growth and demonstrating that London is open to business, new investment and talent from around the globe. \n“London is one the world’s leading technology hubs and investment into the capital post-Brexit remains robust, so Google’s expansion will further strengthen our city’s reputation as a global leader in digital technology” \nThe 10-storey building will be as long as the Shard is tall, and have a floorspace of 650,000 sq ft (60,400m2). The original plans were for a £1bn building with a climbing wall, rooftop pool and indoor football pitch . \nThe new building will lie alongside King’s Cross station, in an area currently used by King’s Cross Theatre for shows including the Railway Children, In The Heights, and the David Bowie musical Lazarus. \nGoogle will continue to occupy its current building in the development, a 380,000 sq ft (35,300m2) office at 6 Pancras Square which has room for 2,500 employees. Construction on a second building that Google will occupy but not own began earlier this year, with Google slated to be moving in in 2018. In contrast, the new headquarters will be designed and owned by Google, a first outside the United States. But it could prove problematic for the company if its tax affairs in the UK are not also cleared up in the meantime. \nIn January this year, Google agreed to pay a £130m settlement to HMRC, but continued to insist that its presence in Britain is minimal, and doesn’t constitute a “permanent establishment” . Instead, under the company’s internal structure, the majority of income from British customers is technically spent in Ireland, where Google’s advertising sales department is based. \nWith the growth of Google’s DeepMind subsidiary, a pure research AI firm founded in London and currently based in the King’s Cross offices, as well as the company’s decision to own and design the headquarters, those claims could be subject to reassessment, if the firm does not choose to change is affairs first. \nHeatherwick’s design agency, Heatherwick Studio, has had mixed success in recent years. Their new bus for London was welcomed as a design icon by then-mayor Boris Johnson, but criticised by riders for ineffective air cooling and by environmental campaigners for being less fuel efficient than the buses it replaced. \nHeatherwick Studio is working with Danish architects Bjarke Ingels Group on the project. In a joint statement they said that the goal with the new building was to “create an interestingness that fits the scale and the community of King’s Cross. The Silicon Valley startup garage meets the London train sheds in a building that couples clarity with eccentricity and anchors innovation with heritage.” Topics ",

      "text": "On Monday, the top trending story if you searched Google for \"final election vote count 2016\" was a fake story on a site called 70News claiming that Donald Trump had won the popular vote , even though he had not. And in the week before the election, Facebook and Google were being criticized about fake news on their sites, which critics believe could have swayed the presidential race's outcome.\nGoogle responded Monday with a pledge to restrict fake news sites from using its AdSense advertising network. Facebook, for its part, updated its policy to clearly state that its advertising ban on deceptive or misleading content applied to fake news.\nFurther Reading Zuckerberg claims just 1% of Facebook posts carry fake news \"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" Facebook said in a statement. And Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Saturday tried to put the kibosh on the idea that Facebook's platform influenced the election.\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\" Zuckerberg said . \"The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nStill, Google and Facebook are not preventing fake news or hoaxes from appearing on the social networking site or in Google search. Instead, the companies' policies are geared toward trying to reduce the financial incentive for producing fake news. And for Google, it's not just about seeking the truth. Advertisers don't want their wares displayed next to bogus content.\n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Google said in a statement. Google also has the same policy for pornography or violent content. AdSense vets content with artificial intelligence and humans to ensure compliance.\nFor its part, Facebook has been hit hard by some who accused the social-media platform of tilting voters in favor of Trump by allowing completely fabricated stories, including one that Trump won the endorsement of Pope Francis, to circulate on the site.\nThe Pew Research Center, meanwhile, in May said that 62 percent of Americans obtain some, or all, of their news on social media—the bulk of it from Facebook.",

      "text": " Google+\nEric Risberg/Associated press\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nBy Samantha Schmidt The Washington Post November 15, 2016\nResponding to growing concerns over the spread of misinformation online in the weeks and months before Election Day, Facebook and Google have announced plans to restrict sites that publish fake news from using online advertising.\nFacebook updated its advertising policy Monday to make clear that it will not display ads in websites or mobile apps that contain fake news. Such outlets will now be included under the already banned category of misleading, illegal or deceptive sites. Earlier Monday, Google announced a similar policy prohibiting ads from being placed on websites that publish fake news, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘We clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,’’ a Google spokeswoman said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal.\nOn Monday morning, The Washington Post reported, the top news link on Google in a search for ‘‘final election results’’ led to a fake news website incorrectly claiming that Donald Trump won both the popular vote and the majority of votes in the electoral college.\nGet Business Headlines The announcements from both internet giants came after Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, denied Thursday that fake news on the social network could have influenced the result of the presidential election. He called it a ‘‘crazy idea’’ and insisted that fake news ‘‘surely had no impact’’ on voters’ decisions.\nIn a Facebook status posted Saturday, Zuckerberg wrote that more than 99 percent of the content people read on Facebook is authentic, and the fake content that does exist is not limited to one partisan view or to politics in general.\nBut, he wrote, ‘‘We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.’’\nAdvertisement\nHe continued to say everyone would need to proceed carefully to make sure they don’t become ‘‘arbiters of truth.’’\n‘‘While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted,’’ he wrote. ‘‘An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual.’’\nSome Facebook employees countered Zuckerberg’s statements that fake news probably had no influence on the election, BuzzFeed News reported Monday. A group of ‘‘renegade employees’’ have reportedly formed a task force to call out the fake news being spread through the network and to voice dissatisfaction with the company’s stance on the issue.\nIn a statement Monday, a representative for Facebook said the company would take ‘‘swift action’’ against sites and apps found to violate its ad policy.\n‘‘Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance,’’ the Wall Street Journal reported.",

Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily\n— Donald J.

There have only been a handful of times that the winner of the popular vote lost the Electoral College, including in 2000 when Al Gore and George W. Bush vied for the presidency.\nTrump has not always been such a big fan of the Electoral College. In 2012, as it became clear that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would lose his bid to unseat President Barack Obama, Trump called the Electoral College “a disaster for democracy.”\nThe electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012 Get Political Happy Hour Trump may not be able to issue his unfiltered thoughts to the masses once he is inaugurated as president. Obama has often expressed frustration that his use of mobile devices has been restricted for security reasons, and it’s not clear whether Trump will have access to Twitter from his phone.\nChristina Prignano can be reached at christina.prignano@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP/file 2014\nMike Rogers, a former congressman, has stepped down from President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team.\nBy Julie Hirschfeld Davis The New York Times November 15, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s transition operation plunged into disarray Tuesday with the abrupt resignation of Mike Rogers, who had handled national security matters, the second shake-up in a week on a team that has not yet begun to execute the daunting task of taking over the government.\nIn a statement Tuesday, Rogers, a former congressman from Michigan who led the House Intelligence Committee, said that he was “proud of the team that we assembled at Trump for America to produce meaningful policy, personnel, and agency action guidance on the complex national security challenges facing our great country,” and that he was “pleased to hand off our work” to a new transition team led by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\nAdvertisement\nPence took the helm of the effort Friday after Trump removed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who had been preparing with Obama administration officials for months to put the complex transition process into motion. Now the effort is frozen, senior White House officials say, because Pence has yet to sign legally required paperwork to allow his team to begin collaborating with President Barack Obama’s aides on the handover.\nAn aide to Trump’s transition team who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal matters said that the delay was taking place because the wording of the document was being altered and updated, and that it would likely be signed later Tuesday.\nGet Political Happy Hour Still, the slow and uncertain start to what is normally a rapid and meticulously planned transfer of power could have profound implications for Trump’s nascent administration, challenging the efforts of the president-elect to gain control of the federal bureaucracy and begin building a staff fully briefed on what he will face in the Oval Office on Day 1.\nView Story Editorial: The reasonable and the outrageous on Trump’s team All fair-minded Americans should be revolted by Trump’s appointment of Stephen Bannon as senior counselor and chief strategist.\nMike Rogers, key voice on national security, steps down from Trump team\nThe chaos caught the attention of some senior Republicans who criticized Trump during his campaign but said after he won that they would not necessarily rule out joining his administration or advising him.\nEliot A. Cohen, a former State Department official, said in a posting on Twitter that after having spoken to Trump’s team, “changed my recommendation: stay away. They’re angry, arrogant, screaming ‘you LOST!’ Will be ugly.”\nAdvertisement\nObama has repeatedly said that his priority is to ensure a smooth and professional transition, a process for which his team and aides to Trump, as well Hillary Clinton’s staff members, had been quietly preparing for several months. Christie had signed a memorandum of understanding on Election Day to put the process into motion as soon as the outcome was determined.\nBut in response to a series of questions about whether the Obama administration had begun to brief Trump’s team, White House officials said late Monday that the president-elect’s decision to replace Christie with Pence had, for the time being, frozen the process. By law, the document must be signed by the chairman of the transition operation, and Pence has yet to do so.\nAmong other things, the paperwork serves as a mutual nondisclosure agreement for both sides, ensuring that members of the president-elect’s team do not divulge sensitive information about the inner workings of the government that they learn during the transition period, and that the president’s aides do not reveal anything they may discover about the incoming administration’s plans.\nBrandi Hoffine, a White House spokeswoman, said Obama’s team was working with Pence to sign the document, a standard agreement whose wording is largely governed by statute.\n“We look forward to completing that work so that we can provide the necessary access to personnel and resources to get the president-elect’s team up to speed and deliver on President Obama’s directive for a smooth transition,” Hoffine said.\nThe turmoil at the highest levels of his staff upended months of planning and preparation for a process that many describe as drinking from a fire hose even in the most orderly of circumstances — a period of about 70 days between election and inauguration on Jan. 20. During that time, the president-elect must assemble a team to take the reins of the massive federal bureaucracy and recruit, vet and hire 4,000 political appointees to help him run it.\nTeams throughout the federal government and at the White House that have prepared briefing materials and status reports for the incoming president’s team are on standby, waiting to begin passing the information to their counterparts on Trump’s staff.\nRelated Pentagon expects to hear from Trump transition team sometime this week Trump team’s coordination with White House on hold over document Mike Rogers, key voice on national security, steps down from Trump team Donald Trump’s White House adviser has history of inciting racial division Horowitz: Does ‘Trumponomics’ really add up?\nAshley Parker contributed reporting.",

      "text": "It’s true, everyone: GOOGLE. KNOWS. ALL. \nEven doctors turn to the search engine when they’re stumped. \nTake it from Dr. Brad Armstrong of the Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. He used Google to care for his patient after she became pregnant twice in 10 days . \nI don’t blame him, though! Have you ever heard of a woman becoming pregnant twice in 10 days? That’s like, my worst nightmare, but I won’t digress. \nThe rare phenomenon happened to Kate and Peter Hill, and they seem to be pretty freakin’ stumped. YouTube \nAccording to US Weekly, the condition is called superfetation — and there’s only been 10 reported cases in the world. \nHere’s the weird part: Within the 10-day period the babies were conceived, the Hills only had sex one time. \nHowever, Peter’s semen stayed alive for 10 days after intercourse. It was then able to fertilize the second egg that Kate released. Alas, baby number two. \nTricky, huh? \nApparently, Kate’s obstetrician, Dr. Brad Armstrong, never saw anything like it before and was baffled by the case. Hence his need for Google. \nDuring an interview with “Today Tonight,” Armstrong spoke about his mind-boggling journey trying to find answers . He said, \nI could not find any literature in the medical review websites at all. I had to go and Google it. YouTube \nHopefully, the search engine was able to give him the answers he sought. \nI don’t have any doubts, though. Google has never let me down before. \nEither way, Kate and Peter’s babies were successfully born two days before a planned cesarean section, regardless of their separate due dates. Their names are Charlotte and Olivia. \nKate spoke with “Today Tonight” on November 9 about her daughters and said , \nThey are definitely little miracles. \nCongrats, guys, and thank goodness for Google! \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.",

      "text": " Google+\nMBTA\nHere’s what the new Orange Line trains will look like.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 15, 2016\nCommuters, there is hope on the distant horizon.\nMBTA officials recently shared pictures of a two-thirds-size mockup of the transit agency’s new Orange Line trains, giving riders a glimpse into the future of public transportation in Greater Boston.\nAdvertisement\nThe trains, which will begin to hit the tracks by 2019, are being built by the China Railway Rolling Stock Corp., or CRRC. The manufacturer is building a plant in Springfield to assemble the cars.\nThe pictures of the train model were presented during a meeting with the T’s Fiscal and Management Control Board last week. They were shared by UniversalHub Monday .\nGet Fast Forward In 2014, the CRRC won a contract with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to build 152 new Orange Line cars and 132 Red Line cars. All 284 cars are expected to be delivered by 2022.\nThe exteriors of the Orange Line cars feature a silver frame with a long orange stripe running along the bottom of the vehicles. Orange paint also marks the front of the cars. Small orange “T” symbols can be seen near the trains’ doors.\nA second picture shows the interior of the trains. No longer will the seats of the Orange Line be covered in black fabric or carpet-like material. Instead, orange plastic seats will greet commuters.\nAdvertisement\nThe exterior pattern was decided after the MBTA launched a survey last year inviting riders to pick their favorite design from several options.\nMBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said the model should be in Boston just after the new year begins. For the moment, it’s still in China.\nWhen asked if the model, once in Massachusetts, would be put on display for riders to inspect firsthand, Pesaturo replied, “to be determined.”\n“We are looking at some options for making sure our customers are kept up to date throughout the procurement process,” he said.\nMBTA\nA view of the exterior.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .

      "text": "  Q. Children can type sex-related terms into Google and get explicit content, including images. What can be done about this? A. Google’s SafeSearch filter can block quite a bit of content like pornography from search results, so make sure the feature is turned on. To do this on a desktop browser, go to https://www.google.com/preferences . ( The filter is also available in the settings for mobile browsers and the Android and iOS versions of the Google app.) Photo The SafeSearch filter controls can be found in the Google Search settings. Credit The New York Times On the Search Settings page, make sure there is a check in the box next to “Turn On SafeSearch.” To prevent the filter from being disabled, click the Lock SafeSearch button, enter your Google account password and save your changes. You can also turn on the filter from the menu under the Settings icon on a Google search-results page. (For those who do not use Google Search, the Yahoo and Bing search engines also offer such filtering.) When the filter is enabled, it can block a lot of explicit material, like screening out most pictures of breasts and instead showing images of tufted titmice and other small birds when a common slang term for female anatomy is entered in the search box. However, SafeSearch — like most filters — is not infallible and some content may slip by. If you see objectionable content in SafeSearch results, report it to Google at https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/safesearch . SafeSearch can get turned off again if you delete browser cookies or your internet service provider overrides the settings. If you find you need stronger protections for your children’s browsing habits, app use and social media habits, consider third-party parental control programs ; free or inexpensive services like Familoop and Qustodio can give you an idea of what this type of software can do. But many children need to use the web for schoolwork and will inevitably come across content that will generate the need for a family discussion. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

      "text": "47 shares Google Photos launched with the intent of getting all your photos onto the cloud. Problem is, a lot of us still have about a bazillion old photos in print, which you can’t exactly upload to the Web over the course of a few minutes. \nExcept, maybe you actually can now, thanks to Google’s new PhotoScan app. As you might guess from the name, it allows you to scan your old photos right from your phone, and it uses some machine learning tricks to make sure they don’t show up as a blurry mess. If you’ve ever tried to take a photo of your old prints, chances are you’ve encountered a fair bit of glare from overhead lights or shadows from your body leaning over images. PhotoScan uses machine learning to composite multiple images and override those artifacts. The process involves opening the app, hovering your phone over the print, and then lining up the image with four dots that show up above the print -similar to making a photosphere or Street View image. If the app screws up a bit and crops the photo improperly, you can adjust the crop area of the image. I tried the app out myself, and it worked without a hitch. Results were fairly consistent, and even with the flash on full blast (which Google recommends for the additional illumination indoors) PhotoScan manages to avoid any glare. Of course, these were with sample images provided by Google, and the company says it’s best to scan the images on a surface with a contrasting background, but it’s impressively fast compared to using a traditional flatbed scanner, let alone shipping the images to a scanning service. That said, the images right now aren’t particularly high resolution – Google says 3-6 megapixels on the small 6×4 photos I tried the app on, but quality could increase over time, depending on the resolution of your phone’s camera. PhotoScan is rolling out on Android and iOS today, launching just in time for the holidays, though family is sure to surface embarrassing images you don’t want uploaded anyway.",

      "text": "Holiday Buyer's Guide Google PhotoScan saves irreplaceable photos in four snaps A new app linked to Google Photos turns your phone into scanner, preserving print images digitally without removing them from an album or frame. Sygma via Getty Images Google PhotoScan saves irreplaceable photos in four snaps 0 Share: \nGoogle's new app PhotoScan creates a digital copy of a printed image, without having to remove the photo from a frame or album. Photo by SSPL via Getty Images \nThe genesis of Google 's latest push in photos arose 69 years ago. \nFor Anil Sabharwal, the vice president of Google Photos , the inspiration for PhotoScan, which quickly creates a digital copy of a printed image, reaches back in his family's history to 1947. His grandparents, who were Hindus living in what had just become the Muslim state of Pakistan, faced soldiers at the door who ordered them to gather what belongings they could carry to cross the Indian border. Leaving behind jewelry and other valuables, Sabharwal's grandparents made sure to grab photos. \nSabharwal said his father, who was 8 years old at the time, has a only a few items remaining from his family lineage prior to 1947. \"He's got watch that his dad used to wear, and 10 or 20 photos of their wedding and of him as a kid,\" Sabharwal said in an interview in New York. \nJust think of what Sabharwal's father could have done with PhotoScan. \nGoogle on Tuesday unveiled the app, which uses your phone's camera and flash to quickly scan a printed photo. It leans on its software and machine learning to remove glare, crop it, correct its color and orient it appropriately before preserving it digitally in the cloud. \nPhotos have increasingly become a way for major tech heavy hitters like Google and Apple to strengthen their relationship with you. Many of the companies offer online storage for your digital photos, but Google's PhotoScan takes a step further by bridging the gap to the world of physical prints. \n\"The last time I was home, it was great,\" he said. \"I was capturing them in a way so I can share them with my kids.\" He added that because prints degrade, those digital preservations may be the only vestiges left for his children's children to tie them to their family history. \nTo use PhotoScan, you align the print you want to preserve in a box on your phone screen. You tap to start scanning, and then you move your phone over four white dots near the four corners of the image. The dots turn blue and disappear when each angle is captured, and then the program takes a few seconds to assemble a scanned digital reproduction of that pictures. \nThe app works on photos that are free and lying flat on a surface, or it can scan photos in a frame on the wall or in the pages of an album. \nAfter scanning, GoogleScan files the images in Google Photos, where that app will back it up remotely and apply the organization tools that Google Photos is already known for: identifying people by face, making images searchable for things like \"wedding\" without tagging, including them in automated montages and movies, etc. \nThe app scans quickly. Sabharwal said one his Google Photos engineers was able to scan about 100 photos in 10 minutes while holding a conversation with her sister. \nHe also said that Google worked hard to release PhotoScan before Thanksgiving in the US and the winter holidays generally, when families may be gathered together to reminisce about their own history. \nPhotoScan is available Tuesday for both Android and iOS globally. \nGoogle also announced some other improvements to Google Photos Tuesday. Editing in Google Photos has been revamped with an \"auto enhance\" quick tool for images, more and different filters called Looks, and advanced editing controls, that lets photo aficionados noodle around more finely with levels and colors. Google Photos will be rolling out more sophisticated movies its assistant automatically generates, such as one called \"Lullaby\" that will collect pics of your sleeping baby and set them to quiet music. It will have another around Christmas that will combine images and clips from Christmases past, with plans for more next year, like a movie for images of pets in April. The app's shared album feature will make it easier to combine pictures from multiple people, by sending a link to the shared album to specific people via an email, a text or through Google Photos app itself.

      "text": "If your most treasured images aren't digital, this clever app can help. \n[Photo: Flickr user SalTheColourGeek ] Harry McCracken 11.15.16 1:00 PM \nBack in October, as I was working on a story about how Google CEO Sundar Pichai gets stuff done for our December/January issue, I had the opportunity to observe him at work during a typical meeting with a product team. The product and team in question were ones that happened to fall neatly into the timetable for my article's research. But as I sat quietly on a couch and watched several Googlers walk Pichai through a demo of an upcoming app, I realized that it was something that spoke to my specific needs. \nThe app is called PhotoScan, and it's a new effort, debuting today, for Android and iOS from the group responsible for Google Photos. Its name gives away its purpose: to scan printed photos in so they can join all the digital ones you have stored in your Google Photos collection. \nOver the past year or so, I've been scanning a century's worth of family photos, including both beloved mementos and snapshots that have been stuck in my mother's basement for so long that nobody remembered they were there. I've been doing it on a MacBook Air using the flatbed scanner built into my Epson printer, and while the results look great, it's a project—which is why I've been at it for so long. \nThere are plenty of other smartphone scanner apps out there, but many are optimized for documents rather than photos, and I haven't seen any that deal with all the problems that can bedevil the job, from glare on an image to the difficulty of holding your phone at the proper angle. PhotoScan steps you through snapping four overlapping sections of your print photo using a clever bit of augmented reality: It superimposes four dots on the screen, then has you move your phone around to lasso each dot with a circle, a process that takes a few seconds. Then it intelligently detects edges, straightens and stitches together the four images, removes the glare, and generally polishes up the results. It will even try to rotate the photo automatically if necessary. \nI got to try the iOS version of the app on my iPhone 7 Plus. With a bit of experimentation, I found that it worked best if I used the flash (which you can also turn off). If I didn't like how a scan looked, trying again sometimes delivered better results. I never got anything that rivaled the scans I can produce with my fancy flatbed. But for a smartphone photo of a photo—not bad. \nFrom left, here are a PhotoScan scan, one from an app called Pic Scanner that doesn't deal well with glare, and one from my flatbed. \nIf you don't have Google Photos installed on your phone, PhotoScan lets you save scanned images to your camera roll. But the app was obviously born to complement Google Photos—once your photos are in the cloud, they get all the same benefits as ones that were digital in the first place, such as facial recognition and intelligent search that can pull up images with dogs, cars, or weddings without you having to futz with tags or albums. For my money, Photos is among Google's most impressive accomplishments of the past few years. \nWhy not build scanning directly into the Google Photos app? Google Photos product lead Dave Lieb says that capturing print photos is something you'll do in one fell swoop (or maybe multiple, sporadic fell swoops) rather than every day. In Google Photos itself, which Google hopes you will use all the time, scanning might feel like bloat. But in an app tailored for the purpose, it's a mission. If the concept is the least bit intriguing, you should check PhotoScan out. \nI leave you with a few more family photos that I scanned with the app.  ",

      "text": "Google Photos is arguably the best photo service for storing your photos and videos, and now Google's got a new app called PhotoScan that makes it stupid easy to digitize old printed photos and upload them.\nThe free app launching Tuesday on iOS and Android uses Google's powerful machine learning to turn print photos into digital pics in seconds.\nSEE ALSO: Google Pixel phones come with unlimited Google Photos storage\nThe real pain of digitizing print photos is what a hassle the entire process is. You either need to use a big, slow scanner or get them professionally scanned, which costs money.\nAnother popular option these days is to just take a photo of the print. But you often end up with all kinds of unwanted glare and reflections in your photos\nPhotoScan works like magic and produces a reflection-free image.\nYou can scan photos that are on a table or in a frame on a wall. It even works through glass frames.\nImage: raymond wong/mashable\nYou start by taking a photo of the picture you want to digitize, and then the app overlays four circles on top of the image. Simply move the circle outline above the four circles displayed on the photo until they turn blue, and voila, you've got a perfectly scanned photo.\nBut how's the app actually producing a reflection-free digital scan? The answer is pretty simple: The app is actually taking four different photos when you match the circles up and then composites each photo into one final image, intelligently omitting out the areas that are overexposed (white) while cropping and auto-rotating it.\nThere are also tools for more advanced users who want more control over the cropping.\nCropping tool.\nImage: raymond wong/mashable\nFrom start to finish, digitizing a photo takes less than 10 seconds. And because they're all stored in Google Photos, you have access to all of the powerful object and face recognition search features.\nThe quality of the scans will depend on your phone's camera. From what I could tell, scans taken with a Google Pixel looked good, but just don't expect anything super high-res.\nImage: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE\nGoogle also updated Google Photos with a few new features, including fun editing tools and filters.\nSome of the new editing features let you go in and really tweak a photo to, say, make skies and water bluer, while maintaining skin tones. It's really powerful stuff, and Google says it's only possible using its machine learning to isolate parts of a photo.\nNew photo editing features.\nImage: raymond wong/mashable\nThe new filters like \"Bazaar\" and \"Modena\" are designed to replicate old film stock.\nFor \"Movies\" in Photos, there's a new \"Lullaby\" montage template that auto-creates a short video out of photos of your baby sleeping and sets it to a slow lullaby.\nGoogle says there are more of these video montage templates planned. A Christmas template that'll create a \"holiday tradition\" video of past Christmases will roll out in December, a template to celebrate pets will come out in April in time for National Pet Day and one for celebrating the outdoors will arrive for Earth Day.\nLike all of the auto-generated Google Photo Movies, users will have up to 25 days to save them before they expire.\nAnd lastly, Google's made it easier to share photos from everyone's devices with Google Photos. You can now send a batch of photos to friends and family via email, text or a messaging app. Recipients will receive a link with thumbnails of the photos sent and they can add their own photos to the shared folder you created.\nSharing photos via Google Photos is easier now.\nImage: raymond wong/mashable",

      "title": "Google unveils new plans for its London HQ",
      "text": "When Google spent upwards of $1.6 billion securing prime land near King's Cross station , it immediately set out plans for a new London HQ. They included a rooftop running track, swimming pool and interior cycling ramps, but it didn't take long for the project to be canned , with the search giant saying it wanted to \"challenge ourselves to do something even better.\" Fast forward three years and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is town to recommit to its London campus, unveiling new ideas for its first \"wholly designed\" building outside of the US in the process.\nThe purpose-built ten story building was designed by Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG). It'll span 650,000 square feet, making up more than half of the company's complete King Cross campus. The artist render above gives an impression of what Google has planned, with floor-to-ceiling windows that let in lots of natural light and space for multi-level meeting rooms. Google currently occupies one 380,000 sq. ft. development at 6 Pancras Square and will move into a second leased building, currently under construction, in 2018.\n\"Here in the UK, it's clear to me that computer science has a great future with the talent, educational institutions, and passion for innovation we see all around us,\" says Pichai. \"We are committed to the UK and excited to continue our investment in our new King's Cross campus.\"",

Google is looking to stand out by virtue of its per-minute billing, rather by the hour, and its variety of GPUs available:the Nvidia Tesla P100 and Tesla K80 and AMD FirePro S9300 x2.\nThis cloud infrastructure can be used for a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning. This is on top of Google’s custom-made tensor processing units (TPUs) , which will be powering Google’s Cloud Vision application programming interface (API) .\nAlso today Google announced the formation of a new cloud machine learning and artificial intelligence unit at during a media briefing at a Google office in San Francisco.\nGoogle cloud chief Diane Greene named the two leaders of the group: Jia Li, the former head of research at Snapchat , and Fei-Fei Li, the former head of Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Lab and also the person behind the ImageNet image recognition data set and competition. As Greene pointed out, both of the leaders are women, but they’re also respected figures in the artificial intelligence field.\nAlso today Google’s cloud division is launching a new Cloud Jobs (API).\nDeveloping…. \nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Reddit \nGoogle Photos is getting a number of updates today that improve the editing experience through machine learning and more manual controls. Additionally, a standalone PhotoScan app for iOS allows you to digitize your old physical prints with just your phone’s camera. \nGoogle notes that a majority of old photos exist as physical copies that would be a huge hassle to manually scan. The PhotoScan app digitizes old prints by just using your smartphone’s camera. Of course, the end result is not as sharp as a scanner, but it is better than just taking a picture thanks to automatic cropping, rotating, and color correction. \nPhotoScan automatically opens up the camera and positions four dots over a physical photo. You just simply move your phone across the four points and once complete can immediately move on to another photo. \nThere is an option to automatically upload to Google Photos, but captured images can just be saved to the camera roll or be shared with another app. \nGoogle Photos is also getting a number of new photo editing features. The editor has more granular controls in the form of sliders for Light and Color, including: Exposure, Contrast, Whites, Highlights, and Shadows. \nAuto enhance now makes “pro editor” enhancements to photos like balancing exposure and saturation to bring out the details. Filters are no longer applied generically, but rather use machine intelligence to make edits based on the individual photo. Brightness, darkness, warmth, or saturation is taken into account before applying each of the 12 styles., \nThese enhancements to the photo editor are rolling out to mobile now, with Photo Scan available later today on iOS .

She is also well-known for her work in computer vision and had joined Snapchat in early 2015 after spending three years leading the Visual Computing and Learning Group at Yahoo Labs. \nSnap and Google could not immediately be reached for comment. \nDeveloping...",

      "text": "Videos \nGoogle is big into machine learning, and one of the product areas that's benefiting from that is photography. You may recall Google said it would use math to fix lens flair on the Pixel, and now it's rolling out a photo scanning app that seems to do something similar. The new PhotoScan app will let you turn your old printed photos into digital ones with the power of computational photography. Plus, the editing tools in Photos are getting better. It's weird that PhotoScan isn't just part of Photos, but Google loves multiple apps. \nPhotoScan uses your device's camera to scan physical photos, but it's not just snapping a single photo and processing it. PhotoScan has you move the phone around so it can see the photo from multiple angles. It's able to pick out \"feature points\" as anchors as it assembles the frames into a full photo. This also lets it mathematically remove the glare from reflected light on the photo. There's a video that explains the whole process in more detail below. \nIf you need to make some tweaks to your scanned photos (or any photos), improved editing tools are rolling out in the Photos app today. There's a new auto-enhance option, new filters, and \"advanced\" editing tools. Auto mode is pretty self-explanatory—it makes photos look more accurate. If you want something stylish, there are 12 new filters that leverage machine learning to mesh better with each individual photo. As for those advanced editing controls, you can control the exposure, contrast, white level, highlights, and shadows. \nThe new Photos editing tools will start showing up today, but it's not clear if an update is necessary. The PhotoScan app is available right now on iOS and Android . We've also got the APK if you want to sideload it.",

      "text": "Top: Original, Bottom: RAISR super-resolved 2x, Image: Google Upsampling techniques to create larger versions of low-resolution images have been around for a long time – at least as long as TV detectives have been asking computers to 'enhance' images . Common linear methods fill in new pixels using simple and fixed combinations of nearby existing pixel values, but fail to increase image detail. The engineers at Google's research lab have now created a new way of upsampling images that achieves noticeably better results than the previously existing methods.\nRAISR (Rapid and Accurate Image Super-Resolution) uses machine learning to train an algorithm using pairs of images, one low-resolution, the other with a high pixel count. RAISR creates filters that can recreate image detail that is comparable to the original, when applied to each pixel of a low-resolution image. Filters are trained according to edge features that are found in specific small areas of images, including edge direction, edge strength and how directional the egde is. The training process with a database of 10000 image pairs takes approximately an hour. \nOnce RAISR has been trained it is capable of selecting the most appropriate filter for each pixel in a given low-resolution image to fill in new pixels in order to create a higher-resolution version. RAISR can also remove aliasing artifacts, such as moiré patterns or jagged lines in the low-resolution images when creating the larger version, something that linear methods are not capable of doing.\nEventually, Google may be able to use the technology to upsample images that are sent at mobile bandwidth-friendly resolutions. More information on RAISR is available on the Google Research Blog .\n Left: Original, Right: RAISR super-resolved 3x, Image. Google",

      "text": "Google’s Cloud Platform will get GPU machines in early 2017 Posted DJI-produced short film puts the new Inspire 2 gorgeously through its paces \nGoogle’s Cloud Machine Learning service launched earlier this year and, already, the company is calling it one of its “fastest growing product areas.” Today, the company is announcing a number of new features for Cloud Machine Learning users and developers who want to run their own machine learning workloads in Google’s cloud. \nUnlike its competitors, like AWS and Azure, Google never offered developers access to virtual machines with high-end graphics processing units (GPUs). Machine learning (as well as a number of other specialized workloads, mostly in the sciences) heavily depends on GPUs to power the core algorithms that have made this technique so successful. \nSadly, you’ll have to wait a bit before you can get started with running your own machine-learning workloads on the Google Cloud Platform. These new GPU-centric machines won’t launch until early 2017. Until then, Google won’t release pricing either. \nIt’s a bit of a puzzle to me why Google didn’t previously offer this kind of machine, especially given its own focus on machine learning and the fact that its competitors like Azure (which signed a partnership with OpenAI earlier today) and AWS already offered it. \nEven then, you will still be able to use Google’s existing Cloud Machine Learning service (in combination with TensorFlow ) to build your own deep learning models, of course, but having full access to these new servers will add dimension of flexibility to Google’s existing services that isn’t currently available on its platform. \nWhile Google offers its service for building custom machine-learning models, it also provides developers with a number of pre-trained models for machine vision, speech-to-text conversion, translations and extracting information from text. Thanks to its own advances in machine learning — and the fact that it now even builds its own custom chips, Google today announced that it is reducing the price for using the Cloud Vision API by around 80 percent. In addition, the service is also getting better at detecting company logos, landmarks and other objects. \nWith this update, the Cloud Natural Language API for extracting information from text is coming out of beta today. The service now also features improved syntax analysis, which allows it to detect text features like number, gender, person and tense. Google says the Natural Language API is now also able to recognize more entities (and with higher accuracy) and offers improved sentiment analysis. \nGoogle’s translation services for consumers also now uses Google’s custom chips, and today the company is bringing this capability to developers with the launch of a Premium edition of the Cloud Translation API (previously known as the Google Translate API). This API supports eight languages (English to Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish) and 16 language pairs, with more languages coming in the future. For these languages, the new premium API promises to reduce errors by 55 to 85 percent. \nGoogle argues that this new API is meant for long-form translations, while its existing “standard edition” service, which is available for 100 languages, is meant for short, real-time conversational text. \nCompletely new to the platform is the Cloud Jobs API. This is a bit of an odd one, because it’s a highly specialized API that helps businesses better match jobs to candidates. The API looks at job titles, skill and other signals to match job seekers to the right positions. Dice and CareerBuilder have already experimented with the API to potentially improve their own services (which often depend on basic searches more than anything else). This new API is now in limited alpha. 0",

Today, Google revealed PhotoScan, a new stand alone app that’s designed to help those old photos move into your smartphone, tablet or cloud account.\nSee also: Best Photo Editor Apps for Android September 10, 2016 Here’s how Google itself describes the app:\nPhotoScan gets you great looking digital copies in seconds – it detects edges, straightens the image, rotates it to the correct orientation, and removes glare. Scanned photos can be saved in one tap to Google Photos to be organized, searchable, shared, and safely backed up at high quality—for free.Google’s Nat and Lo YouTube page offers a quick introduction to the PhotoScan app. At the time of this writing, it is not yet available for download via the Google Play Store, but we will update this post when it goes live.\n\nIn addition, the current Google Photos app is rolling out an update that adds some new image editing features. One of them lets users tap a button to see instant auto enhancements for a photo to help balance its exposure and saturation. Google is also adding 12 image filters that can be individually used with a photo with this update.\nFinally, Google Photos will allow users to make more advanced light and color changes to images with sliders that can alter contrast, shadows, exposure and more. Again, this app update should be available for every Android user in the next few days.\nGet it at Google Play ",

      "text": "Google unveils new phone, VR headset, and Chromecast Google wants to make it easy to digitize all your old baby pics and awkward prom photos. The company launched PhotoScan on Tuesday, a new app that uses your phone to scan old photos and save them online. It's now available for iOS and Android. \nPhotoScan has a fairly straightforward point-and-shoot interface. Place your phone's camera in front a photo, and you'll see four dots on top of the photo. Simply hold the circle you see on the screen over the four dots, and PhotoScan automatically detects edges to crop the photo, rotates, and removes the glare. \nThough you don't need to log in to Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) to use PhotoScan, you can upload photos from the app directly to Google Photos if you have an account. Google Photos provides free, unlimited photo storage (and full-size, high-resolution unlimited photo storage if you have a Pixel phone). \nRelated: Google unveils its Pixel smartphone and VR headset \nGoogle's photo service already provides a robust suite of editing tools, and in September, it debuted an automated way to make movies based on \"creative concepts,\" for instance, automatic videos of your child growing up. \n\nAlong with PhotoScan, Google Photos is releasing more advanced editing tools on Tuesday. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco)   2:48 PM ET",

Among Donald Trump's reported top picks for his administration are Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton.

Image: People pose with laptops in front of projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken in Zenica Fake news has been at the center of a national discussion over the past week, with some accusing Facebook of swaying voters by allowing misinformation on its widely read News Feed, such as the viral post that incorrectly stated the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump. Another post claimed actor Denzel Washington \"backs Trump in the most epic way possible.\"\nMany Americans — 62 percent to be exact — get some news from social media, according to the Pew Research Center. Of that group, 18 percent say they do so \"often.\"\nBut Zuckerberg said the amount of fake news on Facebook is minuscule — though it's not always easy to separate fact from fiction. Some websites post incendiary headlines and have internet addresses that, at first glance, may trick readers into thinking they're reading a story from a legitimate news outlet.\n\"Fake news has become more predominant because the barriers to creating a website and articles are much lower,\" Thales Teixeira, a professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in the \"economics of attention,\" told NBC News.\n© A fake news story posted by \"American News\" on Facebook suggests that Denzel Washington is supportin... Image: Fake news Some register a domain name similar to a legitimate news outlet but add a different suffix, hoping readers won't notice and will think it's a reputable news source.\n\"What has happened with Facebook is they have reduced the exposure of the brand, who wrote the article,\" Teixeira said. \"An article is one in a million. Giving back a little prominence [to major news outlets] is one way to reduce this issue.\"\nAlthough Facebook has always had a policy banning misleading advertisements, the social network made it clearer this week by specifically stating that fake news sites don't meet its criteria for publishers.\nRelated: It Won't Be Easy To Fix Facebook's Fake News Problem\n\"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook representative told NBC News. \"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\"\nWhile Facebook has felt the most heat for the fake news issue, Google is also working on a policy update to ensure its advertising network doesn't serve ads on fake news sites.\n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" a Google representative told NBC News.\nFacebook Under Fire\nMark Zuckerberg has publicly addressed the fake news issue and its possible influence on the election twice over the past week.\nIn a Facebook post on Sunday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated that although News Feed isn't perfect, it would be \"pretty crazy\" to say it swayed the election.\nRelated: What Does Zuckerberg Say About Claims Facebook Influenced the Election?\nWith less than 1 percent of stories being deemed \"hoaxes,\" and only a portion of those political, Zuckerberg said it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\n\"We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\nNews Feed relies on various signals, including user feedback, to determine which posts may contain inaccurate information and to then reduce their distribution.\nWhile it's unclear what concrete steps Facebook plans to take in addition to this, Zuckerberg said they'll have to walk a delicate path moving forward to ensure they're not stifling differences of opinion.\n\"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,\" he wrote.\n© Facebook's trending topics image: Facebook news feed Go to MSN Home",

      "text": "Google's WiFi mesh router is now available for pre-order It's set to ship on December 6th. Share Save \nGoogle announced on Tuesday that the home mesh network it debuted back in October , Google WiFi , is now available for pre-order. This system replaces your single router with Eero-style access points. Each of these individual nodes acts as a signal relay which reduces WiFi dead zones throughout your house. \nGoogle WiFi is available as a single, $129 unit for apartments and small homes (500-1,500 square feet) or as a $300 3-pack that covers up to 3,000 - 4,500 square feet. The system employs Google's Network Assist software to ensure you're always running on the fastest connection. It also offers vocal cues and advice for optimizing the individual nodes' positions. \nThe WiFi bundles are available through Google Store , Amazon , Best Buy and Walmart . According to a Droid Life report, they should begin shipping on December 6th.",

One router is priced at $129, but Google is also selling three of the routers in one package for $299. That should allow for up to 4,500 square feet of WiFi coverage in a bigger home or office.\nGoogle WiFi will also come with what the company calls Network Assist, which is supposed to optimize the signal in the background, along with allowing users with more than one router on the network to transition between WiFI signals seamlessly. The company will release its own Google Wifi app that will allow users to share the local network password with guests, while also offering some Internet parental control features for families with kids.\nIn addition to the Google Store, you can pre-order Google WiFi routers at Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. You will still have a while to wait before you can get your hands on one; shipments are expected to begin on December 6.\nWill you be checking out Google’s latest hardware product?\nPre-order at Google Store Pre-order at Best Buy Pre-order at Amazon Pre-order at Walmart ",

      "title": "Google Releases App to Digitize Boxes of Old Photo Prints",
      "text": "Google Releases App to Digitize Boxes of Old Photo Prints By anick jesdanun, ap technology writer NEW YORK  Nov 15, 2016, 1:57 PM ET 0 Shares Email Google wants to make digitizing your many boxes of old photo prints as easy as opening an app. The PhotoScan app for iPhones and Android phones will use the phone's camera to capture an old photo in four sections and stitch them together, much like a panorama shot. Google says this approach helps eliminate glare that can mar attempts to digitize a print by simply photographing the whole photo. The app will make minor adjustments to restore color in faded photos and to aligned corners when the photo print is bent. Julia Winn, a product manager for the new app, said scanning photos with traditional scanners takes time, while third-party digitizing services cost money and require you to part with your photos temporarily, risking loss and damage. The free app, released Tuesday, will work with photos on a table, a picture frame and an album. It will also digitize slides when projected on a wall. Winn said the resolution of the digitized photo will be comparable to that from a flatbed scanner. You can store digitized versions on your phone or the online Google Photos service, which has unlimited storage for photos of up to 16 megapixels. Other photo features announced Tuesday include: — The main Google Photos app is getting additional editing controls. There are new filters for those who like automation and more granular controls for those who prefer manual editing. The new manual options include \"deep blue\" to give skies and water more color, without oversaturating the rest of the photo, and \"skin tone\" to adjust only the colors on skins. — The service will also automatically generate additional types of video highlights, with background music, from your collection of photos and videos. The service initially organized images only around location and date. It recently started creating reels following a kid growing up. A new type, called lullaby, will gather shots from a newborn's initial days. Coming next month: Christmas shots and happy moments from 2016. Pets and outdoor videos are coming in 2017. 0 Shares",

Posted 16 Nov 2016 04:55 Google and Facebook cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites. (AFP/Josh Edelson) A \nWASHINGTON: Google and Facebook moved on Tuesday (Nov 15) to cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites, acting after criticism of the role fake news played in the US presidential election. \n\"We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,\" a Google statement to AFP said. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.\" \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC the matter was \"a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.\" \nFacebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. \n\"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook statement said. \n\"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\" \nGoogle's Pichai said there should be \"no situation where fake news gets distributed\" and committed to making improvements. \n\"I don't think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,\" he said. \nThe electoral victory of Donald Trump has sparked heightened scrutiny of online and social media, especially the role of bogus news that appeared to help rally Trump supporters. \nSome news stories which went viral included headlines such as \"Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected\" and \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.\" \nOn Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Trump won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70 News - contradicting official results tallied so far by states - said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the Electoral College to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. - AFP/de",

The company announced the thing at the same event it debuted the Pixel and its Daydream headset, so no one spent all that much time talking about the new new home networking hardware. \nIf you weren’t privy to the news, by way of refresher, the simply named WiFi is Google’s take on devices like Eero or Luma, designed to improve the wireless signal throughout a home by being scattered out around the abode. As such, the system will be available as as a standalone or in a pack of three – though there’s some benefit to simply having one around. \nIn fact, the company only recommends multiples for space over 1,500 square feet. Aside from creating a mesh network, the little devices also feature software designed to limit congestion by switching between channels and optimizing speeds by toggling through the 2.4 and 5GHz bands based on location. \nGoogle WiFi is up for pre-order now at $129 or a single device and $299 for a three-fer. It’s expected to release December 6. 0",

Well now you can digitize all of them with ease thanks to Google.\nThe team behind Google Photos today unveiled its latest endeavor: PhotoScan. The highlight of a number of new improvements to Google Photos, PhotoScan essentially acts as a modern day scanner and employs your device's built-in camera to take a \"picture of a picture\" and store it digitally. Best of all, though? The app automatically eliminates any glare that your lights cast on the photos before saving the scans to your camera roll. Once saved, you can then upload your old photos to Google Photos or any other cloud service of your choice.\nSee it in action above and put it to the test now, free of charge, for both iOS and Android .\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Google’s AI Experiments help you understand neural networks by playing with them Posted Google’s WiFi router is now up for pre-order \nGoogle’s work in machine learning and artificial intelligence is often interesting, but it can be a bit academic. People like to get their hands on these things — as much as you can, anyway, with something intangible. To that end, Google is collecting a bunch of little demonstrations of this emerging category of tech in its AI Experiments showcase . \nThe idea is simply to let people fool around with example of machine learning, or download the code themselves to see how it works. Right now there are 8 items available to look at, 4 of which are immediately available to interact with on the web: \nGiorgio Cam (best on mobile), which identifies objects seen by the device’s camera and hypes them up in a rhyming fashion. Trap airhorn warning. \nQuick, Draw! Basically has you playing Pictionary with a sketch recognition engine. You’ll be contributing to its training by drawing barns, school buses, lamps, etc. \nInfinite Drum Machine has sounds gathered by similarity, which you can select and sequence. Shuffle actually produces some pretty hot beats reminiscent of Matmos or Mira Calix. Maybe this is how they do it. (Warning, alarming din when you drag around.) \nBird Sounds. Does what it says on the tin. Bird calls organized by AI based on things like rhythm, tone, and so on. Probably won’t help you find that one you always hear outside your window, but it’s better than the bird guides that literally just spell it out. (Sounds like poo-tee-weet ?) \nOthers you can download or just watch examples of — I like the idea of the AI duet, for instance, which attempts to mimic and extend your style of keyboard playing. And the Thing Translator, which identifies and gives the translated word for whatever you show it, looks practical. \nCheck out the rest of the experiments here , and check back later as well — it’s open for submissions so more will likely appear over time. 0 ",

      "text": "NEW YORK • Google has said it will ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service, a decision that comes as concerns mount over the effect online hoaxes may have had on the United States presidential election.\nThe decision relates to the Goo- gle AdSense system that independent Web publishers use to display advertising on their sites, generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on. The advertisers pay Google, and Google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers.\nMore than two million publishers use Google's advertising network. For some time, Google has had policies in place prohibiting misleading advertisements from its system, including promotions for counterfeit goods and weight-loss scams.\nGoogle's new policy, which it said would go into effect \"imminently\", will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on.\n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content or the primary purpose of the Web property,\" Ms Andrea Faville, a Google spokesman, said in a statement on Monday.\nShe said the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to a growing debate over the past week about whether fake news stories had influenced the outcome of the presidential election.\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's surprise victory in the election has sent shock waves across Silicon Valley. Mr Geoff Lewis, an investor with venture firm Founders Fund, pinned some of the blame for the results on the tech industry on Sunday, arguing that social media sites had grown too cloistered.\nFacebook has been at the epicentre of that debate, accused by some commentators of swinging some voters in favour of Mr Trump through misleading and outright false stories that spread quickly via the social network. One such false story claimed that Pope Francis had endorsed Mr Trump.\nMr Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has played down the role of fake news in the election. In a post on his Facebook page over the weekend, he said that 99 per cent of what people see on the site is authentic, and only a tiny amount of it is fake news and hoaxes.\n\"Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other,\" he wrote.\nGoogle, too, faced criticism after last week's election for giving prominence to false news stories. On Sunday, the site Mediaite reported that the top result on a Google search for the words \"final election vote count 2016\" was a link to a story on a website called 70News that falsely stated that Mr Trump, who won the electoral college, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Mrs Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. By Monday evening, the fake story had fallen to the No. 2 position in a search for those terms.\nGoogle says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories on the site. \"The goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\" said Ms Faville. \"In this case, we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\"\nIt remains to be seen how effective Google's new policy on fake news will be in practice. The policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake.\nAlthough satire sites like The Onion are not the target of the policy, it is unclear whether some of them, which often run fake news stories written for humorous effect, will be inadvertently affected by Google's change.\nNYTIMES, BLOOMBERG\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on November 16, 2016, with the headline 'Google cracks down on fake news sites'.

      "text": "Tweet \nThere are plenty of existing methods for digitizing printed photos, and most of them fall on a spectrum between 'arduous with good results' and 'quick with terrible results.' Google's new PhotoScan app aims to aims to bridge the gap with a method that's easy and produces good results by employing computational photography. \nThe free app, available now for Android and iOS , requires the user to place their photo on a flat surface. After snapping a reference frame, the app directs the user to move their phone around the image to capture more data and, critically, move around the glare that the photo is almost certainly reflecting. \nAfter you've made a successful pass, the app will work its magic and spit out a digitized, glare-free rendition of your photo. Images can be saved to your phone's camera roll and to the cloud. In less than a minute, you've got a shareable digital photo that's way better than the quick-and-dirty version. \nDecent scans of instant photos with minimal effort? Sign me up. I scanned these Instax prints with Google's PhotoScan app and they are gloriously glare-free. \nThe app analyzes your photo and identifies reference points so it can merge multiple versions of the same image, and compares pixel-level details to judge which image is free of glare. It's based on technology Google and MIT have been developing to help remove unwanted reflections and obstructions from photos. \nThe app automatically crops, straightens and rotates your photo, but you can rotate and adjust the corners after capture if needed. My first few tries show surprisingly good results, with glare nearly totally removed in each image. The app uses your phone's flash to provide illumination, but even so, using better available light produced the nicest results. The results look good enough for social sharing, but if it's high resolution, high quality digital conversions you're after, you'll probably still need to go about it the hard way. \nFor more information you can watch Google's Nat and Lo interview researchers about how it all works.",

      "text": "International Business Google, Facebook take aim at 'fake' news Google and Facebook moved on Tuesday to cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites, acting after criticism of the role fake news played in the US presidential election. Posted 16 Nov 2016 04:55 Updated 16 Nov 2016 05:47 Google and Facebook cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites. (AFP/Josh Edelson) A \nWASHINGTON: Google and Facebook moved on Tuesday (Nov 15) to cut off advertising revenue to fake news sites, after a wave of criticism over the role misinformation played in the US presidential election. \nThe move by the two tech giants aims to choke off funds to an industry fuelled by bogus, often sensational \"news\" circulating online and seen as a potential influence on public opinion. \nA Google statement to AFP said new policies \"will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies.\" \nThe shift will mean Google restricts ads \"on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" the statement said. \nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company receives billions of queries daily and admitted errors had been made. \n\"There have been a couple of incidences where it has been pointed out and we didn't get it right. And so it is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it,\" he said in a BBC interview. \nPichai said there should be \"no situation where fake news gets distributed\" and committed to making improvements. \n\"I don't think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,\" he said. \nOn Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Republican Donald Trump had won the popular vote in addition to the electoral college. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70News - contradicting official results tallied so far by states - said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the electoral college to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. \nEXPLICIT BAN \nFacebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. \n\"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook statement said. \n\"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news.\" \nOne report said Facebook had developed a tool to weed out fake news but did not deploy it before the US election, fearing a backlash from conservatives after a controversy over its handling of \"trending topics.\" Facebook denied the report. \nSome critics have gone so far as to blame Facebook for enabling Trump's victory, saying it did not do enough to curb bogus news that appeared to help rally his supporters. \nStories that went viral in the run-up to the vote included such headlines as \"Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected\" and \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.\" \nThe prevalence of fake news has prompted calls for Facebook to consider itself a \"media\" company rather than a neutral platform, a move which would require it to make editorial judgments on articles. \nFacebook executives have repeatedly rejected this idea, but since the election have pledged to work harder to filter out hoaxes and misinformation. \nIn a weekend post, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion that fake news helped sway the election, and said that \"more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic.\" \nStill, he said that \"we don't want any hoaxes on Facebook\" and pledged to do more to curb fake news without censoring content. \"Identifying the 'truth' is complicated,\" he said. \n\"While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\" \nKen Paulson, a former USA Today editor who is dean at the media school of Middle Tennessee State University, said Facebook and other platforms should not be required to filter out news but that it would be good for business. \n\"My hunch is that most of Facebook's loyal customers would welcome a cleaning up of the town square,\" he said. - AFP/de",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google Adds Artificial Intelligence Hotshots To Lead New Data Crunching Team \nGoogle believes the key to growing its cloud computing business is artificial intelligence. \nThe search giant said Tuesday that it had hired two high-profile AI researchers to lead a new machine learning unit that’s part of its Google Cloud business. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that generally refers to training computers to recognize patterns amid tons of data. The two new hires are Fei-Fei Li, the director of Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab; and Jia Li, the head of research for Snap, the parent company of popular social messaging app Snapchat. \nThe two women are considered by analysts to be experts in the field of computer vision, a subset of artificial intelligence that involves teaching computers to recognize objects in images. \nSpeaking at a press event Tuesday in San Francisco, Google’s goog head of cloud Diane Greene explained that the new hires are part of Google’s effort to formalize an artificial intelligence group into its business. Instead of focusing on only AI research, the team would work on incorporating cutting-edge data crunching into various Google Cloud products like its software that businesses can use to predict sales . Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nGreene said the new hires represent the “world’s leading research scientists, practitioners, and leaders” in the hot field of artificial intelligence. Companies like Google, Facebook fb , and IBM ibm are investing millions of dollars in AI-related technologies like deep learning that have made it possible for computers to more quickly perform data-heavy tasks like translating text into multiple languages. \nGreene said that “one of the most thrilling things” about the new hires is that both of them are women. The field of AI has been criticized for its lack of women in prominent research roles at universities as well as at major technology companies. \nIn a Bloomberg News article earlier this summer, Li commented on the dearth of women in AI, saying, “If you were a computer and read all the AI articles and extracted out the names that are quoted, I guarantee you that women rarely show up.” For more about Google , watch: \nLi helped create the popular ImageNet computer-vision contest, which helped spur AI researchers to use cutting-edge data crunching techniques like deep learning to identify objects in photographs. \nJia Li will start work at Google after the Thanksgiving holiday and Fei-Fei Li will start at the beginning of 2017, according to a Google spokesperson. \nRob Craft, the group product manager at Google cloud and its machine learning unit, said that the two new hires will help Google “bring machine learning to the rest of the product categories.” He explained that the new hires are part of Google’s efforts to more effectively bridge together its research unit and its core business. \nBut hiring the appropriate talent with expertise in machine learning and related tasks does not come cheap. \nCraft said the competition for hiring A.I. experts is fierce and in many cases ends up resulting in companies like Google paying “NFL signing bonuses” for the talent. Google did not say how much it is paying the two new hires. \nPart of the reason for the competition is that there are only so many A.I. workers available and that “the universities aren’t graduating PhD level” candidates as fast as Google would like, Craft said.

He made the announcement during a speech at its current London office, which is located in King’s Cross. The new office expansion will be built next to the current building. It will be 10 stories high and have 650,000 square feet of space. It will ultimately cost Google £1 billion to build.\nThe company will continue to work from its current offices, and another building, which began construction earlier this year, will be occupied by Google, but not owned, in 2018. The new expansion announced today will be both occupied and owned by the company.\nThere were some worries that the UK’s upcoming “Brexit” departure from the European Union might cause some delays in the company’s plans but Pichai indicated today that Google remains committed to staying in the country and will continue to invest in its London offices.",

      "text": "| Google+ | LinkedIn | Twitter \nCOLUMBUS — A throwback college apparel retailer is moving forward. \nI sat down with Amanda Sima , founder of Columbus-based Alma Mater LLC, for a story in this week’s Friday print edition and wrote about her business aspirations for the next year, which include new licenses, products and sales channels. \n“In 12 months we’re going to be an eight-figure company,” she told me. \nAlma Mater's sales are in the six-figures today as a designer and wholesaler of vintage-style sweaters and other college apparel, which skews toward the neglected segment of the woman shopper. The company has a roster of more than 80 college licenses, including from Ohio State University. The company wholesales to retailers – most notably Amazon.com and Fanatics.com – and does not sell direct to consumers, though Sima said that will change in the future. \nCheck out this week’s story to see where Alma Mater is headed, but for how Sima got here, read on: \nWhat did you do before Alma Mater? \nI was on the fundraising side of politics. Right out of college I worked on my first gubernatorial campaign. I worked at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. I worked out on my own. So at a young age, I was my own boss in that respect. In 2008, I was in between jobs when I started Alma Mater . It was a part-time, totally entrepreneurial idea. I didn’t go to school for textiles. In fact, I went to Ohio State for history and thought I’d go to law school or maybe be a lobbyist, but I had this idea. I literally pulled a vintage Ohio State sweater piece from my grandmother’s basement. She loves when I tell that story, but it’s true. It’s a really cool piece. It’s comfortable. It’s stylish. I started looking into it and I saw it’s an antiquated category. Page 1",

      "text": "Google And Facebook To Ban Fake News From Ad Networks © Infowars / Facebook Google And Facebook To Ban Fake News From Ad Networks Trending News: Google, Facebook To Crack Down On Fake News Sites Shares Long Story Short \nGoogle and Facebook have both announced plans to ban fake news sites from using their advertising networks. The move comes as both companies try to assuage serious and mounting criticism over the role their sites played in disseminating fake, usually pro-Trump news during the election campaign. Long Story \nBy trying to hit them where it hurts most — their bottom line — tech giants Google and Facebook are banning fake news sites from using their critically important advertising networks. \nThe proliferation of fake news sites, many of them pro-Trump , became a serious issue during and immediately after the election, with many critics blaming the sites for not doing enough to halt the misinformation campaigns. \nAccording to Reuters , Google said it is working on a policy change to prevent websites that misrepresent their content from using their AdSense network; Facebook is updating its advertising policies against the dissemination of misleading or deceptive content to include fake news. But Facebook won’t touch fake news stories shared by users, and Google’s change won’t stop fake news stories, such as those claiming Donald Trump won the popular vote , from appearing in its search results. Buzzfeed News \nFake news is designed to resound in reader echo chambers and appeal to Google and Facebook algorithms. A hysterical, clickbait-y headline will get a click and send users to a site that, as BuzzFeed News reported recently , may very well have been created by a bunch of teenagers in Macedonia. The more the article is shared, reacted to and commented on, the bigger the cut its creators receive. \nFacebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has been forced to state repeatedly that the social networking site didn’t play a significant role in the election or its final result and stated that he believes that “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic…. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes.” \nFacebook also came under fire when it removed human editors and automated its Trending News feed this summer, a move many believe helped the spread of fake news stories. \nGoogle uses a combination of AI algorithms and humans to monitor and review sites hoping to be or are already a part of AdSense. The company knows a lot is at stake, and is jealously guarding its reputation out of fear that legitimate publishers and advertisers will be angry at seeing their brands damaged by appearing near dubious news sources. Own The Conversation Ask The Big Question \nDo we need to teach people how to read the news, just so they can have the critical faculties to separate the real from the fake? Drop This Fact \nEven semi-legit news sources traffic in fake news, according to another BuzzFeed News report from last month. So-called “hyperpartisan” sites like Freedom Daily and Addicting Info regularly publish fake or partially fake news. According to BuzzFeed News’ analysis, the practice is much more acute on right-wing sites: a stunning 38% of articles posted by Freedom Daily, Right Wing News and Eagle Rising were deemed mostly or partially false. On the left, just under 20% of posts by Occupy Democrats, Addicting Info and The Other 98% were mostly or partially false. Today's Hottest Deals",

      "text": "0 COMMENTS FAKE NEWS: After a week of debate over whether fake news influenced the outcome of the presidential election, the two biggest web giants are beginning to crack down on that content. Google and Facebook said they will take steps to prevent fake news sites from generating revenue through their ad-selling services , The Wall Street Journal reports. Google was dragged into the arena after its search engine highlighted a little-known right-wing blog that erroneously claimed Donald Trump won the popular vote, WSJ reports. Google acknowledged the mistake and said it is always working to improve its algorithms. Facebook’s change won’t affect the fake news that appears in users’ feeds, so expect the controversy to continue. Gizmodo reported that the social giant had the chance to remove fake news from news feeds but chose not to when it realized that the necessary update would have disproportionately impacted right-leaning sites. Facebook said it “did not build and withhold any News Feed changes based on their potential impact on any one political party.” Meanwhile, BuzzFeed reports that Facebook employees have formed an unofficial task force to look into the fake news issue at their company.\nAD BUBBLE: Are marketers talking to themselves instead of their customers? The question was on the minds of ad execs and agencies -- many of which skew Democratic -- as they watched the surprising rise to power of Donald Trump. His mass appeal took them by surprise, prompting them to wonder if they’ve been looking at the correct data sources and how they should be studying consumers, reports The New York Times. Advertisers, like many others, “may have found ourselves in bubbles of our own making,” said Publicis Groupe Chief Strategist Rishad Tobaccowala. 360i CEO Sarah Hofstetter emphasized the importance of “social listening” in market research, beyond traditional controlled environments like focus groups, while TBWA/Chiat/Day New York Chief Rob Schwartz said that clients are going to scrutinize not only the data, but also what it tells them about who’s “been to Kansas to understand what they’re consuming in Kansas.” Advertisers aren’t the only ones questioning their own methodologies, and their appeal to Trump supporters. Pollsters that misread consumer sentiment during the election will be on the hook to defend their value to the marketers they also serve, reports Ad Age.\nMEDIA’S PAYDAY: As news outlets face the wrath of President-Elect Donald Trump and contemplate four years in which the White House may be hostile toward the mainstream press, they’re welcoming expressions of support from the public. Especially if it is monetary support. In the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s electoral victory, news organizations saw a bump in subscriptions and donations , reports NiemanLab. Donations for investigative news site ProPublica were “running at about 10 times the rate that we’re used to,” said president Richard Tofel, thanks in part to a donation plea from HBO’s John Oliver. The rate of new subscriptions after the election increased 16% at The Atlantic. At The Wall Street Journal, new subscriber volume got a 300% boost the day after the election, Bloomberg reports. And, despite Mr. Trump’s assertions on Twitter that the New York Times’ subscriptions are down, they’re actually up, the paper Tweeted in response to Mr. Trump on Sunday. Some of this could simply be heightened interest in news after recent events -- and some of it could be the segments of the public rallying to back the fourth estate.\nEND OF AN ERA: As consumers’ media habits change so, too, do the behemoths that control the flow of billions in advertising dollars. At GroupM, one of the largest buyers of media inventory, that means the end of an era as Rino Scanzoni, the legendary ad-buying vet, moves out of his chief investment role , CMO Today reports. He will move into another role overseeing addressable TV and the changing barter business, which essentially helps companies trade distressed assets for media inventory. Lyle Schwartz, GroupM’s managing partner for research and marketplace analysis, will replace him in a lead investment role in North America. The WPP-owned media agency network and its new regime are the latest to reorganize to thrive in a digital media landscape in which ad deals are more reliant on data and technology than handshakes. With the leadership changes also comes the bundling of central digital resources, including search, social and analytics, into a group called platform services. Ad-buying resources will live within another group called investment.\nElsewhere Longtime PBS news anchor and presidential debate moderator Gwen Ifill died at 61 after a battle with cancer. Over three decades, she had a distinguished career at national newspapers like The Washington Post and New York Times, as well as NBC and PBS, while breaking barriers as a black female journalist. Tributes poured in from media heavyweights and political figures. [ Politico , NYT , WaPo ]\nAt the WSJ CEO Council Monday night, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, scolded the media for biased polling. [ WSJ ]\nVeteran Nevada journalist Jon Ralston, known for his accurate predictions of how the state will vote (including in 2016) is launching a nonprofit news organization called The Independent. [ Politico ]\nSnapchat is Foursquare’s latest customer as the photo-sharing app signs on to use the location-based social network’s data. [ Adweek ]\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff said the company backed out of a bid to buy Twitter because shareholders didn’t like it. “If anything, I have to be able to listen, and if I wasn’t listening then I wouldn’t really be the leader that I’m trying to be,” he told Recode. [ Recode ]\nHBO will renew its expensive , fantasy hit Westworld, which to date has averaged 11.7 million viewers per episode, including reruns, VOD and streaming. Divorce and Insecure will also get renewed. [ Variety ]\nAfter a short break from a long career at established media companies, Deadline Hollywood founder Nikki Finke will reemerge as a senior columnist at Mediaite. [ Mediaite ]\nABC has ordered a new series, Marvel’s “The Inhumans.” A version of the first two episodes will premiere in IMAX theaters next summer before the hour-long drama heads to ABC in the fall.

      "text": "share As part of Google’s slew of artificial intelligence announcements today , the company is releasing a number of AI web experiments powered by its cloud services that anyone can go and play with. One — called Quick, Draw! — gives you a prompt to draw an image of a written word or phrase in under 20 seconds with your mouse cursor in such a way that a neural network can identify it. It’s both a hilarious and fascinating exercise with broader implications for how AI can self-learn over time in key AI research areas like image recognition and optical character recognition. Quick, Draw! is a great way to familiarize yourself with how neural networks work to identify objects and text in photos, which is one of the most common forms of AI-guided software techniques we see daily on platform’s like Facebook and Google Photos. As you start to craft the doodle, Quick, Draw!’s software automaton will start yelling out words and phrases it thinks you’re trying to illustrate. As you get closer to the finished product, the voice starts to become a good indication of how your drawing could be misinterpreted as something else. If you’re on point, however, the neural network will hone in on the object and guess correctly. It’s fascinating because it shows just how difficult developing and training this type of technology is. When asked to draw a speedboat, I had to think critically about how a machine intelligence would reasonably differentiate between a sailboat and a speedboat. That meant my doodle couldn’t have a sail or be shaped like a half moon. It could, on the other hand, be relatively boxy and generic so long as the AI understood the object was supposed to be located on the surface of the water. In its post-doodle analysis, Quick, Draw! informed me that it thought my drawing could have been of a shark or a sea turtle. Over time, this neural network will learn from its mistakes and improve as more people play with it. If you’re interested in checking out Quick, Draw! and other Google-powered AI experiments, head on over to the company’s new website . From there, you can choose between a number of new games and exercises created by programmers, artists, and even those without traditional AI and machine learning backgrounds. Google wants its AI Experiments initiative to be a creative play space for anyone to explore, and it’s taking new submissions starting today.",

(CBS) \nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) – Facing criticism over fake news stories that have proliferated during the election season, both Google and Facebook have announced changes to crack down on such sites. \nAccording to The Associated Press, Google announced Monday that it would ban its ad software from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose.” \nAlso on Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook also banned fake news sites from using the company’s advertising network. \n“While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson told the newspaper. \nOn Monday, Google faced scrutiny after users searching for “final election numbers” were led to a fake news site called “70 News” that claimed Donald Trump had won the popular vote over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. To come up with its numbers, 70 News sourced another fake news site that did not have the numbers and laid out its own conspiracy theory on how Trump won the popular vote. \nMultiple news sources, including CBS News , CNN and Fox News have said Clinton continues to have a lead in the popular vote as of Tuesday morning. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote is expected to grow, as votes from California and Washington continue to be counted. \nFacebook is also dealing with criticism of fake campaign stories being shared, along with fake news becoming highlighted on the site’s “Trending Topics” section after human editors were fired in favor of using an algorithm. \nAfter Tuesday’s vote, CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the idea of such stories influencing the outcome of the election. \nTM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Screenshot of Google linking to a fake news story claiming Donald Trump had won the popular vote over Hillary Clinton. (CBS) \nThe erroneous result still showed up for Google users Monday morning. \nFor its numbers, the 70 News blog sources another fake news site that did not have the numbers and laid out its own conspiracy theory on how Trump won the popular vote. \nAs of Monday morning, CBSNews.com , CNN.com and FoxNews.com all had Clinton leading the popular vote over Trump, by a margin of 61 million to 60.3 million. \nClinton’s popular vote lead is expected to grow, as votes from California and Washington continue to be counted, both states Clinton won by double digits. \nFake election-related news has become the source of criticism for social networks, particularly Facebook. After the social network fired human editors for its “Trending Topics” section in favor for an algorithm, the section highlighted a false story on a 9/11 conspiracy theory and another false story claiming that Fox News host Megyn Kelly was fired . \nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said after Tuesday’s vote that fake news on Facebook didn’t influence the election outcome, calling the idea “crazy.”",

      "text": "Google's CEO says fake news could have swung the election Avery Hartmans More (Google CEO Sundar Pichai.AP) Google's CEO has weighed in on the fake-news controversy that many are saying could have affected the presidential election. When the BBC's Kamal Ahmed asked specifically whether fake news might have swung enough votes toward Donald Trump to change the results, Sundar Pichai paused before answering, \"Sure.\" He clarified: \"Look, it is important to remember this was a very close election and so, just for me, so looking at it scientifically, one in a hundred voters voting one way or the other swings the election either way. ... From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.\" Pichai said the company has already taken steps to rid Google of fake news sites and stories. In the past two days, he said, the company has moved to remove Google-served ads from sites promoting fake news, which means fake news platforms can no longer use Google's platform to make money. Over the last year, Google has also been looking at how to fact-check articles and work to promote trusted journalism sources, Pichai said. Shortly after the election, people began blaming Facebook for allowing fake news to be distributed on the site, perhaps contributing to Trump's surprising victory. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he thinks it's \"extremely unlikely\" that Facebook swayed the presidential election, but has acknowledged that the social networking site has work to do when it comes to hoaxes on the platform. But Google has also had issues with inaccurate news sites popping up in search results. For some time on Monday, the top Google search result for \"final election count\" displayed an incorrect tally from a Wordpress blog called 70 News that said Trump won the popular vote by a margin of almost 700,000 votes. In fact, Clinton was ahead in the popular vote by about 700,000 votes at that time.",

      "text": "In an interview with the BBC , Google CEO Sundar Pichai made his first comments on the post-election fake news controversy, and admitted the company has made some mistakes. “We will definitely work to fix it.” \"It is important to remember that we get billions of queries every day,” Pichai told the news organization. “There have been a couple of incidences where it has been pointed out and we didn't get it right. And so it is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.” When the BBC asked Pichai about the potential effects of fake news on the election, he said “there is a lot of discussion” about social media’s role, but added that he was “not fully sure” about the effects. \"Look, it is important to remember this was a very close election and so, just for me, so looking at it scientifically, one in a hundred voters voting one way or the other swings the election either way,” Pichai said, according to the BBC. \"So, when you talk about such narrow margins, obviously there are many, many contributing factors and so I think there is enormous debate because of that — I am not fully sure what caused this.\" This week, Google began surfacing a conspiracy blog in response to the query “who won the popular vote.” The company also announced yesterday that it will remove fake news sources from its ad network. (Facebook quickly made a similar move .) “I think fake news as a whole could be an issue.” Pichai’s comments follow statements from Mark Zuckerberg, who, when faced with a similar question, first said it was “crazy” to think fake news on Facebook had an influence. He later made the claim that \"99 percent of what people see is authentic.” “Given those tight margins [in the election],” BBC reporter Kamal Ahmed went on to suggest to Pichai in the interview, “fake news could have affected some people’s vote, and maybe enough people’s vote, to affect the outcome.” “Sure, I think fake news as a whole could be an issue,” Pichai replied. “From our perspective, there should just be no situation in which fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.” More From The Verge",

      "text": "Google just made a major upgrade to its Translate app.\nThe company is now using a new technology called neural machine translation — which aims to make computer-generated translations more similar to those done by humans — to power its translations in seven new languages. Google says the update should make translations in those languages much more accurate and easier to understand.\nSEE ALSO: Artificially intelligent robot can teach humans ping pong\nThe company previously rolled out this technology for Chinese to English translations in September . Now, Google is using the same technology to power translations to and from English in French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. These languages, along with Chinese, make up more than a third of all translations on Google Translate, the company says.\nAt first glance, the Translate app won't look any different than before. Where users will notice the difference, though, is in the quality of the translations. That's because rather than translating sentences and phrases word by word, the machine learning technology allows the app to translate entire sentences at once. This results in a translation that's much more accurate and more similar to how humans actually speak. You can see the difference in action in the image below.\nImage: google\n\"With this update, Google Translate is improving more in a single leap than we’ve seen in the last ten years combined,\" Google's product lead for Translate, Barak Turovsky, wrote in a blog post . During a press event at Google's San Francisco office on Tuesday, Turovsky said the company hopes to eventually use the same technology to power translations for all of the languages Translate supports.\nThe Translate app isn't the only place where Google is using artificial intelligence to make translations better. The company also showed off a new experimental app called \"Thing Translator\" that can recognize objects you point a smartphone camera at and translate them into different languages.\nGoogle's experimental \"Thing Translator,\" one of company's news \"AI experiments,\" can detect objects and translate them pic.twitter.com/YaD1EHiwx5\n— Karissa Bell (@karissabe) November 15, 2016\nPart of Google's new AI Experiments , the app uses Google's computer vision software as well as Google Translate APIs.\nDuring its event Tuesday, Google also announced two major new hires who together will run the company's machine -learning business: Fei-Fei Li, who previously ran the Artificial Intelligence Lab at Stanford, and Jia Li, who was head of research at Snapchat-maker Snap Inc.",

      "text": "Google, Facebook choke ‘fake’ news sites of ads Agence France-Presse / 07:55 AM November 16, 2016 Google and Facebook are cutting off advertising to so-called ‘fake news’ sites. Photo shows a Facebook post that asked if news that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump was true. The report has been proven false. FACEBOOK SCREENGRAB \nWASHINGTON, United States — Google and Facebook moved Tuesday to cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites, acting after criticism of the role fake news played in the US presidential election. \n“We’ve been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,” a Google statement to AFP said. \n“Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” ADVERTISEMENT \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC the matter was “a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.” \nFacebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. \n“In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” a Facebook statement said. \n“While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” \n“Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” \nGoogle’s Pichai said there should be “no situation where fake news gets distributed” and committed to making improvements. \n“I don’t think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,” he said. \nThe electoral victory of Donald Trump has sparked heightened scrutiny of online and social media, especially the role of bogus news that appeared to help rally Trump supporters. \nSome news stories which went viral included headlines such as “Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected” and “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.” \nOn Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Trump won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70 News — contradicting official results tallied so far by states — said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the Electoral College to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort.

      "text": "Google says its Translate app now spits back more natural translations.\nPhoto by Google World travelers, language nerds and everyone in between, you're in luck.\nGoogle said Tuesday it has vastly improved its Google Translate app, available on phones and the web.\nThe search giant said it's now incorporating \"neural machine translation\" into the software, which means it can translate whole sentences at a time, instead of breaking the text down to smaller chunks and translating those pieces.\nThe result is translations coming out more natural, with better syntax and grammar, Google said.\n\"It has improved more in one single leap than in 10 years combined,\" Barak Turovsky, the product lead for Google Translate, said during a press event at Google's San Francisco office.\nBesides English, the new translation system is coming to eight of the 103 languages supported by the app. They are French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. Google says those languages represent 35 percent of all translations done on the service. Turovsky said the new method cuts down on errors by 55 to 85 percent.\nGoogle has bet the future of the company on artificial intelligence and machine learning -- a type of technology in which computers can learn without being explicitly programmed. Last month, the company unveiled several new consumer devices that feature a digital helper Google calls \"the assistant,\" similar to Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. But Google bills it as the natural evolution of its iconic search box, drawing on the reams of data Google knows about you. Instead of typing a search query into a text box at your desktop computer, you'll speak commands to your phone, watch or smart home hub.\nWhen Google CEO Sundar Pichai first introduced the concept of the assistant in May, he said it was the cornerstone of Google's \"journey\" to becoming an \"AI-first\" company.\nThe search giant isn't the only Silicon Valley giant that has made big investments in machine learning recently. Earlier this year, Facebook started an Applied Machine Learning division, where it works on technology like photo and audio recognition.\nGoogle on Tuesday also said it's forming a Cloud Machine Learning group, which will focus on bringing its AI technology to other businesses. The group will be headed by Fei-Fei Li, an AI professor at Stanford, and Jia Li, former head of research at Snap, the parent company of Snapchat.\nOne of the group's new projects aims to improve how job listings are categorized. One customer is FedEx, and the new service lets a job seeker more easily search for a warehouse job, even if the job title or or description doesn't have the word \"warehouse\" in it. (For example, \"Fork lift operator 3rd shift.)\nDiane Greene, who leads the company's cloud division, summed up the goal: \"Google takes machine learning in every form and takes it to the world.\"",

For instance, one person on Reddit , after seeing this video shared this story:\n\" On my kid's 3rd birthday, Google Photos presented me with a short video titled 'they grow up so fast' compiled of photos and video clips from her entire life, from birth until the day before, highlighting birthdays and whatnot. It just knows those pictures are birthday pictures, and it knows these pictures are all the same baby, from a newborn all the way to a 3 year old. It is amazing.\"\nThe Photos app is cool, and the PhotoScan app seems useful.\nBut the video explaining the app is one of the best we've seen. If you are in need of a bit of a laugh (and these days, who isn't?), do yourself a favor and spend 1:45 watching it.\nSEE ALSO: Bill Maher thought up Apple's next product: the iDefender SEE ALSO: Inside the world of fake Facebook events that dupe and disappoint people NOW WATCH: How to choose the best cut of steak — according to Anthony Bourdain Loading video...

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Facebook and Google Still Resist Calling Themselves Media Companies \nWho are America’s media powers today? The election has put that question at the center of the news, but the answer applies far more broadly. For any leader in any field, understanding today’s most influential media players is crucial. Call them the new ‘Powers That Be,’ after the title of David Halberstam’s 1979 book analyzing that era’s most influential media players: CBS , the New York Times , Time magazine, the Washington Post , and the Los Angeles Times . The new Powers are entirely different, however, and they number just two : Facebook and Google . \nThey’re in the news over speculation that “fake news” spread via Facebook posts could have influenced the election outcome, and over Google’s high placement of a search result reporting wrongly that Donald Trump got more popular votes than Hillary Clinton. The larger issue is that it’s now possible to hold a serious, legitimate debate on whether these two sites wield excessive influence over hundreds of millions–or perhaps billions–of people worldwide. \nSome 44% of U.S. adults get news from Facebook fb , says recent research from Pew . No other site comes close to that; YouTube ranks second with 10% of U.S. adults, followed by Twitter with 9%. It would appear that more Americans get at least some news from Facebook than from any other individual source. Back in 1979, none of the old powers that be, except maybe CBS, could have approached Facebook’s reach today, and none of them could approach it now. \nWhat users see on Facebook is highly influential . One of the company’s own studies from 2012 found that “I voted” posts orchestrated by the researchers influenced an estimated 280,000 additional people to vote in the 2010 midterm elections. The researchers were careful to make their experiment nonpartisan, but it’s easy to imagine how partisans of any cause could launch similarly powerful efforts. \nThat’s especially significant in light of today’s concerns that many Facebook users are in a “filter bubble” that exposes them mostly to people with views like their own. Separate work by Wellesley University researchers details dozens of past efforts to influence Google search results and Facebook news feeds. The companies constantly try to shut down such efforts, but they’re inevitably always a step behind. \n\nFacebook and Google googl hold extraordinary power in another way. At least 75% of all the growth in U.S. online advertising this year will accrue to those two companies ; some estimates say 90%. Emarketer forecasts that digital ads will be the largest category of all advertising as of next year. None of the old powers that be ever dreamed of such dominance. \nBoth companies insist that they’re not media companies—they don’t want to be—and by traditional standards they aren’t. They don’t employ thousands of reporters (or any reporters). But in today’s world they are indeed media companies because that’s how people use them. \nIn the recent controversy, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted that “We must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” But the reality that all leaders must confront is that being influential today requires competing for attention in the online realms of Facebook and Google, today’s towering kings of media. \nSign up for daily insights, updates, and opinion on leadership and leaders in the news at the Power Sheet .",

Google wants to make digitizing your old photo prints as easy as opening an app. The new app for iPhones and Android phones will use the phone’s camera to capture an old photo in four sections and stitch them together, much like a panorama shot. Google says this approach helps eliminate glare that can mar attempts to digitize print by simply photographing the whole photo. (AP Photo/Nick Jesdanun) NEW YORK — Google wants to make digitizing your old photo prints as easy as opening an app.\nThe PhotoScan app for iPhones and Android phones will use the phone's camera to capture an old photo in four sections and stitch them together, much like a panorama shot. Google says this approach helps eliminate glare that can mar attempts to digitize a print by simply photographing the whole photo.\nThe app will make minor adjustments to restore color in faded photos and to aligned corners when the photo print is bent.\nJulia Winn, a product manager for the new app, says scanning photos with traditional scanners takes time, while third-party digitizing services cost money and require you to part with your photos temporarily, risking loss and damage.\nThe free app comes out Tuesday.\nGo to MSN Home",
