      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has tried to downplay Facebook's role in the election. \nPhoto by James Martin/CNET Donald Trump won the popular vote. \nThe Clinton Foundation bought $137 million worth of illegal arms and ammunition. \nAn FBI agent associated with Hillary Clinton's email leaks was found dead in a murder-suicide. \nThe Pope endorsed Trump. \nIf you saw any of these stories on the internet over the past few weeks, let's be crystal clear: They're not true. \nBut you might not have known that if you saw them on Google or Facebook. Google listed the popular-vote story prominently on Google News on Monday for those searching for election results . The other stories made the rounds, unchecked, on Facebook, where they racked up likes, shares and views. \nThat's a problem because Facebook and Google are now two of the largest and most popular sites on the internet. They're also the Hungry Hungry Hippos of digital ad dollars. Between them, they draw billions of visitors a day. So if Facebook and Google have a fake news problem, there's an argument to be made that the internet itself has a fake news problem. And that's not good for the general public. \n\"The lion's share of our research around the role of digital and social media in the news environment suggests it's playing a pretty significant role in the habits of America,\" said Jesse Holcomb, associate director of research for the Pew Research Center in Washington, DC. \nA 'black box' What's more, about 4 out of every 10 Americans get their news online, he added. So if Google and Facebook spotlight bogus stories, those stories can gain a lot of traction. \n\"Google is an important source of news for people who tend to fall toward the middle of the ideological spectrum,\" Holcomb said. Google is a \"generally trusted source of news,\" while Facebook \"casts a shadow over the whole social web.\"\nThe concern over fake news has reached a fever pitch since November 8, when Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, won the US presidency in a victory few predicted. In the aftermath of the election, his detractors have alleged that fake news circulating on Facebook and other sites helped him win.\nEnlarge Image Google said it made a mistake in featuring a fake news article about Donald Trump so prominently in Google News.\nPhoto by CNET What frustrates some media experts is how hard it is to understand the internet giants' algorithms, the technical formulas they use for promoting and sharing stories. Both Google and Facebook have published guides about the type of signals they use to decide what you see or don't see online. For example, over the weekend, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a note on his personal page linking to Facebook's blog on how news feed evolves . \nA Facebook spokesman declined to comment beyond Zuckerberg's post. A Google spokeswoman said its ranking algorithms look at more than 200 different signals , but said the company doesn't go into great detail so sites can't game the system.\nStill, researchers would like to know more.\n\"People don't really know how endemic the problem really is because Facebook's algorithms are opaque to researchers,\" said Jeremy Rue , acting assistant dean at the University of California, Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. \"A lot of people are going to start taking a closer look.\"\nMary Bock, an assistant professor of journalism at the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, echoed the sentiment. \"Google delivers what other people have clicked on,\" Bock said. Still, she said, \"the algorithm is a black box.\"\nNot so 'crazy?' Zuckerberg denied that fake news on Facebook tipped the scale of the election. Last week, he called the notion a \"pretty crazy idea.\" And on Saturday, he wrote a lengthy note on his Facebook page reiterating that fake news amounts to less than 1 percent of all the content on the site. He didn't say what percentage of \"news\" content is fake, though.\nNot everyone agrees with Zuckerberg, who is insistent that Facebook doesn't have the power to influence how people think and behave -- or vote.\n\"The size of the Facebook news audience strikes me as a remarkable amount of influence for one company to have, especially given they don't considers themselves a news organization,\" said Pew's Holcomb. \nSome Facebook unhappy employees feel the same way. A few of them formed a task force with the purpose of questioning Facebook's role in promoting fake news, according to a report Monday by BuzzFeed . One of those employees directly opposed Zuckerberg's stance: \"It's not a crazy idea,\" that person told BuzzFeed. The social network's top brass have also held meetings on the fake news topic, according to the New York Times .\nGoogle, for its part, said Monday that it made a mistake in allowing a fake story to be featured so prominently on Google News. It also said it won't let fake news sites use its ad-selling software . The search giant plans to enforce that new rule the way it does its other policies, through a combination of automated systems and human review. \nJoining the fight Where do we go from here?\nJeff Jarvis, an author and media critic, said the most important thing for the media to do is make sure Google and Facebook aren't in a position to kill news they deem as fake. That puts too much editorial power in their hands, he argued.\nNeither company seems interested in doing that. \nZuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that the social network needs to be careful about becoming an \"arbiter of truth.\" Google, meanwhile, has said it will only remove search results if they contain things like illegal content or malware. That means fake news could keep getting through.\nJarvis thinks Facebook should solicit the media to help fight the phony stories. Facebook could come up with new tags for stories that debunk fake news and put them in related stories boxes. Or, if something has been tagged as fake a certain number of times, Facebook could add a popup box or alert that asks people if they are sure they want to share the story, he said.\nIt's also important to remember that this is the internet. There will always be bad actors. \n\"Any system can be gamed,\" Jarvis said.\nFor now, that means being aware of what you're reading and what's in your news feed. That news may not be news at all. \nCNET's Connie Guglielmo, Terry Collins and Joan Solsman contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Join a chat \n“I’m going to kill the the president-elect,” Matt Harrigan wrote on his personal Facebook page. “[G]etting a sniper rifle and perching myself where it counts. Find a bedroom in the whitehouse that suits you motherfucker. I’ll find you,” the CEO further added. \nHarrigan quickly went on to apologize for his remarks in a statement on PacketSled’s website, downplaying the threats merely as a “joke.” \nHere’s the full apology: \nMy recent Facebook comment was intended to be a joke, in the context of a larger conversation, and only privately shared as such. Anyone who knows me, knows that I do not engage in this form of rhetoric with any level of seriousness and the comment most certainly does not represent my real personal views in any regard. I apologize if anything that I said was either taken seriously, was offensive, or caused any legitimate concern. \nBest Regards, Matt Harrigan \nHarrigan’s apologetic statement has since been removed from PacketSled’s website. Instead, the company put up a new post , notifying that the board of directors has “accepted the resignation of President and CEO Matthew Harrigan, effective immediately.” \n“We want to be very clear, PacketSled does not condone the comments made by Mr. Harrigan, which do not reflect the views or opinions of the company, its employees, investors or partners,” the statement further said. \nIronically, PacketSled specializes in “continuously monitor[ing] for advanced threats and policy violations missed by other defenses.” \nSo in case you want to avoid getting fired over your frustrations with Trump’s presidential triumph: Better refrain from sharing your murderous tendencies on social media.",

      "text": "Facebook, Google, and Twitter urge Trump to support encryption and immigration reform Internet Association outlines policy positions in a letter to the president-elect share Spencer Platt/Getty Images \nA group of tech companies including Facebook, Google, and Twitter has called on President-elect Donald Trump to protect encryption, reform immigration policy, and curtail surveillance during his administration. The Internet Association, whose members also include Uber, Amazon, and Netflix, outlined its policy positions in a letter published on Monday. \nTech executives have been wary and sometimes openly critical of Trump, in part due to the president-elect's divisive campaign rhetoric and positions on immigration and encryption. In June, more than 100 Silicon Valley leaders said in a letter that a Trump presidency would be a \" disaster for innovation .\" The letter released Monday strikes a more optimistic tone. \n\"The internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialogue,\" the letter reads. \n\"Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nDuring the Republican primary, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company refused an FBI order to unlock an iPhone that belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters. He dismissed the company's argument that unlocking the phone would threaten the privacy and security of all iPhone users, saying in a February interview: \"Who do they think they are?\" The Internet Association hopes he'll reconsider. \n\"Laws that require companies to engineer vulnerabilities into products and services harm personal privacy and endanger national security,\" the letter reads. \"Support for strong encryption makes America more secure.\" \nThe letter also calls on Trump to support net neutrality and implement stronger reforms on government surveillance programs. Trump has been critical of net neutrality in the past, and his transition team includes two prominent defenders of the National Security Agency (NSA). But he may be more sympathetic to some of the Internet Association's other policy priorities, including its calls to ease regulation of the sharing economy and lower regulatory barriers in Europe. \nOn immigration, the Internet Association wants Trump to \"expand and improve the green card program,\" and to create a green card system for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates. Trump built much of his candidacy around a hardline anti-immigration position, and although his position on expanding the H1-B visa program for skilled workers remains vague , there are concerns that the program could be curtailed under his administration. \nYou can read the Internet Association's full letter and list of policy priorities here .",

(Photo: Courtesy Tinder) \nTinder offered only two gender picks prior to a major update Tuesday: female or male. Now, the dating app that boasts more than 20 billion \"matches\" is offering dozens more auto-fill options for trans and non-comforming users. \nThe update, Tinder CEO Sean Rad hopes, is the beginning of the solution to problems transgender app users have faced. \n\"Six months ago we discovered that the transgender community on Tinder was experiencing some harassment on the platform,\" Rad says. \"When we initially heard about it, we were very angry.\" \nRad says the team regrouped and took their time figuring out a solution, working with influencers from GLAAD as well as their own transgender users. The result is an additional 37 gender options, including Transgender Female, Transsexual Male, Agender, Genderqueer and the option to write in your own term. Users are given the option to display their gender identities on their profiles. \nThe app update also works in \"very significant algorithms that help us correct harassment early on,\" says Rad, who also notes that the Tinder moderation team has been trained to better catch when a transgender user has been unfairly banned after being reported by someone on the platform. \nNick Adams, the director of Transgender Affairs at GLAAD, sees the inclusion of trans terms and anti-bullying efforts on Tinder as \"an important step forward (and) a message to its tens of millions of users that transgender and gender non-conforming people are welcome,\" he says. \"What the app’s update does provide is the ability for people to self-identify in more expansive and encompassing ways that truly reflect who they are with a fill-in blank feature.\" \nGender is no longer binary on Tinder. There are 37 \"More\" auto-fill terms on the app, and the option to write in a new term. (Photo: Courtesy Tinder) \nAccording to Rad, Tinder will continue to evolve this update, because \"gender is a complex conversation—it’s an ongoing dialogue.\" 33 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "Google and Facebook ban fake news sites from using ad platforms - POLITICO",
      "text": "With help from Nancy Scola and Margaret Harding McGill GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK SQUEEZE FAKE NEWS SITES — Both tech companies announced Monday evening that they would ban fake news sites from using their respective advertising platforms, a strategy aimed at cutting off some of the revenue sources for the sites, which have been under fire for stoking fears during the campaign, The Wall Street Journal reports. Facebook will bar all fake news sites from its Facebook Audience Network, while Google will ban them from using its AdSense ad-selling software, both of which are tools websites can use to place ads. The moves to thwart phony news outlets, which have been called out for potentially influencing the outcome of the presidential election, come after mounting criticism of Facebook and Google for sitting idle while their platforms are being used to perpetuate untruths and hoaxes.\nStory Continued Below\nCLINTON DIGITAL STRATEGIST: FB FAKE NEWS A ‘BIG PROBLEM’ — Over the final weeks before Election Day, Hillary Clinton campaign staffers grew alarmed by the spread of misinformation about their candidate on Facebook, says Hillaryland’s chief digital strategist, Teddy Goff. Campaign officials and other Democrats began talking then about how to tackle post-election the viral spread of completely untrue headlines, like “FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead.” Nancy has the story , including what Goff thinks are possible remedies for what he calls a “solvable problem.” He says a strategy is in the works that could target “one or two people” at Facebook, including Mark Zuckerberg, who appears to have inflamed the debate by saying last week that it’s “a pretty crazy idea” that dissemination of bogus and misleading “news” items swayed the election in Donald Trump’s favor.\n— A group of Facebook employees has formed a secret task force to address the fake news problem, sources tell BuzzFeed . The unofficial group, which one staffer told the site includes “more than dozens” of Facebook staffers, has met twice in recent days and plans to present senior management with a formal list of recommendations for combating the sham news scourge. “It’s not a crazy idea,” a Facebook employee told BuzzFeed, referring to the argument that fake news affected the election. “What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.”\nANOTHER TRUMP TRANSITION AIDE TO WATCH — That’d be Joshua Wright, the former GOP commissioner at the FTC, who’s been advising the team on related matters, according to a source familiar with effort. Wright didn’t respond to MT on Monday night, but he comes to the transition as executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University, which he rejoined in 2015 after serving at the FTC during the Obama administration. He’s also senior of counsel at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati’s D.C. office.\nGOOD TUESDAY MORNING! Welcome to Morning Tech, where we’re going nuts with the Westworld fan theories.

Witnesses in line to testify include NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind, Consumer Technology Association President Gary Shapiro and Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers CEO Mitch Bainwol. The hearing is part of the committee’s Disrupter Series, which has also looked at other emerging tech fields, including wearable devices, advanced robotics and blockchain tech.\nEISENACH REFUTES INDUSTRY TIES — The Trump transition’s lead on telecom, Jeffrey Eisenach, pushed back against the notion that he’s a lobbyist-turned-adviser, tweeting on Monday: “Not wanting to engage on this, but the facts are: Not a lobbyist; not consulting for Verizon; no consulting business before the FCC at all.” He was the online face of a recent New York Times story about Trump calling on lobbyists and corporate consultants to serve on his transition team. Lesley Stahl questioned Trump in Sunday’s “60 Minutes” interview about his campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” of lobbyists in Washington; the president-elect, backpedaling, replied: “Everybody’s a lobbyist down there.” Eisenach declined to elaborate on his tweet.\nFTC GETS SMART ON SMART TVS — The Federal Trade Commission is set to evaluate how smart television devices are tracking consumer data and targeting advertising, during a Fall Technology event on Dec. 7. Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, is expected to open the discussion, which will also feature a panel on how the devices leverage analytics to promote ads to users, and another on the regulatory policies that could be put in place to shield the privacy of consumers who use them.\n** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: It’s time for America to come together.

IPHONE SALES — The Global Times, a Chinese state-run publication, ran an editorial on Sunday suggesting the country would go “tit-for-tat” if Trump were to enforce tariffs on Chinese exports, a move that the publication argued would adversely affect U.S. product sales , including those of Apple’s iPhone. Michael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, spoke with MT about the likelihood of this scenario, and said the stakes are higher for China in a trade standoff. “If President-elect Trump were to impose tariffs to respond to [China's] unfair trade practices, China will probably respond. China, however, has a lot more to lose in a tit-for-tat approach,” Wessel says. “China’s leaders depend a lot more on keeping their people employed to stay in power than Americans need an iPhone.”\n— Following Trump’s phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, The Global Times published an editorial on Monday that took a different tack and emphasized goals of collaboration between the two nations.\nNAMES FLOATING AROUND FOR TRUMP COMMERCE SECRETARY — Several business leaders and lawmakers are among the names being floated as contenders for the top gig at Commerce. Here’s a rundown:\n— Several of those suggested are Republican leaders who have stood by Trump, even as other members of the party distanced themselves from him. They include former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (whose star may have fallen, since he was booted from his transition role) and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry .\n— Another group of potentials is comprised of business leaders, including billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, who’s also said to be one of the final two contenders being considered for the Treasury Secretary role. Others include Nucor Corporation CEO Dan DiMicco , Granite Capital International Group head Lewis Eisenberg and Former World Wrestling Entertainment Executive Linda McMahon . \nTRANSITIONS — TechNet, a trade group representing members of companies including Apple, Facebook and Google has named Joanie Deutsch as its executive director for Washington State and the Northwest. She’ll oversee the organization’s state advocacy and political activities in these regions. \nUpgrading Washington: Technology in the Next Administration — Join POLITICO for a deep-dive conversation on what it will take for the next generation of Washington leaders to bridge the government technology gap.

      "text": "Google and Facebook finally announced steps to tackle fake news on their respective platforms this week following increasing pressure from critics eager to halt the flow of falsehoods online.\nBoth companies said they will prohibit fake news websites from advertising on their platforms, thus reducing the exposure of such articles to the public while also starving the companies of an important source of advertising income.\nThe move comes after the companies received a wave of criticism over its role in propagating misinformation, particularly in this election cycle in which many observed that a bitter partisan war was potentially worsened by polarizing news sources touting untrue assertions. While the technology companies have in the past been hesitant to mediate the flow of news, this change might signal a change in thought as they come to grip with the real-life implications of lackluster surveillance on their platforms.\nRecommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news ,” a Facebook spokesman said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nTest your knowledge Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. Facebook said it will explicitly ban fake news sites from using the Facebook Audience Network, a system that places ads on other websites and mobile apps. On Monday, Google said it will prevent Google ads from being placed on “pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” the company’s spokesperson said, a category that includes fake news sites.\nTechnology and social media companies are increasingly seeing themselves as victims of those who game the system to spread misinformation either with purposes to mislead the public or for personal profit, as Buzzfeed recently exposed in an investigation.\nMost recently on Monday, the top result for a Google search for the final results of the presidential elections is sourced to a random website that says Donald Trump has won both popular and electoral votes , The Washington Post reports (in fact, Hillary Clinton leads the popular vote). On the same day, another false Facebook trending story with more than 10,000 shares claimed that Denzel Washington backs Mr. Trump and that he called President Obama “anti-Christian,” as the Post points out. These come after a string of false news that trended throughout the campaign season that ranged from Hillary Clinton calling for civil war to Mike Pence insulting Mrs. Obama.\nTechnology companies have historically been hesitant to play editor to the information flowing through their platforms.\nLast week, Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that Facebook influenced the elections, emphasizing the role the technology company played was to disseminate information, not decide on content – a painful experience the company had with editors with its Trending topics previously. The company does prohibit certain content, such as nudity.\nBut a growing sense of responsibility among employees of tech companies may continue to add pressure on executives to take more drastic actions. As Buzzfeed reported on Monday, a group of Facebook employees took initiative to form an unofficial task force to investigate whether the company, used by 150 million Americans, is doing enough to address the problem.\n\"It’s not a crazy idea,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed of the assertion that Facebook influenced the election. \"What’s crazy is for [Mr. Zuckerberg] to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed.\nCritics say even with the new policy, Facebook still has not addressed the proliferation of false news in the News feed. Both Facebook and Google have been taking steps over the years to label news sources as “satire” or “opinion,” while also allowing users to flag false content.",

I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels,\" Pamela Ramsey Taylor, the head of a West Virginia nonprofit in Clay County, wrote on Facebook.\nThe mayor of the town of Clay, W.Va., Beverly Whaling, responded, \"just made my day Pam.\"\nRecommended: Michelle Obama: How well do you know the first lady? The offensive post was hardly the first of its kind from a town or city official. Last month, the mayor of West York, Pa., resigned amid pressure from other town officials and constituents after circulating racist memes of the Obama family on his Facebook page . While hordes of Americans publicly condemn the acts of racism and have helped to facilitate the removal of such officials, the recurring instances serve to show that racial tensions remain in communities across the nation – even among the views of elected and appointed officials.\nTest your knowledge Michelle Obama: How well do you know the first lady? In Pictures Voices from across political party lines: What can be done to heal America? \"These remarks tell us there’s a strong strain of bigotry and racism still alive in our country ,\" Gene Policinski, senior vice president for the First Amendment Center in Nashville, previously told The Christian Science Monitor in October. \"Sometimes the function of free speech is to give us a true picture of society.\"\nWhile fewer than 500 people reside in Clay, and only around 9,000 in the county, the post has spread fiercely across the internet. Petitions seeking the removal of both women from their positions garnered more than 85,000 signatures from those who sought to stand up to the spread of racial statements, indicating that many across the nation refuse to accept hateful language on part of officials.\nThe town of Clay has no black residents , and the county itself is 98 percent white, according to BBC. Still, both women contended that the post was not meant to spark racial outrage, but reflected their excitement of a Donald Trump presidency.\n\"My comment was not intended to be racist at all ,\" Ms. Whaling said in a statement to The Washington Post. \"I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I’m not of any way racist!\"\nMore than 75 percent of Clay County voters cast ballots for Mr. Trump, compared to 68 percent statewide.\nMs. Taylor, who directs the partially state and federal funded Clay County Development group, was removed from her position Monday.\nWest Virginia Democratic Party Chairwoman Belinda Biafore issued an apology to Michelle Obama, saying that the rhetoric does not reflect the people of the state and their views.\n\"West Virginia truly is better than this,\" she wrote. \"These radical, hateful, and racist ideals are exactly what we at the West Virginia Democratic Party will continue to fight against.\"",

      "title": "Asana introduces boards as part of an all-out assault on Trello",
      "text": "share Asana , the fast-growing work-tracking tool created by a co-founder of Facebook, today declared war on Trello , its biggest rival. Asana, which has to date been known for its collaborative to-do lists, today introduced boards — essentially a note-for-note re-creation of Trello’s rival approach to getting things done. The move could accelerate the growth of a once-arcane sector of the software world into a default tool used across a broad range of industries. Until now, the divide between lists and boards has essentially been religious. Some believe the most efficient way to work is to create lists of tasks and assign them; others believe it’s more efficient to visualize those tasks on cards and arrange the cards on a digital whiteboard. People particularly like boards for tracking the state of objects — moving a job candidate through the recruiting pipeline, say, or moving an article from conception to publication. This summer Asana introduced what it calls “ custom fields ,” which among other things let users track the state of various projects by adding in their own dropdown menus and text boxes. I’ve found them tremendously useful myself — but still, everywhere that Asana goes, people are always asking it to build boards. Specifically, to build Trello boards. And they refused to switch from Trello to Asana unless Asana had boards. So, Asana built boards. “We want to give Trello full credit here,” said Justin Rosenstein, an Asana co-founder, in an interview. “They’ve done a great job popularizing this easy visual view. But we see a much bigger opportunity here to enable more kinds of work.” In Asana’s opinion, a board is just one way to view your work — and until it’s connected to a more robust system for tracking work, it’s not half as powerful as it should be. In the first version of boards, you have to build them by hand. It’s easy — you create labels for some columns, add “cards” by typing in their names, and move them around however you like using drag and drop. What’s more interesting is what’s coming next. Within months, Rosenstein says, “boards” will simply become one view inside Asana. If you like using lists to get your work done, you can stick with lists. If you prefer boards, you can tap “boards” and visualize your list of projects that way. Different colleagues can work according to their own preferences. And different projects can take the shape that best suits them. Boards are flexible tools for visualizing work, Rosenstein says, but ultimately underpowered. “This is a great feature, but it’s not a product,” he said. “It deserves to be a product instead of a feature.” “This is a great feature, but it’s not a product.” I’m deeply interested in workplace productivity — I’m the sort of person who downloads a dozen to-do list apps just to assess the minor differences in their user interfaces. There are some amazing single-player tools available — Todoist in particular has been a joy for me to use. But ultimately to-do lists are most powerful when they’re connected to everyone you work with. Investors seem to be waking up, if slowly, to this fact. This year Asana raised $50 million at a $600 million valuation. Trello says it was already profitable when it spun out of Fog Creek Software in 2014 with $10 million in venture funding. Both products use a freemium model, but the free version of Trello is much more robust — one reason it grew to 10 million users as of last year. Asana says that around 13,000 businesses pay to use it; Trello doesn’t disclose its number of paid users. (There are other competitors in work tracking, too: notably Basecamp , which arguably invented modern web-based collaboration software, and JIRA , the preferred choice of many software companies.) By integrating lists and boards into a single product, Asana may have just vaulted ahead of its rivals. Its version of boards doesn’t do everything that Trello’s does out of the gate. But in bringing together list people and board people, it just gave Trello an enormous reason to worry. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Facebook supports NGOs with release of emerging markets population data Posted Boldstart Ventures locks down $47 million for fund three \nFrom rockets to planes, Facebook’s Connectivity Lab has been hedging its bets on a number of experiments to bring internet access to the far reaching corners of the globe. \nThe group broadly breaks up connectivity challenges by population density, using machine learning to pinpoint population centers that remain off the grid for existing data sets. Today, Facebook is releasing those population data sets for five countries — opening up possibilities for non-profits and NGOs working to solve tough global challenges. 99 percent of populations live within 40 miles of a city. \nThe question of where to position connectivity infrastructure is an important one. This is because a satellite can broadcast internet to a much larger region than a plane like Facebook’s Project Aquila. Facebook was initially fearful of the challenges presented by a lack of population density in emerging markets. But, in analyzing imagery for 23 markets, researchers discovered that 99 percent of populations lived within 40 miles of a city. \n“For areas like the Middle East and Africa, maps exist at too low of resolution to make quantitative decisions,” said Yael Maguire, head of Facebook’s CX Lab. “We worked with data science folks to think about how to systematically process imagery from space for the entire globe.” \nFacebook processed 14.6 billion images using a large computing cluster to identify and tag these population centers. Display of both urban and rural populations on the top from DigitalGlobe imagery with Facebook’s analysis underneath. \nMachine learning and computer vision automates the process of tagging individual structures across large geographic areas. Those structures are then used to approximate population. That data is already being used by the Red Cross to push back against malaria in Malawi. In addition to Malawi, Facebook is also releasing data sets for South Africa, Ghana, Haiti, and Sri Lanka in its collaboration with Columbia University and the World Bank. \nNew data showing the extent to which populations in emerging markets coalesce around urban centers is encouraging to Facebook because it means that a connectivity solution in each of those regions would only need to span a short distance to connect a vast majority residents. This could take the pressure off the company to put a satellite into orbit to provide large-scale rural connectivity. Facebook’s previous attempt to launch a connectivity satellite ended in fire aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. \n“There’s less of an emphasis on satellite connectivity, but of course that’s a statement about the future not the present,” noted Maguire. “Aquila is years away, satellites are here today. We do think there is a roll for them to play.” \nThe new granular data sets are available starting now on Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network site. 0",

      "text": "65 shares \nJulie Zhuo, VP of product design for Facebook, has been at the company since 2006. Since joining, she’s helped grow the service from eight million college and high school kids to over one billion people worldwide. \nHow’d she do it? Read on for highlights from her recent AMA interview . Do more \nJulie is a huge proponent for getting your hands dirty. When asked her advice on how to start out in the biz, Julie replied: \nThe best advice I have is just to do more . Nothing beats getting your hands dirty and just designing, making, building, crafting, tweaking, you get the idea \nAnd don’t be afraid to simply try…. \nTry new things out. Try working on new things that make you feel a bit uncomfortable. Try designing a logo, try to design an interactive UI using a new design tool… Figure out what you like and what you’re good at. Formal education isn’t a must \nThanks to the advent of technology, it’s now easier than ever to study at your own pace, and turn your hobby into a paying gig. \nWhether it’s coding, design, writing, or underwater basket weaving… you don’t necessarily need a college education to learn. \nI didn’t have a formal background in design. I think it’s same with coding (or anything, really)–obviously super helpful to be able to take classes on the theory and discipline, but the bulk of the learning happens through doing. Just get in there are start designing some stuff, and share it with other people for critique so you can learn and get better. \nIf you’re interested in seeing what Julie’s ideal design curriculum is, she wrote a blog post about it. \nAnd once you’re making waves as a designer, you’ll need to find a developer to kickass right along side you. Her ideal developer? Sees us on the same team. Cares about the user experience. Cares about performance. May push back on implementing features, but the features they commit to are done well. Writes maintainable code that anticipates future iteration. The importances of prioritizing \nWhen building a product or feature, it’s absolutely imperative you always remember your end user. You can lost in the details, but never lose focus of the your purpose. Especially when you’re in the thick of things. \nPrioritize features by being clear about who we’re building for, and what we hope they’ll be able to do with the feature. If we’re developing a product that we think everyone can use, we try and identify the things that we think the most number of people will find valuable. \nAnd don’t forget to research… \nWe do a lot of research to help us make sure we’re on the right track. We’ve learned that the right defaults are really critical – [but] most people aren’t going to go digging around in menus or customizing options… Of course we need to provide those features, but then we may provide them in a way that is accessible but not so front-and-center in the UI. \nFor a look inside UX design, being a female in tech, and why Facebook has that pesky separate messenger, check out the full AMA with Julie Zhuo . And for more AMAs with the world’s most influential thought leaders in business, design and technology, check out our upcoming and past sessions .

      "text": "On Monday, the top trending story if you searched Google for \"final election vote count 2016\" was a fake story on a site called 70News claiming that Donald Trump had won the popular vote , even though he had not. And in the week before the election, Facebook and Google were being criticized about fake news on their sites, which critics believe could have swayed the presidential race's outcome.\nGoogle responded Monday with a pledge to restrict fake news sites from using its AdSense advertising network. Facebook, for its part, updated its policy to clearly state that its advertising ban on deceptive or misleading content applied to fake news.\nFurther Reading Zuckerberg claims just 1% of Facebook posts carry fake news \"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" Facebook said in a statement. And Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Saturday tried to put the kibosh on the idea that Facebook's platform influenced the election.\n\"Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic. Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes,\" Zuckerberg said . \"The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\nStill, Google and Facebook are not preventing fake news or hoaxes from appearing on the social networking site or in Google search. Instead, the companies' policies are geared toward trying to reduce the financial incentive for producing fake news. And for Google, it's not just about seeking the truth. Advertisers don't want their wares displayed next to bogus content.\n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" Google said in a statement. Google also has the same policy for pornography or violent content. AdSense vets content with artificial intelligence and humans to ensure compliance.\nFor its part, Facebook has been hit hard by some who accused the social-media platform of tilting voters in favor of Trump by allowing completely fabricated stories, including one that Trump won the endorsement of Pope Francis, to circulate on the site.\nThe Pew Research Center, meanwhile, in May said that 62 percent of Americans obtain some, or all, of their news on social media—the bulk of it from Facebook.",

Elect,\" Harrigan wrote. \"Bring it Secret Service.\"\nPacketSled said in a statement that it had accepted Harrigan's resignation.\n\"The PacketSled Board of Directors accepted the resignation of President and CEO Matthew Harrigan, effective immediately,\" the company said. \"We want to be very clear, PacketSled does not condone the comments made by Mr. Harrigan, which do not reflect the views or opinions of the company, its employees, investors or partners.\"\nIn a previous statement, the company said it reported the information to the Secret Service and placed Harrigan on administrative leave.\nIn an apology since taken off the PacketSled website, according to The Next Web , Harrigan said the comments were meant to be a joke.\n\"My recent Facebook comment was intended to be a joke, in the context of a larger conversation, and only privately shared as such. Anyone who knows me, knows that I do not engage in this form of rhetoric with any level of seriousness and the comment most certainly does not represent my real personal views in any regard,\" Harrigan said . \"I apologize if anything that I said was either taken seriously, was offensive, or caused any legitimate concern.\"\nThese aren't the first threats of violence against someone in this presidential election.\nIn August, Trump said that \"second-amendment people\" could take action if Hillary Clinton were elected and appointed judges in favor of gun control.\nOn November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.\nOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.\nYou in?\n— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016",

      "text": "Snowden discusses Facebook’s fake news controversy Posted Facebook Messenger now works in Android Auto \nFacebook is facing post-election criticism that it did not do enough to weed out fake news on the platform, allowing viral false stories to spread and influencing the election result. The social network experimented with AI and human reports to cut back on fake stories during the campaign season, and announced yesterday that it will ban fake news sites from its ad network . \nAt Fusion’s Real Future Fair today, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden expressed doubt that Americans would fall hard enough for fake stories on Facebook that it could sway their votes. His comments echoed those recently made by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who claimed is is “extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.” \n“I think that’s a very sad indictment of our democracy, that our voters could be so easily misled. But were it true, and there is some evidence that it may be, this gets into a bigger challenge,” Snowden said, moving on to concerns about the size and dominance of platforms like Facebook in our daily lives. \n“When you get a Google in place, a Facebook in place, a Twitter in place, they never seem to leave,” he said. “When one service provider makes a bad decision we all suffer for it. … The Silicon Valley desire for massive, world eating services, the scale that takes over not only our country but all others, it’s asking us to accept a status quo where we set aside that competition in favor of scale. We should be particularly cautious about embracing this and taking this to be the case.” \nSnowden cautioned that social media networks are careful to respect users as they grow, but get more reckless as they establish dominance. “To have one company that has enough power to reshape the way we think — I don’t think I need to describe how dangerous that is,” he concluded.

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think the social network could have influenced Tuesday's election. (Mandel Ngan / AFP/Getty Images) David Pierson \nAmid mounting pressure, Facebook Inc. said it would block websites that publish fake news from accessing its advertising services. \nThe announcement Monday came hours after Alphabet Inc.’s Google said it would also bar fake news sites from using its advertising networks. \nThe companies faced backlash for allowing the spread of phony news articles during the presidential campaign season, leading to charges that the content helped influence the outcome of last week’s election. \nThe move to restrict fake news sites from utilizing Facebook’s advertising tools comes days after Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think the social network could have influenced the election. Facebook characterized the shift as a clarification of existing policies. \nFake news sites have reportedly enriched themselves by creating content that has spread virally on Facebook and Google. BuzzFeed, for example, reported on teens in Macedonia responsible for making hundreds of politically charged make-believe articles for American audiences and reaping the ad dollars that ensued. \nGoogle, meanwhile, featured a story at the top of its search results Sunday claiming Donald Trump won the popular vote. He did not. \nThough Facebook and Google both dominate the digital advertising market, fake news sites can still generate ad revenue through other smaller ad networks. And they can still dominate users’ newsfeeds if the articles go viral. \nAs technology companies rather than media companies, the two Silicon Valley giants have long argued they are not responsible for the content their users publish. That viewpoint is protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

      "text": "Facebook Users May Soon See Multiple Products Featured in a Single News Feed Ad Retailers are testing the format By Marty Swant November 15, 2016, 1:55 PM EST Technology Facebook is testing an ad format that features more products. Facebook Ahead of the holiday season, Facebook is testing a different kind of product ad that lets retailers showcase more than one item within the news feed. The two-click process seems to be focused on both brand awareness and direct response. The ads pair a main image or video along with related product images underneath and, if clicked, then bring up a second page with more products. If clicked again, the ad leads to the retailer's website where a consumer can actually buy the product. (The launch comes just weeks after Facebook-owned Instagram began letting more than a dozen retailers focus more specifically on ecommerce by tagging products in photos that then lead to a way to buy items online.) Some retailers like Michael Kors and Lowes have already begun testing the Facebook format this week. However, a Facebook spokesperson said other brands will ramp up their own campaigns later this month and through the holiday season. More could join early next year, with other industries beyond retail possibly added if retailers are pleased with results. According to Michael Kors, which has been using the format along with the rest of its fall campaign, cost per conversion has fallen by 6 percent. Instead of focusing too much on targeting a user with a single product, the goal is to give people enough items that might prompt them to shop more. The ads in some ways seem reminiscent of Google's \" showcase shopping \" ad format that launched for retailers this summer. Those ads, featured in Google search, aim to connect retailers with potential buyers who might be interested in a product even if their search query isn't quite exact. The formats seem to potentially point to a broader trend toward clustering retail items in a way that brings a number of product listing ads underneath a single main piece of creative. The approach gives users more ideas to consider beyond just the one image they might or might not be interested in. According to Facebook, this approach drives more visual discovery by letting retailers use as many as 50 products to target users.  ",

      "text": "This List of Fake News Websites Proliferating on Facebook Is Staggering  40   \nThe proliferation of fake news across the internet, especially on Facebook, has become one of the major talking points in the wake of the shocking result of the 2016 US presidential election (with some arguing fake news helped elect President Donald Trump ). Regardless, it seems to be getting harder and harder to discern the difference between trustworthy journalism and fake content created for the sake of a click—but it’s not at all impossible. \nMelissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication & media at Merrimack College, started a list of websites known to have published articles with false information as a way to help her students learn about journalism and media literacy. Thanks to the magic of Google Documents, it's now accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Read the entire public document here (via Gennady Kolker ). \nThe growing guide is meant to be an educational tool for combating fake news. The list includes nearly 150 websites Zimdars and her students have called out for the potential for spreading misinformation, including those masquerading as real media outlets (such as MSNBC.com.co and abcnews.com.co ), those that are complete satire (The Onion, ClickHole) and those with a baiting or heavily biased tone (Upworthy, Crooks and Liars, InfoWars). \nBad web design, headlines that incite an emotional reaction, ALL CAPS ANYTHING, and community-section bloggers posting under the banner of news outlets are a few tells for fake news. \nZimdars writes that her antidote for fake news is to read or listen to a variety of sources and be widely informed, naming The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and The Wall Street Journa l as some of her go-to, trustworthy news outlets. But even these sometime “rely on particular media frames to report stories and select stories based on different notions of newsworthiness.” All media should be consumed with a critical eye — and when fake news is capable of shaping so much , it’s never been a more important lesson. \nGet six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter .

      "text": "Rec \nFake news isn't just for politics on Facebook. \nOn the sports internet, where conversation around potential events is just as valuable -- and perhaps more compelling -- than conversation about actual events, all you need is a sense of what's possible to get a lot of people looking at your made-up garbage. And if one of those people makes the mistake of sharing said garbage on a prominent platform, you can blast speculative fiction all the way into the mainstream news cycle. \nWe saw this happen when Brian Scalabrine -- an NBA guy with NBA connections who might actually hear things sometimes -- went on the radio and said he'd heard things about a potential trade involving Klay Thompson and the Celtics. Fans freaked out, publications like this one acknowledged the rumor, the Warriors themselves were forced to acknowledge it , and then Scalabrine revealed where he'd heard it from: Morning Ledger 3 days ago justin bautista. I talk all rumors not just team I know and cover — Brian Scalabrine (@Scalabrine) November 14, 2016 \nHere's that Morning Ledger post, autoplay video ad included for full effect: \nHere, with a hat-tip to my handsome son Rodger Sherman , is another headline from the same site: \n(It didn't, btw.) \nThis is a fake rumor. By \"fake,\" I don't mean that it didn't or won't become reality. I mean that that there was no official consideration of it becoming reality reported anywhere. It's important to draw that distinction, because NBA rumors are a real thing. \nPeople with connections often catch wind of trade talks, free agency plans, or other front office machinations. They then check that intelligence against other sources, then report it. \nThe rumor may never bear fruit in real life, but it can still be valid. An agent could truthfully tell a reporter \"this team has called about my client,\" and the reporter could confirm that and report \"Team Has Interest In Player,\" and then that team could never actually sign that player. It was still a legit rumor, backed by reporting on real behind-the-scenes dialogue. \nThere is also speculation! Speculation is fun. Playing with ESPN's NBA Trade Machine and saying \"hey look, the Knicks could legally trade Derrick Rose straight up for Klay Thompson\" is a lovely use of time and I support your decision to do that. You could even write about it on your blog. This is all fine. \nWhat gets thorny is when speculation is mistaken for valid rumor, sometimes willfully. Here's another non-Scalabrine example, working backward: \n1. In September, the Knicks and Thunder were not talking about a trade involving Russell Westbrook and Kristaps Porzingis. I promise you this was not the case. And yet, KOCO, an Oklahoma City news station with a verified Twitter account, posted that exact rumor on their website. It's still there , under the headline \"Trade rumor: Russell Westbrook to the Knicks?\" Here's how the rumor was addressed in their article: \n\"Unlikely, but the rumor is out there.\" Hmm. A link! Let's follow it. \n2. Now we're on a website called SportsRageous. Hmm. What do they have to say? \n\"Absurd,\" and yet an article and another link! Let's follow it. \n3. Here we are at Inquistr, which looks pretty legit! Here's their section on this rumor: \nHoly shit! The Thunder and Knicks are actively \"discussing\" this blockbuster trade! Not so absurd anymore! And there's another link, presumably to reporting! Maybe this time it will actually go to the famous website \"NBA Trade Rumors.\" \n4. (Hold on, this is taking a while to load because I have so many tabs with so many autoplaying videos open.) \n... \nOkay, boom: \nHell yeah Send in your rumors, everybody! They could end up in the news! So how does THAT make its way up to a real, verified news source acknowledging it? \nAs far as I can tell, there exist several overlapping webs of rumor farms that all give each other a leg up on Google search. That website SportsRageous is part of a network called Tune Media , which appears to own a bunch of other trash news sites with which you, the internet-surfing NBA fan, may be familiar: Morning Ledger (hi Scal!), Chatt Sports, Morning News USA, Australian Network News, and more. All these sites link to each other, and they get frequent love from places with at least superficial legitimacy like Inquisitr and the Chinese site Yibada . Enough key words, and enough validation via links, and you can soar to the top of everyone's Google searches and alerts. \nSay I'm a Phoenix Suns fan on Nov. 15, 2016 who wants to know if the team is thinking of trading Brandon Knight. I google \"Brandon Knight trade rumor\": \nWhoa! Brandon Knight rumors in the news! The Suns are *going to* trade him, according to this headline! Let's click that \"Headlines & Global News\" link for the scoop: \nOh. \nOh. \nOh, a plainly speculative blog post about a plausible event. No reporting, no valid rumors, just harmless speculation regurgitated and re-regurgitated by other sites until it ends up on Google News with a headline that suggests it's actually transpiring. \nThat is, more often than not, what this comes down to. Fans speculate, then that speculation gets laundered several times over, swaddled in search-engine-optimized keywords, and boom, you're atop the Google search. If you're lucky, a desperate or unscrupulous mainstream source will cite your disingenuously magnified fan fiction and send extra links your way on top of the Google traffic. Eventually the rumor take on a life of its own, large and multiple enough that no one cares where it came from anymore. So what does this mean for you, NBA fan on the web? \nWell, first of all, don't stop speculating. It really is fun, and it's fun to read when other people do it, too. \nThat said, I'd advise taking a moment to distinguish between speculation and reporting, and to follow rumors back to their original source. If a rumor sounds too rich to be true, it probably is. If you've never heard of that original source -- even if the name sounds official! -- give it a double check. \nHave fun out there.",

      "text": "Tweet \nWhile Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg insists his platform’s fake news problem had no impact on the outcome of the election, several of his employees are reportedly banding together against their boss to address the issue. \nAccording to a BuzzFeed News report , an unofficial task force has been formed to explore the role Facebook might have played in the promotion of bogus news reports that led up to President-elect Donald Trump’s unexpected victory last week. \n“It’s not a crazy idea. What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,” one unnamed Facebook employee, who works in the engineering division, told the news site after Zuckerberg said it was a “ pretty crazy idea ” to suggest the social media platform played a role in the election. \nEven Bobby Goodlatte, son of Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R) and one of Facebook’s designers, admitted the networking medium has a problem with fake news. “Sadly, News Feed optimizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bulls**t is highly engaging. These outlets, and Donald Trump, have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement,” he wrote in a Facebook post . \nIn his statement, Goodlatte specifically pointed out a few highly trafficked websites: Breitbart, Vox and the Huffington Post, among others. \nThe group, which according to BuzzFeed consists of “more than dozens” of employees, is currently meeting privately and plans to present their findings to company leadership once they are finalized. Holding these clandestine meetings allows those involved to speak freely and openly about their concerns. \nAn October BuzzFeed report determined that three big left-wing websites published incorrect or misleading information in 20 percent of their posts and three highly-trafficked right-wing sites published incorrect or misleading content 38 percent of the time. \nRegardless, this rebellious bunch is going against the brass, rejecting Zuckerberg’s denial that Facebook swayed the presidential election results.",

      "text": "Follow The Fan: Facebook | Twitter \nTony Romo’s career is not supposed to end like this. \nOur most beloved stories give us a false sense of normalcy. \nWe’ve watched enough film or television over the years to know there has to be more. We’re familiar with story arcs and we crave a sense of finality. \nThe greatest storyteller the world has ever known taught us generations ago that stories do not end in happiness: they end ironically and tragically. And they end without warning. \nRomo’s entire career is an argument left incomplete. That is his lasting legacy. \nWas the snap in Seattle his fault? Bill Parcells has since absorbed the blame. Is he clutch? Romo has more fourth quarter comebacks than any other QB since 1960. Is Romo a winner? He’s an undrafted free agent QB out of Eastern Illinois University, who is 78-49 in the 127 games he started for the Dallas Cowboys. \nTony Romo is objectively a great NFL QB. His place in history will be debated, but the perception of Romo his entire career belies his true greatness. \nHe played through a broken rib in a winner-take-all season finale in 2008 against the Eagles. He broke a rib, punctured a lung and managed to finish a game against the 49ers in 2011. Then, of course, there was the 2013 must win game against the Redskins in Week 16 in which he somehow led the Cowboys to a fourth quarter comeback after he herniated the disc in his back. \nThere was a moment in that game where Romo had just thrown a TD to Demarco Murray on fourth-and-goal from the 10-yard line, trailing by six. There was a moment immediately after he escaped the rush and found Murray a step before he hit the goal line – a moment when you realized the pain he had just played through, and the inevitable pain of knowing he wasn’t going to be able to finish it. \nTony Freaking Romo has thrown for more yards and more touchdowns than any other QB in franchise history. But the Cowboys let Romo down in the prime of his career. They failed to surround him with talent because they were awash in salary cap hell and hit rock bottom in the 2009 draft when they missed on all twelve of their picks. \nFor a decade Romo dragged a lifeless franchise as close as he could get it to the finish line. \nAfter years of missed evaluations on talent and very little organizational direction they decided to invest in their most important asset, an aging all-pro QB. They got a legitimate weapon on the outside in the first round of the 2010 draft. Then, they selected an offensive lineman in the first round of the 2011 draft (a first for Jerry Jones), another in 2013 and again in the first round of the 2014 draft. They gave Romo something he never had: the best offensive line in football. And in 2016 they drafted him a superstar at running back. \nIf “all of the world is a stage,” then Tony Romo is our tragic hero. \nWe all want a perfect ending. You could say the most Romo-esque ending would be Romo hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in Houston after watching as backup to Dak Prescott. \nIn Shakespeare’s tragedies the protagonists succumb because of a fatal character flaw. Maybe Romo’s fatal flaw is in the cosmos. \nMaybe the greatest tragedy will be that his greatness was always misunderstood. Or maybe greatness is best when uncovered in the cracks. \nRomo could still get that perfect, non-Shakespearean ending. That story we’ve all seen – or read – where he takes over the best offense in football and he’s the reason for the Trophy, materialistically justifying an already justified career. \nThere’s nostalgia in wanting to watch Romo do it. \nThere’s logic behind watching Prescott do it. \nThere’s rigidness to this ending. \nThe Cowboys are 8-1. They have the best record in football. They have an offense tailor made to Romo’s exact specifications and it’s being executed flawlessly by a fourth round draft pick that has galvanized the locker room in a way that he hasn’t . . . at least not recently. \nWhat is to come is not better than what has already been of Tony Romo. \nMaybe the greatest endings are the ones left open-ended. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

      "text": "Vandals spray painted 'Heil Trump' on the side of the Episcopal church. (via Facebook) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  22 PM \nIndiana police are looking for the vandal who spray painted pro-Trump graffiti, a swastika and a homophobic slur on an Episcopal church. \nThe priest of St. David’s Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom, a town in southern Indiana, posted photos to social media on Sunday of the vandalism that occurred sometime on Saturday night. \nThe photos show the words “Heil Trump” and “F-- Church” spray painted in black on the exterior of the church. On one side, the vandal emblazoned a swastika. \n“We are disappointed that our safe haven has been vandalized but will not let the actions of a few damper our love of Christ and the world,” the church’s priest Kelsey Hutto, wrote on Facebook. “We will continue to live out our beliefs and acceptance of all people and respecting the dignity of every human being.” Vandals spray painted a swastika and homophobic slurs onto St. David's Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom. (via Facebook) \nAt least 200 racist incidents have been reported since Election Day, according to a tally of hate crimes by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \nMost of the incidents are anti-immigrant or anti-black in nature. \nThe Brown County Sheriff’s Department said they are investigating the church graffiti along with state investigators who are probing “if there are any similarities to other crimes in the area,” according to a statement provided to the Daily News. Vandals spray painted a swastika and homophobic slurs onto St. David's Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom. (via Facebook) \n“A representative of the church said they’ve had no problems with anyone in the area,” the statement read. \nIt’s unclear what other hate crimes occurred in Indiana and whether they are linked to the presidential election. \nAnother Trump-inspired attack targeted an Episcopal church in Silver Spring, Md., overnight on Saturday. \nA Washington D.C. bishop called on Donald Trump to condemn “violence and hate” after the words “Trump nation, White only” were scribbled over a sign advertising Spanish-language services at the Episcopal Diocese in Washington.

      "text": "Facebook and Instagram are finally integrated, sort of Companies now have a unified inbox for Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. Share Save \nFacebook bought Instagram way back in 2012 , but you almost wouldn't know it from how separate they are. Outside of Instagram's options to log in with and post to Facebook, you almost wouldn't know the two entities are connected. However, that's changing in a big way... for the corporate crowd, at least. Facebook is launching a unified Pages Manager inbox that lets businesses see and reply to their Facebook, Messenger and Instagram interactions in one place. If you complain about a faulty product in an Instagram comment, you're just as likely to be answered as if you'd sent a scathing Facebook message. \nSocial media managers can also get a better sense of your history. They'll see your publicly available Facebook or Instagram profile, and will know whether or not you've spoken before. They can even apply labels, so they'll know if your concerns are particularly urgent or if you're a regular. \nEveryone using Pages Manager should see the new inbox available within weeks, and it'll spread to other devices as well. The question is: will regular users see anything like this? Why can't we check our Instagram interactions in Facebook, for example? Still, this is a good sign -- it shows that Facebook is aware of at least some situations where its social networks need tighter integration.",

Image: People pose with laptops in front of projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken in Zenica Fake news has been at the center of a national discussion over the past week, with some accusing Facebook of swaying voters by allowing misinformation on its widely read News Feed, such as the viral post that incorrectly stated the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump. Another post claimed actor Denzel Washington \"backs Trump in the most epic way possible.\"\nMany Americans — 62 percent to be exact — get some news from social media, according to the Pew Research Center. Of that group, 18 percent say they do so \"often.\"\nBut Zuckerberg said the amount of fake news on Facebook is minuscule — though it's not always easy to separate fact from fiction. Some websites post incendiary headlines and have internet addresses that, at first glance, may trick readers into thinking they're reading a story from a legitimate news outlet.\n\"Fake news has become more predominant because the barriers to creating a website and articles are much lower,\" Thales Teixeira, a professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in the \"economics of attention,\" told NBC News.\n© A fake news story posted by \"American News\" on Facebook suggests that Denzel Washington is supportin... Image: Fake news Some register a domain name similar to a legitimate news outlet but add a different suffix, hoping readers won't notice and will think it's a reputable news source.\n\"What has happened with Facebook is they have reduced the exposure of the brand, who wrote the article,\" Teixeira said. \"An article is one in a million. Giving back a little prominence [to major news outlets] is one way to reduce this issue.\"\nAlthough Facebook has always had a policy banning misleading advertisements, the social network made it clearer this week by specifically stating that fake news sites don't meet its criteria for publishers.\nRelated: It Won't Be Easy To Fix Facebook's Fake News Problem\n\"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook representative told NBC News. \"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\"\nWhile Facebook has felt the most heat for the fake news issue, Google is also working on a policy update to ensure its advertising network doesn't serve ads on fake news sites.\n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" a Google representative told NBC News.\nFacebook Under Fire\nMark Zuckerberg has publicly addressed the fake news issue and its possible influence on the election twice over the past week.\nIn a Facebook post on Sunday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated that although News Feed isn't perfect, it would be \"pretty crazy\" to say it swayed the election.\nRelated: What Does Zuckerberg Say About Claims Facebook Influenced the Election?\nWith less than 1 percent of stories being deemed \"hoaxes,\" and only a portion of those political, Zuckerberg said it was \"extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.\"\n\"We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here. We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\nNews Feed relies on various signals, including user feedback, to determine which posts may contain inaccurate information and to then reduce their distribution.\nWhile it's unclear what concrete steps Facebook plans to take in addition to this, Zuckerberg said they'll have to walk a delicate path moving forward to ensure they're not stifling differences of opinion.\n\"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves,\" he wrote.\n© Facebook's trending topics image: Facebook news feed Go to MSN Home",

      "text": "Facebook employees are unofficially trying to defeat fake news Anonymous people within the company feel that the social network didn't do enough to stop pre-election propaganda. Save Shutterstock \nEver since America opted to elect that guy to its highest office, a lot of accusatory fingers have been pointed toward Facebook. After all, the social network has the attention of hundreds of millions of voters and has a reputation for proliferating propaganda. Mark Zuckerberg has refuted the accusation that Facebook's laissez-faire attitude toward fake news contributed to Trump's win, but his employees disagree. BuzzFeed has spoken to several sources within the company that say dozens of workers are privately investigating the company's actions. \nFacebook is quick to censor posts if they contain nudity or other sexual content, but has been noticeably slow at dealing with political content . In the run up to the election, another BuzzFeed investigation found that a group of Macedonian teenagers learned how to game Facebook's newsfeed for money. The result was a slew of pro-Trump content that claimed the Pope had endorsed the candidate, amongst other things. Zuckerberg has often claimed that false content is just \" one percent \" of the site's overall material, but one percent -- when multiplied across the billions of shares every day -- is still a big deal. \nLast week, Zuckerberg spoke at a conference where he said that his site influenced the election was \"crazy.\" One of BuzzFeed's sources said that the only thing crazy about his statement is that he'd dismiss the problem out of hand. The individual went on to say that \"he [Zuckerberg] knows, and those of us at the company know\" just how widely fake news had proliferated across the site. The anonymous sources also said that they'd been warned by Facebook chiefs not to talk to the media and risked losing their jobs for doing so. \nFacebook's been something of a leaky ship over the last few days, with many sources telling reporters the site didn't do enough. Gizmodo reported that the company did develop a tool that would better target and delete fake news from the site. But the platform was shelved when executives found out that it would impact right wing sites far more than other outlets. It's believed that they were worried about appearing biased in the wake of an earlier scandal where human curators claimed to have been instructed to suppress conservative news . Facebook has denied all of the above, of course. \nFacebook's CEO has also spoken out about preserving \" diversity \" on his company's board by supporting Peter Thiel. At that same conference, Zuckerberg also said that the problem with this election wasn't that his site was awash with fake news, but with engagement. In the words of former Facebook employee Bobby Goodlatte, \" bullshit is highly engaging .\"",

Tickets are $3.50 in advance and $5.00 day of show. VIP passes are also available for $20.00 or free with any $10 purchase at participating Rose's Department Stores. Call now, tickets will sell out!\" \nThe invite went out to 5,500 people, it said, and 2,200 people RSVP'd that they would be there. \nFamous tech photographer Eric Pickersgill was among them. \n\"I got a notification on Facebook that a friend was going to this fake event about an hour from Charlotte. The local news was covering it. No one knew if it was really happeneing,\" Pickersgill told Business Insider. \nBut when he arrived he confirmed his suspicions. The whole thing was a joke. The band was never scheduled to play and most of the people who RSVP'd knew it was a prank and stayed away. \nPickersgill was one of the folks that showed up and it set off a six month obsession with fake Facebook events and the people who show up to them. \nHe put together his experience in a funny, sad, insightful new photography project he calls \"No Show \" and shared some of the photos with Business Insider. View As: One Page Slides Eric Pickersgill skyrocketed to fame after the surreal images of his project called \"Removed\" went viral. It shows just how weirdly focused people are on their devices instead of each other. Here's one with Pickersgill and his wife in bed, phones removed from the shot.",

Posted 16 Nov 2016 04:55 Google and Facebook cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites. (AFP/Josh Edelson) A \nWASHINGTON: Google and Facebook moved on Tuesday (Nov 15) to cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites, acting after criticism of the role fake news played in the US presidential election. \n\"We've been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,\" a Google statement to AFP said. \n\"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.\" \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC the matter was \"a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.\" \nFacebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. \n\"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook statement said. \n\"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.\" \nGoogle's Pichai said there should be \"no situation where fake news gets distributed\" and committed to making improvements. \n\"I don't think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,\" he said. \nThe electoral victory of Donald Trump has sparked heightened scrutiny of online and social media, especially the role of bogus news that appeared to help rally Trump supporters. \nSome news stories which went viral included headlines such as \"Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected\" and \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.\" \nOn Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Trump won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70 News - contradicting official results tallied so far by states - said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the Electoral College to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. - AFP/de",

      "text": "Leanna Taylor is not “okay” — and hasn’t been for a long time — she said in a Monday Facebook post after her ex-husband, Justin Ross Harris , was convicted of murder after intentionally leaving their 22-month-old son, Cooper, to die in a hot car .\nTaylor, who reverted to her maiden name after divorcing Harris following his arrest, also defended her ex in her Facebook post, while sharing the pain she is still in.\n“For those of you who want to know if I am ok. The answer is no,” she wrote. “I have not been ‘ok’ since the moment I was told my son was dead. I have not been ‘ok’ since the moment my life was put on this path that has led to Ross being found guilty of maliciously murdering our child.”\n“So now you may be saying ‘justice has been served,’ ” she continued. “And you are allowed your right to that opinion. But guess what, you can convict every parent that this has ever happened to, and I can promise you 2 things…#1 it will never bring our children back and #2 it will not prevent this from happening in the future.”\nThough prosecutors argued Harris visited online communities for the “child-free” lifestyle, and even researched the deadly effects of being in a hot car, he has always maintained his son’s death was a tragic accident, not murder. Taylor echoed that in her post on Monday.\n“Next summer, as this begins to happen over and over again, ask yourself, ‘what can be done?!’ The problem is not the parent!” she wrote. “The problem is a society that refuses to believe this can happen to them! Wake up! Accept it! And by accepting it you will be protecting your child!”\n(Harris’ attorney has said they will appeal the guilty verdict and reiterated his innocence.)\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

It does not matter! Your opinion will never bring back my son. So called ‘justice’ will never bring back my son.”\nLeanna Taylor testifies on Oct. 31, 2016, during Justin Ross Harris’ murder trial. John Bazemore/AP “Nothing will ever take that pain away,” Taylor’s Facebook post concluded. “And nothing will ever feel worse than living with the knowledge that his pain and his death could have been prevented.\n“Be the wise parent, and accept that this can happen. And you will never have to walk the path that my family has had to walk. And I pray YOU never have to walk this path.”\nWhile Taylor has continually defended Harris, arguing that he didn’t intentionally kill their son and was a “wonderful father,” she testified in court that she never wants to see her ex-husband again — following allegations about his marital infidelities with prostitutes and sexting with multiple women , some as young as 16.\n“This whole trial has been unbelievably hurtful to her,” a source close to Taylor previously told PEOPLE . “[The former escort’s] testimony in particular has been painful and infuriating. She really wanted the house and the kids and the picket fence with Ross, and it was all taken away from her.”\n(The source says there will be no additional comment from Taylor, beyond her Facebook post.)\n“He ruined my life. He destroyed my life,” Taylor testified during Harris’ trial . “I’m humiliated, I may never trust anybody again the way that I did. If I never see him again in my life after this day, that’s fine.”",

      "text": "International Business Google, Facebook take aim at 'fake' news Google and Facebook moved on Tuesday to cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites, acting after criticism of the role fake news played in the US presidential election. Posted 16 Nov 2016 04:55 Updated 16 Nov 2016 05:47 Google and Facebook cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites. (AFP/Josh Edelson) A \nWASHINGTON: Google and Facebook moved on Tuesday (Nov 15) to cut off advertising revenue to fake news sites, after a wave of criticism over the role misinformation played in the US presidential election. \nThe move by the two tech giants aims to choke off funds to an industry fuelled by bogus, often sensational \"news\" circulating online and seen as a potential influence on public opinion. \nA Google statement to AFP said new policies \"will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies.\" \nThe shift will mean Google restricts ads \"on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property,\" the statement said. \nGoogle chief executive Sundar Pichai said the company receives billions of queries daily and admitted errors had been made. \n\"There have been a couple of incidences where it has been pointed out and we didn't get it right. And so it is a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it,\" he said in a BBC interview. \nPichai said there should be \"no situation where fake news gets distributed\" and committed to making improvements. \n\"I don't think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,\" he said. \nOn Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Republican Donald Trump had won the popular vote in addition to the electoral college. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70News - contradicting official results tallied so far by states - said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the electoral college to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort. \nEXPLICIT BAN \nFacebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. \n\"In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" a Facebook statement said. \n\"While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news.\" \nOne report said Facebook had developed a tool to weed out fake news but did not deploy it before the US election, fearing a backlash from conservatives after a controversy over its handling of \"trending topics.\" Facebook denied the report. \nSome critics have gone so far as to blame Facebook for enabling Trump's victory, saying it did not do enough to curb bogus news that appeared to help rally his supporters. \nStories that went viral in the run-up to the vote included such headlines as \"Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected\" and \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.\" \nThe prevalence of fake news has prompted calls for Facebook to consider itself a \"media\" company rather than a neutral platform, a move which would require it to make editorial judgments on articles. \nFacebook executives have repeatedly rejected this idea, but since the election have pledged to work harder to filter out hoaxes and misinformation. \nIn a weekend post, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion that fake news helped sway the election, and said that \"more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic.\" \nStill, he said that \"we don't want any hoaxes on Facebook\" and pledged to do more to curb fake news without censoring content. \"Identifying the 'truth' is complicated,\" he said. \n\"While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\" \nKen Paulson, a former USA Today editor who is dean at the media school of Middle Tennessee State University, said Facebook and other platforms should not be required to filter out news but that it would be good for business. \n\"My hunch is that most of Facebook's loyal customers would welcome a cleaning up of the town square,\" he said. - AFP/de",

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has tried to downplay Facebook's role in the election.\nPhoto by James Martin/CNET Donald Trump won the popular vote.\nThe Clinton Foundation bought $137 million worth of illegal arms and ammunition.\nAn FBI agent associated with Hillary Clinton's email leaks was found dead in a murder-suicide.\nThe Pope endorsed Trump.\nIf you saw any of these stories on the internet over the past few weeks, let's be crystal clear: They're not true.\nBut you might not have known that if you saw them on Google or Facebook. Google listed the popular-vote story prominently on Google News on Monday for those searching for election results . The other stories made the rounds, unchecked, on Facebook, where they racked up likes, shares and views.\nThat's a problem because Facebook and Google are now two of the largest and most popular sites on the internet. They're also the Hungry Hungry Hippos of digital ad dollars. Between them, they draw billions of visitors a day. So if Facebook and Google have a fake news problem, there's an argument to be made that the internet itself has a fake news problem. And that's not good for the general public.\n\"The lion's share of our research around the role of digital and social media in the news environment suggests it's playing a pretty significant role in the habits of America,\" said Jesse Holcomb, associate director of research for the Pew Research Center in Washington, DC.\nA 'black box' What's more, about four out of every 10 Americans get their news online, he added. So if Google and Facebook spotlight bogus stories, those stories can gain a lot of traction.\n\"Google is an important source of news for people who tend to fall toward the middle of the ideological spectrum,\" Holcomb said. Google is a \"generally trusted source of news,\" while Facebook \"casts a shadow over the whole social web.\"\nThe concern over fake news has reached a fever pitch since November 8, when Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, won the US presidency in a victory few predicted. In the aftermath of the election, his detractors have alleged that fake news circulating on Facebook and other sites helped him win.\nEnlarge Image Google said it made a mistake in featuring a fake news article about Donald Trump so prominently in Google News.\nPhoto by CNET What frustrates some media experts is how hard it is to understand the internet giants' algorithms, the technical formulas they use for promoting and sharing stories. Both Google and Facebook have published guides about the type of signals they use to decide what you see or don't see online. For example, over the weekend, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a note on his personal page linking to Facebook's blog on how news feed evolves .\nA Facebook spokesman declined to comment beyond Zuckerberg's post. A Google spokeswoman said its ranking algorithms look at more than 200 different signals , but said the company doesn't go into great detail so sites can't game the system.\nStill, researchers would like to know more.\n\"People don't really know how endemic the problem really is because Facebook's algorithms are opaque to researchers,\" said Jeremy Rue , acting assistant dean at the University of California, Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism. \"A lot of people are going to start taking a closer look.\"\nMary Bock, an assistant professor of journalism at the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, echoed the sentiment. \"Google delivers what other people have clicked on,\" Bock said. Still, she said, \"the algorithm is a black box.\"\nNot so 'crazy?' Zuckerberg denied that fake news on Facebook tipped the scale of the election. Last week, he called the notion a \"pretty crazy idea.\" And on Saturday, he wrote a lengthy note on his Facebook page reiterating that fake news amounts to less than 1 percent of all the content on the site. He didn't say what percentage of \"news\" content is fake, though.\nNot everyone agrees with Zuckerberg, who is insistent that Facebook doesn't have the power to influence how people think and behave -- or vote.\n\"The size of the Facebook news audience strikes me as a remarkable amount of influence for one company to have, especially given they don't consider themselves a news organization,\" said Pew's Holcomb.\nSome unhappy Facebook employees feel the same way. A few of them formed a task force with the purpose of questioning Facebook's role in promoting fake news, according to a report Monday by BuzzFeed . One of those employees directly opposed Zuckerberg's stance: \"It's not a crazy idea,\" that person told BuzzFeed. The social network's top brass have also held meetings on the fake news topic, according to the New York Times .\nGoogle, for its part, said Monday that it made a mistake in allowing a fake story to be featured so prominently on Google News. It also said it won't let fake news sites use its ad-selling software . The search giant plans to enforce that new rule the way it does its other policies, through a combination of automated systems and human review.\nJoining the fight Where do we go from here?\nJeff Jarvis, an author and media critic, said the most important thing for the media to do is make sure Google and Facebook aren't in a position to kill news they deem as fake. That puts too much editorial power in their hands, he argued.\nNeither company seems interested in doing that.\nZuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that the social network needs to be careful about becoming an \"arbiter of truth.\" Google, meanwhile, has said it will only remove search results if they contain things like illegal content or malware. That means fake news could keep getting through.\nJarvis thinks Facebook should solicit the media to help fight the phony stories. Facebook could come up with new tags for stories that debunk fake news and put them in related stories boxes. Or, if something has been tagged as fake a certain number of times, Facebook could add a popup box or alert that asks people if they are sure they want to share the story, he said.\nIt's also important to remember that this is the internet. There will always be bad actors.\n\"Any system can be gamed,\" Jarvis said.\nFor now, that means being aware of what you're reading and what's in your news feed. That news may not be news at all.\nCNET's Connie Guglielmo, Terry Collins and Joan E. Solsman contributed to this report.",

(CBS) \nSAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) – Facing criticism over fake news stories that have proliferated during the election season, both Google and Facebook have announced changes to crack down on such sites. \nAccording to The Associated Press, Google announced Monday that it would ban its ad software from appearing on sites that “misrepresent, misstate or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose.” \nAlso on Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook also banned fake news sites from using the company’s advertising network. \n“While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson told the newspaper. \nOn Monday, Google faced scrutiny after users searching for “final election numbers” were led to a fake news site called “70 News” that claimed Donald Trump had won the popular vote over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. To come up with its numbers, 70 News sourced another fake news site that did not have the numbers and laid out its own conspiracy theory on how Trump won the popular vote. \nMultiple news sources, including CBS News , CNN and Fox News have said Clinton continues to have a lead in the popular vote as of Tuesday morning. Clinton’s lead in the popular vote is expected to grow, as votes from California and Washington continue to be counted. \nFacebook is also dealing with criticism of fake campaign stories being shared, along with fake news becoming highlighted on the site’s “Trending Topics” section after human editors were fired in favor of using an algorithm. \nAfter Tuesday’s vote, CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the idea of such stories influencing the outcome of the election. \nTM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "text": "Facebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election. Its predicament stems from this basic conundrum: It exercises great control over the news its users see, but it declines to assume the editorial responsibility that traditional publishers do.\nOn Monday, Facebook took a minor step to address the issue, clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won't display ads on sites that run information that is \"illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.\" The company said it was merely making explicit a policy that was already implied.\nIts move followed a similar step by Google earlier on Monday, after the search giant acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories.\nIn the case of both companies, the aim is to discourage fake-news sites by depriving them of revenue.\nFacebook is also said to be facing brewing internal turmoil over its influence and what it can and should do about it.\nEmployees have expressed concern over Facebook's role in spreading misinformation and racist memes largely associated with the alt-right, according to The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Some have reportedly formed an unofficial task force to investigate the role the company played in the election.\nFacebook's Zuckerberg says fake news didn't drive election Sarah Frier Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\n(Sarah Frier) Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg , however, insists that Facebook remains a neutral technology platform where its users can share anything they want, with only a tiny fraction of it fake or problematic.\nLast week, Zuckerberg called the idea that voters might have been influenced by what they saw on Facebook — fake, uber-partisan stories, such as a false one about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump for president — \"pretty crazy.\"\nFACEBOOK CONTROL \nAfter it's fooled by fake election news, Google pulls ads from fake news sites Tribune news services Google's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers.\nThe incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on...\nGoogle's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers.\nThe incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on...\n(Tribune news services) People update to Facebook so frequently that the company has no choice but to filter what everyone sees in their news feeds — the main artery through which users see posts from their friends, family, businesses, news sources and celebrities they follow.\nThe company's secret algorithms are designed to deliver the posts from friends and other sources that will draw people in and lead them to read and click and \"like\" and share — \"maximizing their engagement,\" in Facebook's jargon.\nFacebook frequently tweaks its algorithm to improve engagement. Various changes have been aimed at shutting out sites that promote clickbait and other garbage that users say they don't want to see, even as they click on it and share away. When users are surrounded by posts they want to see, they're more likely to stick around.\nThat's key to Facebook's advertising business. But it can be problematic when it comes to false but highly interesting posts.\nFacebook's news feed \"maximizes for engagement. As we've learned in this election, bulls--t is highly engaging,\" former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte wrote in an Election Day post. \"Highly partisan, fact-light outlets\" on both the right and the left, he wrote, \"have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement. ... It's now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bulls--t.\"\nSocial media companies today have to acknowledge that they are news organizations, said Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of the Newseum, a journalism museum in Washington. \"Not like news companies of the 20th century,\" he added. \"But not just pipes where people get their news. They determine what is news.\"\nIn a post Saturday night, Zuckerberg rejected that idea.\n\"News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\" he wrote. \"Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family.\"\nFACEBOOK AS NEWSPAPER — NO, SCRATCH THAT \nBack in 2013, Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to be people's \"own personal newspaper,\" one that delivers the stories most interesting and important to them. That's still the company's goal — though minus any reference to itself as a media company of any kind.\nOf course, fake stuff has existed on the internet long before Facebook. And under the law, Facebook is no more responsible for what appears on its site than \"the paper mills that print newspapers are responsible for their content,\" said Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who studies communication technology.\nAt the same time, Jones said he thinks the broader issue of Facebook's responsibility is one that's going to be \"debated forever.\"\n\"Even the notion of truth is something that's highly contested at this point,\" he said.\nAssociated Press",

The latter should strangle websites that deliberately publish misleading content by cutting off their advertising revenue. \nYet despite these gestures, Facebook is unlikely to explore the many options available to it because it simply has very little motivation to do so, experts believe. \n“Although Mark Zuckerberg is being polite about it, there’s absolutely no way that Facebook will start preventing people from sharing what they want to share. That’s the core idea of the site,” said writer and professor Clay Shirky, who studies social networks. \nFacebook’s business model relies on people clicking, sharing and engaging with content – photos, memes, opinions, news and gossip – regardless of veracity. “People trade untrue stories that encapsulate things they believe about the world all the time,” he said. “Facebook is in the business of letting people share stuff they are interested in.” \nPreventing any of that sharing interferes with core user behavior. “People share stuff because their mom might like it. My mom likes the pope, she likes Trump so she’ll be pleased that the pope supports Trump.” People don’t feel duped. We love bedtime stories. We don’t want someone telling us our cherished beliefs are false Clay Shirky, academic and writer \nIt doesn’t make sense for Facebook to apply traditional news publishing values such as verification to the network where a Pepe the Frog meme can carry as much currency as a New York Times op-ed . Facebook is only motivated to censor content when it makes users unhappy, which is why it efficiently polices content it deems to contain nudity, violence and harassment. \nBut don’t people want to avoid being duped? “People who are told the pope supports their candidate don’t feel duped,” Shirky said. “We love bedtime stories. We don’t want someone telling us which of our cherished beliefs are false.” \nHe highlights the absurdity of the task with a thought experiment. “Imagine, for a moment, Facebook adding a line to every story about Christianity saying there’s no scientific evidence that Jesus came back from the dead.” \nShirky acknowledges the dilemma of websites that purposefully create fake news to game the system for clicks and advertising revenue. However, he places the onus on the source of the story – the website creating the content – rather than the place it is being shared, ie Facebook. \nFacebook is an example of mass amateurization – millions of amateur publishers sharing content. “It simply cannot behave like a professional platform,” he said. “And yet if society doesn’t have a place that polices true stories, it will be a terrible loss for us.” How to spot fake news \nIf Facebook won’t tackle the problem head-on, who will? \nThe Trust Project thinks it has some of the answers. Launched in October 2014, the coalition of more than 60 news media outlets (including the Guardian), as well as academics and social networks, has tried to restore the trusted role of the press in civic life. The coalition aims to establish clear guidelines and trust metrics that could help both consumers and technology companies – through their ranking algorithms – by giving more weight to higher quality sources. \n“In today’s burgeoning and chaotic news ecosystem, it is difficult to parse truth from falsehood, wisdom from spin. Legacy newspapers, digital media ventures, sponsored content and social media clamor for our attention,” the project’s leaders, Richard Gingras and Sally Lehrman, said when it launched . \n“We have seen a decline in trust in the media over a period of decades and the polarization across what types of media are trusted,” Lehrman told the Guardian. “There’s very high trust of Fox News among conservatives who say they don’t trust the media in general. Liberals are more likely to trust the news, particularly NPR, CNN and the New York Times,” she added, citing the Reuters Institute’s 2015 digital news report . \n“Fake news is part of the problem, but there’s also news that’s poorly sourced and produced, as well as advertising and propaganda. We are trying to help people identify the difference.” ‘Fake news is part of the problem, but there’s also news that’s poorly sourced and produced, as well as advertising and propaganda.’ Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA \nWorking with news organizations across the US and Europe, as well as interviews with the public, the Trust Project compiled a priority list of possible trust indicators . These include getting news organizations to meet a set of best practices including verification, having an ethics policy, diversity policy and revealing ownership structure and funding sources. \nOther indicators include author biographies covering areas of expertise and experience; citations and references; and labels to indicate whether a piece is news, analysis, opinion or advertising; whether a story contains original reporting; whether it includes diverse voices; whether there’s a way for members of the public to provide feedback to the newsroom and whether reporters are local to the news event. \nThese indicators should be useful to both members of the public and the algorithms that rank and distribute news content, including those developed by Facebook, Twitter and Google. \nThe Trust Project has organized a hackathon at the end of November to see if these indicators can be incorporated into newsroom workflow and easily surfaced on distribution platforms. \n“We’ve been talking to social media including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to get them on board, and they’ve all expressed a lot of interest. We’d like to see how we can work together to implement and find ways to apply the indicators,” Lehrman said. \nOf course, Facebook would still have to incorporate these new signals into its algorithm, but it wouldn’t have to make individual editorial judgements per se (even though it’s already doing this in some cases ). If we can stop spam, why not fake news? \nBut what’s in it for Facebook? Investor and writer Om Malik thinks that Facebook might be motivated to change to avoid looking bad. \n“This is a company that talks about artificial intelligence and the idea that it can’t deal with fake news shows it’s not intelligent at all. It’s super dumb,” he said. “If I am running a platform there’s a huge difference between the Guardian, the New York Times and fake sites spreading bullshit.” Facebook staff mount secret push to tackle fake news, reports say Read more \nFacebook, in his view, should treat fake news in the same way that email providers treat spam. “We keep getting spam in email and yet we are able to stop it. There have to be solutions to spammy information inside platforms like Facebook.” \nMalik suggests that Facebook is commercially motivated to keep fake news on the platform. “As long as people are engaged and stay on the network, it works for them.” \nHowever, as demonstrated by a YouGov poll, people do care about the spread of false information on Facebook . Some 72% of people said that Facebook should filter out fake news stories and hoaxes. \nIn the long run, the spread of misinformation could erode trust in the entire system. “They can’t wash their hands and say, ‘We don’t want to interfere’,” Malik said. “Why should we then believe any video stream or any brand that appears on Facebook?” \nDespite the stern words, Malik thinks that the fake news fiasco is a temporary blip, though he says he welcomes the pressure being applied by the media trying to encourage it to be more thoughtful about the quality and influence of the content shared on its platform. \nFor Shirky, the problem is much bigger than Facebook and is actually about the way that the internet challenges traditional institutions – in this case the media. In this way Facebook’s problem, he says, reflects some of the challenges Airbnb faces. \n“When an institution lasts a long time, society layers a whole bunch of rules and regulations on top of that institution. When the institution changes, those rules and regulations break,” he said, pointing to Airbnb’s problems dealing with racism among its hosts. “We allow individual homeowners to say who can and can’t stay in their home. We require hotels to offer accommodations to people with no regard to race. So what happens when you build a hotel out of individual hotel owners?” \nSimilarly, Facebook’s current structural challenge is misinformation. “You can’t simply take the rules of the old institution and slap it onto news ones. This requires a deep renegotiation. \n“Facebook absorbed the news media and now we want them to behave like editors. It’s impossible to enforce.” ",

      "text": "Google, Facebook choke ‘fake’ news sites of ads Agence France-Presse / 07:55 AM November 16, 2016 Google and Facebook are cutting off advertising to so-called ‘fake news’ sites. Photo shows a Facebook post that asked if news that Pope Francis endorsed Donald Trump was true. The report has been proven false. FACEBOOK SCREENGRAB \nWASHINGTON, United States — Google and Facebook moved Tuesday to cut off advertising revenue to bogus news sites, acting after criticism of the role fake news played in the US presidential election. \n“We’ve been working on an update to our publisher policies and will start prohibiting Google ads from being placed on misrepresentative content, just as we disallow misrepresentation in our ads policies,” a Google statement to AFP said. \n“Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” ADVERTISEMENT \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC the matter was “a learning moment for us and we will definitely work to fix it.” \nFacebook is implementing a similar policy, a spokesman said. \n“In accordance with the Audience Network Policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,” a Facebook statement said. \n“While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” \n“Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” \nGoogle’s Pichai said there should be “no situation where fake news gets distributed” and committed to making improvements. \n“I don’t think we should debate it as much as work hard to make sure we drive news to its more trusted sources, have more fact checking and make our algorithms work better, absolutely,” he said. \nThe electoral victory of Donald Trump has sparked heightened scrutiny of online and social media, especially the role of bogus news that appeared to help rally Trump supporters. \nSome news stories which went viral included headlines such as “Hillary Clinton Calling for Civil War If Trump Is Elected” and “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President.” \nOn Monday, internet users searching on Google were delivered a bogus report saying Trump won the popular vote in addition to the Electoral College. \nThe numbers on a blog called 70 News — contradicting official results tallied so far by states — said Trump received 62.9 million votes to 62.2 million for Hillary Clinton. \nThe blog urged those petitioning for the Electoral College to switch their votes to reflect popular will to scrap their effort.

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A gunman lay in wait outside Oklahoma City’s Will Rogers World Airport on Tuesday before shooting and killing a Southwest Airlines employee in a premeditated attack that occurred while hundreds of people waited for flights nearby, police said. \nMichael Winchester, 52, was shot while walking between a crowded terminal and the airport employee parking area. The unidentified suspect was later found dead in a pickup truck in public parking garage overlooking the scene. Police said the suspect appeared to die of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \nOklahoma City Police Capt. Paco Balderrama said the shooter apparently knew the victim’s schedule and routine. \n“This individual went there and waited for the employee to either be coming or going to take this opportunity,” Balderrama said. He wouldn’t say conclusively that it was a “sniper-type” attack. \nThe 1 p.m. shooting set off a scramble at the airport, with police immediately closing the sprawling complex and asking passengers inside to seek cover. \nThey diverted incoming flights and refused to give already-loaded aircraft permission to leave. There were concerns the gunman might have entered the terminal and mingled among passengers or employees. \n“We have a heightened level of security all the time. These people have access to aircraft so we’re very concerned about that,” airport spokeswoman Karen Carney said. \nWinchester— whose address is listed as Washington, Oklahoma, about 35 miles south of the airport — was a former University of Oklahoma football player whose son James is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs. \n“It is with great sorrow that Southwest Airlines confirms that a Southwest Employee who was injured during a shooting incident today at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City has died from injuries,” the airline said in a statement. It canceled flights out of the city for the remainder of the day even though the rest of the terminal planned to reopen. \nHundreds of people were stranded inside the terminal for more than three hours before officers began letting them leave slowly. Carney said about 300 people were held on aircraft away from the terminal after their planes landed ahead of a ground stop. \nOnce police determined that a suspect found in a red pickup truck on the second floor of a public parking garage was dead, officers gave an all-clear. \nThe airport handles between 7,000 and 8,000 passengers daily for Alaska, Delta, Southwest and United airlines and has a separate terminal that serves as a transfer center for federal inmates. A jet carrying inmates to the transfer site was allowed to land while the rest of the airport was shuttered. \nVideo from a television station helicopter showed what appeared to be a pool of blood about 100 feet from the airport’s employee parking area — and about 100 yards from the airport’s ticket counters and departure area. \nWhile airports have high security, it wasn’t immediately known whether surveillance cameras might show the shooting, Balderrama said. \nBalderrama initially said police had received reports of a possible second victim, but no one was found. \nPolice found the suspect’s truck in the garage about three hours after the shooting and determined that someone was inside. They were not sure whether he was dead or alive. After about 75 minutes, using a robot, officers determined the suspect was dead. \nA number of inbound flights were diverted to other airports after Will Rogers suspended operations. Southwest redirected one flight back to Dallas while a Las Vegas to Houston flight that stops in Oklahoma City went to Amarillo, Texas, instead. Two commercial flights from Chicago’s O’Hare Airport were directed to Tulsa, about 100 miles away. \nMichael Winchester was a punter on the University of Oklahoma’s 1985 national championship team. \n“Our hearts are truly heavy for the entire Winchester Family. Mike was a former Sooner student athlete as was his son James/daughter Carolyn,” the school’s athletic director, Joe Castiglione, tweeted Tuesday afternoon. He added “daughter Becca was also a student athlete. Please keep this beautiful family in your prayers” in a later tweet. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Washington (AFP) - A mayor from West Virginia has resigned amid a furor over a racist Facebook post that described First Lady Michelle Obama as an \"ape in heels,\" US media said. Beverly Whaling, the mayor of the tiny town of Clay, had appeared to applaud the incendiary comment and stepped down Tuesday amid the ensuing firestorm.\nLocal television news channel WSAZ confirmed that Whaling had resigned.\nAccording to WSAZ, Clay County Development Corp. director Pamela Ramsey Taylor had posted after Donald Trump's election: \"It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\"\nWhaling responded: \"Just made my day Pam.\"\nThe comments were later deleted and both women's Facebook pages were eventually taken offline, The Washington Post reported citing local media.\nStaffers at the Clay County Development Corp. told WSAZ that Taylor had been removed from her position.\nBarack Obama's eight years in office have been marred by racial slurs against the nation's first African American president and his family.\nClay has a population of less than 500, according to the 2010 census, and is the seat of Clay County in West Virginia.\nThe furor over the racist comment, and the mayor's seemingly agreeable response, prompted an online petition drive to have the two women ousted.\nThe text on www.thepetitionsite.com gathered nearly 160,000 signatures from across the country.\nWhaling had apologized in a statement Monday to The Washington Post, writing: \"My comment was not intended to be racist at all.\"\nMichelle Obama emerged as a hugely popular surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.\nTrump, a billionaire businessman, won West Virginia's five electoral votes, helping him to his unexpected triumph over Clinton.",

      "text": "share This is how the world looks on Facebook's population maps The social network is mapping rural regions across the globe in an effort to bring communication technologies to disconnected areas. Save Malawi (Lilongwe and environs) CIESIN \nFacebook's Connectivity Lab today released its high-resolution population maps for Malawi, South Africa, Ghana, Haiti and Sri Lanka, with the promise to make more datasets available over the coming months. The population maps are a joint effort between the Facebook Connectivity Lab, Columbia University and the World Bank, though Facebook is interested in the project as part of its effort to launch wireless communication services in rural regions around the globe. \nFacebook and friends used software to identify buildings in commercially available satellite images, and then estimated population using census data and a few other surveys and programs. Convolutional neural networks powered a model capable of identifying individual buildings in images from across the world. \n\"There has been a lot of work recently on neural networks that can recognize individual buildings with very high accuracy, but these models are finely tuned on the local characteristics of the region where they are trained,\" the Connectivity Lab's Tobias Tiecke writes . \"We found that these models do not perform well at a global scale with realistic amounts of training data. Therefore, we developed a model that is trained only on binary labeled data -- if an image does or does not contain a building -- which allows for fast acquisition of the training data.\" \nFacebook's preliminary findings suggest that of the 23 countries it studied, 99 percent of the population lives within 63 km of the nearest city, with 44 percent of people living in cities. \n\"Hence, if we are able to develop communication technologies that can bridge 63 km with sufficiently high data rates, we should be able to connect 99 percent of the population in these 23 countries,\" Tiecke says. \nFacebook has been toying with a handful of options for rural communication technologies , including the shoebox-size OpenCellular platform and a satellite initiative. The population maps will help Facebook streamline its designs. \n\"We would love to hear ideas (preferably also in an open manner) on how to bridge this distance in an economically viable fashion for line of sight and non-line of sight use cases, and we hope that by sharing these datasets we will stimulate further research,\" Tiecke says.",

      "text": "“Anti-smartphone” Light Phone runs into delays Posted Crunch Report | Facebook’s Fake News Problem \nFor people who feel that we are a little bit too connected these days, Kickstarter project Light Phone was promising a respite. It was scheduled to ship in May this year, but has seen a number of setbacks. This week, the company issued a statement . It says that while it missed its goal, it hopes to start shipping late this month. \nLight Phone’s goal was to be the opposite of a smartphone . Including a 2G SIM card and the ability to take and make calls only, the phone aimed to have three weeks worth of battery life on a single charge. Tiny, pretty, and with a three-week battery life. What’s not to love? \nThe company suggests “A few limitations in our initial user experience goals due to some iOS restrictions” is the reason the device is shipping late, but the company has received some criticism for how it has handled its Kickstarter campaign, too. It hasn’t posted any public updates since August last year , instead opting to post updates exclusively to its campaign backers. Not a big problem for backers, of course, but a bit iffy to those of us who were following the company’s progress from the sidelines. Related Articles Samsung is looking for Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge owners to test Android 7.0 on their phones Burner, a service that generates temporary phone numbers, makes it easier to ghost conversations Budget US Android smartphones found secretly sending personal data to China The company came under fire for only offering a dated cell technology for the telephony side of the phone, suggesting that relying on 2G may have been a poor solution. In some countries, the 2G network is scheduled to be switched off soon. “Australian 2G is being switched off on 1st December 2016,” one backer writes, referring to the first round of switch-flicking during a 9-month shutdown process of 2G networks down under. The Light Phone company, in turn, offered to refund backers in countries where the phones would no longer be usable.\nWhen the Light Phone was first announced about 18 months ago, it seemed like a novel and interesting idea. At $100 per device, it’s undoubtedly cool, but the device is also entering a spectacularly competitive space. You can pick up a no-name quad-band phone for a seventh of the price, and most carriers will let you turn off SMS functionality altogether, if you feel passionate about only receiving phone calls. That raises the question; who is the Light Phone actually for ? \nI look forward to trying the Light Phone out and learning what it feels like to live a life without fending off the barrage of social media notifications. Realistically, however, if this was a problem someone was passionate about solving, they’d have found a way of turning off the notifications or get a no-features burner phone already. \nDon’t get me wrong, I love the design and the general concept, but it can’t be denied that creating a phone is a complicated process. On top of that, the types of radios used in mobile phones is heavily regulated throughout the world. The icing on the “hmm, is this gonna work” cookie: in telecoms R&D and manufacturing, a $400k budget (the amount the company raised from Kickstarter) to bring a product to market is an incredibly daunting prospect. \nEither way, Light Phone is an incredibly inspiring company; it takes some serious focus and dedication to bring a complex product in this space from cocktail napkin to brick-and-mortar shops. The company is bringing a fresh pair of eyes to the humble mobile phone, and I’ll be cheering them on from the sidelines. 0",

      "title": "Why Facebook and Google are struggling to purge fake news",
      "text": "November 15 at 7:31 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @caitlindewey Follow @craigtimberg Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took to the social network’s website over the weekend to dispute allegations that “fake news” had tilted the election for Republican Donald Trump. “More than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote, adding it was “extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election.”\nBut such reassurances have buckled under mounting criticism. On late Monday, Zuckerberg acted, joining Google in taking the most serious steps yet to crack down on purveyors of phony stories by cutting off a critical source of funding — the ads that online platforms have long funneled to creators of popular content.\n[ No, this video does not show Obama urging undocumented people to vote ]\nThe move has raised new questions about long-standing claims by Facebook, Google and other online platforms that they have little responsibility to exert editorial control over the news they deliver to billions of people, even when it includes outright lies, falsehoods or propaganda that could tilt elections.\nSuch claims became increasingly unsustainable amid reports that News Feed and Trending Topics, two core Facebook products, had promoted a number of false, misleading and fantastical political stories, such as an article saying Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump, which was shared by over 100,000 users. There were “vote online” memes that assured Democrats in Pennsylvania that they could cast their ballots from home and a widely shared news release claiming Hillary Clinton’s health disqualified her from serving as president.\nOver the weekend, the No. 1 Google hit for the search “final election count” was an article from a little-known site claiming that Donald Trump had won the popular vote by 700,000 votes. ( Clinton won the popular vote ).\nFacebook, Google and other Web companies have sought to walk a fine line: They don’t want to get into the practice of hiring human editors, which they believe would make them vulnerable to criticisms of partisan bias and stray from their core business of building software. Yet outsiders, as well as some within Silicon Valley, are increasingly clamoring for technology giants to take a more active role in policing the spread of deceptive information.\n“It is very difficult for Facebook to say they are not a gatekeeper when they drive such an enormous share of the attention of most news consumers across the world,” said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “They need to figure out some editorial mechanism; with their scale comes responsibility.”\n[ Facebook has repeatedly trended fake news since firing its human editors ]\nWhen Facebook detects that more people than usual are clicking on any given story, the company’s software algorithms instantaneously spread and promote that story to many other users in the network — enabling articles to “go viral” in a short period of time and making it harder to catch false news before it spreads widely.\nThe moves by Google and Facebook this week take aim at false stories but don’t impact Facebook’s News Feed or Google Search rankings, the places where fake news has actually spread. Instead, the tech giants are seeking to exert financial leverage that could prompt sites to clean up their act. Publishers make money when Google and Facebook help place ads on their websites, and they share that revenue with the technology giants. Companies found to be in violation of the policy risk losing a major source of ad dollars.\nNearly 1.2 billion people log on to Facebook every day; almost half of Americans rely on the social network as a source of news, according to the Pew Research Center. Google accounts for roughly 40 percent of traffic to news sites, according to Parse.ly, a start-up that analyzes Web traffic data for news publishers.\nGoogle spokeswoman Andrea Faville declined to detail how the company would determine the difference between false and accurate information going forward. “We use a combination of automated systems and human review,” she said\nFacebook spokesman Tom Channick emailed a statement about the new policy: “In accordance with the Audience Network policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news. While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nFacebook, Google and other sites have struggled to find automated solutions to clamp down on fake news, because there is not always a clear line between true and false news online, said a former Facebook employee who worked on the News Feed product and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to burn bridges with company.\nThe most influential sources of political misinformation on Facebook are not Macedonian fake-news sites or satirical pages but the thousands of partisan news outlets, pages and blogs that derive their traffic from News Feed, the employee said. Because those stories aren’t strictly “true” or “false,” it’s difficult to design a software algorithm that can distinguish among them.\nSome civil-liberties experts said it was dangerous to push Facebook to take on a greater editorial role. “If we wouldn’t trust the government to curate all of what we read, why would we ever think that Facebook or any one company should do it?” said Jonathan Zittrain, faculty director at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.\nOver the past year, Facebook has struggled to strike a balance. In May, the company was accused by former employees of suppressing news stories that had a conservative bent in its trending-news section, which appears on the upper right corner of a user’s Facebook page. In an effort to quell the criticism, Zuckerberg met with conservative leaders and launched an internal investigation into bias at the social network. (The investigation, conducted by Facebook and not by an outside firm, found no evidence of anti-conservative bias.)\nThe company also published a set of editorial guidelines that detail how human editors and algorithms work together to pick what stories should appear in the Trending Topics.\nThe controversy over trending news reflects Facebook’s challenges in curating content on the medium. Facebook had quietly used a handful of journalists, hired as freelance contractors, to help the curate the Trending section. Those contractors were replaced in late August by a team of engineers who defer most editorial decisions to the Trending section’s algorithms. The social network still has an editorial team that manages trending news, and it also allows users to flag hoaxes or fake stories in its News Feed product.\nIn recent months, Zuckerberg has repeatedly emphasized that Facebook is a technology company, not a media company. Still, “there is more we can do here,” he said in his weekend blog post. He said he was proud of Facebook’s role in the election and hoped to have more to share soon. The challenge, he wrote, is that any major changes run the risk of introducing unintended side effects or biases.\n“This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,” he wrote, adding, “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated.”\nAbby Ohlheiser contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Tech News US mayor resigns after racist Michelle Obama post on Facebook A racist Facebook post that called Michelle Obama an \"ape in heels\" fuels a big online petition that helped oust the offending parties Published 3:02  02   MICHELLE OBAMA. The U.S. First Lady listens as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign rally in North Carolina, U.S. on October 27, 2016. Photo by Jewel Samad \nWASHINGTON, U.S. – A mayor from West Virginia has resigned amid a furor over a racist Facebook post that described First Lady Michelle Obama as an \"ape in heels,\" US media said. \nBeverly Whaling, the mayor of the tiny town of Clay, had appeared to applaud the incendiary comment and stepped down Tuesday, Nov 15, amid the ensuing firestorm. \nLocal television news channel WSAZ confirmed that Whaling had resigned. \nAccording to WSAZ, Clay County Development Corp. director Pamela Ramsey Taylor had posted after Donald Trump's election: \"It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified First Lady in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.\" \nWhaling responded: \"Just made my day Pam.\" \nThe comments were later deleted and both women's Facebook pages were eventually taken offline, The Washington Post reported citing local media. \nStaffers at the Clay County Development Corp. told WSAZ that Taylor had been removed from her position. \nBarack Obama's eight years in office have been marred by racial slurs against the nation's first African American president and his family. \nClay has a population of less than 500, according to the 2010 census, and is the seat of Clay County in West Virginia. \nThe furor over the racist comment, and the mayor's seemingly agreeable response, prompted an online petition drive to have the two women ousted. \nThe text on www.thepetitionsite.com gathered nearly 160,000 signatures from across the country. \nWhaling had apologized in a statement Monday to The Washington Post, writing: \"My comment was not intended to be racist at all.\" \nMichelle Obama emerged as a hugely popular surrogate for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. \nTrump, a billionaire businessman, won West Virginia's five electoral votes, helping him to his unexpected triumph over Clinton .

      "text": "Google and Facebook finally announced steps to tackle fake news on their respective platforms this week following increasing pressure from critics eager to halt the flow of falsehoods online.\nBoth companies said they will prohibit fake news websites from advertising on their platforms, thus reducing the exposure of such articles to the public while also starving the companies of an important source of advertising income.\nThe move comes after the companies received a wave of criticism over its role in propagating misinformation, particularly in this election cycle in which many observed that a bitter partisan war was potentially worsened by polarizing news sources touting untrue assertions. While the technology companies have in the past been hesitant to mediate the flow of news, this change might signal a change in thought as they come to grip with the real-life implications of lackluster surveillance on their platforms.\nRecommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news ,” a Facebook spokesman said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nTest your knowledge Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 Facebook said it will explicitly ban fake news sites from using the Facebook Audience Network, a system that places ads on other websites and mobile apps. On Monday, Google said it will prevent Google ads from being placed on “pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” the company’s spokesperson said, a category that includes fake news sites.\nTechnology and social media companies are increasingly seeing themselves as victims of those who game the system to spread misinformation either with purposes to mislead the public or for personal profit, as Buzzfeed recently exposed in an investigation.\nMost recently on Monday, the top result for a Google search for the final results of the presidential elections is sourced to a random website that says Donald Trump has won both popular and electoral votes , The Washington Post reports (in fact, Hillary Clinton leads the popular vote). On the same day, another false Facebook trending story with more than 10,000 shares claimed that Denzel Washington backs Mr. Trump and that he called President Obama “anti-Christian,” as the Post points out. These come after a string of false news that trended throughout the campaign season that ranged from Hillary Clinton calling for civil war to Mike Pence insulting Mrs. Obama.\nTechnology companies have historically been hesitant to play editor to the information flowing through their platforms.\nLast week, Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that Facebook influenced the elections, emphasizing the role the technology company played was to disseminate information, not decide on content – a painful experience the company had with editors with its Trending topics previously. The company does prohibit certain content, such as nudity.\nBut a growing sense of responsibility among employees of tech companies may continue to add pressure on executives to take more drastic actions. As Buzzfeed reported on Monday, a group of Facebook employees took initiative to form an unofficial task force to investigate whether the company, used by 150 million Americans, is doing enough to address the problem.\n\"It’s not a crazy idea,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed of the assertion that Facebook influenced the election. \"What’s crazy is for [Mr. Zuckerberg] to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed.\nCritics say even with the new policy, Facebook still has not addressed the proliferation of false news in the News feed. Both Facebook and Google have been taking steps over the years to label news sources as “satire” or “opinion,” while also allowing users to flag false content.",

Bosworth Hall at Oberlin College . (photo credit:Wikimedia Commons) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nOberlin College Professor Joy D. Karega, who came under fire earlier in 2016 for antisemitic Facebook posts, has been dismissed from the college, the Cleveland Jewish News reported Wednesday. Karega had made comments accusing Israel and “Rothschild-led bankers” of responsibility for downing a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine in 2014. She also posted a graphic of Jacob Rothschild, a member of the prominent Jewish banking family, with a caption reading: “We own your news. The media. Your oil. And your government.” Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. In other posts Karega had claimed that the CIA and the Mossad were behind Islamic state and that ISIS was not “a jihadist, Islamic terrorist organization,” according to The Washington Post. The Assistant Professor of Rhetoric and Composition had been placed on paid leave in August and on Tuesday the college's board of trustees announced their vote to dismiss Kraega, a decision that was effective immediately. The school released a statement explaining, “In the face of Dr. Karega’s repeated refusal to acknowledge and remedy her misconduct, her continued presence undermines the mission and values of Oberlin’s academic community. Thus, any sanction short of dismissal is insufficient and the Board of Trustees is compelled to take this most serious action.”Oberlin originally defended Karega in the name of free speech, posting on their alumni Facebook page, \"The statements posted on social media by Dr. Joy Karega, assistant professor of rhetoric and composition, are hers alone and do not represent the views of Oberlin College.\"Oberlin has drawn attention in recent months for what some alumni claim is a culture of tolerance for antisemitism. More than 250 alumni have signed an open letter to college President MarvinKrislov voicing concern about this and mentioning several incidents at the school, including the expulsion of the Kosher Halal co-op from the Oberlin Student Cooperation Association and a protest against Israel on Rosh Hashanah that Jewish students had to pass through on their way to holiday services.The school also garnered headlines in December when African-American student activists issued a 14-page list of demands to Krislov, including that the school divest from companies doing business with Israel.In September Krislov announced that he was stepping down after the 2016-2017 school year.

      "text": "Facebook says it miscalculated more metrics, but it’s telling advertisers not to worry On the plus side: This has nothing to do with fake news. Facebook advertising chief Carolyn Everson John Lamparski / Getty Images for Advertising Week New York Attention, digital publishers and advertisers: Facebook has checked its math again. It needs to make some corrections. The social network says it has been miscalculating several of the metrics it uses to measure how content performs on its property. It says the new numbers may differ significantly from what publishers are used to seeing. In one case, a metric that measures how many people can see a publisher’s content on its page may shrink by 55 percent. Facebook’s do-over comes a couple months after the company made a similar report, when it announced it had been overestimating a video viewing metric . That disclosure prompted a flurry of discussion over whether publishers and advertisers could trust the data they were getting from one of the two dominant players in digital media . This news should do the same. In both cases, Facebook says none of the restated numbers should affect the results advertisers paid for. If you gave Facebook money to generate a certain number of clicks or impressions, Facebook still delivered what you paid for, says Facebook ad boss Carolyn Everson. Everson says that after Facebook disclosed that its video viewing numbers were off, it went back and reviewed other metrics, which led to the changes it’s announcing today. The biggest change is to metrics that measured how many people could see a publisher’s Facebook page over the course of a week and a month; those numbers may shrink by an average of 33 percent and 55 percent, Facebook says. But Facebook says it has been correctly measuring how many people could see a publisher’s page on a daily basis, how individual posts performed and what happens when publishers pay Facebook to reach more people. At the same time, the company is announcing other changes meant to give advertisers more confidence, including giving third-party auditors like ComScore, Nielsen and Moat more access to Facebook’s data. “We are committed to doing what we need to do to provide the industry with more clarity, and give the industry more confidence in our metrics,” Everson said. “We have an unwavering commitment to getting this right at any given moment, knowing that it is going to continue to evolve.” Everson says Facebook’s erroneous metrics are the results of bugs in their calculations, not a flaw in Facebook’s methodology. In one case, Facebook’s new math will increase the results publishers are used to seeing: Facebook says the metric that tracks how many people watched 100 percent of a video may grow by 35 percent. recode_divider",

      "text": "2 COMMENTS Facebook said it has uncovered several more miscalculated metrics related to how consumers interact with content from marketers and publishers, and simultaneously unveiled additional independent review of some measurements to calm unease over the social network’s data.\nThe company publicly disclosed on Wednesday that a comprehensive internal metrics audit found that discrepancies, or “bugs,” led to the undercounting or overcounting of four measurements, including the weekly and monthly reach of marketers’ posts, the number of full video views and time spent with publishers’ Instant Articles.\nNone of the metrics in question impact Facebook’s billing, said Mark Rabkin, vice president of Facebook’s core ads team.\nFacebook said it was publicly disclosing the miscalculated metrics as it tries to bring more “clarity and confidence” to the many advertisers and publishers who rely on its platform to reach consumers. Facebook has been feeling the heat from the ad community ever since it was found in September to be overestimating the average viewing time for video ads over roughly two years . \nThe unveiling of the additional errors may trouble some advertisers and web publishers that rely on Facebook for distribution and monetization. Several had already called for additional third-party validation of Facebook’s data.\nAs a result, Facebook announced that it plans to take a number of steps aimed at assuaging advertiser concerns about how it counts how many people see its ads and content and where that data comes from.\nFor starters, Facebook will provide viewability data from third-party metrics companies like Moat and Integral Ad Science for display ad campaigns. Previously, this data was limited to video campaigns.\n“We are doubling down of our efforts at third-party verification,” said Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions.\nIn addition, Facebook said it is working with Nielsen to count Facebook video views, including both on-demand views and live viewing, as part of Nielsen’s Digital Content Ratings metric. This third-party verification for publishers could potentially make it easier to evaluate video performance on Facebook compared with TV.\nLastly, Facebook said it plans to form a Measurement Council made up of marketers and ad agency executives, and will also roll out a blog to more regularly communicate updates about measurement.\nAs for the newly discovered bugs, the errors apply to only four of more than 220 metrics that Facebook counts.\nIn one instance, Facebook found that it had been overcounting in some cases how many people were exposed to marketers’ organic posts, meaning regular posts that weren't paid ads, because it was adding up the daily reach over certain periods without taking out repeat visitors. The corrected metric on average will be about 33% lower for the seven-day period and 55% lower for the 28-day period, Facebook said. The bug, which has been an issue since May, doesn’t affect paid posts.\nIn another case, Facebook found it had been undercounting how many people watch video ads to their completion. Some people watch video ads in their entirety, but because the audio and video tracks aren’t always perfectly synced, Facebook wasn't counting some views as completed at 100%. As a result, Facebook expects the count of completed video views to increase by 35%.\nBecause of another calculation error, the amount of time people spend with Instant Articles was overreported by 7% to 8% on average since August 2015, Facebook said.\n“Some of [the bugs] will have a bigger impact than others,” said Mr. Rabkin. “The range of impact varies. We wanted to air on side of fairness and transparency.”\nA top ad buyer who had been briefed on Facebook’s audit described them as important but far from earth-shattering. “These are clarifications but not bombshells,” this person said. Since the most recent overcounting incident, “Facebook has gone hyper sensitive about it.” \nFacebook’s efforts may to fix its reputation with Madison Avenue may fall short of the demands from some ad buyers. \nFor instance, as part of the increased data verification, Facebook doesn't plan to let ad buyers track campaigns using their own ad “tags,” or tracking code, as some have advocated. The lack of fully independent third-party ad verification was a major sticking point following Facebook’s recent video counting mishap, particularly considering Facebook’s growing dominance in the ad world.\nOne way Facebook could calm frustrated ad buyers would be to undergo an audit via the Media Rating Council, the media industry’s independent research watchdog. Following the recent overcounting error, the Association of National Advertisers publicly advocated for an MRC audit. This is something Facebook is now considering, said Ms. Everson.\nMs. Everson said that she has been in numerous conversations with marketers and ad buyers over the past eight weeks regarding metrics, and that the company wants to demonstrate how seriously it is taking these issues.\n“Clients want to have trust and confidence in their investment decisions,” she said. “My desired outcome…is that we are viewed as displaying complete transparency. We want to demonstrate our commitment.”\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com",

      "title": "Facebook Increases Transparency By Updating Video and Third-Party Viewability Metrics",
      "text": "Facebook Increases Transparency By Updating Video and Third-Party Viewability Metrics It faced growing pressure from marketers By Lauren Johnson November 16, 2016, 9:27 AM EST Technology Facebook is making some big changes to its measurement for marketers. Shutterstock In light of its recent video fiasco and growing pressure from advertisers to open up its so-called walled garden for more third-party verification, Facebook today is announcing a ton of changes to its measurement system. Facebook has added a new metric called \"video watches to 100 percent,\" which tracks both completed views and completed audio. \"Video watches to 100 percent\" replaces a previous stat that was called \"video views to 100 percent.\" With the addition of the new metric, Facebook estimates that there will be a 35 percent increase in the count of watches to 100 percent. Mark Rabkin, head of ads engineering at Facebook, told Adweek that his company has underestimated these views and is adding the new metric because, \"when audio and video plays on the phone, sometimes the audio track and the video track get a few milliseconds out of alignment,\" he said. \"Then you have to make a choice—when do you count the video as finished? Is it when the audio track ends or when the video track ends?\" Facebook will provide new insights into campaigns, and it also cut deals with comScore and Nielsen to track display viewability. Facebook initially began offering third-party video viewability about a year ago with Moat and Integral Ad Science and now plans to open up third-party display viewability to measure text and photo ads through its new partnerships with comScore and Nielsen. Similar to video viewability, display viewability will track when and how long ads appears on a page; these measurement offerings will begin rolling it out in the first quarter of 2017. The display viewability stats will not change how marketers pay for ads. Instead, the goal is to give marketers more transparency and verification into their Facebook campaigns, which they can then analyze on their own through third-party partners. \"This is our No. 1 requested third-party verification feedback from clients,\" Rabkin said. \"Together, these four partners cover the vast majority of the market share in terms of what we've heard from our top customers and which providers they're choosing to use.\" Facebook is also extending some viewability stats to non-advertisers so that publishers and users can track video views. As Facebook has grown as a video platform in the past few years, video clips have increasingly taken over more real estate in news feeds, causing publishers and brands to crank out custom content for the site. However, up until now, publishers and brands have not been privy to some of the same stats that advertisers get access to. Now, Facebook video and Facebook Live video will be counted in Nielsen's digital content ratings in a way \"that's comparable to television,\" Rabkin said. More metrics issues In addition to new viewability options, Facebook is also working to become more transparent about its stats after reporting it found a few mistakes recently that could lead to big changes for marketers. All told, Facebook's ads manager provides advertisers with more than 220 metrics, Rabkin said. Most notably, Facebook reports that it found a bug with one metric that miscalculated organic daily reach for Pages. Up until now, Facebook has reported daily reach as the sum of daily users that visit a Page over weekly or 28-day time periods. However, that stat does not account for users who visit a Page multiple times. So the same folks were sometimes getting counted again and again. Going forward, reach stats will factor out repeat visitors, which Facebook estimates could cause weekly visitor counts to decrease by 33 percent and 28-day visitor stats to shrink by 55 percent. The company said it expects to fix the issue in the coming weeks. \"We intended for that total to be de-duplicated for repeat visitors, but instead in that one summary number repeat visitors were counted,\" Rabkin said. \"All of our reach data that we show on Page view insights was unaffected and all the underlying data is fine.\" Also on Pages, Facebook is beginning to calculate reach counts based on viewability. Previously, Facebook has tracked reach count based on when someone refreshes the news feed and a post is placed in a feed—now it will track views under stricter viewability guidelines. Under Facebook's current guidelines, that means reach count will be calculated instantly when a post appears in a news feed or after it's been viewed for 10 seconds. With stricter rules, Facebook warns marketers that they may see up to a 20 percent dip in reported reach, and it plans to make the update in the coming months. In terms of Instant Articles, Facebook's fast-loading mobile pages for publishers, the company claims that it has overestimated the average time spent per article by 7 percent to 8 percent since August. Facebook says it miscalculated the number because it was using a histogram of average time spent instead of calculating the average time spent reading an article divided by total views. For the past nine months, Facebook has worked on clarifying the vernacular of its metrics to make terms easier for marketers to understand, with a few of those changes being announced today. For example, the term \"three-second video view\" is replacing the more generic \"video view,\" and \"website view of content\" is replacing \"view content.\" With video views, Facebook is tacking on the word \"aggregate\" to its three-second, 10-second and 30-second definitions of video views to explain to marketers that these views represent at least—and possibly a bit more—the specified number of seconds. Marketer feedback To convey all of this across to the advertising community, Facebook is launching a measurement council that consists of agency, brand and tech execs who will regularly discuss measurement issues like viewability, attribution and video standardization issues. Facebook says that it will announce the measurement council's members in the coming weeks. Facebook is also launching a new blog called Metrics FYI that's similar to Facebook's News Feed FYI blog, but it will focus specifically on measurement changes. Facebook already has a group called Client Council that entails brand CMOs and agency leaders that give input about the site's advertising options. There are even regional and global councils. \"Our goal is to collect back what are the most pressing issues for our customers right now—some of them are, of course, already known, and then we'll be working from there,\" Rabkin said. \"I think the primary focus will be representatives from agencies and the large advertisers who actually have to integrate these measurement results into their real business outcomes. But of course, we'll have representatives and feedback on the council about the whole flow and everyone who is helping out at every step of the way.\" Get the Technology Today newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest",

      "text": "share Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News stories are supposed to help ordinary voters understand the world around them. But in the 2016 election, news stories online too often had the opposite effect. Stories rocketed around the internet that were misleading, sloppily reported, or in some cases totally made up. Over the course of 2016, Facebook users learned that the pope endorsed Donald Trump ( he didn’t ), that a Democratic operative was murdered after agreeing to testify against Hillary Clinton (it never happened ), that Bill Clinton raped a 13-year-old girl (a total fabrication ), and many other totally bogus “news” stories. Stories like this thrive on Facebook because Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes “engagement” — and a reliable way to get readers to engage is by making up outrageous nonsense about politicians they don’t like. This article is part of New Money , a new section on economics, technology, and business. A big problem here is that the internet has broken down the traditional distinction between professional news-gathering and amateur rumor-mongering. On the internet, the “Denver Guardian” — a fake news site designed to look like a real Colorado newspaper — can reach a wide audience as easily as real news organizations like the Denver Post, the New York Times, and Fox News. Since last week’s election, there has been a fierce debate about whether the flood of fake news — much of it prejudicial to Hillary Clinton — could have swung the election to Donald Trump. Internet giants are coming under increasing pressure to do something about the problem. On Monday, Google announced that it was going to cut fake news sites off from access to its vast advertising network, depriving them of a key revenue source. Facebook quickly followed suit with its own ad network. At the same time, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has signaled reluctance to have Facebook become more active in weeding out fake news stories. He described it as “a pretty crazy idea” to think fake news on Facebook could have swayed the election. He says Facebook will look for new ways to stop the spread of fake news, but he also argues that “we must proceed very carefully” and that Facebook must be “extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” The importance of this issue is only going to grow over time. More and more people are getting their news from the internet, putting more and more power in the hands of companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook. The leaders of those companies are going to be under increasing pressure to use that power wisely. The internet is growing up Photo by John Moore/Getty Images In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was common to think of the internet as a decentralized, even anarchic, place where no one was really in charge. Online-only news organizations were still in their infancy, so that most people either got their news from traditional sources like newspapers or cable news shows, or else they went to the home pages of conventional news organizations like the New York Times, the Atlantic, or Fox News. The rise of social media sites has changed things in two major ways. First, social media has drastically lowered barriers to entry in the news business. It has always been easy for anyone to publish a website, of course. But as news consumption is increasingly driven by social media sharing, it’s becoming easier than ever for no-name sites to reach a big audience. At the same time, a handful of big tech companies — Twitter, Google, and especially Facebook — have gained a huge and growing influence over what news people see. 44 percent of US adults tell pollsters they got news from Facebook in 2016. That’s vastly larger than other news-focused social media sites like Twitter (9 percent) and Reddit (2 percent). And while many people get their news from television programs or newspapers, those media are divided among many competing news organizations. This means that Facebook has a larger influence over ordinary Americans’ media diets than almost any other news organization. Normally we think that organizations with a lot of power have an obligation to use that power responsibly. But the leaders of the largest technology companies have resisted thinking of themselves in those terms. They like to think of their sites as neutral platforms that help users share information with each other — without the company making value judgments of its own. But this isn’t how power works. When an authority figure turns a blind eye to a problem that’s happening under his watch, the problem doesn’t go away. It festers, often becoming an even bigger problem over time. Fake news is a problem, but we don’t know how big it is The problem of fake news is so new that we don’t have definitive data on how big of a problem it is. But there are some reasons to think it could be very significant. We know that low-quality news stories have proliferated on Facebook. For example, investigations by BuzzFeed and the Guardian found that a group of cynical Macedonian hucksters had created dozens of right-wing news sites that publish low-quality pro-Trump news stories. Some are plagiarized from other conservative news sites. Others appear to be totally made up, with headlines like “Proof surfaces that Obama was born in Kenya,” “Bill Clinton’s sex tape just leaked,” and “Pope Francis forbids Catholics from voting for Hillary!” “Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that ‘if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,’” a Macedonian student told BuzzFeed. Other fake news is generated by partisan bloggers taking news tidbits out of context and drawing totally wrong conclusions from them. For example, some confused conservative bloggers misread a leaked email from Clinton adviser John Podesta as evidence that Democrats were manipulating public poll results . In fact, Democrats were using a standard polling technique called oversampling on Democrats’ own internal polls — but that didn’t stop the story from spreading among online conservatives. And fake news hasn’t only circulated on the right-hand side of the political spectrum. A story about Pope Francis endorsing Bernie Sanders was also made up . As the internet’s most popular news source, Facebook appears to have the biggest fake news problem. But it’s not a problem that only afflicts Facebook. In the wake of last week’s election, one of the top search results on Google was a post claiming that Trump won the popular vote — he didn’t. Facebook is worried about being seen as biased against conservatives Sen. John Thune (R-SD) sent Facebook a letter demanding details about Facebook’s trending news feature. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images Publicly, Facebook’s CEO has downplayed the site’s role in distributing fake news online. But privately, there’s a raging debate inside Facebook about how it could do more. BuzzFeed reports that some Facebook employees are frustrated by Zuckerberg’s blasé response to concerns about fake news on the social media platform. “What’s crazy is for him to come out and dismiss it like that,” one anonymous engineer wrote, according to BuzzFeed. “He knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season.” One reason Facebook’s management has been so cautious on this issue is that it’s still smarting from the controversy earlier this year over Facebook’s trending news feature. Until this summer, Facebook employed a team of professional journalists to curate the trending news box that appeared in the right-hand rail next to the Facebook newsfeed. Then in May, one of Facebook’s trending news editors told Gizmodo that the team was routinely suppressing trending stories that slanted in a conservative direction. That caused a massive backlash, including questions from Republicans in Congress about Facebook’s editorial policies. This led to Facebook terminating the entire trending news team . Today, Facebook uses software to choose which headlines appear in this box. But with the human editors gone, Facebook had a new problem: It started to see fake stories showing up in the trending box. Facebook’s trending news algorithm simply wasn’t sophisticated enough to distinguish an accurate news story from an inaccurate one. The current debate over fake news on Facebook can be seen as a much broader version of the same controversy. Nobody is going to defend fake news per se. But once you start injecting human editorial judgment into content decisions, questions of bias are inevitably going to come up. This is a particularly tricky issue because it’s not easy to draw a line between articles that are totally fake and articles that are just highly misleading or based on shoddy reporting. For example, after BuzzFeed reported that 43 percent of articles from a hyperpartisan site called Right Wing News were either “mostly false” or a “mix of true and false,” the site’s editor insisted that many of the articles classified as false were actually accurate . One story claimed that the Clinton Foundation devoted only 10 percent of its revenue to charity, a figure it got from a Federalist article that only counted grants to third-party organizations, not charitable activities carried out by the Clinton Foundation itself, in calculating total charitable spending. It seems pretty clear that the Federalist and Right Wing News are in the wrong here. It’s not reasonable to count a foundation’s own charitable programs as overhead. But if Facebook were to classify this story as fake news and ban it from the site, some conservatives are going to see that as evidence of left-wing bias. Also, any effort to weed out fake news at Facebook’s scale is going to lead to some straight-up mistakes. If these mistakes disproportionately target conservative viewpoints, that’s going to create a backlash that will hurt Facebook’s brand with tens of millions of conservative Facebook users. “This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,” Zuckerberg wrote in a Sunday Facebook post . He argued that many stories “express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual. I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.” Banning fake news might be the wrong approach Most of the discussion about how Facebook could address fake news has assumed that the goal is to banish fake news from the platforms. But there are a couple of other approaches that might ultimately work better. One is that rather than banning fake news, Facebook could give a boost to high-quality news. It’s had to say whether Right Wing News is a fake news site, but it’s easy to say that the New York Times and the Washington Times are legitimate news sources. And Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm decides which news stories to show users first. Giving high-quality news sources a bonus in the newsfeed algorithm could improve the average quality of news users read without Facebook having to make tricky judgments about which news is and isn’t fake. A second approach would be to change how Facebook presents dubious news stories instead of banning them outright. Right now, when users post a link, Facebook expands that into a “card” showing an image, headline, and short sentence describing the article. This format is standardized so that a New York Times article is formatted in the same way as an article from a no-name blog. But Facebook could change that. Instead of presenting an identical summary card for every link, it could present different kinds of cards — or no card at all — depending on the perceived quality of the source. Credible news sources could show full cards like they do now. Less credible sources could show smaller cards — or no cards at all. And Facebook could hire a team of fact-checkers to examine the most widely-shared stories. If a story checks out, Facebook could show an icon verifying that the story is authentic. If it doesn’t check out, Facebook could include a prominent link to a story explaining that the story is inaccurate. Users would still be free to read the story and disagree with Facebook’s verdict. But they’d at least be aware that a particular article’s claim is disputed. Ultimately, some level of controversy is inevitable for a topic this political. Any effort to crack down on fake news is going to generate a certain amount of backlash from people whose stories are labeled as bogus. But critics say Zuckerberg has an obligation to try to do something to stem the flood of fake news on his platform. Was this article helpful?",

Trimble—a sign painter—realized she could help.\n\"Without thinking, without designing anything beforehand, I just jumped out of bed, threw on some clothes, grabbed some paint I had on hand, and ran up there and covered it up as quickly as possible,\" she says.\nThe graffiti was on an abandoned building across the street from Fayetteville&apos;s heavily-used public library. Trimble replaced the hate speech with \"Love always wins,\" posted it on Facebook, and offered to do the same thing for any similar graffiti in the area.\n\"If you see it, you call me, I&apos;ll provide the material, and I&apos;ll just get rid of it,\" she says.\nThe idea resonated, and sign painters and artists across the country—from Philadelphia to Tulsa to Los Angeles—contacted Trimble to offer to do the same thing in their own neighborhoods. A new website, Repaint Hate , asks anyone who sees hate speech to report it so it can be replaced with a positive message.\nIn a GoFundMe campaign , Trimble is raising money for supplies. In Fayetteville, two public walls have been donated for positive murals. She wants to paint similar murals around the country.\nTrimble hopes that the project also inspires others to act. \"I just wanted people to feel empowered, when they see something happening, to take an action to positively affect the situation,\" she says. \"Whether it&apos;s helping a person who feels uncomfortable somewhere, or covering up hate speech, or intervening when someone&apos;s been bullied—whatever it may be.\"\nSince the election, reports of hate crimes have increased; the Southern Poverty Law Center received more than 200 complaints within a few days. To name just a few: Swastikas were painted on dorm doors at the New School in New York City; a church in Maryland was tagged with \"Trump Nation Whites Only\"; a bus stop in San Diego was tagged with \"Heil Trump\" and a swastika.\nOf course, painting over graffiti is technically also graffiti. But Trimble and the other painters are willing to risk getting in trouble. In Fayetteville, officials reached out to ask her to document what she was covering, but didn&apos;t ask her to stop.\nFor now, the message still stands on the Fayetteville building. \"Love always wins.\"\nSlideshow Credits: 06 / Photo: Kat Wilson;",

      "text": "By Garett Sloane   . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, Calif., in October. Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Most Popular \nFacebook on Wednesday said that it has discovered more measurement problems that could have given marketers the wrong picture of their performance with consumers on the platform. \nThe social network, which revealed last month that it had been overstating the average time people spent with videos, said in a new blog post that it had it had given marketers and publishers faulty numbers in a few other spots, inflating how many people visited their Pages and how long they spent reading Instant Articles. \nFacebook said none of its findings affected paid advertisement metrics. Still, publishers and brands rely on numbers from Facebook to understand their audience and how to plan content strategies. \nFacebook said a \"bug\" in its Page Insights since last May was responsible for overstated reach measurements, calculating the number of people reached over a week and a month without de-duplicating them. That meant a brand or publisher saw a raw total of visitors to their content over a month, inadvertantly potentially counting repeat visitors more than once. \n\"The de-duplicated 7-day summary in the overview dashboard will be 33% lower on average and 28-day will be 55% lower,\" the blog post said . \nOther reach data, such as per-post reach and historical figures, were not affected, according to Facebook. \nFacebook also said it is changing how it calculates the reach of marketers' pages. \"For paid ads reports, we've moved to a stricter definition that only counts reach once the post enters the person's screen (\"viewable impressions\"),\" the blog post said. \"With the stricter definition, we estimate that reported reach will be 20% lower on average.\" Related Stories Google, Facebook Say They Won't Serve Ads to Fake News Sites \nAn issue with measuring video completions understated those results. \"We are now updating how we read the video length to address this issue,\" the blog post said. \"This may result in roughly a 35% increase in the count of 'video watches at 100%.' For example, if 'video watches at 100%' were 1%, they would now be 1.35%.\" \nBut the time spent reading Instant Articles, with which publishers let readers consume whole articles on Facebook without clicking through to their own sites, was overstated by 7% to 8% since last August, the company said. \"This was caused by a calculation error: we were calculating the average across a histogram of time spent, instead of reflecting the total time spent reading an article divided by its total views,\" the blog post said. \"We have now fixed this issue.\" \nThe company's revelation last month had already rattled many marketers, who began to wonder what numbers they could trust when platforms, and not just Facebook, provide their own analysis. \nOn Wednesday, Facebook said it will improve how it works with third-party measurement companies and set up a \"Measurement Council\" to work with advertisers on the subject.

      "text": "Focus Features Like us on Facebook \nOn July 11, 1958, five weeks after being married, Richard and Mildred Loving awoke to flashlights and uniformed policemen hovering over their bed. An anonymous tip had led police to the couple for violating Virginia's Racial Integrity Act. Richard was white; Mildred was black. In 24 states, including Virginia, interracial marriage was illegal. \nThe Lovings' fight against that supreme injustice is the subject of Loving , a new feature from director Jeff Nichols. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga portray the couple whose love was against the law, and who were forced to flee Virginia and face criminal charges for having wed. (The two were married in Washington, D.C., one of the places that recognized mixed-race unions.) Labeled felons, they were told never to return to their home while they were still together. Fair use, Wikimedia Commons \nIt would be years before the Lovings made progress, thanks in large part to the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union and volunteer lawyer Bernie Cohen. The case was eventually brought before the United States Supreme Court. Their 1967 ruling would break down the last of the legal barriers in the racial segregation that had divided the country for much of the decade. \nLoving is currently in limited release.

      "text": "filed under: Animals , oceans , video Like us on Facebook \nThe mantis shrimp is an interesting creature: It flaunts a whole rainbow of colors, has some of the best working eyes in the animal kingdom, and ruthlessly kills its prey with extreme precision and power. There are over 550 species of the ocean dweller, but of those hundreds, the formidable crustaceans have just two primary methods for maiming their prey: smashing or spearing. \nAs PBS's Deep Look series explains in the video above, s mashers have a strong club, which they use to literally punch animals to death (or bust open a shell). Their tiny boxing glove moves through the water at 50 mph—faster than a .22-caliber bullet. These clobberers also have a simple spear that's sharp enough to jab their enemies in turf battles, but pro spearers have an advanced harpoon with a serrated blade. They hide in the sand and wait for an unsuspecting fish to pass by so they can leap out and attack before dragging the unsuspecting animal to its death. Yikes. \nThe mantis shrimp combines this pure power with an incredible sense of sight. While humans have two pupils and three color receptors, the mantis shrimp has six pseudopupils and 12 receptors to better destroy their enemies. As the video explains, \"Mantis shrimp can perceive the most elusive attribute of light from the human standpoint: polarization. Polarization refers to the angle that light travels through space. Though it’s invisible to the human eye, many animals see this quality of light, especially underwater.\" \nThis skill is great for more than just killing dinner: The special vision lets mantis shrimp communicate with each other and stake out territory. Scientists have even borrowed this technique to find injuries and even cancer with polarized light. Just another example of how Mother Nature can be both beautiful and terrifying.",

Zuckerberg: it's crazy to think Facebook fake news influenced voting \nNew York Mag’s Max Read wrote that Facebook, stuffed with hoaxes and largely-right wing fake news, has to face up to its role in promoting political disinformation that helped Donald Trump win the election: “it’s not just that Facebook makes politics worse, it’s that it changes politics entirely.” Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg denies this, saying […] John Oliver shreds multi-level-marketing pyramid schemes \nOliver’s 30+ minute investigative piece on Mary Kay, Amway, Herbalife, Avon, Rodan and Fields and the rest of the MLM basket of deplorables shows how the Facebook era has supercharged these semi-criminal enterprises, entrapping thousands of people in a cycle of debt and deception that is fuelled by celebrity endorsers, including Madeline Albright.

On Nov. 16, Mr. Ali, a Democrat, announced he was canceling an anti-Donald Trump march slated for later that evening in liberal Rockville, Md., for ... more > View Comments Print By Ken Shepherd - The Washington Times - Wednesday, November 16, 2016 \nSaqib Ali, a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates from reliably liberal Montgomery County, announced he was canceling a planned Wednesday evening protest against President-elect Donald Trump for lack of interest. \n“JUST IN: Tonight’s Rockville march/protest against @realDonaldTrump has been canceled “due to insufficient RSVPs.” @ABC7News,” WJLA-TV reporter Kevin Lewis tweeted on Wednesday morning. Attached to the tweet was a screen capture from a news release announcing the cancellation of the “March Against Racist Misogynist President-Elect Trump.” \nMr. Ali apparently began organizing the event on Sunday, asking followers on his Facebook page, “Some people are thinking about a flash-mob style Anti-Trump demonstration on Wednesday or Thursday evening in Rockville Town Center. Who’s interested?” \nSEE ALSO: Trump-supporting teen beaten at high-school protest in suburban Maryland: Report \nResponding to a critic who asked what he “intended to accomplish” with the march, Mr. Ali wrote on his Facebook page on Monday, “We want to make sure that the behavior of this vulgar man is not normalized and accepted. He should be denounced and opposed.” \nElected in 2006, Mr. Ali served one term in the House of Delegates from January 2007 to January 2011. A Democrat in a solidly Democratic district, he lost a bitter primary election battle in 2010, having unsuccessfully challenged incumbent State Sen. Nancy King. \nThe canceled protest comes on the heels of a Wednesday morning student demonstration in Rockville that turned violent when a 15-year-old boy wearing a “Make America Great Again” head was “viciously beaten” in the words of a correspondent for WTOP Radio, a Washington, D.C., news radio station.",

(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar 2012 file photo) Buy Photo 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPublic school superintendents from across Indiana asked the State Board of Education on Wednesday to suspend accountability again by not counting last spring's ISTEP scores against schools. \nSuperintendents blasted inconsistencies with the testing system and the turbulence of recent changes, saying that ISTEP results and subsequent A-F school grades are inaccurate and flawed measures of the quality of their districts. \n​\"Indiana needs to get out of the business of delivering tests with so many devastating unintended consequences,\" said Steve Thalheimer, superintendent of Fairfield Community Schools in northern Indiana. \nSuperintendents asked for a similar \"hold harmless\" provision that was in place for the 2014-15 school year, the first year of a revamped test to reflect newly written academic standards. Scores dipped that year, as predicted, but lower scores were not counted against schools. \nState schools chief Glenda Ritz said Indiana does not have the same flexibility within federal regulations to do so for the 2015-16 year but suggested that other methods could be used to adjust accountability measures. \n\"As the superintendent, I am totally open to looking to all avenues to make sure our schools and our communities are represented fairly in the public for which they serve,\" she said. \nISTEP will soon cease to exist, after mounting concerns led state lawmakers to decide last session to replace the controversial test. The state is developing a new assessment, planned to roll out in the 2018-19 school year. \nSuperintendents said they supported fair and equitable accountability: \"If the system's broken, let's fix it,\" said Robert Taylor, school superintendent in Lebanon. \nThey cited several flaws with administering ISTEP in the spring, including interruptions in the online test, an incorrect instruction manual, a calculator tool that didn't work on math sections and missing correct responses. Another glitch prevented students from inputting responses, such as rejecting attempts to include a decimal point in an answer, they said. \nISTEP results, said Superintendent John Hunter of Union Township Schools, are \"difficult, if not impossible, to use in a meaningful way.\" \nDistricts have had 2015-16 ISTEP results since July, according to the Indiana Department of Education. Those results are expected to be released publicly this week. \nThe test is administered once a year in the spring for grades 3-8. Students are given pass/fail scores, which are factored into A-F accountability grades for schools and districts. The scores can also factor into teacher evaluations and performance raises. \nThis story will be updated. \nCall IndyStar reporter Stephanie Wang at (317) 444-6184.

      "text": "Melanie Gonick / MIT Like us on Facebook \nThe future may be star-shaped—the future of medication, anyway. Scientists have created a pill that can unfurl and stay in the stomach, releasing malaria medication for weeks. The researchers, who published a report on their progress in the journal Science Translational Medicine , say the same delivery method could someday be used for almost any drug. \nMalaria affects more than 200 million people each year. While treatment is available, it must be taken every day for several weeks. Many of the people affected by malaria live in remote or impoverished areas, which can make it extremely difficult for them to get and take their drugs on time. And if the treatment isn’t completed, the parasite will stick around. It’s not that the drug doesn’t work; it’s that people often can’t and don’t take it. Non-adherence—or failing to take a prescription exactly as prescribed, for as long as prescribed—is a major problem worldwide. \nBut a very exciting alternative is on the horizon. An interdisciplinary team of engineers and doctors invented a futuristic drug-delivery method: a time-release capsule packed with weeks’ worth of treatment. \nThe capsule is, well, capsule-shaped when swallowed, but it expands into a star or snowflake shape as it makes its way through the digestive tract. Once it’s fully expanded, it stays put, delivering carefully calibrated doses of medication until it breaks down as the joints connecting the arms to the core dissolve and the arms break off. These smaller pieces then pass safely through the digestive tract. \nTo test their creation, the research team loaded their capsule with a malaria drug called ivermectin and gave it to infected pigs. The pill worked beautifully; not only did it not hurt the pigs or prevent them from eating, but it also successfully released the ivermectin for 10 days. \nThe team then devised a mathematical model to see how long-acting ivermectin might work in humans. Their results showed that adding the new capsule to other standard treatments significantly increased the likelihood of eliminating malaria in a given population. \nThe new capsule could improve not only medicine but also medical science and drug testing, says Shiyi Zhang, co-lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at MIT during the study. \"It may help doctors and the pharma industry to better evaluate the efficacy of certain drugs, because currently a lot of patients in clinical trials have serious medication adherence problems that will mislead the clinical studies,\" he said in a statement. \nCo-senior author Robert Langer of MIT believes his team’s technology has potential for all kinds of drugs and diseases. \"Until now, oral drugs would almost never last for more than a day,\" Langer says. \"This really opens the door to ultra-long-lasting oral systems, which could have an effect on all kinds of diseases, such as Alzheimer's or mental health disorders. There are a lot of exciting things this could someday enable.\" More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "A Minnesota police officer has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile , an African-American cafeteria worker whose death this summer sparked protests after its immediate aftermath was live-streamed on Facebook.\nSt. Anthony, Minnesota, police officer Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Castile during a traffic stop on July 6, will appear in court on Friday on the manslaughter charge, where he will enter a plea.\nHe faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted. He has also been charged with two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm, according to authorities.\nHe did not immediately return PEOPLE’s call for comment.\n“To those of you may say this incident was Philando Castile’s fault, I would submit that no reasonable officer — knowing, seeing and hearing what officer Yanez did at the time — would have used deadly force under these circumstances,” Ramsey County, Minnesota, attorney John J. Choi told reporters at a news conference Wednesday.\nCastile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds , who was with him and her daughter in the car during the shooting, has said he was shot after being asked to provide his driver’s license — and after he announced he had a gun, for which he had a permit. \nYanez has said he feared for his life and thought Castile was reaching for a gun to shoot him. Authorities dismissed that defense in announcing the charges against him. \n“Unreasonable fear cannot justify the use of deadly force,” Choi said Wednesday.\nJeronimo Yanez Christian Dobratz/AP “Philando Castile was not resisting or fleeing,” Choi said. “There was absolutely no criminal intent exhibited by him throughout this encounter. He was respectful and compliant based upon the instructions and orders he was given. He volunteered in good faith that he had a firearm, beyond what the law requires.\n“He empathically stated that he wasn’t pulling it out. His movement was restricted by his own seat belt.”\n“I have given officer Yanez every benefit of the doubt on his use of deadly force,” Choi said, “but I cannot allow the death of a motorist who was lawfully carrying a firearm under these facts and circumstances to go unaccounted for.”\nIn a statement of probable cause obtained by PEOPLE, prosecutors also alleged that Yanez put other lives in danger when he opened fire one minute after initiating the stop: “Yanez’s discharge of his firearm seven times into a vehicle in very close proximity to and towards Reynolds and her 4-year-old daughter endangered their safety.”\n• Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Her 4-year-old daughter was sitting in the back seat when he was killed.\nYanez’s attorney has previously said , “This has nothing to do with race and everything to do with the presence of a gun. Deadly force would not have been used if not for the presence of a gun.”\nYanez is the first officer charged in a police-involved death in Minnesota in more than 15 years, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune .",

      "text": "Facebook, and the trouble in being everything to everyone Nov 16th 2016, 18:59 Tweet \nOXFORD Dictionaries has just named \" post-truth \" its word of the year. The timing certainly seems apt. Among the many recriminations unfolding in the wake of the American election are darts aimed at the press which, some argue, did an inadequate job during the campaign sorting truth, from half-truth, from innuendo, from outright fabrication. Interestingly, among those groups in the crosshairs is Facebook, which is now struggling to work out what its journalistic responsibilities are in this strange new digital age. \nFacebook, which has nearly 2b monthly active users, is a media goliath. Users spend much of their time at the site interacting with friends and family, or sharing photos and videos. Yet Facebook is also an increasingly important location for the publication and sharing of news. According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Centre, 44% of American adults said they get some news from Facebook. Some of that news, as it turns out, is fake. During the campaign, wild and untrue stories from fake news sites were occasionally posted to Facebook, where they were shared widely. Facebook's algorithms sometimes gave the stories a boost, because they were popular. Yet Facebook has moved gingerly in its efforts to curate news or weed out fake stories, as such efforts disproportionately affect right-leaning pieces. Facebook is by no means the only web platform to face such headaches; Google has also had problems with fake news stories turning up in search results. But Facebook is the most influential. \nToday, Tyler Cowen rises to Facebook's defence: \nI wish to suggest a simple comparison: how does Facebook compare in this regard to email and forwarded emails? I haven’t seen formal numbers, but I strongly suspect emails have been a far more important source of misinformation about Hillary Clinton (and Trump) than was Facebook. (I do recall Matt Yglesias tweeting an estimate, and it sounded brutal for email.) That is especially likely to hold for the elderly, who use email far more than Facebook and furthermore were more likely to support Trump. \nHow about comparing Facebook to what other people tell you? What a load of crock they are. People, pshaw. Just think about their algorithms. At least Facebook has access to The Washington Post. \nHe makes a good point. In a 2011 paper by Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, investing the different but related issue of ideological self-segregation, the authors write: \nWe find that ideological segregation of online news consumption is low in absolute terms, higher than the segregation of most offline news consumption, and significantly lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions with neighbors, co-workers, or family members. We find no evidence that the Internet is becoming more segregated over time. \nThat is, the news one receives online is more ideologically filtered than the news one receives in print, but it is far, far less filtered than the news and perspectives one finds in conversation with friends, neighbours and colleagues. So that's good. That does not mean there is no reason for concern, however. \nOne problem might be that people treat news found at Facebook with the authority of news gleaned from publications generally, even though news found at Facebook more often resembles the news gleaned from conversations with friends and family. People might practice a sort of mental discounting when encountering new information in different settings; I am less inclined to fully trust a factoid passed along by a stranger at a bar than I would be to trust something reported in a major newspaper. Facebook could throw this sort of discounting off, and lead users to too readily accept \"news\" (which after all is appearing on a major media platform) which is only a little more informative than what one receives in an email forward. \nPut differently: whether Facebook's access to established and reliable publications means that it is a better source of news than a chain email depends on whether readers adjust their trust discounting algorithms appropriately when shifting from reading emails to reading news on Facebook. \nAnother problem is simply that the economics strongly favour the production and distribution of slanted news. Messrs Gentzkow and Shapiro conclude their paper by writing: \nIt is true that the Internet allows consumers to filter news relatively freely, but it has not changed the fact that reporting or writing stories that are tailored to a particular point of view is costly. There is no computer program that can take a story written with liberal slant as input, and output an account of the same facts written with conservative slant. One could imagine a news site that presented the neo-Nazi perspective on all of the day’s events: firsthand neo-Nazi reports from a hurricane in Florida, a neo-Nazi perspective on the Superbowl, and so forth. But such a site does not exist, to our knowledge, likely because the neo-Nazi audience is too small to make such an investment worthwhile, and the preferences of neo-Nazis for many stories are not actually all that different from those of the average consumer. \nThis paragraph might have rung true five years ago; it is less convincing today. Politics has increasingly intruded upon all realms of society, including sports and weather, and the proliferation of news sites which do provide a particular ideological perspective across a broad array of subjects suggests that such models work. Between this trend and increasing geographic polarisation of American society, it is ever easier to live most of one's life in a bubble. Most, but not all; there is not, for the moment, a Democratic or a Republican Facebook. Social networks thrive on network effects: people want to be there because everyone else is there. Intense partisan polarisation can upend such network effects; in some circumstances, the presence of people with opposing viewpoints could reduce the vaue of being on the network rather than raising it. Facebook's success therefore depends on its being able to capitalise on positive network effects while allowing users to segregate themselves away from groups which would otherwise undercut the value of the network. It is that tension which is creating problems for the firm's efforts to become a leading source of news.",

Pete Hoekstra of Holland and Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, who have been mentioned as potentially securing key roles in the Trump administration. \nDeVos's background would be a fit for Trump's plans to boost school choice in the U.S., particularly for high-poverty students. She is on the board of directors for the Great Lakes Education Project, which advocates for school choice and charter schools. She also chairs the board of directors of the American Federation for Children, another choice advocacy group. \nGreg McNeilly, spokesman for DeVos, declined to comment this afternoon and said DeVos herself also would not be commenting. \n►Related: Jesse Jackson: Trump lit the match, now he has fire to put out \nDeVos and her husband led a failed effort to amend the Michigan constitution to provide vouchers that would allow students to attend private schools at public expense. That's a centerpiece of Trump's education plan. He would invest $20 billion in federal money towards school choice, and expect states to kick in $110 billion of their own money, to provide $12,000 each in school choice funds to the 11 million school-aged children living in poverty. \nThe $20 billion wouldn't be new money, but would instead be the result of re-prioritizing existing federal money. \nThe Hill cites sources that say DeVos and Michelle Rhee, former chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools. POLITICO identifies a number of candidates, but says the top choices are likely Indiana Rep. Luke Messer and Williamson Evers, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. \nContact Lori Higgins: 313-222-6651, lhiggins@freepress.com or @LoriAHiggins 13 CONNECT 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2fxKACs More Stories",

(Photo: Lydia Lohrer Special to DFP) \nTuesday’s warm firearm season opener brought in plentiful big bucks of varying kinds — deer and dollars. \nDespite a DNR news release claiming only tens of thousands of hunters in the woods, the numbers were likely much larger — closer to half a million licenses sold . The economic benefits run to over $2 billion a year. \n“It’s been a good opener,” said Russ Mason, DNR wildlife chief. “We’ve seen a lot of good deer. ... I saw some real dandies in Eagle and DeWitt, 10 points, a lot of mass, big bodied. I saw one atypical that was absolutely spectacular.” \nPat and Gary’s Party Store in Indian River reported that its biggest buck as of 6:30 p.m. was 196 pounds and the smallest was a four-pointer that weighed 99 pounds. At noon, the store was slightly ahead of last year’s pace, said owner Gary Lang. \n► Related: State approves year-round coyote hunt in Michigan \nAs of Monday night, 506,318 unique licenses and 1,063,242 kill tags had been purchased, according to Mason. \nIt’s a boost to the economy, but not as big as it could be. Those numbers represent roughly a 3.7% decline in tags and a 4.3% decline in individual hunters from last year. It’s an anticipated decline. \n“It always happens when we have a mid-week season opener,” Mason said. \nThis downturn in sales drastically affects the DNR budget as well as retail sales, but Mason says hunters are attached to that date. \n“Hunters have had their opening day in Michigan on Nov. 15 since 1927, and surveys say they prefer to keep it that way,” Mason said. “Sixty-three percent of young people said that they liked the Nov. 15 opener despite the fact that they can’t go because they hunt primarily on weekend. Other states that try the weekend opener see a blip, but it’s transitory. It doesn’t produce a sustaining change in participation.” \nTom Knutson, owner of Knutson’s Sporting Goods in Brooklyn, hosts an annual buck pole. By late afternoon, he said there were 40 deer on the pole, down from the 100 or so at that time of day during last year’s opener, though the 2015 opener was on a Sunday. \nKnutson says that mid-week openers cut deeply into his profit. \n“I think if you were to ask people specifically whether they would prefer a Saturday or a mid-week opener, they would invariable answer Saturday,” he said. “I think I calculated that we won’t have another Saturday opener for another decade due to leap year.” \n► Related: West Michigan man, 39, dies after falling from hunting tree stand \nMark Copeland, general manager of Jay’s Sporting Goods in Gaylord, skipped hunting Tuesday for his hot tub, but says that the archers make up much of the losses that come with a mid-week opener. \n“Sales have been excellent,” he said. “The day before opener is essentially our black Friday. Bowhunters came in steadily over the weekend trying to get their hunting in before firearm opener, so it still turned out pretty good despite the mid-week opener. The one thing hunters were all wishing for was colder weather. That would have boosted their success and ours. Winter clothes aren’t moving so well.” \nDeer hunting seasons",

      "text": "How Facebook threats against Trump can turn into a felony Latest News President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a rally in New York in November. After Mr. Trump won the election, a man in Del Mar, Calif., threatened his life in a Facebook post. Evan Vucci/AP/File View Caption of \nA man who says his Facebook post stating he wanted to kill Donald Trump was made in jest could potentially face up to five years in prison for threatening the life of the president-elect. \n\" I'm going to kill the President Elect ,\" Matt Harrigan, the then-chief executive of PacketSled, a cybersecurity start-up based in Del Mar, Calif., wrote on Facebook. \"Bring it secret service.\" \nLater on, responding to a friend's comment, he added, \"Getting a sniper rifle and perching myself where it counts. Find a bedroom in the whitehouse [sic] that suits you ... I'll find you.\" Recommended: Trump's reality TV playbook: Seven ways it changed 2016 election \nWhile Mr. Harrigan contends that his claims weren't serious, and were made privately on his Facebook page to friends he believed would understand that, they spread widely, raising concerns that likely wouldn't have come up before the digital age. Screenshots captured the words and allowed others to repost them on Twitter and Reddit, causing Harrigan to receive harsh criticism, including death threats, and later, a visit from investigators. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/16 \nIn a divisive election cycle, a barrage of offensive posts about both candidates, including racial remarks about the current first family, have surfaced on Facebook, even some shared by elected officials . While such remarks often result in the resignation or termination of those who made them, as they did in Harrigan's case, according to The Washington Post, bringing a criminal case against those who actually threaten the president is a bit trickier. \nThreatening the life of a sitting president or president-elect is a felony that can result in five years behind bars or up to $250,000 in fines. Still, such threats aren't uncommon. \nJust a day before the election, a man in Oregon named John Martin Roos pleaded guilty to making threats to Mr. Obama's life on Facebook and Twitter. While such comments must be investigated with respect to an individual's right to free speech, those that show someone may have actually intended to carry out the threats can face prison time. \nWhile Mr. Roos said he uses social media to \"blow off steam,\" he admitted that he would \"punch Obama in the nose\" if he had the chance. Authorities found rifles, hundreds of rounds and ammunition, and firebombs in his home, prompting them to charge him. \nAn investigation earlier this year into threats from an inmate held in Bridgewater, Mass., yielded similar findings. After he told a fellow inmate, who was working as a cooperating witness with authorities, that he intended to kill Obama , authorities gathered sufficient evidence from his cell to believe the threats had merit. \nHarrigan, whose family has received threats of their own since his post went viral, maintains that his threats against the president-elect weren't serious. He was questioned by two agents who searched his home Monday, but no charges have been brought against him. \n\"What I do know is that I'm deeply regretful for having made any commentary on the president-elect at all,\" Harrigan told The Washington Post. \"I certainly don't want to harm him and I hope he does a great job.\" Next up ",

      "title": "Cuban: Decision To Avoid Trump Hotels Made ‘Months Ago’",
      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nDALLAS (AP) — Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says the team’s decision not to stay at Donald Trump-branded hotels in New York and Chicago was made before the presidential election. \nThe billionaire technology entrepreneur declined Wednesday to elaborate on the decision, telling The Associated Press it “was made months ago. Not recently.” \nCuban was a frequent critic of Trump during the campaign and supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , who lost to the Republican president-elect. \nESPN, citing anonymous sources, reported that Dallas, Memphis and Milwaukee were among the teams that moved away from Trump-branded hotels in New York and Chicago. The network reported that the decision was made in part to avoid any implied association with Trump. \nSeveral NBA coaches have been critical of Trump since the election, including Golden State’s Steve Kerr and San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich. Back in May, before things between him and Trump got testy, Cuban said he’d “absolutely” consider being Trump’s running mate. He’d also “absolutely” consider being Democrat Hillary Clinton’s. And if those don’t work out, the reality show star says maybe he’ll run for president in 2020 or 2024. Cuban’s comments were aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Cuban said at the time, Trump has a “real chance to win” but his statements sound like, “he’s proposing things based off the last person he talked to.” \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nBROWARD (CBSMiami) – Some South Florida police officers have gone well above and beyond the call of duty to help lots of people have a happy Thanksgiving.\nPolice officers from all over Broward were in the spirit of giving.\nThey loaded turkeys into the back of a pickup truck after turkey donations for Health Care for the Homeless did not come through for the Homeless Thanksgiving Feast at the Broward Health Clinic.\nOfficer Sandi Downs-Keesling from the Fort Lauderdale Police Department works with the homeless.\nWhen she heard turkeys were in short supply, she put the word out to fellow officers who work with the needy.\n“Within a couple of hours everyone responded and here we are. We wound up with over 50 turkeys and three hams,” Downs-Keesling said.\nBSO Deputy Lauren Apollo dug into her own pocket.\n“I just asked my district for some cash, I paid the other half and we wanted to donate on behalf of our district,” Apollo said.\nEvery officer and deputy who donated did the same thing – they asked their colleagues for money and pulled out their own cash, thankful they can help the homeless in a more personal way.\n“We understand it’s a time to be thankful, a time to give. The holidays bring that and it brings out the best in everyone,” said Jennifer Bickhardt, an officer with the Wilton Manors Police Department. “We tried to show that we care about our community, whichever department you’re with, we all care.”\nAnd that care is appreciated.\n“That’s very thoughtful of them to think about us and everybody,” said Cindi Johnson.\nThe final count was 62 turkeys, more than enough to feed the estimated 650 people who will show up for the feast on Monday. It will be at the Broward Health Clinic on Broward Boulevard at NW 11th Avenue in Fort Lauderdale.\nOfficers who donated are from Fort Lauderdale, Wilton Manors, BSO Pompano Beach, BSO Oakland Park, Margate, Coconut Creek, Lauderhill, Plantation, Hollywood, Pembroke Pines and Miramar.",

      "text": "Getty Images Fake stories generated more engagement on Facebook than real, mainstream news among top election-related articles, according to data analyzed by BuzzFeed News . \nIn the last three months of the presidential campaigns, top-performing false headlines from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated more than 8.7 million shares, reactions and comments, BuzzFeed News estimated. That's compared to nearly 7.4 million shares, reactions and Facebook comments on the 20 best-performing news stories from mainstream websites, according to BuzzFeed's Craig Silverman.\n\n\"It may seem like the top stories get a lot of traction, but they represent a tiny fraction of the total,\" a company spokesperson told BuzzFeed. CNBC has reached out to Facebook for comment. \n\nFake news that Hillary Clinton sold weapons to terror group ISIS, and that the Pope endorsed Donald Trump, were the top false stories, BuzzFeed said. One fake news site, Ending the Fed, got more engagement on its top viral news than the best-performing content from the Washington Pos t and The New York Times , BuzzFeed News found. \nBuzzFeed's report comes after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bucked accusations that viral content swayed the election, writing, \" Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99 percent of what people see is authentic.\" \nFor the full article, see BuzzFeed.com.",

      "text": "Illustration by Bruno Moraes BTW \nFake election news outperformed real news on Facebook in the three months prior to the presidential election, according to a study conducted by BuzzFeed. \nThe false news stories identified by BuzzFeed come from fake news websites or hyper-partisan websites. \nWith the top 20 election stories, fake news had 8.7 million engagements on Facebook versus 7.3 million from mainstream news. Engagements refer to the number of action taken with the content, whether it's Likes, shares, comments, or clicks. \nSeventeen out of the 20 top stories were pro Trump or anti Clinton. The top false stories included a Donald Trump endorsement from the pope published by Ending the Fed, and a story claiming Hillary Clinton sold weapons to ISIS from the Political Insider. \nThe top stories from mainstream media with the most engagements included “Trump’s history of Corruption is Mind-Boggling. So why is Clinton Supposedly the corrupt one?” published by the Washington Post, and “Stop Pretending you don’t know why people Hate Hillary Clinton” by the Huffington Post. \nThis data shows the extent to which fake news regarding the election was distributed throughout Facebook. Although Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the possibility that fake news swayed the election one way or another, he has recently said Facebook is working on flagging false content. [Placeholder for https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103253901916271 embed.] “We have already launched work enabling our community to flag hoaxes and fake news, and there is more we can do here,” Zuckerberg posted. “We have made progress, and we will continue to work on this to improve further.” \nIn the meantime, watch out for these 130 fake news publishers.",

      "text": "One of Facebook's new face-tracking camera filters. Facebook\nFacebook on Wednesday acquired face recognition technology provider FacioMetrics in a move to beef up its photo and video capabilities. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nA spin-off from Carnegie Mellon University in 2015 as a response to market demand surrounding use of facial image analysis, FacioMetrics is the producer of developer tools for understanding facial behavior and demographic from videos, detection, and even letting you swap faces. It appears that all of its apps have been removed from both the App Store and Google Play store.\nCompanies that used FacioMetrics’ technology include those in the academic and industry world, such as Lightricks, Anki, Meograph, University of Kentucky, Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and a “leading social networking company” — perhaps Facebook?\n“How people share and communicate is changing and things like masks and other effects allow people to express themselves in fun and creative ways,” remarked a Facebook spokesperson in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome the Faciometrics team who will help bring more fun effects to photos and videos and build even more engaging sharing experiences on Facebook .”\nThe purchase of FacioMetrics comes weeks after Facebook demonstrated Prisma-like filters for its live video product. At this year’s WSJD Live conference, chief product officer Chris Cox showcased a new app which would let you transfer the style of an artist, such as Rembrandt onto your image using Convolutional Neural Network and computer vision. It also isn’t the social networking company’s first foray into the image recognition space.\nCox explained that real-time implementation was the hardest challenge the company faced, as the program functions at 24 frames per second. “It’s taking something that’s a known technology, but it was getting it to be fast on a phone and to be able to be done at a low-enough latency, without dropping frames, stuttering, or…blurring.” The app is still in its prototyping phase, but there’s certainly an advantage to get these augmented reality filters up and running sooner than later.\nThe battle for influencers and content creators around live video is heating up and while giving people the ability to livestream is one thing, empowering them to own the experience is another. And it’s here where FacioMetrics could play an important role.\nCertainly this is impactful for Facebook, especially around its Oculus VR division and will pair well with technology gleaned through its Face.com purchase in 2012 . With Oculus, FacioMetrics’ technology could assist developers in developing more realistic-like experiences so avatars appear and respond more like the user.\nHere’s FacioMetrics’ announcement of the acquisition by its chief executive Fernando De La Torre:\nWe started FacioMetrics to respond to the increasing interest and demand for facial image analysis – with all kinds of applications including augmented/virtual reality, animation, audience reaction measurement, and others. We began our research at Carnegie Mellon University developing state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms for facial image analysis. Over time, we have successfully developed and integrated this cutting-edge technology into battery-friendly and efficient mobile applications, and also created new applications of this technology.\nNow, we’re taking a big step forward by joining the team at Facebook, where we’ll be able to advance our work at an incredible scale, reaching people from across the globe. We are thrilled for our next big step forward by joining Facebook. We’d like to thank Carnegie Mellon University and our clients for their trust and support – we couldn’t have made it this far without them.\nWe are looking forward to getting started at Facebook!\nRead the original article on VentureBeat .

It’s going to be a big impact,” said passenger Cristiano Amargo. \n“Everybody just had a this is ridiculous face,” said passenger Kevin Hsieh. “But it’s better safe than sorry, under this situation there’s no use in yelling. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/Illustration \nSAN FRANCISCO - Facebook on Wednesday said that was working to fix flaws in its metrics calculations that led to the audience being overestimated at times. \nIt was the second time in months that Facebook acknowledged problems with assessing the reach of content at the leading online social network, a key factor in luring crucial advertising. \nIn September, Facebook said it had overestimated the average amount of time spent watching videos over the course of the previous two years. \nFacebook on Wednesday said a software bug went live in May that let repeat visits to online pages of companies or brands be counted as though someone new was taking a look each time. \nThe software did not \"de-duplicate\" visits as intended, causing calculated averages for visits during seven- or 28-day periods to be inflated by 33 percent and 55 percent, respectively, according to Facebook \nThe social network also said that since August it has been overestimating by about seven percent the time spent on news stories published using its Instant Articles tool. \nFacebook added that a stricter standard being used for tabulating when paid ads are viewed in news feeds at the social network was expected to reduce \"reported reach\" by an average of 20 percent. \nOn the other hand, Facebook said it had been undercounting the number of videos watched to completion, and expected a fix to boost that number by 35 percent. \nThe erroneous metrics were not those used to determine ad prices at the social network, according to Facebook. \nHowever, the reach of content at Facebook is important to advertisers or companies when it comes to evaluating the potential impact of marketing campaigns. \nThe social network has an interest in maintaining advertiser confidence with reliable audience metrics. Facebook makes the bulk of its money from online advertising. \nFacebook on Wednesday said it was taking steps to make information about its reach more reliable and transparent. \n\"We know that having access to reliable metrics is important to the millions of partners who use our services to grow their businesses,\" Facebook said in a blog post. \n\"As our products evolve to meet the needs of the people and businesses that use them, our metrics will also evolve.\" \nFacebook also promised more collaborations with data-tracking companies such as comScore and Nielsen to ramp up third-party verification. \nShare",

Posted 17 Nov 2016 13:53 Updated 17 Nov 2016 14:00 Mark Zuckerberg was among two million still-living Facebook users whose profile pages were accidentally issued with memorial messages AFP/Lluis Gene A \nWASHINGTON: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's account on social media platform Pinterest was hacked by members from hacking group OurMine, according to media reports on Wednesday (Nov 16). \nThis was the second time the group had hijacked Zuckerberg's social media accounts after breaking into his Pinterest and Twitter accounts back in June, reported Forbes. \nThe post on his Pinterest page read, \"Hacked by OurMine\" and “Don’t worry, we are just testing your security, please contact us to tell you more about that and help you to keep your accounts safe.” \nForbes cited ZDNet's Zack Whittaker as saying that the hackers this time \"discovered a vulnerability on Pinterest\" and exploited it. \nAccording to CNET, OurMine is known for \"targeting high-profile users, such as company bosses and tech executives, and defacing their web accounts with the group's name and a contact address\". \nReports said the group had also claimed responsibility for the cyber attack on Buzzfeed in October. \nOn Friday (Nov 12), Facebook accidentally declared Zuckerberg and many other users dead , acknowledging after fixing the problem that it had committed a \"terrible error.\" \nThe social network apologized and said it worked as quickly as possible to correct the problem. - CNA/mn",

      "text": "Joy Karega Via Facebook: jakare01 ID: 9998708 Karega’s Facebook posts were screenshotted and shared on the pro-Israel magazine the Tower in February. One post from 2015 after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris showed an ISIS fighter tearing off a mask of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with the conspiracy theory that Israel caused the attack in order to get France to stop supporting Palestine.\nIn another post from Dec. 2014, Karega included a photo of banker Jacob Rothschild, with text saying “We own nearly every central bank in the world. We financed both sides of every war since Napoleon. We own your news, the media, your oil and your government.”\nIn another post, she falsely accused Israel of taking down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine. “All things considered, it seems obvious that the same people behind the massacre in Gaza are behind the shooting down MA-17. The Israeli ground offensive began the very same day Flight 17 was shot down.”\nAll of Karega’s posts were deleted after gaining attention.\nIn response, Oberlin’s President Marvin Krislov said although he was Jewish and had family who had died in the Holocaust that as an academic he believed in the freedom of expression.\nBut then in August, Kargea was suspended and placed on paid leave.\nA statement from Scott Wargo, the director of media relations for Oberlin, said that the college had been “considering carefully the grave issues surrounding the anti-Semitic postings on social media by Oberlin faculty member Dr. Joy Karega.”\nKarega earned her PhD at the University of Louisville in 2014, writing her thesis on black activism, and taught classes at Oberlin with titles such as “Writing For Social Justice.”\nHer termination was finally announced Tuesday, which emphasized the fact that Karega refused to apologize for her posts.\n“In the face of Dr. Karega’s repeated refusal to acknowledge and remedy her misconduct, her continued presence undermines the mission and values of Oberlin’s academic community,” the college said in a statement . “Thus, any sanction short of dismissal is insufficient and the Board of Trustees is compelled to take this most serious action.”\nKarega wrote in a statement shared with Inside Higher Education that she intends to “challenge the college’s decision and assault on my substantive rights through all the avenues I have available to me.” She also said the Facebook posts were taken out of context.\n“Since the publication of the posts, I have been inundated with hundreds of hatemail filled with slurs (racial, misogynist, classist), harassment and threats,” she said. “To add insult to injury, for the last eight months, Oberlin has campaigned to implicate my professional fitness using arbitrary, inequitable and discriminatory practices. Indeed, the college launched an assault on my substantive rights.”",

      "text": "share Facebook has stopped collecting WhatsApp user data across Europe, the Financial Times reports , bowing to pressure from privacy watchdogs across the continent. The shift in policy means that European users of the messaging app will no longer have information — including phone numbers — relayed to Facebook, but the social network says it may only be a temporary suspension while the laws are debated. “We hope to continue our detailed conversations with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office and other data protection officials,” Facebook says, confirming that it “remain[s] open to working collaboratively to address their questions.” Facebook bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, but only started to collect data from its users in August this year . That move drew criticism from Europe’s data collection authorities, 28 of whom signed an open letter sent last month in which they urged WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum to suspend data collection until the legality was worked out. Germany already ordered Facebook to stop collecting the data The Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s office — Facebook’s European regulatory body — confirmed to the Financial Times that Facebook had indeed suspended European data collection last week. The company had already been ordered to halt the practice in Germany: German authorities ruled that the collection of app data constituted \"an infringement of national data protection law,” and also demanded that Facebook delete all data that had already been obtained on the country’s 35 million WhatsApp users. Other countries, including the UK, France, and Italy, have their own ongoing investigations into Facebook’s data collection. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Facebook users were much more engaged with fake election news than real news before the election 5:46 a.m. ET \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be right that it's \"extremely unlikely\" fake news and hoax news on his social network affected the results of the U.S. presidential election, but it also appears true that, as some Facebook employees attest , Facebook has a fake-news problem. During the crucial final three months of the election, the top 20 fake election articles on Facebook generated more engagement — shares, likes, comments — than the 20 best-performing election articles from legitimate news sites, according to a BuzzFeed analysis . Viral fake election news outperformed real news on Facebook in final months of the US election https://t.co/xiURnpZv1s pic.twitter.com/xggwGK8Vkw \n— BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) November 16, 2016 \nThe top 20 fake and hoax election stories generated a combined 8.7 million shares, likes, and comments in the final three months of the campaigns, while the top election stories and op-eds from The Washington Post , The New York Times , NBC News, The Wall Street Journal , CNN, USA Today , and other purveyors of reported news earned 7.4 million reactions. The clear winner was Ending the Fed , a website that was registered in March and doesn't list an owner. That site notched four of the top 10 fake election stories on Facebook, with a false story about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump taking the top overall spot; combined with hoax articles about Hillary Clinton selling weapons to ISIS, Clinton being disqualified to run, and FBI Director James Comey getting millions from the Clinton Foundation, the four fake articles generated nearly 3 million engagements in three months. \nAll but three of the top 20 fake election news articles were pro-Trump or anti-Clinton. \"I'm troubled that Facebook is doing so little to combat fake news,\" Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan tells BuzzFeed News . \"Even if they did not swing the election, the evidence is clear that bogus stories have incredible reach on the network. Facebook should be fighting misinformation, not amplifying it.\" Facebook pushed back, telling BuzzFeed that engagement does not equal traffic. \"It may seem like the top stories get a lot of traction, but they represent a tiny fraction of the total,\" a Facebook spokesman said. Facebook and Google took steps this week to tamp down on fake news.

One of the few firm positions Donald Trump took during the campaign was on how great Putin is, even after the CIA and other U.S. intelligence services told him that the Russian government hacked the Democrats, Colbert said. And just yesterday, \"Michael Rogers, the sitting head of the NSA, said the Clinton campaign was targeted by a foreign power. \" \nWhen Putin spoke with Trump after his election, \"the new celebrity power couple — I'm going with Donomir Prumpin — discussed threats and challenges facing the United States,\" Colbert said, \"which was easy to remember, because the threat was talking to the challenge.\" Afterward, the Kremlin said the call was part of a \"joint effort to normalize relations,\" he added, and he didn't think that's a great idea: \"Don't normalize it. It's not normal. Once again, it's weird.\" \n\"Despite the fact that we know Vladimir Putin's a bad guy, Trump cartoonishly insists that he's a model for leadership,\" Colbert said. \"Well, here now to answer for this is Cartoon Donald Trump.\" Colbert congratulated the cartoon president-elect, but it turned out Cartoon Trump wasn't alone. \"You just got that answer from him,\" Colbert said, after Cartoon Vladimir Putin whispered something in Cartoon Trump's ear. \"What? No, we're just good friends,\" Cartoon Trump said. \"We're so close we finish each other's...\" \"Elections,\" Cartoon Putin said. Then things got kind of strange. Watch below.

He did not take their calls for nearly two weeks, didn't even acknowledge the honor until a brief mention of it appeared then disappeared on his website five days after the Nobel was announced on Oct. 13, and only revealed that he had accepted the prestigious award (and its $870,000 check) in an Oct. 28 interview with a British newspaper. On Wednesday, the Swedish Academy said Dylan won't show up on Dec. 10 to accept his Nobel Prize. \n\"Yesterday evening the Swedish Academy received a personal letter from Bob Dylan, in which he explained that due to pre-existing commitments, he is unable to travel to Stockholm in December and therefore will not attend the Nobel Prize Ceremony,\" the academy said in a note on its website . \"He underscored, once again, that he feels very honored indeed, wishing that he could receive the prize in person.\" The Swedish Academy said the decision to skip the ceremony is \"unusual, to be sure, but not exceptional,\" and that the prize is still his as long as he gives a Nobel Lecture within six months. \n\"It is unclear what commitments Mr. Dylan might be referring to,\" The New York Times notes . \"His official website lists no tour dates after Nov. 23.\" If this seems rude — and chairman of the Nobel Literature committee Per Wastberg called Dylan's refusal to take their calls \"impolite and arrogant,\" and said his decision to skip the ceremony is baffling — Dylan isn't the first literature laureate to snub the Noble, or even the rudest. Jean-Paul Sartre refused the Nobel in 1964, and Doris Lessing, who also ditched the ceremony, grumbled \"Oh, Christ,\" when informed that she'd won the award in 2007. Other laureates, like Harold Pinter, could not attend because they were close to death.

He had reportedly been fighting cancer, but on Wednesday, his manager, Robert Kory, said that Cohen died after a late-night tumble on Nov. 7, three days before his death was announced . \"Leonard Cohen died during his sleep following a fall in the middle of the night on Nov. 7,\" Kory said in a statement . \"The death was sudden, unexpected, and peaceful.\" \nCohen had been working right up until the end, and it wasn't clear before his death that his just-released album, \"You Want It Darker,\" was to be his swan song . Collaborator Patrick Leonard tells The New York Times that he and Cohen were working on two other albums, one with string arrangements of his songs and another featuring songs inspired by old R&B grooves, and Cohen was also finishing a book of poetry. \"He felt the window was getting narrower,\" Leonard said. \"He wanted to use the time as productively as he could to finish the work that he was so good at and so devoted to.\" Peter Weber \nJimmy Fallon, Metallica play the toy-instrument acoustic 'Enter Sandman' you never asked for 2:20 a.m. ET \nMany of the most-coveted Tonight Show viewers were in grade school when Metallica released its fifth album, Metallica , in 1991, with its hit song \"Enter Sandman.\" So things kind of came full circle when Metallica joined Jimmy Fallon and the Roots on Wednesday's show to play that song with classroom instruments. The Casio keyboard isn't technically acoustic, but with James Hetfield adding toy clarinet to his vocals and Lars Ulrich banging away on a Fisher Price drum, this is not your typical Metallic performance. Still, \"exit light, enter night\" is still a rollicking call to darkness, and \"hush little baby, don't say a word, and never mind that noise you heard\" is only slightly less creepy when whispered alongside toy instruments.

Peter Weber \nMegyn Kelly tells Anderson Cooper how threats from Team Trump led to a year of security guards 1:49 a.m. ET \nFox News anchor Megyn Kelly told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night that nothing could have prepared her for the firestorm that erupted after she confronted Donald Trump at an early GOP primary debate about his history of disparaging women. Trump had spoken with her four days earlier on the phone, angry about one of her segments, and he called her a disgrace and threatened to unleash his Twitter account on her. He was only angrier after the debate, and insisted on going on CNN at the same time her show aired on Fox. It was on that CNN segment he made his \"blood coming out of her whatever\" comment, Kelly said, and \"things would never be the same. It was a game-changer.\" \nThe changed game included security for her and her family. \"We had security guards the whole year,\" Kelly said. \"I mean, the threat level got so high that it was impossible not to take that seriously.\" It wasn't just Trump, either. Michael Cohen, a Trump surrogate and lawyer, had retweeted a threat to \"gut\" Kelly, earning a scolding from Fox executive Bill Shine. \"He didn't much care, and what Bill Shine said to Michael Cohen was, 'Let me put it to you in terms you can understand: If Megyn Kelly gets killed, it's not going to help your candidate,'\" Kelly recounted. \n\"There's no question that some of the tactics engaged in by those supporting — in Team Trump, were questionable,\" she added. \"Corey Lewandowski specifically threatened me if I showed up at the second debate hosted by Fox News,\" and various threats continued until the election. \"The point is,\" Kelly said, \"these are not your normal tactics that we see in a presidential race unleashed against a journalist who asked a tough question.\" \nCooper asked about the serial sexual harassment by ousted Fox News chief Roger Ailes, and Bill O'Reilly's comment that Kelly should have gone to HR instead of spilling the story in a book. \"At Fox News it's very true that Roger Ailes was very much a king of sorts,\" Kelly said. \"He had loyalists placed throughout the company and he demanded loyalty. I mean, O'Reilly speaks of loyalty — that is the culture that Roger demanded, that that should be placed above all things.\" Cooper and Kelly ended with their shared experience of losing a father at a young age.

      "text": "\"Fake news *beat* real news on Facebook over last 3 months of election,\" Ben Smith at Buzzfeed tweeted out. Alex Wagner, newly named an anchor at CBS, tweeted \"Here's a thing: viral fake news outperformed real news in the last 3 months of the election.\"\nThese tweets link to a Buzzfeed story headlined \"Viral Fake Election News Outperformed Real News On Facebook In Final Months Of The US Election.\" The story has interesting data about the proliferation of a few fake news stories, but it comes nowhere near proving the headline or Ben Smith's tweet, that Fake News Beat Real News.\nThe methodology is a mess in many ways.\nFirst, it doesn't measure how much traffic went to fake election stories versus real election stories — it only picks the top few stories in each genre. Second, the study only chooses from a handful of mainstream sites. Third, the \"Real News\" stories often aren't real news at all—a point which doesn't undercut the conclusion as much as it shows the silliness of the comparison.\nThe BuzzFeed study looked only at the top 20 election stories, in terms of engagement, by fake websites and compared it the top 20 election stories from a tiny list of mainstream sites. The list included left-leaning opinion-heavy outlets like Huffington Post and Vox. They didn't include Yahoo News and the Daily Mail, two of the most-read news sites in the U.S. Also excluded: Reuters, BBC, Associated Press, Bloomberg, and, ahem, the Washington Examiner . You could add the Boston Globe, the Chicago Tribune and the major newspapers in every city besides New York, L.A., and D.C.\nSo the \"Real News\" numbers are from an incomplete, odd, and unexplained subsample of the media.\nAlso, the \"Real News\" isn't even Real News.\nLook at the top \"Real News\" stories to which Buzzfeed compares the fake news stories.\nHere's the top \"Real News\" stories: \"Trump's history of corruption is mind-boggling. So why is Clinton supposedly the corrupt one?\" As the headline suggests, this is a liberal opinion piece, complaining that the media doesn't report enough on Trump's scandals.\nAlso   Nervousness about Trump lingers among GOP governors It's clear that they're relying on Mike Pence to steer the Trump administration in a conservative direction.\nBy David M. Drucker • 11/17/16 6:00 AM No. 2 is \"Stop Pretending You Don't Know Why People Hate Hillary Clinton .\" This is a rambling screed claiming that people only dislike Clinton because she is a woman.\nThe No. 3 \"Real News\" story is \"Melania Trump's Girl-on-Girl Photos From Racy Shoot Revealed,\" published at the New York Post.\nTo be clear, the journalists gnashing their teeth about \"Fake Election News\" winning would have been less concerned if \"Melania Trump's Girl-on-Girl Photos\" had received more clicks.\nThis study tells us nothing. But that hasn't kept it from catching on.\nTimothy P. Carney, The Washington Examiner's senior political columnist, can be contacted at tcarney@washingtonexaminer.com . His column appears Tuesday and Thursday nights on washingtonexaminer.com. \nAlso   Report: Trump considering Nikki Haley for secretary of state President-elect Trump might be flirting with the idea of selecting South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as his secretary of state.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 11/17/16 12:30 AM  ",

      "text": "Facebook working with 'major ad group' to fix metrics screwup \nNevertheless, industry insiders said the inflated figures likely swayed ad-buying decisions as Facebook competed for ad dollars with everybody from Google’s search engine to struggling newspaper sites. \n“It’s not difficult to measure views. It’s not difficult to measure engagement. It’s not difficult to measure any ad metric,” said Mike Gamaroff of Sito Mobile, an ad-targeting firm. “For Facebook to over-report these metrics is pretty inexcusable.” \nThe disclosures came as Chief Executive Zuckerberg is taking heat for allowing a barrage of fake news stories to propagate across its site, a policy some critics say may have tipped the outcome of the presidential election. \nEarlier this month, Facebook shares got slammed after it told investors it expects a “meaningful” slowdown in ad-revenue growth next year as it seeks to avoid saturating users’ News Feeds with marketing posts. \nTo fix the ad-metric mess, Facebook said Wednesday it will begin allowing third-party firms like comScore and Moat to vet its viewability data for display-ad campaigns, in addition to video campaigns. \nThe tech giant also said it is working with TV-ratings firm Nielsen to count video views, and that it’s forming a “Measurement Council” of marketers and ad-agency execs to monitor its metrics. \nStill, Facebook stopped short of putting all of its ad measurements up for third-party verification — a stubborn refusal that continues to undermine trust in its ad data, critics say. \n“It certainly doesn’t look good,” said Mitchell Reichgut of Jun Group, a New York ad firm. “Online advertising has a history of opaque reporting, and this doesn’t help.” \nFacebook, which has more than 4 million advertisers, has been growing its ad revenue this year at more than three times the rate of the overall online ad market, according to Cantor Fitzgerald.

      "text": "Photo via Charles Foster Lime/Facebook What the duck? Facebook hasn't done much to curb its disastrous fake news problem , but when it comes to confusing photos of birds, the social network isn't taking any risks. \nEarlier this year, Facebook cracked down on a photo of a goose that appeared to be on fire . Now it has apparently suspended a user for \"nudity\" over photos of a rubber duck. \nThe craziest part is that the duck was wearing clothes. \nThe pair of pics was posted years ago by one Charles Foster Lime , but Facebook has just gotten around to flagging them as \"nudity\" and suspending Lime for 30 days. There was no nudity, though: one photo showed a pair of pants with a conspicuous crotch bulge. The other showed the fly of the pants open, revealing that the bulge was a rubber duck. [Placeholder for https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=562130087309091&set=p.562130087309091&type=3&theater embed.] — Suscepimus (@suscepimus) November 16, 2016 It's not even clear that anyone's in the pile of clothes. There's no exposed penis here, and there might not even be a covered one. Nice going, Facebook. \nOnce the photos went down, Lime's friends began reposting them in protest of Facebook's bizarre, uneven enforcement of its \"community standards.\" Unsurprisingly, Facebook took those down, too: FACEBOOK: No we won't do anything about fake news or Nazis or whatever but here's a 30 day ban for posting pictures of a duck pic.twitter.com/kzm67lECf0 — K. Thor Jensen (@kthorjensen) November 16, 2016 The users protested the removal of the photo, arguing that it was just a photo of \"a duck in a pile of laundry,\" but things only got more ridiculous. Facebook reviewed the photo again, in light of the fact that there was no actual nudity, and decided it still somehow violated the site's rules. \nWhether you're running past a campfire or popping out through the fly of a pair of trousers, it's hard to be a bird on Facebook.",

      "text": "I’ve been debating whether to weigh in on the Facebook fake news issue and role the platform played in the 2016 US Presidential Election. For one, it feels like most people are largely fatigued by Trump v Clinton and need a bit of a break to take it all in and assess where we’re at, and Facebook’s involvement has also been so heavily covered on other platforms that I wasn’t sure it needed re-iterating here.\nBut readers have asked about it and why we’ve not covered it, so here are three points that I think are relevant to the debate and the lasting implications of the 2016 US Presidential Election result.\n1. Facebook Absolutely Influenced the Vote To deny this is illogical – Facebook now plays an integral role in the dissemination and distribution of news, and as such, it also plays a role in how people are informed, thereby influencing what they think. Add to this the fact that Facebook’s News Feed is fuelled by an algorithm which provides users with more content similar to that which they’re interacting with , and the link is fairly obvious.\nReally, it’s not even up for debate – as has been Quote: d elsewhere, research shows that 67% of Americans use Facebook , and two-thirds of them get news there, equating to around 44% of the entire population who get at least some of their news from the site.\nThat number's likely even higher now – this research was conducted by Pew Research back in in January and Facebook’s North American user base has grown by seven million since then. It's fair to assume that a significant amount of those new users are also now getting news updates from the site.\nContrast that against the declines in overall TV consumption and newspaper readership and the impact is obvious - one way or another, Facebook’s rising prominence as a media source means the platform absolutely wields significant influence over news delivery, which, in turn, impacts audience behavior – but the case has actually been proven even more definitively than that.\nBack in 2010, around 340,000 extra voters turned out to take part in the US Congressional elections because of a single election-day Facebook message . This is based on research co-authored by Facebook, in which they proclaimed that it was:\n“…the first [study] to demonstrate that the online world can affect a significant real-world behaviour on a large scale.”\nThe process they used to prove this was relatively simple:\n“About 611,000 users (1%) received an 'informational message' at the top of their news feeds, which encouraged them to vote, provided a link to information on local polling places and included a clickable 'I voted' button and a counter of Facebook users who had clicked it. About 60 million users (98%) received a 'social message', which included the same elements but also showed the profile pictures of up to six randomly selected Facebook friends who had clicked the 'I voted' button. The remaining 1% of users were assigned to a control group that received no message.”\nThe results showed that users who received the 'informational' message (the top message in the above screenshot) voted at the same rate as those who saw no message at all, while those who saw the 'social' message – with images of their friends included (lower example in above screenshot) were 2% more likely to click the ‘I voted’ button and 0.4% more likely to head to the polls than the other group. Based on this, researchers estimated that the social message directly increased voter turnout by 60,000 votes, while a further 280,000 people were “indirectly nudged to the polls” by seeing messages in their News Feeds - \"notifications that their friends had voted\".\nThis is direct influence on an election via Facebook content. It’s not even a hypothetical, this research - again, co-authored by Facebook - proves it.\nWanna’ find out if Facebook thinks you’re more Liberal or Conservative based on your on-platform actions? You can do that too – go to www.facebook.com/ads/preferences , click on the \"Lifestyle and culture\" tab under the “Interests” section, then look for a box in that section titled \"US politics\".\nAgain (and as noted in the image), this is based on your on-platform actions, Facebook is well aware of users’ political leanings and has been using it as a targeting option, so this factor definitely does have some influence on the content you see. These elements all point to the fact that Facebook absolutely influences political opinion and how people subsequently vote – and even on a basic level, on your own usage of the platform, you know this.\nFor example, let’s say you’re going through you’re News Feed and you’re a Donald Trump supporter and there’s a friend of yours who’s posting a heap of links to articles about how bad Trump is and how Hillary is great. He gets annoying. You unfollow him. Granted, this is within the control of the user, not the platform, but at best, Facebook facilitates the expansion of political echo-chambers by making it easier than ever to filter out anything that doesn’t align with your perspective – while the News Feed algorithm also uses those actions as signals in order to serve you more personally relevant content, and we know that Facebook can infer political leaning based on such actions.\nThe News Feed shows you more of what you engage with, which is likely what you agree with, and less of what you don’t. By design, its reinforcement theory in practice – but the question then is whether that influence was enough to change the vote.\n2. Eliminating Fake News Probably Won't Provide the Solution Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the notion that fake or misleading content could have influenced the election result, noting that it only amounts to around 1% of content on the network. That seems like an underestimation given the evidence.\nFor example, BuzzFeed recently published the results of their investigation which found that in the final three months of the US presidential campaign, \"the top-performing fake election news stories on Facebook generated more engagement than the top stories from major news outlets such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, NBC News, and others\"\nNow that's not all of the content on Facebook, it's only a subset as sampled by BuzzFeed - but still there's a clear trend from that May-July period. So what happened in that space of time that could have had an impact.\nThe uptick in fake news engagement matches when Facebook put \"friends first\" over traditional publishers June 30th https://t.co/O5eHNblHdG pic.twitter.com/fZ43a4ZO8r\n— Josh Constine (@JoshConstine) November 17, 2016 This seems to correlate with previous studies - as noted in the 2010 election experiment, people were influenced to act when shown the 'social' message, the image with pictures of your friends on it, which enhanced the peer pressure of the notification. The jump in fake news shares is based on the same principle - Facebook's algorithm change put increased emphasis on what your friends were sharing ahead of Page posts, adding to the wider reach, and also the implied peer pressure, of those viewpoints. If your friends were engaging and sharing more of this content, you were bound to see more of it - combine that with increased discussion around the election and the theory makes sense. The spread of fake news increases, more people are influenced by those reports, the outcome is delivered.\nBut even if those fake reports were reaching a wider audience, were they actually able to influence the way people voted?\nThis element is much more difficult to prove. It's clear now that fake news ran rife throughout the election period – even Facebook insiders have (reportedly) admitted this . Stories like the Pope endorsing Donald Trump , Bill Clinton being charged with child rape , the murder of someone who was set to testify against Hillary Clinton – all of these falsehoods gained traction online and likely solidified people’s support one way or another, but these tales only gained traction at all because of the bigger concern with Facebook’s news feed, that being that it actively works to deliver more content which supports your existing beliefs, while banishing alternate perspectives from view. From that perspective, it seems more likely that fake reports merely reinforced people’s pre-existing opinions as opposed to shaping them - but that discounts the huge amount of undecided voters who, given the final margin, would have influenced the result.\nGoing on the research Quote: d above, it would suggest that what your friends share is definitely able to inspire real world action, and with more fake stories being shared, the influence seems clear.\nBut even if that was the case, it's not fake news that's the core issue, it's the echo-chamber - people being shown more of what they agree with, and subsequently engaging with that content, has then lead to that content having more reach and influence. And because the algorithm learns from your on-platform actions, they're also getting less and less exposure to the other side's perspective, thus, their viewpoint is only being underlined further and further with each post.\nFor example, if you saw a post in your feed that said that Hillary Clinton knowingly funded terrorism and you clicked on it, Facebook would take that as an indicator that you're interested in that topic, and you might suddenly see more stories along the same lines, while opposing views would be lessened, based on your now noted political preference.\nThat polarization was highlighted in a study conducted by The Guardian in which they asked ten voters - five conservative and five liberal – to switch sides and view Facebook feeds from the other perspective in the final month of the campaign. The Guardian created two Facebook accounts, one that followed pro-liberal news sites and one pro-conservative, then handed them to the participants of the opposing view.\nThe participants were amazed at the coverage they were seeing – one described the experience as being “like reading a book by a fool”, while another said it was “like being locked into a room full of those suffering from paranoid delusions”.\nThe experiment showed that the content each side is seeing is very different - but it wasn’t necessarily fake news or lies that were influencing their choices. In fact, none of the participants changed their vote as a result, and none of them made specific note about lies being debunked by the other side. The participants had pre-existing beliefs which had been fueled by their own experiences and connections - what they were seeing on Facebook only helped to reinforce them.\nOne participant noted that:\n“I did unfollow a lot of friends because I didn’t want to feel enticed to correct what they were saying and get in a fight.”\nThis seems to be a larger concern than fake news, that people are so easily able to switch off dissenting views. We presume that those on the other side of the debate are seeing the same evidence we're seeing because we're totally eliminating the counter, which is why we're so incredulous when so many end up supporting the opposing view.\nIn this sense, the role that fake news played in the process is only part of the bigger issue. Definitely, the increased spread of fake stories would have helped justify people’s existing leanings, and that, you can assume, had subsequent influence on undecided voters. But on a broad scale, if you were to remove fake content from the equation, it may not have actually changed the result.\nWhile eliminating fake news is a positive step in any case, the echo chamber is the more divisive element, and the real concern we should be discussing in regards to Facebook.\n3. What Comes Next? And here’s the bigger question. Now that Trump is the US President and the nation seems more divided than it has in years, what happens next? What influence will social media echo chambers have in reinforcing the existing divisions and pushing people to take sides?\nMore than ever, people need understanding - they need to understand why people would vote for one side or another, what lead them to this conclusion, because it seems that the majority were clearly shocked at the result and that people are genuinely struggling to see why voters of the opposing view have given their support to either candidate.\nRight now, that’s the perspective we need in order to see the problems and issues that are present and move forward, but the concern here is that with that echo chamber effect in place, that may not be possible. If people’s existing views are only being reinforced by the media they consume, then we’re likely to see those divisions become bigger, more significant concerns over time. And given the current state, that’s a huge issue, and something that needs to be addressed.\nIn this respect, analyzing Facebook’s possible role in the 2016 US Presidential Election should be less about how the results played out and more about how people are getting their information, and how we can ensure there’s more diversity of opinion being shared to better align these two opposing perspectives. Sure, we’re never going to all see eye-to-eye, but if we’re divided now, and there’s an influential medium in the middle that’s built, essentially, around fueling that division even further, it seems that the situation is only going to get worse.\nAnd the solution could be hard to pinpoint – Facebook works to give users more of the content they like and want to see, which ultimately puts the power in their hands. If users want to narrow their perspective, they can. Given this, how do you prevent people from shutting out opposing voices and gaining more understanding of those around them?\nIt used to be that you’d watch the TV news, you’d read the newspaper - all of these sources would at least provide some exposure to alternate perspectives or events. But now it's perspective-based, it's interest-based - you can hone in on only the things you’re interested in and just see more and more of that, underlining, reinforcing and growing your opposition or agreement.\nThis is likely to be one of the most pressing issues of the next stage of media development, and right now it feels like a flashpoint, a critical juncture where the true impacts of this new media construct are becoming clear. How we address them, now that we’ve come so far in this new self-curation and user-controlled cycle, is something no one can answer at this stage.",

      "text": "Facebook's fake news activity spiked near election day The fake stories mostly came from hoax websites and hyperpartisan publications. Share Save \nMark Zuckerberg said it's unlikely that the small amount of fake stories circulating on Facebook affected the outcome of the presidential elections. According to Buzzfeed News' investigation, though, that \"small amount\" of hoaxes outperformed (Google Doc) stories from legit sources on the social network during the final three months of the campaign period. The top 20 fake stories from August to election day apparently generated 8,711,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook, whereas the top 20 from 19 mainstream news websites only generated 7,367,000. \nBefore that period, mainstream sources generated up to four times the engagement fake sources did. It's not exactly clear what caused the shift, but it's worth noting that in the end of June this year, Facebook updated its News Feed algorithm to prioritize the updates your friends share over posts from other sources. \nBuzzfeed says 17 of the 20 top-performing hoaxes were overtly pro-Trump or anti-Clinton. That supports earlier reports that Facebook didn't address its fake news problem, because it would've removed a lot of conservative content from people's Feeds. Three of the top five hoaxes, for instance, claim that the Pope endorsed the President-Elect, that Hillary Clinton sold weapons to ISIS and that the FBI agent suspected of leaking Clinton's emails was found dead. \nThere were a handful of fake anti-Trump stories that made the rounds, including one that claims Mike Pence called Michelle Obama the \"most vulgar first lady we've ever had.\" But Buzzfeed found that most of the fake content in the list ultimately came from hoax websites or from hyperpartisan right-wing publishers. Some of those publishers even registered their domains merely a few months before the elections. \n[Image credit: Buzzfeed ] \nAs Buzzfeed noted, though, Facebook likes, shares and comments don't necessarily translate into traffic. A spokesperson for the social network also told the publication that these 20 fake stories are but a small fraction of everything that's shared on the website. It doesn't necessarily represent the Facebook activity of all the election-related posts, whether fake or real, shared on the social network. \"There is a long tail of stories on Facebook,\" he said. \"It may seem like the top stories get a lot of traction, but they represent a tiny fraction of the total.\" Still, there are dozens of employees within the company who feel like Facebook didn't do enough to prevent fake news from spreading. They're now reportedly investigating the situation from within.",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nKendall Jenner has — in my opinion — always been the best member of the Kardashian clan. \nShe just seems slightly more down to Earth than her siblings, and her face has yet to be completely savaged by modification. \nSo when she appeared on “The Late Late Show with James Corden” and was asked some seriously personal questions about her family, you knew the answers were going to be prime. \nThe 21-year-old played Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts. \nIt’s the perfect concept: answer an intense question about you or your family the entire world is dying to hear, or eat a bull’s penis. There are other disgusting dishes as well, like cod sperm. YouTube \nQuestion number one, as read by Corden, was, \nKendall: Three of your nieces and nephews are named Dream, North and Saint. Rank those baby names from best to worst… Just start with the best, what’s the best name? \nShe could choose not to answer, but she’d have to down a sardine smoothie. But this is Kendall we’re talking about — she answered because she’s a great sport. YouTube \nThe model said, \nI’ve liked North , I’ve always liked North. North, Saint , Dream . I still love them, I still love them. \nWhich is 100 percent the correct answer. \nThen she was asked who her least favorite member of Taylor Swift’s squad is — or drink bird’s saliva (yeah, that’s a thing apparently). YouTube \nShe couldn’t answer, and put away the saliva. \nThen it was Corden’s turn. Kendall asked, \nJames: Your parents are lovely people who often do comedy bits for your show. In fact, they’re here tonight… Who do you prefer, your mom or your dad? \nHe said his dad is great for advice but his mom is there for the hugs. Corden couldn’t decided, though, and downed cod sperm. \nWhat an amazing game — why am I only just learning about this now!?

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nWASHINGTON (AP) – After losing the popular vote, President-elect Donald Trump has decided that the Electoral College is a pretty smart way to elect a president after all. \nBy the time all the votes are counted, Democrat Hillary Clinton will have won the popular vote by more than 1 million, with big leads in big blue states. \nDemocrats have used Clinton’s vote lead to downplay any mandate Trump might claim. \nTrump has shot back on Twitter, saying he would have campaigned differently if the winner were decided by the popular vote. If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2016 \nTrump has 290 Electoral College votes and Clinton has 232, with Michigan still undecided. It takes 270 votes in the Electoral College to win the presidency. \nFour years ago, Trump called the Electoral College a disaster. This week, he called it “genius.” \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.)",

The social media giant will no longer collect device information, including phone numbers, which could be used for advertizing purposes.\nWhatsApp announced in August that it would begin sharing user data with its parent company and afforded its users 30 days to opt in or out of the process. The move drew criticism from authorities across Europe, and investigations into Facebook’s potential data protection violations are ongoing in the UK, Germany, France and Italy.\nSee also: Google and Facebook make moves to stop circulation of fake news 2 days ago Facebook’s decision to halt data collection may only be a temporary measure, however, as it continues “detailed conversations with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office and other data protection officials.” Facebook said that it remained open to “working collaboratively to address their questions.”\nAre you concerned about Facebook and WhatsApp’s data collection practices?

      "text": "Washington Post screenshot In March, Donald Trump’s son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, tweeted links to one of Paul Horner’s faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google. By Caitlin Dewey, The Washington Post\nWhat do the Amish lobby, gay wedding vans and the ban of the national anthem have in common? For starters, they’re all make-believe – and invented by the same man.\nPaul Horner, the 38-year-old impresario of a Facebook fake-news empire, has made his living off viral news hoaxes for several years. He has twice convinced the Internet that he’s British graffiti artist Banksy; he also published the very viral, very fake news of a Yelp vs. “South Park” lawsuit last year.\nBut in recent months, Horner has found the fake-news ecosystem growing more crowded, more political and vastly more influential: In March, Donald Trump’s son Eric and his then-campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, even tweeted links to one of Horner’s faux-articles. His stories have also appeared as news on Google.\nIn light of concerns that stories like Horner’s may have affected the presidential election, and in the wake of announcements that both Google and Facebook would take action against deceptive outlets, The Washington Post called Horner to discuss his perspective on fake news.\nQ: You’ve been writing fake news for a while now – you’re kind of like the OG Facebook news hoaxer. Well, I’d call it hoaxing or fake news. You’d call it parody or satire. How is that scene different now than it was three or five years ago? Why did something like your story about Obama invalidating the election results (almost 250,000 Facebook shares, as of this writing) go so viral?\nA: Honestly, people are definitely dumber. They just keep passing stuff around. Nobody fact-checks anything anymore – I mean, that’s how Trump got elected. He just said whatever he wanted, and people believed everything, and when the things he said turned out not to be true, people didn’t care because they’d already accepted it. It’s real scary. I’ve never seen anything like it.\nQ: You mentioned Trump, and you’ve probably heard the argument, or the concern, that fake news somehow helped him get elected. What do you make of that?\nA: My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers don’t fact-check anything – they’ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist.\nQ: Why? I mean – why would you even write that?\nA: Just ’cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests – trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it.\nI thought they’d fact-check it, and it’d make them look worse. I mean that’s how this always works: Someone posts something I write, then they find out it’s false, then they look like idiots. But Trump supporters – they just keep running with it! They never fact-check anything! Now he’s in the White House. Looking back, instead of hurting the campaign, I think I helped it. And that feels (bad).\nQ: You think you personally helped elect Trump?\nA: I don’t know. I don’t know if I did or not. I don’t know. I don’t know.\nQ: I guess I’m curious, if you believed you might be having an unfair impact on the election – especially if that impact went against your own political beliefs – why didn’t you stop? Why keep writing?\nA: I didn’t think it was possible for him to get elected president. I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasn’t messing them up as much as I wanted – but I never thought he’d actually get elected. I didn’t even think about it. In hindsight, everyone should’ve seen this coming – everyone assumed Hillary (Clinton) would just get in. But she didn’t, and Trump is president.\nQ: Speaking of Clinton – did you target fake news at her supporters? Or Gary Johnson’s, for that matter? (Horner’s Facebook picture shows him at a rally for Johnson.)\nA: No. I hate Trump.\nQ: Is that it? You posted on Facebook a couple weeks ago that you had a lot of ideas for satirizing Clinton and other figures, but that “no joke … in doing this for six years, the people who clicked ads the most, like it’s the cure for cancer, is right-wing Republicans.” That makes it sound like you’ve found targeting conservatives is more profitable.\nA: Yeah, it is. They don’t fact-check.\nQ: But a Trump presidency is good for you from a business perspective, right?\nA: It’s great for anybody who does anything with satire – there’s nothing you can’t write about now that people won’t believe. I can write the craziest thing about Trump, and people will believe it. I wrote a lot of crazy anti-Muslim stuff – like about Trump wanting to put badges on Muslims, or not allowing them in the airport, or making them stand in their own line – and people went along with it!\nQ: Facebook and Google recently announced that they’d no longer let fake-news sites use their advertising platforms. I know you basically make your living from those services. How worried are you about this?\nA: This whole Google AdSense thing is pretty scary. And all this Facebook stuff. I make most of my money from AdSense – like, you wouldn’t believe how much money I make from it. Right now I make like $10,000 a month from AdSense.\nI know ways of getting hooked up under different names and sites. So probably if they cracked down, I would try different things. I have at least 10 sites right now. If they crack down on a couple, I’ll just use others. They could shut down advertising on all my sites, and I think I’d be OK. Plus, Facebook and AdSense make a lot of money from (advertising on fake news sites) for them to just get rid of it. They’d lose a lot of money.\nBut if it did really go away, that would suck. I don’t know what I would do.\nQ: Thinking about this less selfishly, though – it might be good if Facebook and Google took action, right? Because the effects you’re describing are pretty scary.\nA: Yeah, I mean – a lot of the sites people are talking about, they’re just total BS sites. There’s no creativity or purpose behind them. I’m glad they’re getting rid of them. I don’t like getting lumped in with Huzlers. I like getting lumped in with the Onion. The stuff I do – I spend more time on it. There’s purpose and meaning behind it. I don’t just write fake news just to write it.\nSo, yeah, I see a lot of the sites they’re listing, and I’m like – good. There are so many horrible sites out there. I’m glad they’re getting rid of those sites.\nI just hope they don’t get rid of mine, too.",

      "text": "Facebook's new Community Hub feature will be made available during disasters starting next year. Facebook \nNEW YORK — Facebook is ramping up its efforts to become a disaster and crisis response tool. \nThe company revealed a new \"Community Hub\" feature at a press event on Thursday, which will allow Facebook users to connect with those seeking shelter, food, and supplies in the wake of a natural disaster. \nFacebook also announced that its Safety Check feature, which lets people quickly tell their friends that they're safe during a natural disaster or crisis, will only be activated by people already posting about their concerns and not by Facebook employees. \nThe company has previously been met with backlash for activating Safety Check for certain disasters, like the shooting at a Paris nightclub last year, and not others, like the 2015 bombings in Beirut and Lebanon. Now Safety Check will only be enabled when enough people are posting about a crisis like an earthquake or shooting. \nSafety Check was first enabled in 2014 for Typhoon Hagupit in the Philippines, and Facebook turned the feature on for the first time in the U.S. in early 2016 after a gunman massacred 50 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. \n\n\nVisit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

      "text": "Tweet \nA senior adviser to liberal New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has come under fire for a photo he posted on his Facebook page prominently showing a sign that read “F*** Whiteness,” the New York Daily News reported . \nThe three people in Lincoln Restler’s photo: His father holding a “Black + Brown + Immigrant Lives Matter” sign, his mother holding a “Love” sign and his sister holding a “F*** Whiteness” sign, the Daily News confirmed with city hall. Why take it down if you believe it? Mayor de Blasio aide ripped for racist Facebook photo https://t.co/7WcaqhuZES #racism #dumbassery \n— Michael Brown (@MichaelBrownUSA) November 17, 2016 \nRestler said in his now-deleted Nov. 14 post that he captured the image as his family “took to the streets to stand in solidarity with immigrant New Yorkers,” the paper said. \nAs you can imagine, not everyone who caught a glimpse of the image was pleased. \n“Should be former senior advisor,” one commenter wrote on Restler’s Facebook page. “Your racist picture speaks a thousand words of your character as well as your family who gleefully posed for it.” \nAnother commenter wrote: “As a school teacher, I am constantly guiding children to try their best at thinking before they post. Seems as though you missed that lesson.” \n“Liberals are losing the battle,” another commenter said. “And the war. And it shows every time one of them, like you, posts photos like this. What a pack of assholes you all are.” \nFormer City Councilman James Gennaro, who now works for New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo at the Department of Environmental Conservation, blasted the photo on his own Facebook page Monday, the Daily News said. \n“It seems that to the Mayor’s senior advisor, hate is okay as long as the right people (or the right racial ‘state of mind,’ if that’s what is meant by ‘whiteness’) is hated,” Gennaro wrote, the paper said. \nGennaro also chided Restler for taking the post down, according to the Daily News: \nAs much as I detest hate speech, I would have more respect for the Mayor’s senior advisor if he would stand by his FB post and have the courage of his convictions to leave it up. So I’ll do that for him — and post that which I claim to have disdain for, in order to give people a window into the mindset of a key figure of Mayor de Blasio’s policy team, because I believe that one who takes pride in hate and also makes mayoral policy is an incongruity as stark as the signs in his post. \nDe Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips told the paper that Restler was spoken to but not sanctioned and that the mayor doesn’t believe Restler’s photo is appropriate. LOOK! It's @LincolnRestler 's birthday today. Happy Birthday!! pic.twitter.com/cwPWzffpKL \n— New Kings Democrats (@newkingsdems) March 19, 2015 \n“No doubt the message was inartful and not clear enough in its intent and that’s why Lincoln took it off his page,” Phillips told the Daily News. \nRestler makes $107,625 per year and couldn’t be reached for comment, the paper said.",
