      "text": "on Wednesday November 09, 2016 @08:00AM from the like-new dept. In the past, Apple has only sold refurbished Macs, iPads and various niche devices on its refurb store. Now the company is officially selling refurbished iPhones , offering the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in its refurb store . 9to5Mac reports: Apple has sort of sold refurbished iPhones before, but those sales were relegated to an eBay store front and never fully acknowledged by the company. This is the first time that the company has offered iPhones on its official refurb store online . Customers will find the iPhone 6s in 16 GB storage varieties for $449.00. The larger iPhone 6s Plus is being offered in two storage varieties: 16Gb and 64GB for $529 and $589, respectively. It seems that all colors are currently available, which includes Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold. In the end, users can expect to save up to 15% ($110) by going the refurbished route, and remember that these devices come with a full 1-year factory warranty, which makes refurb units a great idea for budget-conscious shoppers. It's also worth noting that all of Apple's official refurbished iPhones are unlocked and come SIM-free, plus they all include a brand new battery and outer shell. It's as close to a new iPhone as you'll get without actually buying one brand new.",

      "text": "Apple Starts Selling Refurbished iPhones on Its Online Store Apple starts selling refurbished iPhones on US online store Users buying these can save up to $100 These refurbed iPhones have 1 year warranty, fresh battery & exterior \nApple has started selling refurbished iPhones via its US online store starting from Tuesday. The models up for sale currently include the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus , that were launched last year. \nThe Cupertino giant is selling refurbished iPhones for the first time on its online store, notes 9to5Mac. The company normally used refurbished units as replacements for users, or sold them via third-party resellers, the report adds. \nA refurbished product is typically one that is returned by a customer after purchase because of either a manufacturing flaw, or product dissatisfaction, and is returned in accordance to Apple’s 14 day return policy . On the refurbished items page , Apple claims that all iPhones on sale are tested by the company, come with a brand new battery and outer shell, and carry a 1-year warranty just like a brand new iPhone. These products are also not locked to any telecom operator. Traditionally, in many countries where Apple’s online store exists (it doesn’t in India yet), the company is known to have sold refurbished Macs , iPads and iPods. At the moment though, it appears that refurbished iPhones are only being sold in the US online stores, as there’s no mention of them on the online stores of other countries such as the UK, Singapore, or Hong Kong.\nIf you compare prices, an iPhone 6s 16GB is being sold for $449 (roughly Rs. 29,969), which makes it $100 (roughly Rs. 6,674) cheaper than a new $549 iPhone 6s 32GB. There are iPhone 6s Plus 64GB units being sold for $589 (roughly Rs. 39,314) that make them $60 cheaper than a new iPhone 6s Plus 32GB. Bear in mind that Apple discontinued 16GB and 64GB iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus variants this September after the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch, with refreshed units now available in 32GB and 128GB capacities. Also, these prices do not factor in taxes that vary from state to state in the US. Stocks will tend to fluctuate depending upon how many returned iPhones Apple is able to salvage.",

      "text": "Data Centers Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon get $2B in data center tax breaks; economic benefit unclear Some 27 states have established incentive programs specifically for data centers, according to a report from Good Jobs First. Here's what that means for local economies. By Alison DeNisco | November 9, 2016, 4:00 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/scanrail \nThe data center industry is booming, and tech giants are increasingly receiving large incentives packages from state and local governments in exchange for building their data centers in the area. But whether these centers create jobs and benefit local economies remains in question, according to a recent report from national policy resource center Good Jobs First. \nGoogle, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon alone have been awarded more than $2 billion in subsidies combined, according to the report \"Money Lost to the Cloud: How Data Centers Benefit from State and Local Government Subsidies.\" While the number of construction jobs generated for each facility is comparable to building a factory or distribution center, an operating data center creates an average of just 30 to 50 permanent jobs, the report stated. For larger facilities, that number rises to up to 200 jobs. \n\"The question is, how many long-term jobs are being created, and how many are accessible to people from the region? Do people from the region have skills to apply for them?\" said Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst at Good Jobs First and the author of the report. \nSEE: Why data centers fail to bring new jobs to small towns \nThe US is home to 44% of the world's data centers, leading every other country, the report found. And 27 states have established incentive programs specifically meant to draw data centers in, the report found. \n\"The incentive packages can be quite outlandish—far exceeding any reasonable economic justification,\" Todd L. Cherry, director of the Center for Economic Research and Policy Analysis at Appalachian State University, told TechRepublic for another story on data centers and job creation . \"This is a form of what we call 'the winner's curse.' When governments engage in a competitive bidding process over an uncertain benefit, the one that wins is the one that overestimates the benefit.\" Tax breaks and transparency \nThe most important factors for companies considering creating a data center are a stable climate, and access to inexpensive energy, Tarczynska said. That means any area of the country prone to earthquakes, tornadoes, or hurricanes is out, and many rural areas are in. \nElectric power is the largest operating expense for data centers, reported at 70% to 80% of the operating budget, the report stated. Increasingly, companies including Facebook under pressure from environmental groups are looking to access renewable energy for their data centers, Tarczynska said. \nA large data center can cost up to $1 billion to build, the report found. That cost might include land acquisition, facility construction, infrastructure upgrades such as utility hookups, and servers and other equipment. Purchase of mechanical equipment such as computers and cooling rooms, and power equipment such as generators and transformers, are the biggest initial costs. Construction can average $1,000 to $2,000 per square foot, the report found. Data Center Must-Reads Ebook: IT leader’s guide to making DevOps work \nTherefore, the amount of property and other taxes the company pays could be very large. The problem is many of those taxes are being abated, Tarczynska said. \nCompanies might chose two locations in different states, and have each government bid against each other. For example, in September, Facebook engaged in a bidding process between New Mexico and Utah for the opportunity to host its new data center. The New Mexico town of Los Lunas agreed to give up property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments from Facebook starting at $50,000 and going as high as $500,000. In June, the town approved an ordinance allowing for the issuance of up to $30 billion in industrial revenue bonds in efforts to draw the company's business. \n\"These facilities receive a huge amount of tax breaks from state and local governments,\" Tarczynska said. \"There are public costs to those facilities.\" \nOnly 15 states provide easily available online reporting of costs for data center-specific programs, the report found. Many states do not consider these to be economic development incentive programs, but rather something written into the tax code, which invokes various confidentiality laws, Tarczynska said. \nBut that will soon change: A new Governmental Accounting Standards Board rule will require states, cities, counties and school districts to release fiscal reports on tax incentives, starting in 2017. New York City released its findings early: The city lost $3 billion in 2016 to corporate tax breaks for housing and economic development projects. \n\"It's quite a big development, and will help the public and researchers understand what is going on when it comes to tax breaks,\" Tarczynska said. The growth of \"megadeals\" \nThe report also examined 11 \"megadeals,\" or economic development incentives of more than $15 million, that states and local governments offered to tech companies. \nThe average cost of one job in those deals was $2 million in tax breaks. \"This is a huge amount of money being paid for the creation of each individual job,\" Tarczynska said. \"It's important to think about the opportunity cost—what else could be done with that money?\" \nHowever, Mehdi Paryavi, chairman of the International Data Center Authority (IDCA), argues that it's incorrect to compare the size of the data center to the number of jobs created. These data centers are similar to farms, in that they take up a lot of square footage, but don't require hundreds of employees. Benefits of data centers \nTech companies building data centers in rural areas purchase land and develop it, and employ both contract and long term employees—a benefit for those areas, said Paryavi said. \n\"When the Apples and Googles step into a troubled economy, the only thing they can do is help it,\" Paryavi said. \"These guys are coming in and investing millions of dollars. Trusting that your county and state has legislation that protects that investment, why not have their business? It's revenue you didn't have before.\" \nThough the quantity of people working at data centers is less than at a factory, the quality of the positions and work is much higher, Paryavi said. There are also a number of jobs created indirectly, such as those for architects, for the companies that manufacture cooling supplies, and those that maintain generators and replace batteries. \"Those companies are all prospering because of new investments these companies are making with their data centers,\" Paryavi said. \nInternational competition is also a large reason why states should encourage data center development, Paryavi said. \"We have already lost all of our manufacturing to abroad, because incentives outside our borders were better than incentives within the borders,\" Paryavi said. \"Do we want to give away or data center business as well, or provide the right incentives so the Apples and Facebooks will be loyal and have long term plans with us?\" \nThe average lifespan of a data center is 10 years, Paryavi said. \nOne thing is certain: It's unlikely that we'll see data center construction stop any time soon. \"It's an industry in a growing mode—data centers are necessary facilities for companies to operate,\" Tarczynska said. \"There are going to be more and more of them as the need for providing backup on data grows.\" The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Some 27 states have established incentive programs specifically meant to lure data centers, according to a recent report from Good Jobs First. While tech giants Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon alone have been awarded more than $2 billion in subsidies for data centers, each facility creates under 200 jobs on average, the report found. Data center proponents argue that the jobs created are high quality and high salary, and that tax breaks for these facilities help keep these jobs in the US.

      "text": "print \nAP \nThe European Commission ordered Apple to pay the Irish government €13 billion (£11.5 billion) in back taxes in August. \nBut there's one small problem. The Irish government does not want the money. \nIrish finance minister Michael Noonan submitted an appeal to the European courts on Wednesday in a bid to block the decision, The Register reports . \n\"The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis,\" Noonan reportedly said during a speech he gave to the EU's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on Tuesday. \"The decision left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow.\" \nApple employs more than 5,000 people in Ireland and the Irish government is keen to keep the Californian tech giant on side. \nMargrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, ruled in August that Apple had received €13 billion in \"illegal state aid\" from the Irish government. At the time, she said: \"Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies — this is illegal under EU state aid rules. \n\"The commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.\" \nThe European Commission started to look into Apple's Irish tax rate in 2014, so the decision was the culmination of a three-year investigation. \nAn Apple representative said at the time: \"The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple's history in Europe, ignore Ireland's tax laws, and upend the international tax system in the process. The commission's case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes — it's about which government collects the money. It will have a profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe. \n\"Apple follows the law and pays all of the taxes we owe wherever we operate. We will appeal, and we are confident the decision will be overturned.\"",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe Irish government is today formally appealing against a European Union ruling that it should have claimed an additional €13B in tax from Apple, which has its European headquarters in the country. The EU ruled that offering Apple a sweetheart tax rate of just 2.5% amounted to illegal state aid. \nApple wasted no time in announcing that it would appeal the judgement soon after it was made, but the Irish government understandably took a little longer to announce that it, too, would be appealing. Deciding that it didn’t actually want an additional €13B in tax revenue would not have been the easiest of decisions, but it concluded that keeping Apple happy and retaining its status as home to the company’s European sales was of greater value. \nThe Register reports that finance minister Michael Noonan said yesterday that the government would be submitting its appeal today. The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis, and the decision left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted [today]. \nIt’s not yet known how long it may take for the case to be heard. Whatever the outcome, it now looks unlikely that Apple will be able to continue its practice of funneling all profits from European sales through Ireland, rather than paying tax in the countries in which sales were made. \nThe issue has generated strong views on both sides of the Atlantic, with a marked divide between U.S. and European views. \nPhoto: Tithe an Rialtais, home to the Irish Finance Ministry in Dublin ( Wikipedia ) Guides",

      "text": "Reddit \nJust a day after Apple started selling refurbished iPhones for the first time, the company has now added the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to its refurbished items in the online store. \nPrices range from $509 for a 32GB Wi-Fi only model (a saving of $90) to $789 for the 256GB Wi-Fi + Cellular version (saving $140). This is in line with the 15% saving typically offered on refurbished products. As always, what you get is identical to a brand new item, including standard warranty and accessories, but in a plain white box rather than retail packaging. \nIf you were hoping to take advantage of the offer, however, you may need to be patient. At the time of writing, all combinations were showing as out of stock. If you’re in the market for one, you may need to keep checking the site or keep an eye on 9to5Toys . Guides",

      "text": "At this time of year, the quench for Apple products is realer than ever. We've recently seen the company unveil the iPhone 7, the Apple Watch Series 2 and a fresh range of MacBook Pros, meaning you've been avoiding buying food and paying household bills in order to save up. It doesn't have to be that way, though, with the Cupertino giant unveiling a new way for you to pick up an iPhone on the cheap. Okay, so you're not going to be able to pick up the newest models, but finding a temporary solution to your smartphone woe isn't the worst idea once you consider the fact Apple is expected to overhaul the iPhone in just under a year. Related: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S - is it worth upgrading and which is best for me? Any more catches in this seemingly ultra-awesome deal? Well, depending on how you feel about refurbished phones, there's also that to consider. Once you realise the official online store is offering both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus at a discounted rate in a range of colours and capacities, though, we're sure you'll forget all about that. If you want to get in on the ground floor with a 16GB iPhone 6S, you'll be handing over $449 to the folks at Apple — with the Plus entry-level costing $529. When you factor in the standard costs (iPhone 6s, $549; iPhone 6s Plus $649), and the fact the devices will be unlocked and feature a one-year limited warranty, you'll be hard pressed to find a better deal. Of course, the added piece of legitimacy here is that the refurbished products are coming directly from Apple. The devices are all tested, certified, and offer a new battery and outer casing to avoid any internal or external issues. Unfortunately, this second-hand fun doesn't appear to be available for those in the UK just yet. With Apple still offering refurbished jobs on Macs and iPads, though, it should only be a matter of time before the iPhone is added to the list of products you can snaffle on the cheap. ",

      "text": "Apple's MacBook Pro launch in October inspired more criticism than any Mac event in recent history. The new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros, while thinner and more powerful than ever before and equipped with the brand new Touch Bar, are significantly more expensive than the older models. They also don't come with a 32GB option . And all connectors have been replaced with USB-C ports, plunging users into dongle hell , which Apple quickly tried to remedy by reducing the prices of its dongles and accessories.\nDespite all that, it appears that the new MacBook Pro is selling very well, and has already outsold all of its Windows-based competitors by a large margin.\nSEE ALSO: Apple thinks you'll eventually love its MacBook Pro\nAccording to a new report by Slice Intelligence , via Cnet , the sales of the new MacBook Pro in the first five days surpassed the sales of key competitors such as Microsoft's Surface Book, Dell XPS 13 and 15, Lenovo Yoga and Asus Chromebook Flip even though all these devices have been on the market for over a year.\nImage: Slice Intelligence\nThe MacBook Pro sales have also approached the sales of Apple's own MacBook, which has been available since April 2015.\nThis is in line with a recent statement by Apple's Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, who told Independent that Apple's \"online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before.\"\nSlice gathers its data by looking at \"hundreds of millions\" of e-receipts from more than 4.4 million online shoppers. This latest report focuses on sales and not units sold, which might skew numbers in Apple's favor because the company's laptops, on average, are more expensive than Windows-based equivalents. Furthermore, given the long wait for a major MacBook Pro update, heightened interest is unsurprising.\nEven so, the numbers are impressive; if accurate, they show that Apple's MacBook Pro basically swept the floor with all of its major competitors combined in less than a week.",

      "text": "More from Ben Kuzma Published on: November 8, 2016 | Last Updated: November 8, 2016 2:19 PM PST \nNew York Rangers' Michael Grabner, front, celebrates his third goal of the night with teammates during the third period of the NHL hockey game against Tampa Bay Lightning, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016, in New York. The Rangers defeated the Lightning 6-1. Seth Wenig / AP Share Adjust Comment Print \nNEW YORK CITY — Michael Grabner laughed when asked to recall the infamous hallway incident when Rogers Arena was known as General Motors Place. \nIt’s funny now because the New York Rangers winger has reason to smile after having his checkered career rejuvenated with the National Hockey League’s version of the Harlem Globetrotters. \nGrabner was leading the club with seven goals and playing on a red-hot line with Kevin Hayes and J.T. Miller that exploded for 23 points in a five-game win streak before facing the struggling Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. \nHowever, seven years ago in Vancouver, the speedy winger was making different headlines. \nIn a traditional pre-game soccer warm-up, the Austrian flash fractured his ankle on Nov. 1, 2009. He had been recalled the previous month to replace the injured Daniel Sedin and a week later, scored his first NHL goal. \nHe would spend most of that season with the American Hockey League affiliate Manitoba Moose, but if anything, he has proved to be a survivor. \nMichael Grabner of the New York Rangers competes against the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 6, 2016 in New York. (Bruce Bennett photo/Getty Images) \nFrom the Canucks to the Florida Panthers, New York Islanders, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Rangers, there has always been a place in the game for a forward who skates as well as he does and who also has a quick and deceptive release. The Canucks were teased of all that before Alain Vigneault discovered that fateful 2009 night that the kid wouldn’t be playing for a long time. \n“I still play soccer to warm up,” chuckled the 29-year-old Grabner. “I haven’t had anything (injury) since then. That was a bad night. I was playing pretty good at the time and then you break your ankle and I was out for a month-and-a-half. It was unfortunate.” \nIt has been far from a straight-line career ascension. \nGrabber scored a hat trick with the Canucks on April 2, 2010 and added a playoff goal, but wasn’t projected as a future top-six fix. He was traded to the Panthers on June 22, 2010 — along with Steve Bernier and a first-round pick for Keith Ballard and Victor Oreskovich — and then claimed off waivers by the Islanders on Oct. 5, 2010 after a poor training camp and pointless pre-season. \nAfter five seasons with the Islanders, Grabner was traded to the Leafs and had but nine goals in 80 games. To say he’s in the right place at the right time — and with the right coach — is a massive understatement. You see it in his body language and hear it in his confident tone. \n“It’s sometimes how the career goes and sometimes it’s a different path,” he reasoned. “When I signed here (two years, $3.3 million US), I knew how they were playing would benefit my style — a fast-paced game. It’s been perfect from training camp to right now and it helped knowing Vigneault and Arnie (Rangers assistant Scott Arniel) from my days with the Moose. \n“Coming here has been everything I could have dreamed of. Even my billet from junior (Spokane) is from here and is pretty excited. I live outside the city for the schools, but we ride the train in and then take the subway, so I get the whole New York experience.” \nWhat has also kept the 6-1, 187-pound Grabner in the game is how he trains in the off-season. He does a lot of lower-body work — dead lifts, squats, spin bikes — to maintain his explosiveness and has been called a mad scientist for his willingness to try anything that is going to prolong his career. A break from the ice doesn’t hurt either. \n“It definitely takes a lot to keep it up and I do a lot of core work and different speed exercises away from the ice,” added Grabner. “We’ll see how long I can keep it up, but so far it has been working. It’s going to go downhill eventually.” \nBut not now. \nGrabner’s line has clicked from the outset and that nervous acclimation period to a new club never really happened. And when the goals started coming up and down the roster, it brought a sense of calm and lessened the pressure for the 14th overall pick in the 2006 draft to perform instantly. \n“The scoring has been spread out and it’s pretty hard for other teams to defend us,” said Grabner. “With our line, everybody brings something, and everything seems to be going in and it makes such a difference when you have that confidence. You just go out and play.” \nVigneault wasn’t sure what he was going to get when he put the trio together. \n“There’s no doubt that you’ve got a lot of speed with Grabs,” he said. “You’ve got a guy that likes to make plays like Haysey. And you’ve got a guy that loves to pursue the puck, protect the puck, hang onto it, come out of the corners, and J.T. goes to the tough areas. \n“Really, I put those guys together because one game we were short-handed as far as personnel. Didn’t think this is what I was going to get. Sometimes things work out.” ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan New MacBook Pro sales are surging After only five days of sales, it seems that Apple's new MacBook Pro has wiped the floor with the competition. | Topic: Hardware \nLike it or not, it seems that Apple's new MacBook Pro is pulling in stacks of cash. See also : Five reasons why Apple's new MacBook Pro makes me want to switch back to Windows \nAccording to data collected by e-commerce tracking firm Slice Intelligence and reported by CNET , MacBook Pro revenue for its first five days has hit 78 percent of all the revenue generated by the MacBook 12-inch since it became available in April 2015, and has accumulated more revenue than any other laptop this year. \nThis means that it's already wiped the floor with laptops such as Microsoft's Surface Book, ASUS's Chromebook Flip, and Lenovo's Yoga 900. Slice Intelligence \nSlice Intelligence also discovered that 40 percent of Apple laptop owners who purchased a MacBook in 2014 went on to buy their next laptop with another maker, with Dell and Asus being the most popular choice. Slice Intelligence \nTo get any real idea of how the new MacBook Pro has shifted the Mac sales and revenue needles, we are going to have to wait for Apple's next earnings report in January 2017.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe tax debate between Apple, Ireland, and the European Union may escalate in the next few months. According to recent reports, the Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years-long court battle. \nThe battle stems from a European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. \nMore: Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant \nAfter a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. That is the largest state-aid payback demand in history. \nThe decision has been the subject of criticism, particularly from this side of the Atlantic. The U.S. Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.” \nApple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision, and those appeals will follow the ones already pending in Luxembourg, where the EU is headquartered. Those pending appeals include cases against Starbucks. \nOf course, Apple and Ireland will face tough competition in the European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, arguing that the decision is not one against the U.S., but rather against unfair business practices. \nThe issues stem from the fact that Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe second beta of iOS 10.2 has been pushed to developers, bringing a number of changes to the operating system, which will ultimately be pushed to consumers. \nPerhaps the biggest change to iOS is the fact that it now has the TV app that was shown off during Apple’s October 27 event. The app allows users to view content from a range of other streaming accounts, although Netflix will not be among the list of providers at launch, according to reports from Recode . \nMore: Facebook gradually moving into TV advertising with Apple TV and Roku TV ads \nApart from the TV app, the new iOS 10.2 beta comes with a few design tweaks in Apple Music, and some new SOS features. \nWhen it comes to the SOS features, users will now be able to press the power button five times to automatically dial an emergency number. The feature works in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. You can manage the settings for the new SOS feature by heading to the Settings app and scrolling to the General section. \nThe Music app has also gotten a few design tweaks to make using it a little easier. For example, the Shuffle and Repeat buttons have both been made a little more prominent, and you can simply swipe up to access those larger buttons. \nApart from the TV app and the new Music app, there are a few new emojis and a few redesigned emojis, as well as a new selection of wallpapers. You’ll also get the option to save the camera settings, plus support for a single sign-on, which lets users with a subscription to a cable service sign in only once to access multiple apps.

      "text": "Republican Donald Trump is now the president-elect in what's being called the \"biggest upset\" in American political history.\nSilicon Valley figures are already freaking out , but there's one company specifically that soon might find itself in President Trump's crosshairs.\nApple, the world's most valuable company by market cap, was mentioned specifically by Trump several times during his campaign. And Apple CEO Tim Cook actively campaigned for Hillary Clinton , hosting a fundraiser earlier this year and apparently holding a private meeting with the campaign chairman, John Podesta, in 2015. \nInstitutions around the world are holding emergency meetings to discuss what the ramifications of a Trump presidency are. Here's what Cook and his executive team are likely discussing this morning: \nTax repatriation AP Tax is a critical issue for Apple, and tax reform is the number one issue the company lobbies for in Washington.\nIt's here that Trump's stated policies might end up working out in Apple's favor. Apple has about $200 billion in cash and marketable securities stashed overseas, and currently, it would have to pay 35% in American taxes to bring it back to the United States.\nTrump has proposed slashing the tax rate on income held overseas to 10%, most notably during a speech at the Economic Club of New York in September. \n\" This wealth that’s parked overseas, nobody knows how much it is, some say it’s $2.5 trillion, I have people that think it’s five trillion dollars. We’ll bring it back, and it’ll be taxed only at the rate of 10% instead of 35%. And who would bring it back at 35%? Obviously nobody, because nobody’s doing it,\" Trump said.  Tweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/768609363086815232\npic.twitter.com/hrCAaTz96Y \n\"The largest beneficiaries of the move would be the big American technology groups,\" the Financial Times reported on Wednesday .  \n\"Honestly, I believe the legislature and the administration will agree that it’s in the best interest of the country and the economy to have tax reform,\" Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year . \"And when we bring it back, we will pay 35 percent federal tax and then a weighted average across the states that we’re in, which is about 5 percent, so think of it as 40 percent. We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate.\"  \nMoodys says that US companies outside the financial sector hold $1.2 trillion overseas. Apple is the largest hoarder. \nThere is also the possibility that a Trump administration might retaliate against the European Commission, which is alleged to be targeting US businesses to collect taxes. \nThe European Commission ordered Apple to pay at least $14.5 billion in taxes to Ireland earlier this year. The decision is currently being appealed by Ireland. \nAmerican manufacturing AP Throughout Trump's campaign, Trump has repeatedly called for Apple to build its iPhones in the United States. Currently, iPhones are assembled in China from mostly Asian parts.  \n\" I'm going to bring jobs back. I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,\" Trump said in March.  \"How does it help us when they make it in China?\" \nHe continued talking about moving iPhone production to the US throughout his campaign.  \nHowever, Trump is not the only president or president-elect to challenge Apple to produce a made-in-USA iPhone.  President Barack Obama asked former Apple CEO Steve Jobs about the topic in 2011. \nTurns out, it's unlikely for a variety of reasons :  \nLogistical challenges because many of Apple's parts makers are in Asia. A lack of manufacturing skills in the US.  Significantly lower overall costs in China. Some estimates find that American assembly could add over $50 to the cost of making an iPhone, which would make the device significantly less competitive in the global market.  Still, there are ways Trump could incentivize Apple to build phones in the US. He's called for a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, which would reshape the American economy in unprecedented ways.  \nEncryption and backdoors  AP Trump has called for a boycott of all Apple products over the company's stance on encryption and backdoors that became a hot-button issue earlier this year when the FBI asked the company to break into a dead terrorist's iPhone in San Bernardino, California.\n\"Apple ought to give the security for that phone, OK?\" Trump said at a rally in February . \"What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such time as they give that security number. How do you like that? I just thought of it. Boycott Apple!\" \n\" I use both iPhone & Samsung. If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info,\" Trump tweeted earlier this year. ( Trump has been paid to speak at Samsung corporate events.)\nAlthough the issue over the San Bernardino iPhone has been resolved , and Apple was not forced to create a \"backdoor\" to crack passcodes on the iPhone, encryption remains a hot-button topic and the issue could come up again when law enforcement finds an iPhone it cannot read the data on.\nIt's also worth noting that James Comey, the director of the FBI, was the person who led the bureau's battle against Apple, was also the same person who made a surprise announcement 11 days before the election that new possible Hillary Clinton emails had surfaced.\nAlthough Comey and the FBI are nominally non-partisan, the Obama administration believes that his actions may have helped Trump win the presidency, and he is likely to continue serving his 10-year term under a Trump administration.\nIt wouldn't be surprising if Trump gives Comey permission and encouragement to bring the encryption fight back to Apple and the FBI could once again seek a way to break through the iPhone's security.\nNOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home \n",

      "text": "Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo \nI often recommend folks check out Apple’s refurbished section when they’re in the market for a new laptop. It’s a great place to find low prices on products that are covered under a new warranty. Now Apple is selling refurbished iPhones, too. \nThere’s a small catch, at least if you’re used to carrier subsidies: you’ll need to pay the full cost. This is going to make the phone seem expensive on the surface since you’re buying it outright instead of paying off the total cost over 24 months, but there are some good deals to be had. A refurbished 16GB iPhone 6s will set you back $449, a savings of $80. The iPhone 6s Plus is $529. A solid deal for unlocked Apple devices \nThose are pretty significant deals and great options for folks who don’t want to pay the full price of a phone or who need an unlocked device for travel. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are not yet available refurbished. \nApple has a whole selection of refurbished phones available with ranging capacities and colors. I highly recommend buying refurbished if you don’t care about a gently used product. Apple adds 1-year of warranty and still lets you buy additional AppleCare. Hit the source if you’re curious.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nNasdaq futures were down almost 97 points before 9 am, Eastern, or 2%, at 4,705, though that drop has narrowed to 70 points following the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States.\nMajor techs are among decliners in early trading, including Apple ( AAPL ) down 65 cents, or 0.6%, at $110.41, Facebook ( FB ) down $2.14, or 1.8%, at $122.08, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) down $1.19, or 5%, at $22.05.\nWeighing in with some post-election advice this morning is Mizuho ’s Abhey Lamba , who advises buying “good quality names with valuation support,” such as Salesforce ( CRM ), ServiceNow ( NOW ), Red Hat ( RHT ), Apple and Commvault ( CVLT ). Lamba is cautious about companies with what he calls “model transitions,” such as Splunk ( SPLK ), Tableau Software ( DATA ), and Teradata ( TDC ).\nShares of Splunk and Tableau are down 2%, and 3%, respectively, while Teradata stock is unchanged.\nAnother point of view is offered by Citigroup ’s Walter Pritchard , who thinks that stocks will “focus on the likelihood of one-time repatriation of overseas cash,” and that “some of the mid and large cap companies that have large cash balances trapped’ offshore are likely to benefit from being able to return a portion of this cash to shareholders,” including Autodesk ( ADSK ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Oracle ( ORCL ).\nBack on planet Earth, Shares of GoPro ( GPRO ) are down 96 cents, or almost 9%, at $9.90, after the company announced last night , during the thick of U.S. Presidential election tallies, that it is recalling all 2,500 of the “Karma” drones that it has shipped, and issuing refunds, citing the possibility of the units losing power “during operation.” The company says no injuries or property damage have been reported thus far.\nCEO Nicholas Woodman said “we are working in close coordination with both the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Aviation Administration” and that “we are very sorry to have inconvenienced our customers and we are taking every step to make the return and refund process as easy as possible.”\nThe problem with the drone, and with the company’s new camera, first arose during a disappointing Q3 report by GoPro last Thursday.\nThe stock has gotten at multiple downgrades this morning. Raymond James ’s Tavis McCourt, cutting the stock to Market Perform from Outperform, writing “we are concerned about the company’s brand image following a 12- to 18-month period filled with produce management missteps.”",

The gap is even wider on other popular computers, including the Asus Chromebook and Dell Inspiron computers. Only Apple’s 12-inch MacBook has been able to top the MacBook Pro’s sales. However, Slice Intelligence noted that Apple’s latest notebook has already generated 78% of the revenue the 12-inch MacBook has generated since April 10, 2015.\nThe Slice Intelligence data comes from its analysis of more than 4.4 million online shoppers.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nApple AAPL unveiled its new MacBook Pro late last month. The computer comes in 13- and 15-inch form factors and runs on Apple’s macOS Sierra operating system. While it comes with several enhancements under the hood, including better processing power, arguably its most important feature is its Touch Bar. That feature, which sits above the device’s keyboard, is a multitouch glass strip that lets users interact with the on-screen software with their fingers. It’s Apple’s answer to Windows-based computers featuring touchscreens--a feature customers won’t find on the MacBook Pro.\nSeveral signs of late have indicated MacBook Pro sales were strong. Last week, for instance, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said the MacBook Pro has secured more sales through the Apple online retail store than any other professional-focused notebook it’s ever released. Earlier this week, a report from Apple’s supply chain surfaced, saying the company is ramping up orders to satisfy strong demand for its notebook .\nApple hasn’t shared exact sales figures on its MacBook Pro.\nFor more about Apple MacBook Pro, watch: \nIn addition to sharing sales data, Slice Intelligence said in a statement that the MacBook Pro is also helping Apple get back some of its former customers who had turned to other brands like Dell and Asus. The research firm added some customers had turned away from Apple in the last couple of years to try out touchscreen-based computers in the Windows world. Now, they’re coming back to Apple.\nApple’s MacBook Pro will begin shipping soon to those who ordered the computer last month. Those who order it now from Apple’s online store will need to wait four to five weeks for the computer to ship to their homes or offices.",

      "text": "  09:19 AM EST Apple, Salesforce, Offshore Cash in Focus on Trump 2016 Election Win Here are some things going on today in your world of tech : Nasdaq futures are down almost 97 points, or 2%, at 4,705, following the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. Major techs are among decliners in early trading, including Apple ( AAPL ) down 65 cents, or 0.6%, at $110.41, Facebook ( FB ) down $2.14, or 1.8%, at $122.08, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) down $1.19, or 5%, at $22.05. Weighing in with some post-election advice this morning is Mizuho’s Abhey Lamba, who advises buying “good quality names with valuation support,” such as Salesforce ( CRM ), ServiceNow ( NOW ), Red Hat ( RHT ), Apple and Commvault ( CVLT ). Lamba is cautious about companies with what he calls \"model transitions,” such as Splunk ( SPLK ), Tableau Software ( DATA ), and Teradata ( TDC ). Shares of Splunk and Tableau are down 2%, and 3%, respectively, while Teradata stock is unchanged.",

Wolfe November 9, 2016 \nJust weeks after going live, Apple Pay is already one of the most popular payment platforms via the web, according to SimilarTech . \nFirst introduced in October, Apple Pay on the web is already the fifth most popular payment platform for the top 10,000 websites. It’s currently available on 0.25 percent of those websites. This number is around 10 percent of market leader Paypal, which is on 2.36 percent of the top websites. Apple Pay also trails Paypal’s subscribe button (0.98 percent), Stripe (0.35 percent), and Braintree (0.32 percent). Already, Apple Pay is more popular than Google Checkout and Amazon Payments for the top 10,000 websites. To date, Apple Pay for web is only available on 1,035 websites, which makes its quick rise even more remarkable. Paypal and the Paypal subscribe button are available on 1.83 million websites, compared to 45,000 for Braintree, 38,000 for Stripe, and 13,400 for Google Checkout. Apple is also the fifth most popular payment technology for the top 100,000 websites. A remarkable, quick rise, no? \nSee also:",

      "title": "Apple Finally Starts Selling Refurbished iPhones",
      "text": "Flip It! \nApple released the iPhone 7 in September and is now officially selling refurbished versions of its previous flagships. Now the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus can be bought at a 15% lower price than the original by opting for refurbished models. The 16GB iPhone 6s is now priced at $449, the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus is at $529 and the 64GB iPhone 6s Plus is at $589, notes Techtimes. Image Source: iphonedigital/flickr.com Devices to come with new battery and warranty \nAll the phones will be unlocked, SIM-free models and will come with a one-year warranty. Three color options will be available: silver, rose gold and space gray. Apple says that though the units are refurbished, all of them will ship with a new battery and outer shell. \nIn the past, the company has sold refurbished versions of almost all its products — iPods, Macs, MacBooks, iPads, and even the Apple TV. But for the first time since 2007, it is putting refurbished variants of its smartphones up for sale, notes Techtimes. Why such a decision? \nSelling refurbished iPhones is an odd move for Apple as it has only done this once before in 2007. The company generates the most revenue and profits from the sale of the iPhone, and probably for this reason, it always offered the lineup at its full price so that customers are not directed towards buying inexpensive iPhone models. \nSo why Apple is suddenly selling refurbished iPhones is up for speculation. It seems Apple made this decision to clear out inventory at a faster pace, as it was disappointed with the measly sales figures of the 6s lineup, notes Techtimes. Such a move could also attract users who might not be able to afford an iPhone 7 due to its steep price and hence might be lured to buy Android handsets. Best to stick with Apple \nThere could be some customers who might find these sale prices also a bit steep. If so, they can opt for used iPhone models from third-party retailers, which have an exhaustive supply. But these phones come with a considerably greater risk of them being bogus and faulty units that could be defective. \nThe refurbished phones that Best Buy offers come with a 12-month limited warranty. But what exactly the warranty covers and how someone can get the device serviced are not clear. Gazelle only offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, says Gizmodo. Hence, the best thing to do is stick to Apple for refurbushed iPhones.",

      "title": "Apple Watch 3 release date, rumours, price, features, design and everything you need to know",
      "text": "Smartwatches have been around for a couple of years now. Yes, you were right to be wary on day one, but things have come a long way since then, and they've quickly transformed into the latest must-have luxury. Next on this hit-list of desirable wearable tech will be the Apple Watch 3, with the eagerly awaited smartwatch set to build on the existing Apple Watch Series 2 with all manner of new features and functions. So, what can you expect when the Apple Watch 3 release date rolls round? Well, despite still being the better part of a year away, the rumour mill has been churning and plenty has already been tipped for the third-generation wearable. From a radical redesign to an integrated camera, here's everything you need to know about the Apple Watch 3. Apple Watch 3 release date: You've got quite the wait ahead Related: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6S Holding out for the Apple Watch 3 release date? Well, you better make sure you're comfortable, because you've got one heck of a wait ahead. Given that the Apple Watch 2 only went on sale back in September, chances are the next-generation model won't touch down until that time next year. No, Apple hasn't yet confirmed its official plans, and yes, the original Apple Watch fell earlier in the year, but that happened with iPhones and iPads too. We now appear to be in an annual Apple Watch update cycle, and it makes sense for the smartwatch to drop alongside the new iPhone in September 2017. After all, without an accompanying iPhone, the Apple Watch is pretty much just a nice paperweight. Although this far out from launch it's a bit tricky to say exactly when the third-gen wearable will appear from under Cupertino's shroud of mystery, right now, we'd tentatively pencil September 2017 into your diary. It won't be the star of the show though. In what's expected to be arguably Apple's biggest product reveal in recent years, the Apple Watch 3 will likely have to share the stage with the eagerly awaited iPhone 8 – a handset that's widely expected to feature a radical redesign (about time) with across-the-board specs improvements. Apple Watch 3 design: Could a circular smartwatch finally be on the way from Apple? Related: Best Apple Watch straps What a square! No, not you, the existing Apple Watch. Despite having only adopted square forms to date, the Apple Watch is already the best looking smartwatch out there. If latest reports are to be believed, however, it could be about to get a whole lot easier on the eye too. Prefer circles to squares? Well then it might be worth holding off for the Apple Watch 3, because its been suggested the upcoming device could start playing nice with soft, flowing edges. It's not like circular smartwatches haven't been done – just look at the LG G Watch R, Huawei Watch and Moto 360 – it's just they've not really been done particularly well, yet. These claims are still shrouded in a fair bit of speculation though (and preceded the Apple Watch 2) so maybe don't go getting your hopes up just yet. While we'd all love to see a round Apple Watch, what's looking more likely is that the big-A will put much of its design efforts into a run of new straps. We're not just talking about additional colour schemes or materials either. A number of patents have emerged, showing Apple is working on a series of smart straps. From bands than can change colour at the touch of a button to those that hide a hidden Mac-friendly charging port, Apple has been working on a number of ideas on how to improve its wearables without tampering with the tech at the core. Perhaps the most exciting of these ideas is the potential addition of strap with a second screen built in. According to approved patents, this additional panel could be used to display additional information such as battery life or app-reactive details that don't fit on the primary screen. As cool as all this sounds, we'd be hugely surprised if any of these improvements arrived in time for a 2017 release. Sorry wannabe Apple Watch 3 owners, but it all sounds just a little too futuristic to drop in the coming months. Expect something pretty damn familiar, if not a little skinnier, then. Apple Watch 3 features: Gesture controls and a camera reportedly inbound Related: Apple Watch tips and tricks What new skills can the Apple Watch 3 add? Well, with integrated GPS and a waterproof body having already made it to the realms of reality aboard the Apple Watch 2, you'd be forgiven for thinking there wasn't much left for the next-gen offering to add. You'd be wrong though. According to a number of leaks and plenty of speculation, the Apple Watch 3 will play host to a mass of new options and abilities. Headline amongst these could be the arrival of an integrated camera. Why the chuff would you ever want a camera attached to your wrist? Well if you've got thoughts of sticking your arm out in order to capture your latest holiday snaps, forget it. The small, user-facing camera will instead reportedly enable contortion-free, voice-activated selfie options and, more importantly, on the fly FaceTiming without the fuss. Like the smart straps, this is something Apple is known to be working on and considering – thanks patents – but is still far from a dead cert for the Apple Watch 3. It's not the only new feature on the list of possibilities, either. Elsewhere, Apple is working on gesture-based controls that would let you use your Apple Watch without even touching it. Using the timepiece's integrated sensors, the Apple Watch 3 could let you control certain features just by moving your wrist or hand in a certain way. Exact examples are currently unclear, but if that camera does make an appearance, we can see gestures such as the opening and closing of a first being used to capture snaps. That's now where the new feature list will end either. New technology could also be added to the underside-mounted heart rate tracker, with Apple known to be working on improvements to the health-monitoring sensor, and the screen has been tipped for a boost. Yes, the Apple Watch 2's screen was brighter than the original model's, but no sharper. Although image quality isn't a big deal on such a small panel, it's possible the Apple Watch 3 could sharpen things up slightly, especially if that coveted round panel becomes a reality. Apple Watch 3 software: Get ready for the arrival of watchOS 4 Related: 9 watchOS 3 features to get excited about As well as offering hardware improvements, expect to see the Apple Watch 3 bring new software skills to the table. Again, Apple patents have offered an early insight on what's to come, with a new input method potentially on the cards for the wearable. Making the device's expansive menu options easier to navigate, long lists could be subbed out for 3D content cubes. Confused, don't be, essentially a list in 3D form, these would offer more visual delights when trying to tailor your watch to your wants and needs. They would also be controlled by the Digital Crown, meaning you can keep the screen finger-free for easier viewing. Just one of a number of software updates expected to be handed to the Apple Watch 3, you can expect to hear plenty more about Apple's watchOS 4 updates well before the new devices drops too. The company's annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June will likely see the software showcased before an autumn rollout to new and existing devices. Apple Watch 3 price: Get saving those pennies It's a good job that there's still many months separating you and the Apple Watch 3 release date. Why? Well it gives you plenty of time to get saving. No, the Apple Watch isn't Apple's most expensive device on the Cupertino company's roster, but with prices currently starting at £369 for the 38mm and £399 for the 42mm Apple Watch 2 with a Sport Band strap, its far from an affordable accessory either. Although we wouldn't expect Apple to hike the price too much, the addition of a round face would surely see the asking fee increase. What's more, given the recent dip in the pound (once again, thanks Brexit), there's a good chance the Apple Watch 3 will line up more expensive than its predecessors. Exactly how things will pan out is still far from certain. If you're after the Apple Watch 3 though, we'd get saving now. Stay tuned for all the latest Apple Watch 3 rumours and leaks. This page will be updated with the latest details as new things emerge.",

The Company Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Austin, Texas, Cirrus Logic ( CRUS - Free Report ) is a supplier of high-precision analog and digital signal processing components for a variety of audio, energy and industrial applications. They have ~1,380 employees and ~3,200 customers worldwide. Majority of their products are sold through direct sales channels. The company has a strong intellectual property portfolio with 2,400 patents issued and pending. Cirrus Logic is the only supplier of a complete audio IC solution from capture to playback. Their audio chips are used in the leading smartphone brands, tablets, digital headsets, wearables and many emerging smart home applications. Apple is CRUS’s largest customer, accounting for ~78% of the revenue in the reported quarter though the company develops solutions for many industry leading global brands. Jack-less iPhone a Boon for Cirrus Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack has been great for this company. Their content in each iPhone 7 unit has gone up substantially because their chips are used in new lightning EarPods and adapter. This is a huge opportunity for Cirrus because Apple sells about 45 million units in a quarter and is expected to sell 70 million in the holiday quarter. Many other smartphone makers are also making the switch from tradition headphones to digital headphones, following’s Apple’s lead. Excellent Earnings and Upbeat Guidance The chipmaker reported its Q2 fiscal 2017 results on October 27. Revenue of $428.6 million came in above the high end of their guidance thanks to better-than-expected demand for some portable audio products. Adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share were substantially above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 per share. “We are extremely pleased with our progress in the September quarter as we began volume shipments of our new digital headset solution, expanded our share with boosted amplifiers and ramped production in a mid-tier smartphone at another leading customer”, said the CEO. They also raised their guidance for the current year after solid results. Revenue is expected to range between $475 million and $515 million while GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 47 and 49% Estimates Soaring After the big beat and upgraded guidance, analysts have raised their estimates for the company. Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and next fiscal year have soared to $3.73 per share and $4.41 per share respectively, up from $2.83 and $3.35, before the results. Rising estimates sent the stock back to Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has an excellent record of beating as can be seen from the following “Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart”: The Bottom Line Audio/video features continue to grow in complexity and differentiation value. While they continue to expand in high-end devices, they have now started moving into mid-range devices. These features continue to expand beyond smartphones and tablets, into wearables, accessories, automotive and connected homes. With its leadership position in Analog and Mixed Signal Technology and focus on fast growing markets, Cirrus seems to be well positioned for solid growth in coming quarters. The company is highly dependent on a single customer, so that makes the stock a bit risky but I think it’s worth a look due to growth potential.

      "text": "Ireland to appeal EU’s €13 billion tax ruling against Apple November 9th, 2016 at 4:54 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nThere has been a lot of controversy surrounding Apple and its tax payment strategy in Europe, which involves routeing money through Ireland for lower tax rates. Back in August, the European Commission ended its three-year investigation into the case, concluding that Apple should still owe around 13 billion euros in unpaid back taxes. Tim Cook immediately penned an open letter, expressing confidence in the decision being reversed and now, Ireland is set to appeal the EU’s ruling. \nIreland’s government is set to formally submit its appeal this week against the European Commission’s ruling against Apple, which would force the company to pay out 13 billion euros. \nThe Irish government took Apple’s side early on back when the ruling was first made. Essentially, they are looking to protect the current tax regime, which has attracted plenty of huge companies like Apple over the years. \nWhether or not the appeal will change the European Commission’s mind remains to be seen but it looks like this case will be revisited. \nKitGuru Says: Tim Cook did seem very confident that this ruling would eventually be overturned and now it looks like the first steps are being taken in that direction. Either way, it will be interesting to see if the European Commission sticks to its initial ruling or not once the appeal comes through.",

While the data is likely not entirely accurate, it should serve as reasonably reliable yardstick for Apple’s sales performance. \nBlowing the competition out of the water is nothing out of the ordinary for the Cupertino titan.",

      "text": "| Product News \nApple began offering refurbished iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices on the Apple Store Tuesday, as first reported by 9to5Mac . Refurbished iPhone 6s models start at US$449 with 16GB of storage, while 16GB iPhone 6s Plus models start at $529. 64GB iPhone 6s Plus are currently priced at $589. iPhone 6s Refurb Models on Apple Store Online \nThose prices sort of represent a 15% discount, but comparisons are difficult because new devices are available in 32GB and 128GB capacities. But, for those who can handle 16GB of storage, $449 for an iPhone 6s is a solid deal. Apple Refurbs \nApple has long operated a refurbished stores for Macs, iPods, iPads, and several other products. This is the first time, however, that refurbished iPhones have been available since 2007, according to The Next Web . \nThe way Apple’s refurbished offers work, products are available only while they are in stock.

      "text": "Sprint Wants to Pull Off an Apple   (Evan Niu, CFA) 2 hrs ago Image source: Sprint. \nNo. 4 domestic wireless carrier Sprint (NYSE: S) isn't in particularly good shape right now, although that's been true for at least the better part of a decade (if not more). It seems like the company has been in turnaround mode ever since the spectacular failure that was the Sprint-Nextel merger in 2005. The Softbank deal from 2012 that recapitalized the wireless carrier was promising, bolstering the balance sheet while giving the Japanese parent company a controlling stake and some exposure to the U.S. market. \nBut operationally, Sprint continues to fail in terms of actually winning over customers in a meaningful way. Un-carrier T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) officially overtook Sprint last year as the No. 3 domestic wireless carrier, making good on a promise that T-Mobile CEO John Legere made in 2014. In fact, T-Mobile has only widened its lead ever since taking the No. 3 spot, while Sprint's customer base languishes. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. \nAs part of Softbank's fiscal second-quarter earnings release, Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son made it clear that the Japanese carrier needs to pull off a turnaround at Sprint. In no uncertain terms, he wants Sprint to pull off an Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . \"The most dramatic large-scale turnaround in the U.S. history\" \nOn the earnings call, Son made a hyperbolic vow: \"In a few more years, Sprint will be the most dramatic large-scale turnaround in the U.S. history. They will be marked in the U.S. economic history that this will be a big most dramatic turnaround in a few years.\" \nWhile I'm admittedly a little biased in the Apple department, I think most corporate and business historians would objectively grant that title to Apple. The Mac maker went from being 90 days away from bankruptcy to the most valuable publicly traded company of all time within the span of about 15 years. As far as turnarounds go, I don't think you can top that. \nSon's comments come as Sprint continues to weigh on Softbank's results. The Japanese magnate's original plan was to have Sprint acquire T-Mobile , believing that a combined company would be a greater competitive threat to Big Red and Ma Bell, but that didn't play out the way he had hoped. Those pesky U.S. antitrust regulators always have a way of ruining the mood. Son again: \nFor the past three years, Sprint has been a drag on our consolidated basis and was the biggest reason our debt increased. Originally Sprint and T-Mobile, we were going to acquire both, merge them and have a company that is equal to AT&T and Verizon to have a hit on competition. That was our basic strategy. But because of the rejection by the U.S. government, our basic strategy did not work out. But as a result, we had difficulty, but we made steady effort. \nThe main challenge that Sprint faces is that its service is inherently commoditized, which severely limits its strategic toolbox. In a given metropolitan area where coverage and connectivity are comparable, wireless customers essentially care only about price. T-Mobile has been very innovative in the ways that it competes on price, offering a wide range of added benefits and included perks with its wireless plans, essentially adding value in different ways at existing price points. \nSprint's balance sheet is in particularly bad shape to withstand aggressive price competition. The company has an extremely heavy debt load relative to its cash flows ($36.6 billion in total long-term debt and capital lease obligations), and has resorted to effectively mortgaging spectrum as a way to raise cash. Sprint may continue to tread water for some time, but there's absolutely no way that it's about to pull off an Apple-esque turnaround for the history books. \n10 stocks we like better than Sprint \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Sprint wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7 , 2016 \nEvan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

      "text": "Although Apple CEO Tim Cook hasn’t officially laid out the company’s etched-in-stone plans for virtual reality and augmented reality, he has hinted that the company may lean more towards the latter, as AR keeps users visually connected with others in the same room while VR experiences completely engulf each viewer. Support for these technologies begins at the operating system level, and a recent patent reveals that Apple could be currently working on implementing AR into its base iOS services.\nPublished by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, Apple’s new patent is simply called “ Augmented reality maps .” It was submitted for approval in February 2010, and lists former Apple employee Jaron Waldman as the inventor. Waldman was responsible for developing the location-based services infrastructure for Maps, CoreLocation, and MapKit for iOS and OS X. He left Apple in 2013 to establish Curbside, a service for finding, buying, and retrieving products from nearby stores.\nMore: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events”\nBased on the new patent, Apple’s Maps application won’t utilize a special headset that will project augmented map information in the user’s field of view. Instead, the information will be displayed on a mobile device’s screen, and will based on the user’s current geographical location, camera direction, and the tilt of the device. Essentially, users will point their iOS device in a specific direction and a search result will display nearby points of interest in an overlay rendered over the camera’s real-time feed.\nFor instance, the owner of an iPhone may load up Maps and point the device in a specific direction when visiting Washington, D.C. In turn, Maps will render relevant information in a layer drawn over the camera’s real-time video feed displayed on the screen. This information will stay “attached” to those real-world points of interest no matter how the iPhone’s point-of-view is shifted. After that, if the user selects a location on the screen, Maps will progress to display directional information as the user moves toward that location.\nApple AR Maps Patent More That said, the AR version of Maps relies on several factors: a built-in camera, GPS connectivity, a digital compass to determine the camera’s direction, an accelerometer to determine the camera’s tilt orientation, and internet access for retrieving and servicing map information requests based on the area surrounding the current GPS coordinates. That information will include “descriptive” data of features including places, roads, buildings, and other points of interest.\nOf course, we can’t forget the graphics processor that will generate the augmented information and the real-time video feed on the same screen:\n“The graphics processor configured to: overlay, on the video image, map data representing each of the one or more identified points of interest and an illustrated portion of a route from the GPS location identified by the GPS device to a selected one of the identified points of interest, the route being determined based on the map data; and update the illustrated portion of the route as the GPS location of the video capture device changes with movement along the route; and the display configured to present the video image that has been overlaid.”\nIf anything, the patent reveals that Apple has tooled around with AR technology for at least six years. Naturally, the advancement of mobile technology makes the patent relevant to today’s devices rather than what powered the iPhone 4 so many years ago. It also shows that Apple is indeed building an AR foundation into iOS, and hopefully we’ll see all that work go live with an upcoming iOS release in the near future.\nGoogle’s first AR-capable Tango phone, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, now available Giphy Cam now lets you create shareable Snapchat-style GIFs in augmented reality Epson and DJI team up to let you fly drones with augmented reality",

The company even has a sophisticated robot, named Liam, that can systematically remove components in devices like the iPhone so they can be reused in other units.\nAlthough there is still a bit of a stigma attached to buying refurbished electronics and some will wonder what might be wrong with the hardware that it needed to be fixed up, some of that fear is unfounded. In many cases, devices are returned to companies for little reason other than the customer didn’t want it after purchase. In other cases, refurbished devices might never have been opened and returned before the owner could even try them out.

On the iPhone 6s Plus side, customers can similarly save $100 or more off the sticker price. Like brand-new iPhones, the refurbished handsets Apple is selling come with new batteries and outer shells. They also come with a one-year warranty. This article originally appeared on Fortune.com ",

      "text": "Yui Mok—PA Wire/PA Images iPhone 6s (right) and iPhone 6s Plus The company is selling refurbished iPhones for the first time \nFor the first time in nearly a decade, Apple is offering its customers the opportunity to get refurbished iPhones. \nThe tech giant this week launched a new sales program for the iPhone, known as the Apple Certified Refurbished store. Customers who head over there will be able to pick up a refurbished iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The iPhone joins Apple’s many other products, including Macs, iPods, and other items already on sale in its digital marketplace for refurbished devices. \nThe move is a notable one for Apple, which has focused most of its retail attention in recent years on selling brand-new devices. While Apple has offered refurbished Macs for years, its online marketplace has only been home to new iPhones. In fact, Apple hasn’t sold refurbished iPhones at retail since the smartphone’s launch in 2007. \nSelling a refurbished iPhone, however, is in keeping with Apple’s desire to be a leader in electronics recycling and other green initiatives. Apple is investing heavily in recycling programs in hopes of getting its old hardware back from customers. It then decides whether to refurbish the hardware and sell it again or break it down and mine its parts for recycling. The company even has a sophisticated robot, named Liam, that can systematically remove components in devices like the iPhone so they can be reused in other units. \nAlthough there is still a bit of a stigma attached to buying refurbished electronics and some will wonder what might be wrong with the hardware that it needed to be fixed up, some of that fear is unfounded. In many cases, devices are returned to companies for little reason other than the customer didn’t want it after purchase. In other cases, refurbished devices might never have been opened and returned before the owner could even try them out. In those cases, customers are effectively getting a brand-new handset that Apple or any other company simply can’t sell as new any longer. Getting a refurbished iPhone also saves folks some cash. Apple’s iPhone 6s has a starting price of $549 when it’s purchased new. Buying a refurbished iPhone 6s from Apple will set customers back $449 to start. On the iPhone 6s Plus side, customers can similarly save $100 or more off the sticker price. Like brand-new iPhones, the refurbished handsets Apple is selling come with new batteries and outer shells. They also come with a one-year warranty.",

      "text": "Posted: Nov 9 2016, 11:29am CST | by Ahmed Humayun , in Rumors | Apple Apple has been granted patent for foldable/bendable iPhone \nApple has been granted a patent for a foldable and/or bendable iPhone. This device will be manufactured from advanced carbon nanotube structures. Patently Apple claims that this patent application was given back in 2014. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals \nIt describes the device to have clam shell like design. Evidence that Apple is seriously interested in this foldable iPhone concept since many years is that another solely bendable phone patent was filed back in 2013. \nThe patent which has been filed in 2014 uses the iPhone moniker specifically instead of the general ‘electronic device’ or other such derivatives. It also has illustrations of the basic iPhone design as well of the new foldable designs. \nThe documents also shed some light on the materials which may be used in the construction of this future iPhone. The materials mentioned are ceramic, glass, fibre, plastic and aluminium. However nanotubes are mentioned clearly as the main material which will make this design to be possible. \nThese patents can be taken to be true but certainly do not indicate that the next iPhone sport any such design. Many other Smartphone makers including the leading rival of Apple, Samsung has also expressed interest in this technology. You May Like",

ET Apple, Salesforce, Offshore Cash in Focus on Trump 2016 Election Win By Tiernan Ray \nHere are some things going on today in your world of tech : \nNasdaq futures were down almost 97 points before 9 am, Eastern, or 2%, at 4,705, though that drop has narrowed to 70 points following the election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States. \nMajor techs are among decliners in early trading, including Apple ( AAPL ) down 65 cents, or 0.6%, at $110.41, Facebook ( FB ) down $2.14, or 1.8%, at $122.08, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) down $1.19, or 5%, at $22.05. \nWeighing in with some post-election advice this morning is Mizuho ’s Abhey Lamba , who advises buying “good quality names with valuation support,” such as Salesforce ( CRM ), ServiceNow ( NOW ), Red Hat ( RHT ), Apple and Commvault ( CVLT ). Lamba is cautious about companies with what he calls “model transitions,” such as Splunk ( SPLK ), Tableau Software ( DATA ), and Teradata ( TDC ). \nShares of Splunk and Tableau are down 2%, and 3%, respectively, while Teradata stock is unchanged. \nAnother point of view is offered by Citigroup ’s Walter Pritchard , who thinks that stocks will “focus on the likelihood of one-time repatriation of overseas cash,” and that “some of the mid and large cap companies that have large cash balances trapped’ offshore are likely to benefit from being able to return a portion of this cash to shareholders,” including Autodesk ( ADSK ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Oracle ( ORCL ). \nBack on planet Earth, Shares of GoPro ( GPRO ) are down 96 cents, or almost 9%, at $9.90, after the company announced last night , during the thick of U.S. Presidential election tallies, that it is recalling all 2,500 of the “Karma” drones that it has shipped, and issuing refunds, citing the possibility of the units losing power “during operation.” The company says no injuries or property damage have been reported thus far. \nCEO Nicholas Woodman said “we are working in close coordination with both the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Aviation Administration” and that “we are very sorry to have inconvenienced our customers and we are taking every step to make the return and refund process as easy as possible.” \nThe problem with the drone, and with the company’s new camera, first arose during a disappointing Q3 report by GoPro last Thursday. \nThe stock has gotten at multiple downgrades this morning. Raymond James ’s Tavis McCourt, cutting the stock to Market Perform from Outperform, writing “we are concerned about the company’s brand image following a 12- to 18-month period filled with produce management missteps.”",

      "text": "Share   \nI admit it, I thought Apple was going to face an uphill battle with the MacBook Pro. I guess I underestimated the new laptop. Despite ditching popular features like the SD card slot and sporting a starting price of $1,499 — and that’s without the new Touch Bar OLED panel — the laptop appears to be an early success. New data from Slice Intelligence suggests that the new MacBook Pro is selling at a faster rate than Apple’s competitors, too. \nYesterday, reports out of Apple’s supply chain suggested Apple is bullish on the new MacBook Pro and has indeed increased component orders in anticipation of increased sales. Slice’s data shows that Apple may be making a smart move. \n“In the first five days of availability online, the latest model generated over seven times the revenue that the MacBook 12-inch did during its April 2015 launch,” Slice Intelligence said on Wednesday. “The new model’s sales already equal 78 percent of all the revenue generated by the MacBook 12-inch since it became available, and has accumulated more revenue than any other laptop this year.” \nLet that sink in for a moment. \nThe new MacBook Pro is already generating almost as much revenue as a product that has been out for a year and a half. It’s also crushing every other competitor on the market, including all of the fancy new Windows 10 machines we’ve seen launch over the last several months, in terms of ability to generate revenue. \nLook, I said early on that the MacBook Pro is wildly overpriced, and I thought that there was no way it could help boost Apple’s sinking PC sales. I may have been wrong. But we do need to consider the other side of the coin. \nKeep in mind that, given the MacBook Pro’s price, it’s easy for it to generate revenue at a much faster pace compared to lower-cost machines. In other words, for every one thousand $1,500 MacBook Pros Apple sells, a Chrome OS competitor selling $200 machines would need to sell about 8,000. So what’s causing the spike? Why is the MacBook Pro an early success? \nSlice thinks the resurgence is thanks to folks who may be coming back to Apple. “This successful launch may be luring those who have abandoned Apple back to the brand,” the firm said. “Touch-screen technology has been deployed by other laptop brands for years and shoppers looking for the newest technology would have to move away from Apple to try the new tech.” \nApple still hasn’t adopted a full touchscreen display, though, and it sounds like that’s something that’s not even in the cards. Folks who want that will still need to look elsewhere. In any case, early signs suggest the MacBook Pro is a success. Color me surprised.

      "text": "Apple, Bacon & Gorgonzola Salad with Sweet Balsamic Vinaigrette November 9, 2016 \nHiya friends! How is everyone feeling today? Never mind. Don’t answer that. lol I am staying off Facebook for the rest of the day, or I guess until after I share this amazing salad recipe over there. Other than that, it’s just too much for me to handle seeing friends and family fighting over the election results. To be fully honest I was not happy with either candidate. I thought our country could’ve done better. But I do love this country and I am proud to be an American. No matter who our President is. \nOkay, no more politics. Let’s bring on the food! 🙂 This salad is a new favorite of mine and I believe will become yours too! Slices of apple, crispy bacon and Gorgonzola cheese are among some of the deliciousness inside. Of course the dressing always makes that final touch and this Sweet Balsamic Vinaigrette does just that. I’m normally not the biggest vinaigrette fan but this one changed my mind. It is delicious! \nThis salad makes for an incredibly yummy lunch or dinner. I can also see this being served as a side salad with our Thanksgiving meal. I think everyone is really going to love it!

      "text": "It's been more than two months since Nintendo first joined Apple onstage to announce Super Mario Run . There's still plenty we don't know about the mobile game, but, as its December release date draws closer, more details are starting to come in.\nHere's a quick rundown of everything we've learned about Super Mario Run in the past few weeks.\nSuper Mario Run release date is still on track According to video game industry analyst Dr. Serkan Toto, who's reported on Super Mario Run development in the past, the game is still on schedule for its promised December launch.\n5) Super Mario Run is on track for a December release. DeNA had to cooperate closely with Nintendo - on both the client and server side.\nWe still don't have a specific release date, but you can signup for notifications in the Apple App Store to find out as soon as it launches (over 20 million people have already signed up). Super Mario Run is also set to land on Android devices ... eventually , but that might not happen until next year.\nIs Super Mario Run headed for the Nintendo Switch? Super Mario Run might be a mobile game, but it could be headed to the Nintendo Switch too. A recent Japanese patent filed by Nintendo reveals potential plans to bring the side-scroller to its upcoming console.\nThe patent in question was re-published on gaming forum NeoGAF . It clearly mentions Super Mario Run by name and then suggests the game could run on \"home video game machines.\" That doesn't guarantee Super Mario Run will launch on the Nintendo Switch, but we wouldn't rule out the possibility.\nSuper Mario Run release will be even bigger than planned Super Mario Run was originally set to launch in 100 countries this year. Late last month, Nintendo upped that number to 150 countries during a presentation to investors .\nThe company also explained how pricing will work for the mobile game. Super Mario Run will be available as a free download that includes a limited demo. From there, players will have to pay a one-time fee to access the full experience.\nSuper Mario Run release could be as big as Pokémon Go Nintendo obviously has high hopes for Super Mario Run , but it could be difficult to follow the runaway success of Niantic's Pokémon Go . Speaking to Bloomberg , Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said the company expects its new mobile game to do just as well.\n\"This time we're using Mario , that's a very important intellectual property for us,\" he said. \"And that's what [Shigeru] Miyamoto's team is working on now: making sure it spreads out just as quickly as Pokémon Go .\"\nSuper Mario Run : Made with Unity Earlier this month, Unity Technologies revealed that it's working with Nintendo to launch Super Mario Run .\nWe are thrilled that the legendary creators @NintendoAmerica are bringing Mario to mobile for the first time, and it's #madewithunity\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwMtEetVMAATAPB.jpg:large Unity's software engine is a popular choice for video game developers. The company boasts a number of successful titles developed using its technology, including Crossy Road , Monument Valley and Pokémon Go . That should put Super Mario Run in good company once it launches next month.\nSuper Mario Run: Everything we still don't know Despite everything we've learned about Super Mario Run in the past few weeks, there's even more that we still don't know.\nThe specific price is still a mystery, though we're guessing it will come in at around $5. The official release date is also unclear, but we wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo just barely makes its December deadline.\nHopefully, Nintendo will clear up those questions soon, but until then we'll keep an eye out for any more information.",

      "text": "Apple pushes Apple Pay on the web with attractive online discounts Yoni Heisler Pin it Share Apple Pay hasn't swept the world by storm just yet, but Apple's homegrown payment service continues to grow by leaps and bounds. As an illustrative example, Tim Cook said during Apple's most recent earnings conference call that the number of Apple Pay transactions increased by 500% year over year. Looking ahead, we can expect the volume of Apple Pay transactions to grow even more now that macOS Sierra supports Apple Pay on the web. Additionally, Apple's recently revamped MacBook Pro has a Touch ID sensor built right into the keyboard, providing an efficient means to authenticate online transactions. DON'T MISS: Evidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone In an effort to encourage Mac users to embrace online payments via Apple Pay, Apple today quietly rolled out a new promotion that offers users exclusive deals at some big name retail outlets when they purchase goods via Apple Pay on the web. The advertised deals are as follows: \nAdidas — Enjoy one- or two-day free shipping. \nCasper — Buy a mattress and receive a $50 iTunes gift card. \nGrubhub — Win a $50 gift card for you and a friend! New diners will also receive $10 off their next order. \nInstacart — First-time customers get one month of free Instacart delivery. \nJackThreads — Get 20% off great holiday looks. \nJet — Get 10% off your first three orders and $5 JetCash to use on future purchases. \nLululemon — Get a $25 gift card if you spend over $150. \nThe New York Times — Get 50% off a one-year subscription. \n1-800-FLOWERS — Enjoy free shipping. \nOverstock — Enjoy a free year of Club O Rewards Membership, a $19.99 value. \nSeamless — Win a $50 gift card for you and a friend! New diners will also receive $10 off their next order. \nShopify — Explore unique gifts and deals from Shopify stores. \nSpring — Get 20% off perfect looks for holiday. \nVacatia — Get 7% off resort bookings and a chance to win a one-week stay in Hawaii. Apple also adds that it plans to roll out additional Apple Pay related discounts at a number of other online outlets, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, Tumi, Under Armour and The Washington Post Trending right now:",

      "text": "Home > Apple > Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro enjoys brisk early… Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro enjoys brisk early sales thanks to pent-up demand November 9, 2016 10:07 AM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIn spite of a chorus of complaints around the lack of real innovation in its recent MacBook Pro release , Apple is still enjoying brisk sales of the new machines. In fact, the new MacBook Pro is outselling a number of competitive notebooks on the market, including Apple’s own 12-inch MacBook, according to Slice Intelligence . \nThe data is most impressive because it’s based on just five days of sales for the 2016 MacBook Pro. In that brief span, the MacBook Pro generated 78 percent of the revenues that the diminutive MacBook has generated since its introduction on April 10, 2015. Generally speaking, the new MacBook Pro has already generated more revenue than any other notebook in 2016. \nMore: How Intel’s Ultrabook initiative challenged the MacBook Air — and won \nCompared to the competition, the 2016 MacBook Pro has generated more revenue in its first five days than a number of competitive machines have since they were introduced. This includes Microsoft’s Surface Book, the Asus Chromebook Flip, Dell’s Inspiron 2-in-1, and the Lenovo Yoga 900. Slice Intelligence \nThese results are particularly important for Apple’s long-term success, as Slice Intelligence points out. In the two years since the previous MacBook Pro refresh in 2014, fully 40 percent of Apple’s notebook customers moved on to other vendors. Dell and Asus were the biggest beneficiaries, with each gaining roughly 7 percent of Apple’s customers. Slice Intelligence \nWhile seeming like very good news for Apple, it’s entirely possible that these significant sales gains represent pent-up demand for new MacBook Pro hardware. The Windows 10 notebook ecosystem hasn’t been standing still, and time will tell if Apple can maintain these sales levels against excellent alternatives like Dell’s popular XPS 13 and the new thin and light — and more affordable — 2-in-1 convertible machines from HP, Lenovo, and others. \nSlice Intelligence gathers its data from 4.4 million online shoppers, so it doesn’t track all sales from every channel. Therefore, there’s room for interpretation of this data, although a general conclusion has to be that, at least initially, Apple is enjoying some renewed vigor when it comes to selling MacOS hardware. \nIf the MacBook Pro is still selling at these levels in six months or so, then we can mark this as a tremendous success. Otherwise, it’s possible that Apple’s perceived lack of innovation could end up costing it even more customers as the market continues to move forward around it.

      "text": "Apple Releases Updated Version of iOS 10.1.1  29 am   seeded a minor version change to iOS 10 .1.1, the current version of the iOS 10 operating system. The update is minor enough that it did not warrant a full 10.x.x number change, but it does include an updated build number. iOS 10.1.1 being released today has a build number of 14B150, while the initial iOS 10.1.1 release , which came on October 31, had a build number of 14B100. The new build of iOS 10.1.1 is only available as a download from Apple's servers and cannot be obtained over-the-air at this time for those who have already installed the first version of iOS 10.1.1. The new version of iOS 10.1.1 will likely be provided to those who have yet to install iOS 10.1.1, as it otherwise requires an iTunes connection to obtain. There is no new information in the changelog for the updated build, so it is unclear what minor bug fixes or changes it brings. The first version of iOS 10.1.1 fixed a bug that caused Health data to be unavailable for some users. A minor update, iOS 10.1.1 was released shortly after iOS 10.1 , a more significant update that brought a new \"Portrait\" mode and dozens of bug fixes and feature improvements.",

Citing supply chain sources, Mac Otakara said Apple wants to add a glossy white color option for the iPhone 7, MacRumors reported Monday .\nApple has had a tough time making enough jet black iPhone 7 handsets to meet demand in part because the production process is complicated. The jet black finish has a deep, high-gloss look, which is accomplished through a nine-step process of anodization and polish.\nThe iPhone 7 series, launched on Sept. 16, comes in five colors. Handsets are available in black, silver, gold and rose gold matte finishes and only jet black for the glossy finish.\nOn a conference call with analysts on Oct. 25, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said, \"Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus.\"",

      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Executive Briefing newsletter \nDigital hubris \nThe year 2016 may well be the year that some of the magic of Silicon Valley-based technology faded. Once rumors began circulating that Apple was attempting to build a car, it seemed almost a foregone conclusion that the physical engineering and production requirements of a mass-market vehicle could be readily duplicated by Apple, and that software would easily differentiate what was assumed to be an otherwise easily replicated commodity product. This was also the year that Tesla released its highly anticipated Model X SUV, only to experience significant challenges with several features, including the industry first \" falcon doors ,\" prompting CEO Elon Musk to confess that the vehicle might have been over-designed. \nThe obvious takeaway for IT leaders is that software and innovation are not magical talismans that can overcome any obstacle and mitigate flaws in physical products or complex processes. Apple cited the complexities of the automotive supply chain as a key driver in scaling back Project Titan, a fact that should have been relatively obvious. While Apple has created a world-class supply chain for its products, a smartphone-like device would be one of tens of thousands of complex subassemblies that must be designed, purchased, integrated, and managed to assemble a modern car. \nCreating frenemies \nEven before Project Titan became the worst-kept secret in the automotive industry, Apple was attempting to integrate itself more deeply into vehicles with its CarPlay project. Essentially, CarPlay allowed iPhone users to have an \"iPhone experience\" on that vehicle's dashboard screen, providing consumers with a familiar and standardized experience, but also putting Apple in charge of the in-vehicle experience rather than the automaker. This has created a bit of a strained relationship between Apple and the automakers, as consumers demand familiar, high quality software in the vehicles, but automakers hesitate to cede full control of the experience and data to a third party, creating a \"battle for the dashboard\" of sorts. While consumer demand is pulling carmakers into the Apple and Google fold, Project Titan presumably strained relations with a significant potential market for Apple, making enemies of companies that could potentially be massive customers or partners with Apple. \nSEE: Apple CarPlay: A guide to connecting your iPhone to your car (CNET) \nThe promises of digital technologies can make it tempting to thumb your nose at longstanding partners, vendors, and customer segments that you assume you'll no longer need once your innovation dreams come to fruition. However, despite shifting relationships, these entities may become tomorrow's customers should your project change direction. Presumably Apple will continue to pitch CarPlay, and may soon be approaching the automakers it vowed to \"disrupt\" with additional software products resulting from Project Titan. \nAs you consider where to invest your digital dollars, it can be tempting to buy into all the near-magical promises of technology allowing for rapid innovation, and accelerated product development and rollout. However, all the technology in the world won't necessarily simplify highly complex physical products, sprawling supply chains, or regulatory and political burdens. Think of digital as gasoline that accelerates an already-burning fire. Just as the gas will do little without air, heat, and spark, so too will digital accomplish little if the prerequisite elements are not in place.

      "title": "My internship at Apple",
      "text": "Tweet \nName: Alastair Paragas \nWhere did you intern? I worked at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, CA, as a software engineer intern in the Internet Software and Services Department. \nWhat projects did you work on? In general, Apple tends to be highly secretive about the work that its employees do, to keep the element of delight and surprise. I can’t talk much about what I worked on in specifics, but my work focused on data crunching as well as the general area of “Big Data” and engineering pipelines to transport and query against massive datasets within the company. I worked on all “software stacks,” ranging from the design of the user interface, building out a highly responsive and real-time, front-end application to the software architecture that ran on a cluster as well as various server-side applications that connected to various data sources and utilized various other data transport/storage solutions. \nWhat is your major? Computer Sciences with minors in mathematics and mathematical sciences \nHow did your internship connect back to your coursework? During internship, I was able to apply the theory I learned in class into pure application. Computer Science, in itself, is a very application-oriented field, ranging from implementations of programming languages with compilers/interpreters to the design of networks. Also, as I typically have multiple side projects and hackathons I would attend and build projects about, things that in hindsight, may have seemed useless to me, finally revealed themselves when building complex pieces of software that ran on huge clusters of servers. \nWhat was the coolest thing about your internship? Getting to work with a highly concentrated set of intelligent people, some of whom have had been employed at other well-known tech companies. Being mentored on my project was an important moment considering the value I picked up from my co-workers. Surprisingly, I was also given a real responsibility to build a project that was actually going to be utilized and developed upon even after my internship ended. I also got to attend WWDC 2016 – Apple’s premier developer conference! \nWhat did you like most about your experience? The talented interns and co-workers who I was surrounded with. Having extremely bright mentors and co-workers helped me pick up ao anything I wished to learn quicker – whether it be through a simple lunch discussion on a programming language or a software architecture. \nWhat did you learn about yourself? I learned I was a workaholic. I enjoyed staying overtime to get a specific component done. I also always feared how I would react given some financial flexibility that the job provided me, but I found comfort in realizing that I managed to stay humble with my expenses. For example, my roommates always joked about how I ate the same plate of eggs and refried beans for dinner, which I found convenient, efficient and highly affordable. Following Henry David Thoreau’s rhetoric on keeping it simple, I found it enjoyable to live a simple life and I found myself barely utilizing the money that I earned, if any. \nHow did the position increase your professional confidence? It gave me insight into the corporate world. I was given a tremendous set of real-world responsibilities to which I was able to respond with both effort and quality. \nHow did you expand your professional network? On one of the few weekends I considered socializing, I finally met a group of people who I had interacted with online (codenamed CdT). It was enlightening how our online and offline personalities contrasted, as they were some talented and bright people who held several internships around the valley in companies like Facebook, Twilio and Google. Having opportunities to meet such people in person added a tremendous sense of connection. \nHow did it help you prove yourself in the “real-world?” Working for a company like Apple gave me the opportunity to develop projects to an extent I would have never been able to before simply due to the complexity and lack of resources. \nHow did you get your internship? I originally obtained my internship as a joke. Two of my friends – Mark Fajet and Lester Ramos – submitted my resume at Apple’s booth during HackFSU, a hackathon at Florida State University. I managed to win the “Best Hardware Hack” during the event with a hack that I scrounged together in the last few hours of the hackathon, which I’m guessing helped get me the internship for real. \nWhat advice do you have for those beginning the internship process? Assume the worst possible scenario, but also gain confidence by considering the value that you are bringing to a company – if you do get an internship with them. Assuming that I would not get into Apple gave me the calm directive that allowed me to tackle several steps of the interview process (ranging from technical to non-technical) with calm, something I would have not been able to do otherwise. \nIf you're new here, you may want to subscribe to our newsletter .

      "text": "Apple's Dominance In Smartphone Market Isn't Going Away November 07, 2016, 08:10:48 AM EDT By Chris Ciaccia Shutterstock photo \nApple ( AAPL ) may not sell the most phones out there, but its dominance in one specific area is what matters most to investors -- and this isn't likely to go away anytime soon. \nIn a recent research note, BMO Capital Markets analysts, led by Tim Long, noted that for the first time, Apple owned 103.6% of the profit in the smartphone market for the third quarter, the first time ever it had owned all of the profit and then some. \"Apple was the big winner in the quarter, with over 100% of smartphone industry profits,\" Long wrote in a note to clients. \nThis is important, as the smartphone market is now mature, with shipments down 5% year over year in the quarter to 397 million, but up 4% sequentially, Long's research highlighted. \nThis is a great sign for Apple going forward, as the iPhone 7/7 Plus were not supposed to be a huge positive for Apple. A lot of people were going to wait until next year to upgrade their iPhones, or so the prevailing thought went. \nAs usual, the consensus on Apple has been wrong and Apple has proven that it knows what it's doing when it comes to upgrades. Given the excitement surrounding next year's models, it will be interesting to see how many people do upgrade next year as opposed to this year. \nWe're not likely to see the explosive unit growth we saw just a few years ago, so companies like Apple, Samsung and now Google are going to battle it out for profits. That's where Apple has dominated and that fact is likely to change anytime soon. \nApple is highly unlikely to see the most the most of anything, (though it is the currently the leader in the tablet market), but it's able to have such a high share of the profits in the smartphone market for a few different reasons. \nNot only is its key competitor, Samsung, experiencing huge problems with the recall of its Galaxy Note 7, but unlike its competition, Apple makes both the hardware and software for its devices. While Google is also doing that with the Pixel phone (and early reviews have been positive), it's going to be a long time before Google approaches Apple-like levels in terms of unit sales. \nAs Apple continues to build out its ecosystem, including Apple Music, iCloud and other services designed for the iPhone, this strength is likely to continue to be one of the major areas the company can point towards as a positive. \nShares have had a nice run over the past six months and that momentum is likely to continue, as we get to the holiday season and beyond. \nNot bad for a device that was largely glossed over when it was first announced. \n  This article appears in: News Headlines , Technology , Mobile , Stocks More from Chris Ciaccia",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe reaction to Apple ‘s changes with the new MacBook Pro will vary depending on who you’re talking to, but it would seem that the Apple faithful have come out in force for these new machines. According to a new report from Slice Intelligence, the new MacBook Pros have been quite successful out of the gate. Sales have managed to outpace not only Apple’s competitors, but also the previous 12-inch MacBook. \nAccording to Slice’s findings, the new MacBook Pro has sold seven times as many models as the 12-inch MacBook did when it launched back in March 2015. Slice Intelligence notes that sales of the MacBook Pro already total 78% of the revenue pulled in by the 12-inch MacBook since launch. That isn’t bad when you consider that the MacBook Pro has only been available for less than a week. \nThe difference begins to look even more drastic when we shift away from Apple. According to this report, the MacBook Pro has outsold Microsoft’s Surface Book nearly 5-to-1 during this launch period. The Surface Book turned one-year-old last month, so the MacBook Pro’s performance has been impressive to say the least. \nNotebooks from other companies like Dell, Lenovo, and ASUS have an even harder time keeping up. One interesting thing to note, however is that some of these models from Apple’s competitors seem to target a different audience than the MacBook Pro. That much is at least true for the ASUS Chromebook Flip, which the MacBook Pro is being compared to in this analysis. \nApple has some work ahead of it, though, as Slice also discovered that nearly 40% of people who purchased an Apple laptop in 2014 went to a different company for their subsequent notebook. Slice says that it collected e-receipt data from 4.4 million online shoppers to come up with these numbers, making the results here somewhat more accurate than traditional polls. \nSince Apple hasn’t shared sales numbers yet, we don’t have any official word on how the MacBook Pro is performing. However, should these numbers from Slice turn out to be accurate, then it looks like the new MacBook Pro is off to an excellent start.",

      "text": "Apple is doubling down on open source Apple has been getting religion on open source, but more than code the industry needs its voice. By Matt Asay | November 9, 2016, 10:07 AM PST Google Plus Image: CNET \nApple may be the most secretive tech company on the planet, but it's finally starting to open up to open source. While the company has yet to issue its own open source report card, Google style , an Apple software engineer recently noted \"at Apple we are doubling down on open source.\" \nThat's progress, and follows on the heels of the company acknowledging its use of Apache Mesos, as well as updating its open source page to proclaim , \"Open source software is at the heart of Apple platforms and developer tools.\" \nIs it enough? \nSEE: Job description: iOS developer (Tech Pro Research) Open is as open does \nMost of Apple's software isn't open source, of course. From Siri to iOS, Apple keeps most of its code under proprietary lock and key. That's partly legacy, but it's also simply in keeping with how most companies operate, including big open source contributors like Google or Twitter. More about Open Source Subscribe to TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly newsletter \nSome of this has to do with trying to maintain competitive differentiation, but much of it comes down to effort: It's real, extra work to open source code. \nLately, Apple has been warming to more visible involvement in open source projects. Though the company has long used open source software within its proprietary products, it is now starting to contribute back, hosting projects on GitHub and on its own (like Swift). \nAs such, it's impressive to hear Apple's Michael Kjellman open up on Apple's open source ambitions: [A]t Apple we are doubling down on open source. We have tons of code in flight — really big ones in fact — many already out for review. Our list of enhancements we want to do grows all the time so there is no shortage of work to do. \nSome of that \"work to do,\" as Red Hat's Jason Brooks calls out , could involve less draconian software licensing agreements . However, it's hard to find particular fault in Apple's SLAs, given that SLAs across the industry basically translate to \"This software doesn't work and will almost certainly blow up at any moment.\" Apple's aren't any worse. It's more than code \nThe cynic will argue that Apple is only getting into open source because it has to. In a world fueled by developers, enterprises must speak their language: open source code. As Klint Flinley put it , \"[E]ven Apple can only risk alienating the developers on whom it relies for so many third-party apps and services so far. Coders have myriad options available to let them do their jobs the way they want; to keep them in-house, it turns out, Apple has to open up.\" \nFinley was referring to Apple's now open source programming language, Swift, but it's true across the board with Apple technology. Apple has proved adept at getting developers to build for its ecosystem (e.g., the App Store), but it will need tighter ties to the developer crowd as it seeks to improve services like Siri that gain resonance as developers extend them (similar to how Amazon's Echo keeps getting better due to third-party integrations). \nSEE: Apple's Swift programming language: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) \nWhich brings up a final point: As great as it is that \"Apple continues to contribute and release significant quantities of open source code,\" it's even more important that the company contribute in other ways. As Wes McKinney writes of GitHub, it \"overemphasizes the value of commits over the other kinds of important contributions to open source projects, like doing code reviews and discussing bugs and new features on the issue tracker.\" \nFor me, the most important thing Apple can do is talk about how it uses open source. Apple's taking the stage to talk about Apache Mesos and Siri , for example, is just the sort of thing to lower barriers to entry for less technical enterprises. Developers want to hear from other developers, and the fact that Apple is finally starting to participate in public conversations about open source is a huge step for Apple...and open source.

      "text": "Apple Enables Direct Links to tvOS Apps LIKE Posted 4 minutes ago by iClarified · 215 views · Translate Apple has announced that is now possible to direct link tvOS apps. Make it easier for customers to view your tvOS apps on the App Store for iPhone and iPad, and on the iTunes Store on Mac and PC with a direct link your app’s product page. Customers who have enabled their Apple TV to automatically install apps can download your app straight to Apple TV from their iOS device or computer. Simply get the link from iTunes Link Maker and use it when promoting your app. This means that for those apps that do not have an iOS app, you can now link them and view screenshots. For example, check out Carrot Weather .Hopefully, we'll soon see Apple TV screenshots and descriptions for applications that have a iOS app version as well.Please follow iClarified on Twitter , Facebook , Google+ , or RSS for updates.

      "title": "Will Music + DJ Gear Manufacturers Adopt USB-C?",
      "text": "Along with some PC notebooks and Android phones, Apple’s new MacBook Pro exclusively features USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 connections for power and data. In today’s article, we’ve compiled the benefits and headaches of USB-C for DJs and electronic musicians. We also reached out to major music gear manufacturers. Read what they think of the new standard, and when they might add USB-C ports into their hardware. Will USB-C be the new uber-standard or the next FireWire 800 flop?\n\nUSB-C and the MI Industry Consumer products like external hard drives are much faster to adopt new standards than music gear.\nSince the inception of computer music and electronic music gear, the musical instrument (MI) industry has been slower to adopt technological standards than the computer / consumer electronics industries at large. Why?\nlonger product refresh cycles for music technology the relatively tiny size of the MI business means manufacturers have a tougher time reaching economies of scale and negotiating for lower-priced bulk components This has lead to a slower-then-ideal adoption of standards (SD cards, Bluetooth) into music gear, which the industry has largely caught up to. So when the latest technologies pop up, music producers and DJs always have to wonder how soon (if at all) their setups will be affected.\nWhile the 24-pin USB-C ports started popping up on some PCs in early 2015, it didn’t make much of a splash in the music tech scene. However, when Apple festooned its long-awaited MacBook Pro laptops with nothing but USB-C ports and a 3.5 mm headphone jack at the end of October, it both granted a bright future to the USB-C standard, and sent cringes rippling through music technology circles.\nThe ports on the new Macbook Pros\nThe MacBook Pro is the most ubiquitous laptop amongst pro and semi-pro music producers and DJs . Many anticipated an overdue product refresh for quite some time. While USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports could be an advantage down the line, there are currently no pro-audio peripherals that include the port. Using adapters can (but does not always) diminish the performance of audio interfaces and other peripherals. Adapters of all kinds are also easy to lose (think about the last time you needed a headphone adapter but couldn’t find one).\nOur industry’s enthusiasm for USB-C’s advantages hinges upon how quickly and thoroughly MI gear adopts it.\nAdvantages of USB-C for Music Gear Smaller – USB-C measures 2.6 mm tall, so it can allow devices like laptops to be thinner if they don’t use any 7.5 mm tall USB-A sockets. Only certain mobile segments of music gear benefit much from ultra-thinness, but USB-C could also help free up space on often-crowded audio interfaces and controller or instrument back panels. Easier connection – USB-C cables are reversible and flippable; they don’t have to be connected “right side up,” and they use the same connector on each end. That will eventually help musicians and DJs set up more quickly and easily in low-light situations. Also, in case there was any doubt, USB-C connections are backwards-compatible with other USB standards. Powerhouse – USB-C can send video, audio and power streams simultaneously, which could mean that depending on your music setup, you may only need one wall power adapter for your laptop. Eliminating as many wall-wart and other power adapters from a live rig as possible can only make for less frustrating setups. USB-C also uses the USB 3.1 protocol by default, which has a theoretical speed of 10Gbps—twice the speed of USB 3.0. Thunderbolt 3 – Since Intel announced that Thunderbolt 3 would use the USB-C port type, every Thunderbolt 3 port, like the ones one the new MacBook Pros, will also work as USB-C ports, and will use the same cables. The Thunderbolt 3 protocol is even more powerful, supporting 40Gbps theoretical bandwidth and as much as 100W of power. As the most powerful protocol yet, Thunderbolt 3 promises to eliminate latency and provide for more expandability options over fewer cables (that is, if all your other gear is also compatible with USB-C). When Will We See Massive USB-C Adoption in Music Gear? Outlets like PCMag more or less rejoiced when Apple revealed its USB-C covered MacBook Pros, seeing it as a sign that “it won’t be long until […] USB-C is found on all manner of devices from simple external hard drives on up.” The connection is already in certain thin-form PC laptops like the Asus ZenBook 3 and in Android phones like the new Google Pixel and models from HTC and Motorola.\nThe new Google Pixel phone (right) has a USB-C port\nAs previously mentioned, MI companies are historically slow in adopting new tech standards. It’s possible that Apple’s clout, especially in the music world, will encourage gear manufacturers that USB-C is the way of the near- and long-term future. But those purchasing the new MacBook Pro out of necessity or luxury will have to settle for struggling in a potential mire of adapters and dongles for their gear until everyone else catches up. Macworld published a helpful guide to various USB-C adapters.\nEarly USB-C adopters will have to hope everyone else does catch up without a lot of concrete proof for now. We contacted 10 major OEMs of music and DJ gear to try to gauge both their interest in and timetable for USB-C adoption.\nAs you might expect: no one wanted to give specific estimates on when their company would incorporate USB-C into their products, but the overall implication, with varying degrees of urgency, indicated that MI manufacturers would adopt USB-C when it made sense for them to do so. My own conclusion: gear manufacturers are waiting on a wide-scale adoption of USB-C computers first.\nIt’s nonetheless enlightening to hear some of the feedback from heavy-hitting gear manufacturers:\nKorg on USB-C Korg emphasized that it is “always innovating,” but Korg Product Specialist Nick Kwas’ comments centered on how USB-C could specifically enhance pro audio products. “[USB-C is] compact, which allows for more space for other input and output jacks,” he said. “And it allows for USB 3.1 data transfer, which might someday lead to technology that can be used to transmit USB MIDI and audio data at completely unprecedented rates and fidelity.”\nRoland on USB-C Roland issued the most affirmative response to adopting USB-C, although without any specific timing. Roland Corp., US Product Strategy Manager Brandon Ryan said, “we intend to implement USB-C in the future.” He added that because of USB-C’s wide compatibility and other advantages outlined above, “we expect USB-C to be adopted quickly and fully.”\nRyan’s further comments addressed how USB-C could benefit audio gear and the people who use it. “Increased power delivery could mean more devices that can get their power from USB, reducing cable clutter, eliminating unwieldy wall warts and speeding up setup at gigs,” he said. “It means more gear can go more places, increasing the opportunities to be creative.”\nHe also pointed to the benefit of USB-C possibly becoming the default cord for power and data. “USB-C cables will probably become ubiquitous, reducing the need for expensive, proprietary cables that may not be readily available, especially on location,” Ryan said.\nAllen & Heath on USB-C Allen & Heath’s response reinforced the notion that you shouldn’t assume USB-C will show up on musical equipment in the immediate future. \n“W e’ve observed that a large proportion of DJs are still using ‘older’ issue laptops and despite many perceptions, have no real definitive reason to upgrade the system that currently works for them,” said Allen & Heath’s Xone Marketing Specialist, Greg Ibbotson . “For DJs selecting external interfaces with a laptop, they might not (yet) require this or gain any benefit for the next three years.” \nIbbotson continued that “USB-C looks appealing, but it will be another standard caught in the multitude of connectivity options already on the markets’ various interfaces. However, as this isn’t an Apple-only standard, we could see USB-C actually long-term replace interfaces that featured the larger USB connector.” \nNative Instruments declined to comment on its adoption of USB-C at this time, and Pioneer DJ, Novation/Focusrite, InMusic Brands and Keith McMillen Instruments did not return our request for comments in time for publication. \nShare your thoughts below: how do you think the new connection could improve musical gear? Will you move to a USB-C computer soon? \nThe post Will Music + DJ Gear Manufacturers Adopt USB-C? appeared first on DJ TechTools .\n",

It's also been more than two weeks since Apple released macOS Sierra 10.12.1 to the public. Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the macOS Sierra beta through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store . Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website , which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas should not be installed on a primary machine due to the potential for instability. In addition to bug fixes and under-the-hood performance improvements, macOS Sierra 10.12.2 introduces support for dozens of new emoji, ranging from those introduced in Unicode 9 to several professions in both male and female genders. Some new emoji include fox face, clown face, selfie, face palm, crossed fingers, owl, shark, eagle, avocado, bacon, croissant, potato, carrot, and more. Apple has also updated the artwork on many existing emoji, adding much more detail.",

The previous build for iOS 10.1.1 was 14B150, and the new version of the mobile operating system is build 14B100. The new changes are not enough to warrant another version number change, so there won’t be any major discoveries made in this software version. \nMoreover, the new software is not available as an over-the-air (OTA) update for devices already running iOS 10.1.1. This new version of the platform is more than likely meant for those who have not yet upgraded to the latest iteration of iOS just yet.  ",

      "text": "share Still waiting for Apple to ship your shiny, new Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro ? Curious to try out the new feature before plunking down $1,799+ worth of cash? Sticking with your old laptop, but interested in seeing how the new UI works anyway? The app provides an alternative display for Apple’s already baked-in Touch Bar support If you answered yes to any of those questions, then you should try installing Andreas Verhoeven and Robbert Klarenbeek’s Touch Bar Demo App . The application is a hacked-together workaround to enable using Touch Bar on an older Mac, either as an on-screen bar by pressing the Fn key, or on a connected iPad, should you have one handy. The app simply provides an alternative display for Apple’s already baked-in Touch Bar support — so the bar will dynamically change based on what applications you have open, just like it will on the actual hardware, assuming the application in question actually supports it. Another nice perk is that the application works on any Mac that can run the latest version of macOS, letting you use the Touch Bar interface with Apple’s iMac or Mac Pro desktops in addition to just older MacBooks. To get the Mac side of things set up, you’ll need to update macOS Sierra to version 10.12.1, build 16B2657 — which adds the Touch Bar support to the operating system — from Apple’s website here . Then, simply download the application from the Touch Bar Demo App’s GitHub page , and you’re good to go. Getting the iOS application installed to use an iPad as a Touch Bar is a bit tricker, however Getting the iOS application installed to use the iPad as the Touch Bar is a bit tricker, however. To get it up and running, you’ll need to have a copy of Xcode installed. Then, you’ll need to download the TouchBar Xcode project file from the GitHub repo, and sideload the application using Xcode. Full instructions are here — it’s not too difficult to do, but if it’s your first time working with Xcode, it may take you a little longer to get things up and running. Then, simply launch the application on your iPad, connect it via USB to your Mac, and you’re good to go.",

      "text": "Hi guys, \n\ntoday I ran into a problem with authenticating Apple Mac OS X clientsvia 802.1X. The initial plan was to handle the Macs like Windows machines and authenticate them via computer authentication against the AD. After some googling I found out that there is no option to da a computer authentication on Macs. Even if they were in the domain. \n\nSo I decided to profile them and authenticate the user instead of the machine. What I want to do is the follwing: \n\nif user auth (Authorization:Domain - memberof) and Apple Mac (Authorization:EndpointDB - OS Family) -> AppleMac \n\nif AppleMac -> VLAN xzy \n\nI can see in access tracker that the user auth is working against the AD but the second condition (Endpoint DB) is failing. \nI also tried to seperate the two authorization sources in two different role mappings and combine them in the enforcement - this fails also. \n\nDoes anyone have any clue why? Is there any problem with my config? \n\nMaybe some can give me a hint to reach my goal in a better way?! \n\nAll the clients are profiled via DHCP fingerprint and the Endpoint",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Citigroup ‘s hardware and software analysts — Jim Suva and Walter Pritchard , respectively — both weigh in today with thoughts on what last night’s upset victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. election means for their covered companies.\nSuva, who follows Apple ( AAPL ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ), sees an initial threat in the potential for “political and FX uncertainty in light of US elections to impact C4Q results as we could see a pause in IT spending affecting typical 4Q spending seasonality.”\nHowever, he focuses more effort on potential for overseas cash repatriation:\nWe note this could be a positive for the sector overall. Specifically, some of the mid and large cap companies that have large cash balances “trapped” offshore are likely to benefit from being able to return a portion of this cash to shareholders, resulting in larger shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases. \nConsider all the hardware names with piles of cash, like Apple:\nWe note companies with high gross cash balances trapped offshore within our IT Hardware space include: AAPL (93% of $230bln), CSCO (91% of $64.6B), IBM ($8.2B total cash, undisclosed % of cash held overseas but note 58% of earnings are from non US operations), HPE ($10.0B total cash, undisclosed % of cash held overseas but 65% of earnings are from non US operations), HPQ ($5.6B total cash, undisclosed % of cash held overseas but 65%-70% of earnings are from non US operations), JNPR (94% of $3.2B), NTAP (90% of $5.3B), EFII (46% of $497M), SNX (76% of $235M), LXK (68% of $158M), XRX (36% of $1.4B), IM (56% of $689M), FFIV (31% of $1.2B), ARW (84% of $427M), AVT (96% of $1.2B) and TECD (87% of $697M). \nFor his part, Pritchard also sees a repatriation for software names as “a relative tailwind for the sector overall,” including for Adobe ( ADBE ) and Autodesk ( ADSK ):\nSpecifically, some of the mid and large cap companies that have large cash balances “trapped” offshore are likely to benefit from being able to return a portion of this cash to shareholders. We note companies with high gross cash balances trapped offshore include: ADBE (85% of $4B – from 2015 10-K), ADSK (86% of $2.1B), CA (76% of $2.7B), CTXS (80% of $2.45B), FTNT (38% of $1.2B), ORCL (76% of $56B – pre-N), MSFT (96% of $113B – pre-LNKD purchase), RHT (42% of $2.0B), SYMC (93% of $5.6B – post-BC), VMW (77% of $7.5B), VRSN (68% of $1.9B). We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies.",

      "text": "– A + Apple's new MacBook Pro has generated 7x more revenue than 12\" MacBook at launch By AppleInsider Staff \nWednesday, November 09, 2016, 01:01 pm PT (04:01 pm ET) \nThe new, thinner redesign of Apple's MacBook Pro lineup has been a blockbuster success out of the gate, new data suggests, blowing away dollars spent on the first 12-inch MacBook from 2015.\n\n\n\n\nSales data collected by research firm Slice suggests the new MacBook Pro has already generated more than seven times the revenue earned by the 12-inch MacBook when it went on sale in April of 2015.\n\nIn fact, in just a few weeks, the hotly anticipated MacBook Pro is said to have accumulated more revenue than any other laptop released this year.\n\nIn addition, launch sales for the MacBook Pro are already equal to 78 percent of all of the revenue generated by the 12-inch MacBook since it launched in early 2015. The data all supports Apple's own announcement that the new MacBook Pro has received more orders than any other professional-grade notebook the company has ever produced.\n\n\n\n\nThe strong sales come despite ongoing controversy from enthusiasts, bothered by what they see as unnecessary changes and concessions for a pro-focused machine. Specifically, the new MacBook Pro eschews full-size USB ports, the MagSafe charging connector, HDMI port and SD Card slot for four reversible USB-C ports\n\n\"We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one,\" Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller explained. \"That's okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good.\"\n\nStill, Apple also offered a peace offering to pro users last week, when it cut prices temporarily on USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 accessories. Many users will require new cables or dongles to connect legacy accessories to the USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro.",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Apple Brings the Emergency SOS Feature to the iPhone Starting with iOS 10.2 It first appeared on the Apple Watch by Brent Dirks November 9, 2016 \nA great Apple Watch feature is making its way to the iPhone starting with iOS 10.2. The second beta version of iOS 10.2, which was seeded to registered developers and public beta testers earlier this week, contains the Emergency SOS feature. What is it? What is it? \nOnce starting the feature, you'll have a three-second countdown to cancel a call. \nAs you could probably tell by the name, the feature is designed to help you quickly and easily call emergency services using an iPhone. Just to note, right now, the feature only works in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \nIn an emergency, rapidly click the sleep/wake button five times to call emergency services. You can toggle that on and off by heading to Settings, General, Emergency SOS. Through the menu, you can also select to play a countdown sound while the Emergency SOS is counting down. It should give users three seconds to cancel a call if needed. \nAs a nice extra layer of protection, whenever you call emergency services, anyone selected as an emergency contact will receive a message saying that you’ve called for help. The message also includes your current location. \nTo set up emergency contacts, go through Apple’s Health app. Arriving before the end of 2016 \nApple's TV app is one of the new features in iOS 10.2 \nApple says iOS 10.2 should arrive to the general public sometime before the end of the year. \nThe software sports a number of other new features. Photographers should be happy to hear about the new Preserve Camera Settings feature. Instead of completely resetting after each time the Camera app is closed, you can select to preserve the last camera mode, photo filter, and Live Photo setting. \nAlso included are three new wallpaper options, a video widget, and some new emoji. \nWe’ve also gotten our first look at the TV app .

All developers could do was ask potential customers to search for their app on the Apple TV App Store, a cumbersome process that made it difficult to acquire new customers. \nApple has been chipping away at the problem all year. In April, it introduced the ability to link to web previews of tvOS apps. The previews didn’t include buttons to buy or download tvOS apps, but it did allow potential customers to read app descriptions and view screenshots. Then in September with tvOS 10, Apple added an automatic downloads option to tvOS . That meant that if a tvOS app was associate with an iOS app, it could be installed automatically on your Apple TV if you bought or downloaded the related iOS app, effectively making the link to the iOS app a proxy for its tvOS counterpart. Apple TV-only apps can be purchased on the iOS App Store and automatically downloaded to your Apple TV. \nToday, Apple added tvOS apps to its iTunes Link Maker web app and enabled tvOS app purchases on iOS devices, even if the tvOS app is available only on the Apple TV. iTunes Link Maker lets you search for and generate links to iTunes content. tvOS app links generated by the iTunes Link Maker open in iTunes on macOS and the App Store app on iOS where the apps can be purchased or downloaded. If automatic downloads are enabled on your Apple TV, any apps acquired this way should show up on your Apple TV the next time you turn it on. Links generated with the iTunes Link Maker also work with the iTunes Affiliate Linking program . This means that for the first time a customer can click or tap a link and purchase a tvOS app without leaving their Mac or iOS device and have it waiting for them they sit down in front of the TV. \nThis is a welcome change for tvOS-only apps that greatly expands developers’ ability to reach potential customers. The change is not, however, without limits. As of the publication of this article, tvOS apps do not appear to be searchable from the iOS App Store’s Search tab. In addition, tvOS app results are not currently returned when the iTunes Search API is queried, though there seem to have been changes made to the API in anticipation of adding tvOS apps. Notwithstanding those limits, the changes today should help make tvOS-only apps a more viable option for developers. Join Now Like MacStories?

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Citigroup ‘s hardware and software analysts — Jim Suva and Walter Pritchard , respectively — both weigh in today with thoughts on what last night’s upset victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. election means for their covered companies.\nSuva, who follows Apple ( AAPL ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ), sees an initial threat in the potential for “political and FX uncertainty in light of US elections to impact C4Q results as we could see a pause in IT spending affecting typical 4Q spending seasonality.”\nHowever, he focuses more effort on potential for overseas cash repatriation:\nWe note this could be a positive for the sector overall. Specifically, some of the mid and large cap companies that have large cash balances “trapped” offshore are likely to benefit from being able to return a portion of this cash to shareholders, resulting in larger shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases.\nConsider all the hardware names with piles of cash, like Apple:\nWe note companies with high gross cash balances trapped offshore within our IT Hardware space include: AAPL (93% of $230bln), CSCO (91% of $64.6B), IBM ($8.2B total cash, undisclosed % of cash held overseas but note 58% of earnings are from non US operations), HPE ($10.0B total cash, undisclosed % of cash held overseas but 65% of earnings are from non US operations), HPQ ($5.6B total cash, undisclosed % of cash held overseas but 65%-70% of earnings are from non US operations), JNPR (94% of $3.2B), NTAP (90% of $5.3B), EFII (46% of $497M), SNX (76% of $235M), LXK (68% of $158M), XRX (36% of $1.4B), IM (56% of $689M), FFIV (31% of $1.2B), ARW (84% of $427M), AVT (96% of $1.2B) and TECD (87% of $697M).\nFor his part, Pritchard also sees a repatriation for software names as “a relative tailwind for the sector overall,” including for Adobe ( ADBE ) and Autodesk ( ADSK ):\nSpecifically, some of the mid and large cap companies that have large cash balances “trapped” offshore are likely to benefit from being able to return a portion of this cash to shareholders. We note companies with high gross cash balances trapped offshore include: ADBE (85% of $4B – from 2015 10-K), ADSK (86% of $2.1B), CA (76% of $2.7B), CTXS (80% of $2.45B), FTNT (38% of $1.2B), ORCL (76% of $56B – pre-N), MSFT (96% of $113B – pre-LNKD purchase), RHT (42% of $2.0B), SYMC (93% of $5.6B – post-BC), VMW (77% of $7.5B), VRSN (68% of $1.9B). We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies.",

      "text": "| Analysis \nThe recent botnet attacks have called into question the security of all our various internet of Things (ioT) devices, and rightfully so. Those attacks happened because people like you and me had routers, webcams and other gizmos in our homes that were not properly secured. Some of those security issues are fixable by general users, but many are not. \nThe majority of the devices that were involved in the DDoS attack on Dyn , for example, were compromised using a security hole that came from one of the device’s chipset vendors. This was something that most users wouldn’t be able to change even if they knew to try. We Have a Problem. Is HomeKit the Solution? \nA lot of discussion has centered around solving this problem going forward. Indeed, the botnet that attacked Dyn is still very much alive, functional and, in many ways, unstoppable. One of the regular chimes I hear in our Apple-centric universe is, “HomeKit is secure, it must be the answer.” \nHomeKit is secure. The transmissions between your iPhone and HomeKit-enabled devices are encrypted using some of the best security that exists. Problem is, HomeKit might not be the only way to access those devices. Indeed, it’s rare that a Wi-Fi-based smart home device is built to use only HomeKit. Most devices support HomeKit amongst a sea of other access options, often including a self-branded application or web service from the device manufacturer. \nHomeKit is the most secure of any of the methods we’ve seen, which therefore means all these other methods are less secure and potentially easier to hack. In addition to that, there are the aforementioned security holes that can exist in the devices’ chipsets themselves, having nothing to do with the stated purpose of the device. Plugging the holes \nAn obvious question, then, is why don’t device manufacturers plug all these holes? The good news is that many do. In researching this article, we spoke with quite a few smart home device manufacturers, and all of them responsibly spend time closing off all access to their devices before meticulously opening only those ports and services that are required for proper operation. That still leaves an access target, but it limits it to something the device manufacturer is aware of and hopefully can control. \nThe important thing to note, though, is that HomeKit’s device specification and certification does not require manufacturers to perform any security beyond that which relates to HomeKit access. You could theoretically have a HomeKit-enabled device that contains one or more non-HomeKit security holes. Thankfully we haven’t found one yet, but it is most certainly possible. Even in that case, though, the HomeKit transmissions and data would still be secure, and even a hacked device wouldn’t allow access to your iPhone or any of its data. HomeKit keeps all that contained. What Can I Do To Protect My Devices? \nThe other thing you can do is to secure your home network. Router manufacturers are in a unique spot to help detect and even prevent these kinds of attacks but, until they’re up-to-speed with this, you need to do the work yourself. \nConsider disabling UPnP or NAT-PMP on your router and using manual port forwarding instead. UPnP and NAT-PMP allow your devices to automatically request that certain ports be forwarded to them, and can often be the source of unintentional (or intentional) security holes. By manually forwarding the requested ports you’re in a position to prevent unnecessary external access to your devices in the event some malware makes its way onto one of them in the future. \nAdditionally, choose devices from known, trusted vendors and ask them about each device you plan to use. Check with us, too. We’re regularly testing these things and we talk about this kind of security on Mac Geek Gab all the time. Check online to see what others say. The bottom line is: do your research, and know that we’re here to help. Share this:",

      "text": "tvOS Apps Can be Purchased From Macs and iOS Devices   \nApps are a big bet for Apple, as far as the tvOS platform is concerned, so it would make sense that the company would make buying them as easy as possible . \nFor anyone who has had the desire to buy a new app for the Apple TV 4, but just so happened not to be anywhere near it at the time, Apple’s making it possible to buy that app right from your phone or computer. That begins with adding tvOS apps to its iTunes Link Maker web app. \nWith support from Apple’s iTunes Link Maker web app, iOS device owners, as well as Mac users, will be able to buy tvOS apps right from those devices, and have them installed on the set-top box by the time they get home. That includes tvOS-only apps. For links generated with the tool, they will open iTunes on a Mac, and they will open the App Store app on iOS devices, directly to the app’s dedicated landing page. From there, it can be purchased and downloaded as normal. \nFor the aforementioned download to occur back at home, though, the user has to have the Automatic Download feature turned on in the Apple TV 4, so keep that in mind. \nThis is good news all around, for developers that want to get their app in front of more eyeballs, especially tvOS-only apps. Making it easier for customers to buy/download those apps is also a bonus. \nHow many apps do you have installed on your Apple TV 4?",

      "text": "Behind-the-scenes update allows for Apple TV app installs from iOS or iTunes By Wednesday, November 09, 2016, 01:53 pm PT (04:53 pm ET) Apple on Wednesday announced changes to the way it handles tvOS apps, most notably allowing one to be automatically downloaded to an Apple TV if a person picks up its iOS counterpart. For the feature to work, automatic downloads must be turned on for a user's iTunes account. Previously, people would have to manually find and download tvOS apps even if iOS versions were available. Developers can now also offer direct links, by way of iTunes Link Maker , to tvOS apps in the iOS and iTunes versions of the App Store. A universal URL incorporates screenshots and details for all compatible devices, including iPhones, iPads, iPods, the Apple TV, and/or the Apple Watch. While Apple skipped updating the Apple TV hardware this year with features like 4K support, it has been tackling the software side, for instance introducing tvOS 10 and promising additions like single sign-on support , a dedicated \"TV\" app , and the ability to jump straight into live streams using Siri.

      "title": "Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan - Investor's Business Daily",
      "text": "Technology Apple, Microsoft, Cisco Eye Trump Overseas Cash Tax Plan Apple is the overseas cash king, but President-elect Trump has proposed a measure that would ease the tax hit on U.S. companies bringing cash back to the country. (Apple) Reprints \nApple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress. \nTrump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Cisco and Oracle ( ORCL ). \nTrump's cash repatriation proposal \"could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,\" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. \"The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.\" \nMoody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015. \n\"We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,\" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. \" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments. \n\"More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.\" \nTrump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates. \n\"Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,\" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report. \nWalter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate \"is not likely to block\" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House. \nPritchard says Adobe Systems ( ADBE ), Autodesk ( ADSK ), Citrix Systems ( CTXS ), Red Hat ( RHT ) and VMware ( VMW ) are among companies that could bring back cash. \n\"We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,\" Pritchard said in a research report. Drug Companies Also Have Lots Of Cash Overseas \nThe biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen ( AMGN ), Medtronic ( MDT ) and Gilead Sciences ( GILD ), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ) and Coca-Cola ( KO ). \n\"While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,\" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report. \nAmong big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today . Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59. Microsoft shares dipped 0.5% to 60.17. \nRELATED:",

      "title": "Apple's MacBook Pro Has Already Outsold Its Competitors - Fortune",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple’s MacBook Pro Has Already Outsold Its Competitors \nApple’s MacBook Pro has generated far more revenue than any other notebook released this year. \nIn its first five days of availability, sales of the MacBook Pro nearly quadrupled that of the Microsoft Surface Book over the last year, according to new data from research firm Slice Intelligence. The gap is even wider on other popular computers, including the Asus Chromebook and Dell Inspiron computers. Only Apple’s 12-inch MacBook has been able to top the MacBook Pro’s sales. However, Slice Intelligence noted that Apple’s latest notebook has already generated 78% of the revenue the 12-inch MacBook has generated since April 10, 2015. \nThe Slice Intelligence data comes from its analysis of more than 4.4 million online shoppers. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nApple AAPL unveiled its new MacBook Pro late last month. The computer comes in 13- and 15-inch form factors and runs on Apple’s macOS Sierra operating system. While it comes with several enhancements under the hood, including better processing power, arguably its most important feature is its Touch Bar. That feature, which sits above the device’s keyboard, is a multitouch glass strip that lets users interact with the on-screen software with their fingers. It’s Apple’s answer to Windows-based computers featuring touchscreens—a feature customers won’t find on the MacBook Pro. \nSeveral signs of late have indicated MacBook Pro sales were strong. Last week, for instance, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller said the MacBook Pro has secured more sales through the Apple online retail store than any other professional-focused notebook it’s ever released. Earlier this week, a report from Apple’s supply chain surfaced, saying the company is ramping up orders to satisfy strong demand for its notebook . \nApple hasn’t shared exact sales figures on its MacBook Pro. For more about Apple MacBook Pro, watch: \nIn addition to sharing sales data, Slice Intelligence said in a statement that the MacBook Pro is also helping Apple get back some of its former customers who had turned to other brands like Dell and Asus. The research firm added some customers had turned away from Apple in the last couple of years to try out touchscreen-based computers in the Windows world. Now, they’re coming back to Apple. \nApple’s MacBook Pro will begin shipping soon to those who ordered the computer last month. Those who order it now from Apple’s online store will need to wait four to five weeks for the computer to ship to their homes or offices.",

      "text": "Search: The Skeptical Way to Look at Apple’s Guidance Apple reported earnings in late October, and we look at the major segments, digest the guidance the company offered up, and discuss some issues analysts raised during the conference call. Motley Fool Staff ( the_motley_fool ) Nov 9, 2016 at 2:20PM \nInvestors didn't react very favorably to Apple 's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) latest earnings release, and it's likely that guidance for the coming quarter failed to impress. \nIn this clip from Industry Focus: Tech , Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss the bigger picture and how to interpret the company's forecast. \nA full transcript follows the video. \nThis podcast was recorded on Oct. 28, 2016. \nDylan Lewis: In my eyes, pretty solid quarter. They met expectations, they set guidance that put them back on to at least some sort of growth, for at least the next quarter. We had a listener tweet, and I think this is something that probably a lot of people are wondering, you say, \"OK, they checked the boxes in a lot of ways. Why are they down 2.5% since they reported?\" The initial reaction when you saw iPhone units was positive, and pretty much after that they've fallen off and haven't really recovered. Two and a half percent is nothing to go crazy panicked over, but I think it's a valid question, and it's something a lot of people are wondering. What do you think? \nEvan Niu: I think it was just kind of in line with expectations. It's always hard to know how the market is going to react. It's not always just about with the actual consensus number is, it's also about the whispered number, which is this abstract concept of what people actually think. That's the way that analysts work. Investors talk up this whispered number, \"Oh, this is what I have on my official estimates, but I think they'll probably go lower, or higher.\" So, it's always hard to gauge what's actually going to happen. Two percent is not a killer move in either direction. I think it was more of just a lack of being impressed, if that makes sense. We talked about the gross margin guide wasn't super great. People just have to start accepting that Apple is just not a growth machine anymore, and that's OK. But some people have trouble with that just because it's kind of boring, for it to not be a growth machine. \nLewis: Yeah. And, in fairness, this is a company that has, historically, provided relatively conservative guidance. You almost never see them miss their own guidance marks. They typically meet it or are surprised pretty comfortably. So, to show them projecting growth means they must be pretty confident that that's going to happen. They do have some nice tailwinds to support that, like I said, they have one of the biggest competitors off the market, and they also benefit this quarter from a 14-week Q1 instead of a 13-week Q1. So, that should help them out a little bit, a couple extra selling days there. But, by and large, there's nothing in this report from my end, that really changes my thesis on this company. \nNiu: They do pretty much always get within their guidance. It's not like the old days, when they would put out this laughably low guidance number, a lowball that you could basically ignore. A few years ago, they changed to really be more honest, to actually give a range that they're pretty confident they'll get within. And, for the most part, they have, every quarter, more or less. I definitely take their guidance at face value these days versus the old days, when you could basically just laugh it off because it was a joke. I think maybe that's another reason why they weren't as impressed. Maybe, like you mentioned, there's an extra week in this quarter. If the revenue growth is because you get an extra week, that doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence in the business. Again, it's not like it's a terrible business. But if you're looking skeptically, you could say, \"Oh, you're only going to grow because you had more days to sell in the quarter.\" Maybe that's another thing people were disappointed in. \nLewis: Even then, returning to a flat quarter, in my eyes, is great. We've seen this down trend for such a long time that seeing them get back to, whether it's zero or positive growth, it's pretty fantastic. \nDylan Lewis owns shares of Apple.
