      "title": "2019 Ford Explorer spied again",
      "text": "By : Jeff Perez , Editor Ford is keeping its sixth-generation Explorer SUV well under wraps until its debut. This is the all-new Ford Explorer – though you might not be able to tell just by looking at it. Underneath all that heavy cladding sits a brand new platform, and eventually a range of new engine options. The mule was caught testing again on public roads near Dearborn, Michigan, this past week. The new D6 platform will replace the outgoing D4 platform – which has been on the market since 2005 – and is expected to underpin not only the Explorer but also the new Lincoln MKT . It can be configured in either front-, rear-, or all-wheel-drive, depending on the spec, though the prototype seen here seems to be putting to use the former, as no rear axle is present. Under the hood, a range of more efficient engine options will be offered. The existing 2.3-liter four-cylinder, and 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost will remain, but the naturally-aspirated 3.5-liter V6 could be axed in place of something more mpg friendly. No word on whether the same six-speed automatic transmission will carry over, or if the Explorer will gain the new 10-speed automatic proposed for the Mustang . The Explorer, which has been on the market since 1990, has been a mainstay vehicle for Ford, with more than seven million examples sold in the United States alone. The current fifth-generation model, which has been on the market since 2011, has been marginally successful, earning the North American Truck of the Year Award in 2011. The sixth generation of the seven-seat SUV is expected to debut either at the 2017 Los Angeles Auto Show or the 2018 Detroit Auto Show. It will go on sale sometime in summer 2018 as a 2019 model.

      "text": "Charges Dismissed For Speeding Ford GT Prototypes | By Share A couple months after three 2017 Ford GT prototypes were pulled over for speeding in Colorado, it’s been reported that the speeding and reckless driving charges have been dropped. Vail Daily wrote that at the time, a Colorado State Patrol trooper clocked two of the prototypes driving at 101 mph (162 km/h) in a 50 mph (80 km/h) zone while the third was obeying the posted speed limit. While trying to prosecute the offending drivers however, it was too difficult to identify which of the three were speeding as they didn’t have license plates and all looked almost identical. According to assistant District Attorney Heidi McCollum, “There would have been no way to identify which two of the three were doing the speeding. There was no way we could prove beyond a reasonable doubt which two of the three were speeding.” While the charges for the triple figure speeds were dropped, McCollum did say “There are places to go 100 mph (160km/h). The interstate highway leaving Glenwood Canyon is not one of those places.” It still remains somewhat of a mystery when production examples will hit the streets. Recently, it was reported that in the welcome guide provided to 2017 Ford GT owners, Ford says the first customer deliveries will commence next month. That comes despite the fact that full technical specifications about the model’s 3.5-liter twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 engine have yet to be made public.

      "title": "Ford enlivens Nigeria’s auto market with new Edge",
      "text": "Ford enlivens Nigeria’s auto market with new Edge November 23, 2016 New Ford Edge Rasheed Bisiriyu Just before the end of a recession year in Nigeria, characterised by poor sales and scarce new car launches, Coscharis Motors has unveiled the 2016 edition of Ford Edge, which comes loaded with sophisticated technologies including active noise control and pre-collision assist/pedestrian detection. The event, which was held in Lagos, was witnessed by officials of the Ford Middle East and African Region, led by the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jacques Brent. The President, Coscharis Group, Cosmas Maduka, says the introduction of the new Ford Edge to the Nigerian market is not to allow the gloomy recession deny the fans the opportunity of having the latest Ford masterpiece in their garages. Specifically, he says the new vehicle, coming after the 2016 Ford Explorer and all-new Ford Figo, is a confirmation of the automaker’s continuous improvement and innovation on all its line-up. According to Maduka, the Edge comes in three variants – SE, SEL and Limited, all of which have striking designs and assert their presence on the road, either in motion or in parking position. He says the new Ford Edge is an upscale sport utility vehicle that delivers premium levels of comfort, sophisticated driver assistance features and class-leading driving dynamics, adding that its Ford Adaptive Steering automatically adjusts the steering ratio according to speed to optimise manoeuvrability and precision. Ford, in a statement on the new Edge, quotes its Regional Sales and Marketing Manager, Customer Services Division for sub-Saharan Africa, Rob Johnston, as saying, “The spacious and high-tech Ford Edge responds to our customers’ demands for a premium Ford SUV. “Offering cutting-edge style with commanding presence and high specification including Ford Intelligent All Wheel Drive, the Edge makes advanced technologies and premium quality more accessible to the growing numbers of SUV customers around the world, and in Africa.” Interior Ford also says the vehicle sets new standards in its class for interior space, featuring high quality materials and offering comfort with convenience features including heated as well as cooled front seats and a panoramic roof on the high-spec models. It has luxurious seating options, depending on model derivative, which include front and rear heated leather seats that enhance comfort in cold weather, and cooled front seats that offer relief to occupants on hot days by directing cold air from the climate system through perforations in the seat leather. Ford says, “Customers who welcome the sunshine into their cars will enjoy Edge’s expansive panoramic glass roof on the SEL, Titanium and Sport models, with two large glass panels that add to the spacious, open and airy feel of the interior.” Luggage capacity of 1,847 litres with the rear seats folded is among the largest in the segment, and additional stowage areas are located around the wheel arches, according to the automaker. Other striking features Pre-Collision Assist with Pedestrian Detection is unique to the car and it applies braking if a collision with another vehicle ahead is imminent, and is designed to detect people in or near the road ahead and automatically apply the brakes if a potential collision is detected. Its adaptive LED headlamp technology employs Ford’s Adaptive Front Lighting System to adjust the headlight beam angle to match the driving environment; while the Glare-Free High-beam technology detects vehicles ahead, both oncoming and those travelling in the same direction, and blocks out light that could dazzle from the adaptive LED headlamp technology while retaining maximum illumination for other areas. The all-new Edge sensor technologies also make parking easier with its Perpendicular Parking that can detect and reverse the car hands-free into spaces alongside other cars in the same way that Active Park Assist helps drivers to parallel park. Engine The new Ford Edge comes with the advanced 2.0-litre four-cylinder EcoBoost engine that uses a twin-scroll turbocharger to produce 245 horsepower and 275 lb.-ft. of torque. The Ford Edge uses the latest powertrain technologies to deliver optimised fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. There is the option of 3.5-litre Ti-VCT V6 engine with 280hp and 250 lb.-ft peak outputs. Its all Edge derivatives are mated to a six-speed SelectShift automatic transmission, with the choice of front-wheel drive or Ford’s Intelligent All Wheel Drive system on the 2.0 EcoBoost and 3.5 V6 versions. Safety Some of its safety features are the Blind Spot Information System; Traffic Sign Recognition; Lane Keeping Alert; Lane Keeping Aid and Driver Alert. A fully configurable 3D digital instrument cluster allows drivers to personalise the information displays to their own preferences, while maintaining a simple, elegant appearance, Ford adds. “The Ford Edge is the first Ford vehicle designed to meet the new 2016 Euro NCAP five-star occupant and pedestrian protection standards.” Copyright PUNCH.

      "title": "BaT Auction: 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback",
      "text": "Advertise on BaT \nThis 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback was built as a GT350R tribute in 2005 and has been with the seller for two years. This example started as a non-GT A-code model and was modified by a former Ford parts manager for road and occasional track use. The car is finished in Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue stripes and features Torque Thrust-style wheels, riveted aluminum rear quarter windows, fiberglass hood/front apron, and plexiglass rear window. Cabin updates include a wood steering wheel, GT350R-style gauge cluster, rear deck-mounted spare, and a roll bar. The balanced and blueprinted 302 V8 uses a Mexico block, high-performance internals, tall Cobra valve covers, and a Cobra oil pan. The 4-speed Toploader transmission is equipped with a high performance clutch and sends power to a heavy duty Ford 9″ rear end. Brakes are Kelsey Hayes discs up front and 11″ drums in the rear. The car was recently serviced and is reported to have no current mechanical issues. It is sold with some service records and a clean North Carolina title. \n\nThis 350R tribute was executed using period photography, and the reported build objective was a drivable car that could occasionally be tracked. The Wimbledon White is a full body repaint and appears to have been completed to high standard, with no obvious traces of the original Rangoon Red. \nBody panels appear straight and shut lines are typical of the period, with some unevenness in fit to both the hood and trunk. No damage repairs or filler cracking are noted, and the seller reports no body rust is present. A few paint blemishes are visible, including a short scratch to the top of the driver-side fender and a chip to the passenger-side rear fender just right of the taillight. \nThe car rides on 15″ Torque Thrust-style mag wheels with gray spokes and brushed alloy rims, showing a few scratches but no loss of finish or curb rash. Yokohama’s AVS ES100 rubber is mounted at all four corners. \nBadging includes standard GT350 decals on the rocker panels and the single Peter Brock-designed badge on the rear fascia. Adding to period look is a decal for Carroll Shelby’s Terlingua Racing Team. The B-Production class decal just aft of the doors is a nod to the SCCA race heritage of these cars. \n1965 GT350s had a full-size spare mounted to the rear deck in place of a rear seat, helping to satisfy the 2-seater requirement to race as a “sports car” under SCCA regulations. The spare wheel carries a BF Goodrich tire that appears to be new. \nMany 1965 GTs had the battery relocated to the trunk for better weight distribution. The trunk-mounted fuel filler features a spin-on cap instead of the Monza-type and sits in a metal splash bowl designed to keep any excess fuel from being spilled into the trunk. \nThe black vinyl interior appears to be in good condition, with light wear and scuffing to seating and door panels. A black painted roll bar has been added and multi-point race belts are visible behind the seats. No signs of the original red paint show around the door openings. \nThe VDO gauge cluster is a great look and a slotted wood-rimmed steering wheel has been added, though no center emblem or horn push is fitted. A Hurst shifter with classic white knob ties to the uprated 4-speed manual. Floor mats in the foot wells are solid but showing some discoloration. \nThe replacement 302 V8 uses an NOS Mexico block, high-performance internals, tall Cobra valve covers, and a Cobra oil pan. Said to have been balanced and blueprinted as part of the 2005 build, the engine has not been tested for power by the seller, though it is described as running well. \nUnderbody photos show no leaks, seeps, or fluid accumulation in evidence. Light surface corrosion is visible on exhaust tubing, edges of the leaf springs, and other suspension components. Reported drivetrain upgrades include a 4-speed Toploader transmission, high performance clutch, and heavy duty Ford 9″ rear end with 3:89 axle ratio. \nThe uprated suspension benefits from a larger front sway bar, rear traction bars, and Koni shocks, and race springs all around. Stopping power now comes from Kelsey Hayes discs in front and 11″ drums in the rear.

      "text": "Provided \nUAW Local 551, which represents workers at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant in Hegewisch, delivered turkeys to a church Monday in Hammond for distribution to families in need. \nHAMMOND — A Hammond congregation received a gift of about 100 turkeys plus fixings Monday morning as part of a union's effort to support communities in the area through its annual turkey drive. \nUnited Auto Workers Local 551 delivered the turkeys Monday morning to Greater Works Deliverance Ministries, 5125 Hohman Ave. \nPastor Jose Ruiz said the union has provided the church with turkeys to hand out for the past several years. He said he has been told the church also will receive clothing and toys to pass out to those in need this Christmas. \n\"They have been awesome,\" he said of the union. \nEach turkey came with side dishes including mashed potatoes, canned corn, canned green beans, cornbread muffins and cranberry sauce. \n\"We are once again very excited to reach out to our local community with our annual turkey drive,\" said UAW Local 551 President Chris Pena. \nThe union represents workers at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant on 126th Street and Torrence Avenue in Hegewisch. In all, the union is donating 500 turkeys plus fixings to nonprofit organizations, churches and community shelters throughout the greater Chicago area and Northwest Indiana. \nRuiz said the number of people needing holiday meals has been growing. While the church was able to provide turkey and fixings to about 125 families this year, Ruiz said they had to turn some families away. \nThe church also provided hot meals to another 100 to 110 families on Sunday. \nIn addition to the turkeys provided to the Hammond church Monday, the union provided another 100 turkeys and fixings to Restoration Ministries, Inc., in Harvey.",

      "text": "ford mustang news rumors specs performance More The sixth-generation Ford Mustang will receive a series of mechanical and visual updates for the 2018 model year. The Blue Oval is remaining tight-lipped about what the future holds, but leaked documents uncovered by ‘Stang enthusiasts give us a better idea of what to expect.\nThe biggest change to the Mustang lineup for 2018 is that the V6 engine will no longer be available, according to website Mustang6G . The naturally aspirated 3.7-liter six develops 300 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 280 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm. It’s overshadowed by the turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder, a unit that develops 310 horses and 320 pound-feet of twist.\nThe decision to deep-six the V6 will upset some Mustang enthusiasts. Those who don’t like the idea of a pony car with a turbo four under the hood will need to step up to the GT model, which will continue to offer a powerful V8. The Shelby GT350 is expected to stick around for at least one additional model year, and earlier rumors claim the range-topping GT500 will return with up to 800 horsepower on tap. Dodge’s vaunted Challenger Hellcat might not be the most powerful muscle car on the block for long.\nMore: Looking back at five models that made the Ford Mustang the icon it is today\nFord will expand the list of extra-cost options with a 10-speed automatic transmission, a dual exhaust system with four exhaust tips, and an adaptive suspension named MagneRide borrowed from aforementioned GT350. The leaked documents also reveal the launch of a new option package named Performance Package 2, though they don’t shed insight into what it includes. Mustang6G believes it will include track-sourced components needed to help the Mustang fight head-to-head against the Chevrolet Camaro 1LE .\nAs is typically the case, the mechanical upgrades will be joined by a handful of visual tweaks. Expect the redesign to include new lights and redesigned bumpers on both ends, new-look alloy wheels, and two additional paint colors named orange fury and royal crimson, respectively.\nThe 2018 Ford Mustang could debut either in January during the Detroit Auto Show or in April at the New York Auto Show. It will go on sale shortly after its official introduction.\nLooking back at five models that made the Ford Mustang the icon it is today Ford launches performance upgrades to muscle-up the Mustang GT, EcoBoost Hennessey Performance works its magic on the Ford Focus RS",

They will also be used to move the 7,000 tons of salt currently in storage. \nNormally, the city needs about 5,000 tons of salt every winter season, but because of last year's mild winter, they only needed to buy 2,000 tons of salt. \nPublic Works officials also want to remind drivers to give these trucks plenty of space on the road when they are out at work, to avoid any future accidents. 41.506700 -90.515134 ",

      "text": "  \nIt’s a magical time, isn’t it? Here is a hatchback with 350 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Here is an all-wheel-drive system capable of adjusting power distribution rearward and side to side. Here, from a major automaker with an appropriately sized legal department, is a button that if you press it enough times, the word “drift” appears on the center display. \nActual functionality of Drift mode aside (spoiler alert: it’s OK), its existence speaks volumes of Ford’s mindset. This 113-year-old automaker has just won Le Mans with a successor to the GT40, from which a production variant will soon be on public streets. It produces a Mustang with a unique flat-plane-crank V-8 and carbon-fiber wheels that took second place in our 2016 Best Driver’s Car competition . (It lost to the vastly more powerful, more expensive, and more carbon-fibered McLaren 570S.) And here’s an all-wheel-drive four-door Focus with a Drift mode. \nA huge wing on the back of the roof and black 19-inch wheels further ensure the absence of subtly on the RS. The exhaust pops and burbles, seemingly in effort of emulating rally cars at the staging lights. The color is called Nitrous Blue, for crying out loud! \nRead more on the Focus RS from 2017 Car of the Year testing HERE . \nHow does it scamper away from stop, err, staging lights? All-wheel drive plus a rapid, full-throttle clutch dump nets 0–60 in 4.5 seconds and a quarter-mile pass of 13.3 seconds at 103.3 mph. This process also ensures cringes from the test driver, as the brunt of all that power is forced upon the poor driveline—don’t do this too frequently at home, kids. \nNow we have to talk about tires. Our test car came with optional Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s, an extreme racetrack-orientated tire that’s available on track-ready cars such as the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Porsche 911 GT3 RS. They amplify all test numbers, from aforementioned longitudinal acceleration to the 1.02 lateral g average on the skidpad and the 104-foot stopping distance from 60 mph. The Focus RS’ 24.0-second figure-eight time is in the realm of the BMW M3 and M4. \nThe tires are the primary contributor to these performance results, although the all-wheel-drive system helps, too. Because the system can route power rearward and side to side, adding to the gas pedal can adjust the pitch and balance of the car midcorner. When you’re ready to come out of the corner, you hit the gas harder. The nose tucks, and you exit faster than anticipated. \nSounds fun, right? It is until you put the Focus RS in Track mode. At that point the dampers turn into pogo sticks, and the hatchback starts bouncing up and down like an excited Boston terrier. It isn’t like a rough ride that you’d ignore in a sports car, but an unbelievable and constant vertical shake, as if riding a sine wave. It happens both midcorner and on the straights, no matter how smooth the pavement. It’s enough to unsettle the car when you have it loaded up in a corner. \nSwitching to Drift mode nearly eliminates the shaking. It also has the benefit of dramatically increasing oversteer. You see, “drift” is a misnomer here, as the Focus RS doesn’t do the real power-on oversteer like a good old-fashioned rear-drive car does. Ain’t physics tough? Instead, the rear becomes more playful and neutral, allowing you to induce some slide into a corner. But if you try to keep doing this for too long, the tires bite and you start understeering. Drive it tidy, though, and the looseness is enjoyable, if certainly slower. We also worry about long-term use of this system at track speeds due to the continual clutch work the system must be doing. \nAlthough drift mode is a small disappointment in practice even if its existence in a four-door hatchback wins our nonofficial Corporate Subversive of the Year award, it’s the vertical pogoing effect with the Cup tires that we find unacceptable. We suspect the standard tires will eliminate this phenomenon. It would be worth it even at the expense of the amazing performance numbers our test car generated. \nThis is truly disappointing because the Focus RS’ fundamentals are solid: from chassis to steering response, you feel an unyielding sense of terrific agility. Eliminate the pogo-stick bounce, and the Focus RS will reframe your perception of previous all-wheel-drive sport compacts, such as the Subaru WRX STI and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. It’s much, much faster and more fun to drive. \nThe biggest problem becomes price. From a pure performance standpoint, the Focus RS gets uncomfortably close to better driving rear-drive coupes that are faster and capable of real honest-to-goodness drifts without the need of special modes. With a base price of $36,775, the Focus RS equals that of a Mustang GT with the optional Performance pack and Recaro bucket seats. When loaded with options, the Focus RS gets close in price to the vastly superior-handling and faster Chevrolet Camaro SS 1LE. The hatchback and four doors make the car more livable for a single-car family, but there are better-performing and better-riding cars available for $42,245. 2016 Ford Focus RS",

      "text": "Ford One-Ups Chevy with Largest Flag Record 2017 Super Duty Officially Sets Guinness Record   5 Photos The Ford versus Chevy rivalry is nearly as old as the automobile itself. And nowhere is that rivalry more heated and competitive than in trucks. While all the current fullsize truck models are very close in terms of capability, that doesn’t stop the brands from symbolic one-upmanship. In the latest round of the Ford versus Chevy battle, Ford claims the victory for the largest American flag towed behind a truck. The previous record was set by the 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD at the Texas Motor Speedway in September . That flag was 40 by 80 feet. The flag towed by the 2017 Ford F-450 Super Duty was 45 by 92 feet -- or a massive 4,124 square feet, larger than the average American home by a substantial margin. Photo 2/5 | Ford Giant Flag Unfurling In order to qualify for the record books, the flag could not touch the ground for more than 100 yards or 328 feet. The truck exceeded that record by 32 feet and, just to rub it in little more, took four victory laps around the Homestead-Miami Speedway’s 1.5-mile track. To pull off this patriotic feat, a team of 20 was required to unfurl the flag and prepare the 45-foot rigging to ensure the flag did not touch the ground. The display was repeated at the Ford EcoBoost 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship earlier this week. In an ironic twist, Jimmie Johnson won the race driving -- you guessed it -- a Chevrolet.

      "title": "#TrumpEffect: Ford Plant Not Moving to Mexico",
      "text": "Andrew Anglin\nDaily Stormer\nNovember 19, 2016\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nThe Jewish media is acting now like this somehow didn’t happen.\nThe most dishonest people.\nBloomberg :\nUnited Auto Workers leaders huddled with Ford Motor Co. executives today after the union was caught off guard by President-elect Donald Trump’s tweet last night he helped prevent another Ford model from going to Mexico.\nWhile the union is pleased Ford has now committed to continue building the Lincoln MKC small sport utility vehicle at a Kentucky factory, Trump’s tweets had suggested that the entire Louisville Assembly Plant’s output was under threat of moving to Mexico. The MKC is built on the same assembly line as the Ford Escape, which outsells the Lincoln version by 12-to-1. More than 5,000 employees are working nearly around the clock on three crews to meet demand for the two SUVs, said Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville.\n…\nAfter Trump’s tweets, the company acknowledged for the first time it had been considering moving production of the MKC to Mexico, allowing the plant to boost output of the Escape, one of its hottest models. After talks between Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the president-elect, the automaker decided to keep building the MKC in Louisville after the UAW’s current contract expires in 2019.\n“We had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville Assembly Plant,” Christin Baker, a Ford spokeswoman, said in an e-mail, noting the UAW contract signed last year allowed for such a move. “Cuautitlan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC.”\nHenry Ford would approve of Donald Trump. He wanted his employees to be able to buy his cars.\nHe also hated the Jews .\nDonald Trump Ford 2016-11-19 Andrew Anglin",

      "text": "An all-new generation of the Ford Explorer has been spotted on test yet again, this time in Dearborn, Michigan. The heavy camouflage suggests that the 2019 model is still in its early development stage.\nHardcore fans of the Explorer might think of it as a disguised version of the current three-row model but underneath, the prototype is testing the new D6 platform. The latter is set to be the basis of both Ford and Lincoln vehicles.\nLike all major manufactures, Ford is developing the D6 platform in a way that it’s flexible enough to underpin different categories of vehicles. It's said its flexibility will allow for both front and rear-drive vehicles to be based off of it. There will of course be all-wheel drive models as well.\nRumors also suggest that the next-gen Explorer could go rear-wheel drive although these pictures do not show any sign of a rear axle. The Explorer is also set to get the latest EcoBoost engines, with a possible termination of the naturally aspirated V6.\nWe expect to see the next-gen Explorer early in 2018 at the Detroit Motor Show.",

      "text": "Pinterest Email \nIt’s one thing to go out and bash sand dunes in a relatively controlled desert environment. It’s another thing entirely to run the Baja 1000. After a down-to-the wire effort during the 49th SCORE International Baja 1000, the 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor can now claim it has done both.To complete the non-stop 854.5-mile desert race, you have to make it from the starting line to the finish line within 36 hours. The Foutz Motorsports Raptor made it in 35 hours, 59 minutes, 8.151 seconds. That’ll work! That time was good enough for third in class; Rod Hall claimed first in a Hummer, and Marc Van Tassell came in second in a Toyota Land Cruiser -- but so far as we know, only the Foutz crew drove their race truck home to California after the race wrapped. Foutz and the brand-new Raptor found success in the American “Best in the Desert” race series earlier this year . But the Baja 1000 has unparalleled name recognition; finishing this race means something to even the most casual of off-road fans. Making the run in a purpose-built machine is impressive. Doing it an essentially stock vehicle? That’s gonna sell some trucks.Not that Ford has every had trouble moving the Raptor, especially after a race-prepped version of the previous-generation truck had another successful Baja run in 2008. Baja Pits Sand Against Machine: Battling the Baja 1000 with the Honda Racing Ridgeline \nThe Baja 1000 is many things at once: a logistical nightmare, a multi-front war, a feat of endurance, a test of patience. It’s a modern-day Targa Florio charging down the freakish, 775-mile ... \nNote: We did say the new truck was “essentially stock.” The 3.5-liter turbocharged V6, ten-speed automatic transmission, frame and body are all factory-fresh, but to be race-legal, the Baja-prepped Raptor gets enhanced safety features, including a fuel cell, a roll cage and racing seats and harnesses, plus a Rigid Industries light bar (the race doesn’t stop once the sun goes down).Further, Fox Racing shocks and springs were, according to Ford, “revised” to reflect the weight added safety gear -- just how much, we don’t know -- but other than that, what you see (and don’t see) on this truck is said to be what you’ll get off the lot right down to the BF Goodrich T/A KO2 tires.On top of the durability of the frame and suspension, we’re particularly impressed that the Raptor’s stock air filter was able to feed the turbocharged 3.5-liter even in choking silt clouds. \nDid the truck’s driver-selectable “Baja mode,” which backs off the traction control, speeds up shifts and holds onto gears longer, help? Probably. \nAll in all, it’s enough to make the $50,115 entry price look downright reasonable. Though we don't expect to see many stock Raptors running side-by-side with trophy trucks going forward, the new models should continute to see action as prerunners -- the rugged and highly-capable (but usually road-legal) trucks used for scouting and race support. And Foutz Motorsports will even do all the prep work for you . \nShould you snag one, we beg you: Don’t let its newly demonstrated capability go to waste on the paved streets of suburbia.",

      "text": "Search for: Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions A Ford logo is pictured at a car dealership in Monterrey, Mexico, November 9, 2016. Picture taken November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril \nNovember 23, 2016 \nBy Bernie Woodall \nDETROIT (Reuters) – Automakers in the United States are ramping up holiday sales promotions ahead of Black Friday, aiming to clear out bulging inventories of unsold cars and dispel investor doubts about consumer demand. \nDetroit automakers need a strong year-end sales push. They are sitting on hefty inventories of unsold sedans, compact cars and sports cars as consumers shift to pickup trucks and SUVs. \nThe share prices of General Motors Co <GM.N>, Ford Motor Co <F.N> and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV <FCAU.N><FCHA.MI> are flat to down for the year. This reflects investor concerns that a six-year auto sales boom in the United States is reaching an end and that sustaining sales levels will require more aggressive price cutting. \n“We are seeing a tougher pricing environment, higher levels of discounts,” said Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields. He predicted November and December sales would be about the same as a year ago, when the annualized sales pace averaged about 17.9 million vehicles a year. \nFord kicked off its Black Friday sales promotions in early November, after reporting an 11.7 percent drop in October sales. \nRivals have since followed suit. GM’s GMC truck brand is promoting “Black Friday All Month Long” with discounts of as much as 20 percent off list prices for pickup trucks. \nLuxury automakers usually join the fray in December. Toyota Motor Corp’s <7203.T> Lexus brand began touting its annual “December to Remember” deals ahead of Thanksgiving weekend, offering 0.9 percent, five-year loans or $1,000 off on its compact IS 300 sedan in certain markets. \nGM this week began offering markdowns on the Chevrolet Corvette sports car through retailer Costco Wholesale Corp’s <COST.O> car-buying club, the first time the Corvette has been offered through the discount retailer’s car buying service. \nAt the start of the month, there were 122 days of Corvette inventory, up 51 percent from a year earlier and nearly double the level automakers consider ideal, according to Automotive News data. \nLike other retailers, automakers use holiday-themed promotions to boost sales during the final two months of the year, and like Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>, Target Corp <TGT.N> and Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>, automakers have steadily expanded the Christmas season over the past several years. \nGOING GLOBAL \nThe concept of winter holiday sales is going global. Black Friday car deals came to Britain about six years ago. In China, automotive marketers target customers on Singles Day, Nov. 11, led by Alibaba Group Holding <BABA.N>. \nSingles Day has become the largest shopping day of the year as Alibaba encourages vendors on its sites to offer heavy discounts on items from cars to clothing. \nAutomakers in the U.S. market will report November sales on Dec. 1, and analysts expect an increase in total U.S. auto sales from a year ago. The annualized sales pace could drop, however, to 17.9 million vehicles, according to J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. A year ago, the annualized selling rate for November was 18.25 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. \nA factor working in the automakers’ favor is the advanced age, 11.6 years on average, of the U.S. fleet of 264 million vehicles. \nIt is unclear to what extent automakers will offer deeper discounts overall in the coming weeks or repackage existing deals with holiday bows. \nJ.D. Power data on new-vehicle discounts provided to Reuters shows that on average GM discounts grew 1 percent in October from a month earlier, to $4,700 per vehicle, while Ford’s average discount fell 10.6 percent to about $4,400 per vehicle. Fiat Chrysler’s October discounts were flat at $4,920 in October from September, according to J.D. Power. But the company offered $7,800 or more off its top-seller, the Ram 1500 pickup truck. \n“Incentive levels are near record highs as a percentage of the selling price,” said Jeff Schuster, lead forecaster for LMC Automotive, an automotive consultancy. \nAt the same time, Detroit automakers are cutting production. Both GM and Ford recently announced production cuts. GM announced indefinite layoffs for 2,000 workers at two U.S. factories that build various car models. Ford ordered temporary layoffs. \n(Additional reporting by Alexandria Sage in Los Angeles, Catherine Cadell in Beijing and Costas Pitas in London; Editing by Cynthia Ostermanand Jonathan Oatis)",

      "text": "  What Investors Need to Know About Ford's Earnings Profit plunges in 3rd quarter, but company remains on track to achieve full-year guidance   F +0% \nFord Motor ’s ( NYSE:F ) third-quarter results failed to impress investors with profits dropping 55% to $1 billion. This is a reflection of weak auto sales in the U.S. in August and September. \nA decline was apparent as the company posted its best third-quarter results in the year-ago quarter by registering a profit of $2.2 billion. Ford made 26 cents per share this quarter in comparison to last year’s third quarter when it earned 45 cents per share. Here’s a brief look at the Blue Oval’s quarterly performance. \nA bird’s eye view \nFord recorded quarterly revenue of $35.94 billion, a decline of 6% compared with last year, and generated profit of $1 billion. \nFord posted a profit of $1.26 billion in North America before interest and tax. However, the company’s operating profit margin plunged to 8.4%. It recorded a strong performance in the Asia Pacific region where it earned $131 million.   F \nEurope was a bright spot for the company as it recorded its best third-quarter profits since 2007. The pretax profit in the region was $138 million. In contrast, the company faced a loss of $295 million in South America. \nChief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Ford registered negative cash flow of $2 billion but should bounce back in the fourth quarter. What actually brought down Ford’s earnings were the launch costs of the Super Duty and the supply issues. The company might face higher costs in the near future. Its operations in North America, the Middle East and Africa were not profitable. \nShanks said the third quarter and year to date metrics for the company were lower. He explains the key reason behind the fall was “the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging.” The drop in revenue is attributable to the decline in sales volume as well as the unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency. The company’s share of the market also fell. As far as the seasonally adjusted annualized rate is concerned, South America was down 10% to 400,000 cars and vehicles. This was on account of Ford’s disappointing performance in Brazil. \nLooking ahead \nDuring the earnings call conference, Marks Fields said that the company has reported strong results so far in the first three quarter of the fiscal. The company is confident of achieving its full-year guidance on adjusted pretax profit, which is expected to come in around $10.2 billion. This would be the second-best results since 2000. Though profit for the third quarter was lower than the prior year, it came in better than expected. \nThe Blue Oval successfully introduced the all-new Super Duty and the Lincoln Continental in its home market. The company also is working out its strategy to address the challenges including stagnating sales in the U.S. retail market, insecurity in Europe after Brexit and the increasing spending on incentives in the U.S. \nFord’s cash flow for the first nine months of the year continues to be a strong point for the company.

Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy. \nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump’s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, “We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.” \nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal. \nFord’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars. \nAnd then hours later, Donald Trump tweeted… \nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J.

Here is a hatchback with 350 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Here is an all-wheel-drive system capable of adjusting power distribution rearward and side to side. Here, from a major automaker with an appropriately sized legal department, is a button that if you press it enough times, the word \"drift\" appears on the center display.\nResearch 2016 ford focus See Full Specs See Pricing Actual functionality of Drift mode aside (spoiler alert: it's OK), its existence speaks volumes of Ford's mindset. This 113-year-old automaker has just won Le Mans with a successor to the GT40, from which a production variant will soon be on public streets. It produces a Mustang with a unique flat-plane-crank V-8 and carbon-fiber wheels that took second place in our 2016 Best Driver's Car competition . (It lost to the vastly more powerful, more expensive, and more carbon-fibered McLaren 570S.) And here's an all-wheel-drive four-door Focus with a Drift mode.\nA huge wing on the back of the roof and black 19-inch wheels further ensure the absence of subtly on the RS. The exhaust pops and burbles, seemingly in effort of emulating rally cars at the staging lights. The color is called Nitrous Blue, for crying out loud!\nRelated Video: Driving with The Stig in the Ford Focus RS\nClick to expand Replay Video Will cars of the future be opened by selfies?

All-wheel drive plus a rapid, full-throttle clutch dump nets 060 in 4.5 seconds and a quarter-mile pass of 13.3 seconds at 103.3 mph. This process also ensures cringes from the test driver, as the brunt of all that power is forced upon the poor driveline—don't do this too frequently at home, kids.\nNow we have to talk about tires. Our test car came with optional Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s, an extreme racetrack-orientated tire that's available on track-ready cars such as the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and Porsche 911 GT3 RS. They amplify all test numbers, from aforementioned longitudinal acceleration to the 1.02 lateral g average on the skidpad and the 104-foot stopping distance from 60 mph. The Focus RS' 24.0-second figure-eight time is in the realm of the BMW M3 and M4.\nFind a Ford Focus near you\n© Motor Trend Staff 2016 Ford Focus RS front side in motion The tires are the primary contributor to these performance results, although the all-wheel-drive system helps, too. Because the system can route power rearward and side to side, adding to the gas pedal can adjust the pitch and balance of the car midcorner. When you're ready to come out of the corner, you hit the gas harder. The nose tucks, and you exit faster than anticipated.\nSounds fun, right? It is until you put the Focus RS in Track mode. At that point the dampers turn into pogo sticks, and the hatchback starts bouncing up and down like an excited Boston terrier. It isn't like a rough ride that you'd ignore in a sports car, but an unbelievable and constant vertical shake, as if riding a sine wave. It happens both midcorner and on the straights, no matter how smooth the pavement. It's enough to unsettle the car when you have it loaded up in a corner.\nSwitching to Drift mode nearly eliminates the shaking. It also has the benefit of dramatically increasing oversteer. You see, \"drift\" is a misnomer here, as the Focus RS doesn't do the real power-on oversteer like a good old-fashioned rear-drive car does. Ain't physics tough? Instead, the rear becomes more playful and neutral, allowing you to induce some slide into a corner. But if you try to keep doing this for too long, the tires bite and you start understeering. Drive it tidy, though, and the looseness is enjoyable, if certainly slower. We also worry about long-term use of this system at track speeds due to the continual clutch work the system must be doing.\nAlthough drift mode is a small disappointment in practice even if its existence in a four-door hatchback wins our nonofficial Corporate Subversive of the Year award, it's the vertical pogoing effect with the Cup tires that we find unacceptable. We suspect the standard tires will eliminate this phenomenon. It would be worth it even at the expense of the amazing performance numbers our test car generated.\nThis is truly disappointing because the Focus RS' fundamentals are solid: from chassis to steering response, you feel an unyielding sense of terrific agility. Eliminate the pogo-stick bounce, and the Focus RS will reframe your perception of previous all-wheel-drive sport compacts, such as the Subaru WRX STI and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. It's much, much faster and more fun to drive.\nThe biggest problem becomes price. From a pure performance standpoint, the Focus RS gets uncomfortably close to better driving rear-drive coupes that are faster and capable of real honest-to-goodness drifts without the need of special modes. With a base price of $36,775, the Focus RS equals that of a Mustang GT with the optional Performance pack and Recaro bucket seats. When loaded with options, the Focus RS gets close in price to the vastly superior-handling and faster Chevrolet Camaro SS 1LE. The hatchback and four doors make the car more livable for a single-car family, but there are better-performing and better-riding cars available for $42,245.\n2016 Ford Focus RS BASE PRICE $36,775 PRICE AS TESTED $42,245 VEHICLE LAYOUT Front-engine, AWD, 5-pass, 4-door hatchback ENGINE 2.3L/350-hp/350-lb-ft turbo DOHC 16-valve I-4 TRANSMISSION 6-speed manual CURB WEIGHT (F/R DIST) 3,417 lb (59/41%) WHEELBASE 104.3 in LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT 172.8 x 71.8 x 58.0 in 0-60 MPH 4.5 sec QUARTER MILE 13.3 sec @ 103.3 mph BRAKING, 60-0 MPH 104 ft LATERAL ACCELERATION 1.02 g (avg) MT FIGURE EIGHT 24.0 sec @ 0.81 g (avg) REAL MPG, CITY/HWY/COMB Not tested EPA CITY/HWY/COMB FUEL ECON 19/25/22 mpg ENERGY CONS, CITY/HWY 177/135 kW-hrs/100 miles CO2 EMISSIONS, COMB 0.91 lb/mile Follow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "comments \nA rare baseball signed by Henry Ford found in a New Jersey attic is back in the Ford family â sort of. A baseball autographed by Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford. It sold for $15,038.08 at a Lelands auction last month. Lelands.com \nBelieved to be the only baseball in existence signed by the founder of Ford Motor Company, it has been purchased by a Las Vegas Ford dealer , according to Forbes.com. \nGary Ackerman, a third-generation dealer, paid $15,038 for the baseball at a Lelands auction, the report said. The auction took place Oct. 28, Lelands said on its website. There were 16 bids . \nThe ball was discovered in a box stashed in an attic by a New Jersey couple and was brought to the National Sports Collectors Convention in Atlantic City in August. \nThe couple has chosen to remain anonymous. The wife said a friend gave her the ball years ago and it was largely forgotten until the couple cleaned out the attic for a yard sale. They said they came close to offering it at the yard sale or throwing it out. \nThe ball, which is custom imprinted with the words \"Ford Safety Glass Exhibit 1903-1933,\" is also signed by race car driver Ralph DiPalma and several Ford engineers. \nCurrent Ford executive chairman William Clay Ford Jr., a great-grandson of Henry Ford, is a graduate of Princeton University. \nJeff Goldman may be reached at .

Photo by Ford \nWhen Radio Flyer unveiled its Tesla Model S for Kids , I thought it was pretty advanced for a kid's toy. Now, Ford and Power Wheels teamed up for a new ride-on Mustang , and it blows the Tesla out of the water. \nAvailable in blue or pink, Fisher Price used actual Ford design data when it built this new Power Wheels. Its top speed is 5 mph, one less than the Radio Flyer Tesla, but with a retail price of $359.99, it's more than $100 cheaper. \nIt packs a computer-controlled powertrain called Smart Drive, which will likely make its way to other Power Wheels models in the future. It packs traction control, adjusting motor speeds after detecting wheel slip. If it's in danger of rolling over, it can cut power, too. The speed control is set with a backlit LED touchscreen, as well. \nJust like the Radio Flyer Tesla, there's an auxiliary input that connects to a speaker, so kids can crank Drake or Veggie Tales or whatever the youth listens to nowadays. There's also a second sound system that pipes out real Mustang engine notes in response to vehicle speed. The Radio Flyer Tesla doesn't have engine noises. Although, I guess it kind of does, considering the big-boy Model S is entirely silent, as well. \nThe Power Wheels Smart Drive Mustang hits retailers in December, which is just enough time for your kid to learn about its existence and incessantly beg you to buy one.

      "text": "Robots work on Ford F-150 trucks at a factory in Norfolk, Va. The plant was closed in 2007. (Ford Photo) Six months ago, computer scientist Moshe Vardi felt as if he was a voice crying in the wilderness when it came to automation’s anticipated effect on the job market. No political candidate, it seemed, was talking about the potential impact of autonomous cars and automated manufacturing on future employment.\nToday, the topic still isn’t quite on President-elect Donald Trump’s radar screen. But his election has gotten a lot more experts talking about the issue.\n“It went from being somewhat esoteric to being practically mainstream,” Rice University’s Vardi told GeekWire.\nSince the election, Trump has put jobs front and center on his agenda.\n“Whether it’s producing steel, building cars or curing disease, I want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here, in our great homeland, America, creating wealth and jobs for American workers,” he said this week in a YouTube video.\nBut Trump’s prescription focuses on renegotiating (or withdrawing from) trade deals, doubling down on fossil-fuel sources, cutting back on regulations and cracking down on work visas.\nEven if Trump and congressional leaders follow through on those initiatives, they won’t address what Vardi and other analysts say is a fundamental shift that will transform the very nature of work in the decades to come: the rise of robotics and artificial intelligence.\n“Winter is coming,” Vardi said. “I think stopping technology will be very difficult, but we need to deal with the implications for the labor force. One of the things that’s clear, which was not clear six months ago, is the political consequences of not doing anything.”\nThe frustrations of dislocated manufacturing workers in America’s Rust Belt were seen as the key to Trump’s narrow victory in the presidential election. Many of those workers are now hoping that Trump’s policies will bring more of America’s manufacturing base back from other shores. That could happen, but Vardi said next-generation factories seem set to create far fewer jobs.\nU.S. manufacturing employment has been falling for several decades , even though U.S. manufacturing output is nearing an all-time high . And the robotic revolution is just about to disrupt another large employment sector, transportation, thanks to the development of self-driving cars and trucks.\nBy 2050, Vardi projects that half of the world’s population will be out of the labor force by the year 2050.\nOthers take a different perspective: In a collection of analyses published just as the presidential primary season was getting under way, a group known as Innovation for Jobs, or I4J , argues that the disruption in employment could force the development of a “people-centered, rather than a task-centered, economy.”\nThe I4J group – which includes Google executive Vinton Cerf, widely known as one of the fathers of the Internet – foresees an age when smartphones and distributed work environments can knit together a flexible, versatile work force.\n“The problem is not too much automation or innovation; the problem is that we are trying to run the new economy in the old way,” Cerf and his colleagues write in their book, “Disrupting Unemployment.” \nIn any case, researchers who study the effects of technology on employment are coming around to the view that the transition from the old to the new economy will require strategies that aren’t yet in the traditional policy playbook.\n“Now, what is a job? A job is actually a bundle of tasks,” Vardi said. Current trends suggest that many of today’s traditional jobs will be unbundled, with some tasks given over to machines and other tasks turned into gigs for humans.\nEconomic analysts are looking into several strategies to response to the trends:\nCreating ‘flexicurity’ for workers: This European-style approach gives governments and their social partners more responsibility for retraining workers and providing an employment safety net. Offering a universal basic income: Some conservatives as well as progressives have favored the idea of folding unemployment payments, welfare, Social Security and other parts of the traditional safety net into one program that would provide a baseline payment to all citizens, whether or not they work. It’s not clear whether such ideas will gain traction during the next four years, but Vardi said there’ll eventually have to be a paradigm shift in employment policy.\n“To me, the biggest part is a moral imperative,” he said. “And also, the economic imperative will be unstoppable.”\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "title": "Ford showcases SUV prowess at Philippines Adventure Experience - CarWale News - CarWale",
      "text": "Ford India recently flew us to the Philippines to experience their Asia-Pacific line up of SUVs. With SUVs being the fastest growing category globally, Ford added that this segment is expected to grow over 40 per cent by the year 2020.\nFord has been designing SUVs for over 50 years and its experience in the segment has helped them master the design and engineering of these vehicles, the way their customers want them. Nima Nourian, exterior design manager, Ford Asia Pacific and Africa said, “Over the past 50 years, Ford has built up a wealth of knowledge about what SUV customers are looking for. At its heart, the Ford SUV is both capable and versatile, and design plays a major role in communicating that message.”\nFord believes that SUVs evoke emotions. So, if they look capable, it is easier for customers to connect with them and imagine the possibilities the vehicles offer. They want an SUV that can look like it can go anywhere and do anything. While the SUV segment continues to grow, Ford expects design to become more important as they continuously look at alternatives to distinguish themselves from their competitors.\nIt is through design that Ford engineers portray the vehicle’s sense of strength and robustness, and after decades of designing class leading utility vehicles, Ford believes they know exactly what it takes to make an SUV appear as capable as it actually is. The increased ground clearance, raised driver position and more aggressive approach and departure angles are all classic hallmarks of Ford SUV DNA.\nHowever, these vehicles also need to be versatile to meet the needs of modern buyers who will be using the same vehicle to take the kids to school, drive to work, and then escape to the countryside over the weekend. Today, Ford offers SUVs with car like dynamics with space for modern lifestyles. So while the company offers rugged models with go-anywhere ability like the Endeavour (or Everest), they also have sporty models designed for urban lifestyles like the Ford Escape (Kuga).\nFord’s SUV experience in Philippines, was designed to help us experience the variety and the diversity of their Asia-Pacific SUV fleet, and to demonstrate that the company offers an SUV for every customer need in response to the growing demand. They reiterated that we were going to experience the two days in different SUVs through the eyes of the customer.\nIn other words, we were going to live the life of an urban commuter running errands in an EcoSport, the life of luxury in an Explorer which included a trip to a resort, escape the city with an out-door adventure in the Ford Escape (Kuga), and drive up the Mount Pinatubo in the Lahar beds in the Ford Endeavour.\nWe will soon serve you the details of this Ford SUV experience with the EcoSport, Escape, Explorer and Endeavour. So stay tuned.",

      "text": "  1:56 pm Fisher Price and Ford have introduced the most advanced Power Wheels ride-on toy yet, the Smart Drive Mustang.Designed as a kid-size replica of the V8-powered Mustang GT, the new Smart Drive edition boasts an advanced computer-controlled powertrain that takes inspiration from traction- and stability-control systems in modern full-size vehicles.The system monitors for wheel slip and adjust motor speeds to keep the car moving over wet grass or bumpy terrain. If the driver gets a bit too adventurous on steep includes, a tilt sensor will cut power to the motors to prevent the child's first rollover accident.Parents can use an LED touch interface to set the maximum top speed, ranging from 1 mph to a brisk 5 mph. The motor controllers have also been improved for graduated throttle application, ramping speed up or down for fast starts and shorter stopping distances.Further sweetening the experience, the Smart Drive Mustang pipes engine sounds through the stereo system -- just like daddy's real EcoBoost Mustang . The exhaust note and music input from an auxiliary jack are played on the biggest speaker ever installed in a Fisher-Price product.After making its debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show, the car will arrive in December with a retail price of $360. \n ",

      "text": "— Nov 23, 2016 Sponsored Links \nThe Ford Mustang may be leading the overall sales race , but it’s easy to argue the sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro outperforms the Mustang in many ways. And it outperforms the Mustang in one key area: the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro SS 1LE . \nCurrently, Ford has nothing to match the Camaro 1LE directly, which is already approaching GT350 levels of performance for less money. That is going to change, according to Ford Authority . The latest report states Ford is readying a “Performance Pack 2” for the 2018 model year, which will be optional for the V8-powered pony. \nThis package is widely believed to be in response to the Camaro 1LE and could feature similar track-day appointments, such as stickier tires, revamped suspension and more. The current performance package offered for the Mustang features a Torsen differential with a 3.73:1 final drive ratio, 19-inch wheels with staggered Pirelli summer tires, a strut bar, front splitter and marginal brake upgrades. Still, it can’t catch the Camaro 1LE. \nSpecifics on this performance pack are unknown, but we do know the 2018 Ford Mustang will arrive with a freshened look , 10-speed automatic gearbox and MagneRide dampers. Do we foresee a rematch forthcoming? Yes, yes we do.

      "text": "2017 Ford F450 Super Duty Sets Flag Pull World Record 205 SHARES \nFord has claimed what has to arguably be one of the most American achievement possible in the Guinness Book. The 2017 F450 Super Duty is now the holder of the “World’s Largest Flag Pulled by a Moving Vehicle” record. This feet was accomplished in Florida at Homestead-Miami Speedway on the mile and a half long racetrack. \nWe’re not sure why the date of November 19th, 2016 was picked but it’s now one for Ford history. The upcoming model had to have a specially constructed frame built in its bed to haul the huge flag. The red, white, and blue spanned an impressive 4124 square feet of fabric. For a better sense of scale, it was 92 feet long by 45 feet wide as well as weighing about 145lbs. \nIn order to claim the record, the truck was required to travel at least 100 meters, or 328 feet, without the flag touching the ground. Official records show that it beat this record by 9 meters while following a pack of other Ford trucks. While this flag was heavy by flag standards, it’s nowhere near the 32,5000 pound towing capacity of this truck. \nThe 6.7L V8 turbo diesel Power Stroke under the hood was more than ready for the task. The base model of this pickup comes with 440 horsepower and 925 pound feet of torque. After the pull started, the flag unfurled from a starting team who kept it respectfully off the ground. When it was complete, certification of the achievement was handed over to the team of 20 who made it happen. \nThe setting of this Guinness World Record attempt was no mistake either. The Ford Championship Weekend takes place at Homestead-Miami Speedway. It also plays host to the Ford EcoBoost 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. \nWe have the video below because this is an interesting record to see being set with such a huge flag being towed. Let us know what you think of the record as well as Ford’s choice of vehicle to be the new title holder. Related Posts",

Sanchez Ford One-Ups Chevy with Largest Flag Record The Ford versus Chevy rivalry is nearly as old as the automobile itself. And nowhere is that rivalry more heated and competitive than in trucks. While all the current fullsize truck models are very close in terms of capability, that doesn’t stop the brands from symbolic one-upmanship. In the latest round of the Ford versus Chevy battle, Ford claims the victory for the largest American flag towed behind a truck. The previous record was set by the 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 3500 HD at the Texas Motor Speedway in September . That flag was 40 by 80 feet. The flag towed by the 2017 Ford F-450 Super Duty was 45 by 92 feet -- or a massive 4,124 square feet, larger than the average American home by a substantial margin.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Related Story: Ford vs Chevy: Which truck lineup performs better?\n© Truck Trend Network Staff Ford One Ups Chevy with Largest Flag Record In order to qualify for the record books, the flag could not touch the ground for more than 100 yards or 328 feet. The truck exceeded that record by 32 feet and, just to rub it in little more, took four victory laps around the Homestead-Miami Speedway’s 1.5-mile track. To pull off this patriotic feat, a team of 20 was required to unfurl the flag and prepare the 45-foot rigging to ensure the flag did not touch the ground. The display was repeated at the Ford EcoBoost 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship earlier this week. In an ironic twist, Jimmie Johnson won the race driving -- you guessed it -- a Chevrolet.\n© Truck Trend Network Staff Ford One Ups Chevy with Largest Flag Record Source: Ford\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Ford Fry Is Officially Expanding His Empire to Nashville Three restaurants for the Music City Ford Fry. Emily Schultz The rumors have been swirling for a while, and now it’s official: Ford Fry is opening a Nashville restaurant. Scratch that, the tireless empire builder is opening three Nashville restaurants. Fry will be a major player in the Music City’s Germantown neighborhood, he confirmed Wednesday . There’s no word on what, exactly, is in store, but the mega-restaurateur tells Eater Nashville seafood may be the name of the game: \"It will be three distinct spaces but will all work together with the majority being highly seafood-centric . I am always a fan of local music talent so I can also see a fun version of a ‘listening room/honky tonk.’ But whatever it is, it needs to be true and unique to Nashville.\" Fry previously floated the idea of expanding his Superica Tex-Mex concept to the city. After a relatively quiet 2016 — he’s opened just one restaurant, Superica Buckhead , this year — Fry appears to be ready for some new challenges. He opened five restaurants in 2015 alone: the original Superica in Krog Street Market, Marcel in Westside Provisions District, Bar Margot at the Four Seasons hotel in Midtown, BeetleCat in Inman Park’s Inman Quarter development, and State of Grace in Houston, his first expansion beyond the Atlanta market.",

(Photo by: Aaron J. / RedCarpetImages.net) \nFord Motor Company teamed up with several of Detroit’s home town champs to pass out more than 2,000 turkeys, fresh vegetables, canned goods and boxed foods for families in need this Thanksgiving season at Tarence Wheeler’s annual All Star Giveback. The event, which took place on November 22, 2016, was held at the River Rouge High School, in River Rouge, Michigan. The all-star event boasted several celebrities who volunteered their time to the worthy cause. Some of the celebrities included Multi-Platinum and Grammy Nominee Rapper Big Sean, female rapper Dej Loaf, former NBA Player Derrick Coleman, Hall of Fame Boxer Tommy “Hitman” Hearns and former Mayor of Detroit Dave Bing. 2016 marks the fourth year that Big Sean and the Sean Foundation have supported the giveaway. Tarence Wheeler and Tommy “Hitman” Hearns address the crowd \nThe All-Star Giveback and Tarence Wheeler Productions celebrated its 18 th year of giving back. Every year, families line up early to get a box of food and a turkey just in time for Thanksgiving. Celebrities could be seen passing out food, conversing, snapping pics and having a good time with the Detroit community. But the event is not about the “all-stars” says Wheeler, president and CEO of the All-Star Giveback LLC. “It’s called the All Star Giveback because every person is an all-star, from the janitor to the CEO. We start at 11am, but typically people start lining up around 7:30am, 8:00am in the morning because the need is so great.” \nAlso this year, Ford Motor Company joined the giveaway by providing reusable grocery totes and delivering food to community outreach programs like FOCUS: HOPE, in the Edge Sport. Rapper Big Sean posted up by the New Ford Edge Sport, which features three engines, and a 4-model lineup that includes SE, SEL, Titanium and Sport. \nTake a look at the photo gallery below to see some of the highlights from the commendable event.

      "title": "BaT Auction: 1953 Ford Prefect",
      "text": "Advertise on BaT This 1953 Ford Prefect is a right hand drive example powered by an 1172cc side-valve straight-four coupled to a 3-speed manual gearbox. This car is rare in the US and comes from the last year of the perpendicular body design that had remained virtually unchanged since 1938. Prior to the seller’s six year ownership, the car received a refurbishment of the paint, upholstery, and headliner. It has been driven just a few hundred miles over the last several years and the last service was under 100 miles ago. This Prefect is now being offered with a clean California title. History of the vehicle is unknown prior to 2010, though the shiny black exterior is a repaint. The finish shows well in pictures and is complimented by a red pinstripe. All chrome brightwork is said in good condition, and the front grill wears various Ford and Union Jack badges. Rubber seals appear to have been replaced during the refurbishment and trunk straps look solid. The side trafficators on both sides need to be connected to work. Wheels are thought to be factory and are in good condition with a color-matched center ring. Black vinyl seats were recovered before the seller’s purchase and have no rips or tears. The headliner was also replaced, and carpets are said to be well-kept. The dashboard looks to be in clean original condition. Note the manual crank in the middle of the dash for operating the wind-out front windshield. The front passenger window is broken but all other glass is stated to be in nice condition and working order. According to the seller, this E493A drives nicely and the 1172cc side-valve inline-four is smooth but takes some time to warm up. These engines were designed with no water pump, and instead relied on a thermo-siphon effect to cool, much like the older Model T’s. The seller acquired the car from a collector and has driven it locally and shown it. Maintenance has included oil changes, tune ups, and brake checks. All recent services have been completed by Dennis Tolley, a veteran San Diego British car specialist. Few records are included, but numerous period pamphlets and an owner’s manual are included in the sale. Photo Gallery",

I don’t know, I don’t think it’s that surprising.” \nSince some fans already referred to them as the couple “Carrison,” Fisher said she believed people had given at least some thought to the fact the pair were more than co-stars. \nShe has written about their months-long affair when she was 19 and he was a 33-year-old married father of two in her new book, “The Princess Diarist.” \nThe recollections come from diaries she recently found, which she said chronicled a difficult time for her. \n“It was sad, because I was so insecure,” Fisher said. “It’s very raw. Obviously I didn’t expect anyone — including myself — later on to read it.” \nAs for Ford, Fisher said she let him know that she was publishing her diaries detailing their affair. She doesn’t know if he has read the book, she said. \n“He’s incredibly private,” Fisher said. “I feel really bad about doing that.” ",

      "text": "Standing in his family's Orland Park garage, Alex Marneris beams over the 2005 Ford Mustang V6 that has been both a training vehicle and a catapult to national recognition in the field of automotive technology.\n\"I learned brakes on it, how to fix suspension, how to do diagnostics on it. This was the main tool I used,\" he said of the supercharged, track ready gray vehicle.\nMarneris, a Carl Sandburg graduate and a student at both Joliet Junior College and University of Illinois Chicago, recently took third in a national competition, making him one of five contenders for the chance to represent the United States in the 2017 WorldSkills Automobile Technology competition in Abu Dhabi, National Arab Emirates.\nThough he was not selected for the international event, he says he will root for the candidate who was chosen and he will set his sights on representing the U.S. in the 2019 competition in Russia.\n\"I have been so fortunate to be able to get this far,\" he said.\nSo far, the 20-year-old has amassed 13 medals earned in various state and national competitions and over 25 industry certifications.\nThe most prestigious of them is the third place award he earned at SkillsUSA in Louisville, Ky., in June, 2015. He was 18 at the time and it qualified him for the world competition, which takes place every two years.\nMarneris competed in that event at the high school level. His friend and former JJC classmate, Tom Hahn, a graduate of Stagg High School, took first place in the national event at the college level, becoming the first JJC student to win gold at a SkillsUSA contest. Hahn was not eligible for WorldSkills. He missed the maximum age requirement by two days. Now 24, he is currently a student at Southern Illinois University , where he is studying automotive engineering.\nCollege of Lake County receives grant to grow mechatronics program Emily K. Coleman Wauconda resident Pat Lincoln has two engineering degrees, but he still has trouble finding full-time work.\nHe keeps getting told he's overqualified, but he suspects his age may be more the issue. He's found that certifications sometimes carry more weight than years of experience.\nThat's why he's...\nWauconda resident Pat Lincoln has two engineering degrees, but he still has trouble finding full-time work.\nHe keeps getting told he's overqualified, but he suspects his age may be more the issue. He's found that certifications sometimes carry more weight than years of experience.\nThat's why he's...\n(Emily K. Coleman) Both SkillsUSA and WorldSkills promote excellence and advancement in vocational and technical skills in some 50 fields of study, including welding, baking, landscape gardening and cabinetmaking. Competitions are held at the high school and college levels.\nMore than 6,000 competitors vied for medals at this year's national event, Marneris said. In his category — automotive services — 50 high school and 25 college students competed.\n\"It was so humbling to take third,\" he said. \"It was an amazing moment to be standing up on stage to get that medal.\"\nBut it was hardly the first time he'd known the feeling. Marneris has a medal to show for every competition he's entered.\nMarneris' road to success began with a regional qualifying event, in which 250 students across Illinois competed. About 60 of those qualified for the state contest based on results of an exam of automotive knowledge. Marneris took first place in that contest.\nThe SkillsUSA Illinois competition consisted of 20 hands-on stations that required students to diagnose problems, take measurements, conduct tests and make repairs. They were judged according to Automotive Service Excellence standards.\nMarneris took first in that event as well.\nIn Louisville, the competition was among all 50 state winners.\nAt each competition, the contestants are put through a series of stations, at which they have a specific amount of time to complete a task. The higher the level of competition, the more complex the diagnostic tasks and the more advanced the vehicles.\nChris Komer, applied technology teacher at Sandburg, said Marneris' success is a testament to his work ethic.\n\"Alex worked really hard,\" Komer said. \"He met every day after school with (teacher) Ron Morris, who mentored him.\"\nMorris has since left District 230 for a job in North Carolina. But Komer said the staff at Sandburg is proud of how far Marneris has taken his skills.\n\"We've never had anybody be able to get as far as Alex did (at the high school level),\" Komer said. \"It's very gratifying. We show the kids the skills, but it's the student's commitment that takes it to the next level. Alex was really into it, put in the time and effort. That's what he wanted to do. He took the basic skills and knowledge he got here and applied them.\"\nMarneris said he still keeps in touch with Morris. \"He was the main person who made sure I was prepared and had everything I needed,\" Marneris said. \"He ensured my path to the podium.\"\nHe said he is grateful that both Sandburg and JJC, which he visited often during his high school years, were outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and caring teachers. In addition, he said Hahn, who is four years older, helped him considerably along the way.\nMarneris, who is studying automotive technology at JJC and biology at UIC , credits his dad, George Marneris, Sandburg's Morris and a former neighbor, Bob Alexander, with helping him not only find a passion but excel at it.\n\"It began with my dad's 1987 Porsche 928 S4. We took it on Sunday drives. It was a nice dark silver metallic, almost a gun metal gray with a nice cream, ivory interior,\" Marneris said. \"I loved that car. Unfortunately, he had to sell it because it couldn't be his daily drive.\"\nThen Alexander bought a 1983 Cobra.\n\"He was our best friend. He'd let me watch or help tinker with it. It was an amazing vehicle,\" Marneris said. \"Unfortunately, he passed away from cancer. It was a tough time, because I really loved that car and he was the man who made it. Unfortunately, his wife had to get rid of it because there was too much emotional attachment to it. I wish I could have bought it but at the time I didn't have the funds.\n\"That's what kind of drove me to go automotive. It was a way to say 'Thank you' to my neighbor and to my dad for kick starting this,\" he said.\nGeorge Marneris said: \"He's a champion to me. We spent many hours in this little garage. In that corner of tools. It was the most incredible time I had with him. It's emotional. Thirteen medals and counting and still he's driven to do this.\"\nMarneris's mom, Margaret Marneris, said her son displayed a knack for mechanics early on.\n\"When we first moved in here, we were doing some remodeling. He wanted to help remove the (electrical) cover plates. He was little. I said, 'No, no, no.' Then one day I came home and while my mom had been watching him, he'd removed every single cover plate,\" she said.\n\"He's one of those kids that when he sets his mind on something, he just goes for it,\" she said. \"I am very proud of him.\"\nMarneris said he was disappointed he wasn't chosen for WorldSkills 2017, but he already has his sights set on the next nationals and the next WorldSkills competitions.\n\"I love this weird little passion, tinkering with cars, figuring out what's wrong and fixing them,\" he said.\nThe hobby also has opened other doors, he said.\nNoticing the similarities between many automotive diagnostic tools and those used in the medical field, Marneris has opted to double major in both mechanics and biology, with the intent to become a doctor one day.\n\"I really like helping people, whether through medicine or mechanics,\" he said. \"That is my passion.\"\nTo learn more about WorldSkills 2017, go to www.worldskills.org/what/competitions/wsc2017/ \ndvickroy@tribpub.com \nTwitter @dvickroy \nCopyright © 2016, Daily Southtown High Schools University of Illinois at Chicago Southern Illinois University",

      "text": "WRZESNIA, Poland -- Volkswagen aims to grab a greater share of the lucrative segment for large cargo vans dominated by Ford Motor and Mercedes-Benz after investing around 800 million euros in a new manufacturing plant that marks a record for its light commercial vehicles division.\nThe new factory here is expected to build 100,000 units of its entirely redesigned Crafter annually when all body style derivatives are available in 2018. The Crafter will offer new features such as front-wheel drive and automatic transmission, both previously not offered. These should help to double the model's current volume according to VW managers.\nDemonstrating the importance of the model, both Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and Lower Saxony Premier Stephan Weil, two of VW's most important board directors, flew in to attend the opening ceremony late in October along with the CEO of Volkswagen Truck & Bus, Andreas Renschler.\nThe market for \"C/D Transporters,\" as VW calls large delivery vans with 3-6 tonnes of gross permissible weight, is over 1.3 million vehicles in size globally and growing thanks to the trend towards online shopping firms such as Amazon or Zalando in Germany. However VW mainly competes in the western European market which increased by 14 percent last year to nearly 500,000 units.\nWhile anything but sexy, it's a well-known axiom that the commercial vehicle business can be extremely profitable when run properly. Ford of Europe is market leader in the region with the Transit, earning a 4.9 percent pretax margin during the first nine months. Meanwhile, Opel/Vauxhall had long neglected the commercial van businesses and ended up breaking even during the same period -- and then only on an operating level and after adjusting for effects. Addressing this vulnerability has now become an \"fundamental element\" of the General Motors brand's 2022 growth strategy.\nThe risks however have never been higher for VW's van business, best known for building the Volkswagen Bus that became a pop culture icon during the Flower Power era of the 1960s.\nLike many automakers in this comparatively low-volume segment, VW had previously split the development costs by partnering up with a competitor. The outgoing Crafter was based on the Sprinter from Daimler's Mercedes-Benz unit and built by Mercedes. Daimler only supplied the 50,000 units annually that it was contractually obliged to do and in 2013 decided to end the partnership entirely to gain the extra capacity.\nPlatform risk \nMuch like the passenger car market though, larger vehicles are more lucrative than small ones. \"Mercedes' van business makes all its money with the Sprinter,\" said one VW commercial vehicles manager.\nVolkswagen took a risky bet by developing a platform solely for the Crafter which is technically incompatible with the rest of the 12-brand group's vehicle. No other vehicle in the entire product range comes equipped with axles capable of supporting the weight needed for the segment except for the heavy trucks sold by VW Group's MAN and Scania heavy truck brands.\nAdditionally the problem arose that none of the group's 130 manufacturing plants worldwide were adequate to build the Crafter given none had the required dimensions for assembling and painting a model such as the Crafter, which is 7.4 meters in length and three meters high. The paint shop has 12 swimming pool size tanks alone dedicated to various stages of cathodic immersion coating.\nAs a result, the 2.2 square kilometer size of its plant in Wrzesnia - roughly equivalent to 300 soccer fields - makes it the group's biggest factory for one single model.\n\"The length of the vehicle determines the factory,\" said Jens Ocksen, head of Volkswagen Poznan, the Polish unit of VW's commercial vehicles division, told Automotive News Europe .\nVW hopes that by adding front-wheel drive models it can increase volumes mainly from businesses that need a vehicle offering plenty of volume to store a product that doesn't have a lot of weight, for example bakeries or florists.\nAn additional benefit of removing the drive shaft is the corresponding 10 centimeter lower floor. While it sounds minor, VW officials say it saves drivers climbing the equivalent of climbing over 600 stairs every month. The sliding door has also been designed to shave off three seconds each opening and closing. These savings translate to more trips they can take and hence more money operators earn.\nLastly, VW will now finally be able to offer automatic transmissions, which the Crafter needs in Germany to participate in tenders made by emergency services for ambulances or police vehicles.\nVolkswagen is considering whether to launch the Crafter in the U.S. market, where more and more European vans are succeeding thanks to their lower cost of ownership. Ford began building its Transit in Kansas City, Missouri, while Mercedes is investing half a billion dollars to begin manufacturing the Sprinter in Charleston, South Carolina.\nYou can reach Christiaan Hetzner at christiaan.hetzner@gmail.com .",

By: Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Published: November 24, 2016 6:20 AM Umang Bedi, managing director, Facebook India and South Asia, attributed it to the fact that this was “only platform with real people”, in effect making it the “largest aggregator of real identities on the planet”. (Reuters) \nFacebook India has claimed that it has started offering unprecedented results for its partners in terms of “moving business”. Umang Bedi, managing director, Facebook India and South Asia, attributed it to the fact that this was “only platform with real people”, in effect making it the “largest aggregator of real identities on the planet”. \nListing examples of recent successes, Bedi, who joined the social network a few months back, said Tata Housing was able to sell 280 houses on the platform within a day while Ford and Samsung too experienced similar success. Bedi said his focus was on eight key vertical including financial services, tech, telecom and auto. \nIndia has for sometime been Facebook’s second largest market, but Bedi said the country is clearly the most critical and strategic market for the company. “We contribute $4 billion and 335,000 jobs to India through our marketing, platform and connectivity efforts.” he said, quoting a 2015 Deloitte report. Though he refused to divulge India’s position in terms of revenue, he said it was “leading the charter for emerging markets”. \nTo help brands make better use of the platform, Facebook has rolled out its Blueprint free creative training modules for businesses. The idea he said was to help them create “thumb stopping” creatives and understand the best practices for mobile first. Blueprint eLearning has hit 1 million enrolment. India ranks as the second largest country signing onto Blueprint. The top five countries include the US, India, Egypt, Brazil and the UK. \n“Blueprint has vertical specific narratives. Then it shows various products and how to use them with deep and narrow segmentation as well as broad and wide targets. There is training on how to get maximum reach and maximum frequency. Blueprint really focuses on two things. One is the creative, the other is how do you build a campaign, reach and optimisation. By the way it is for both on and off Facebook,” Bedi told indianexpress.com. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

      "text": "Why Ford's North America Troubles Might Be Here To Stay November 23, 2016, 02:06:04 PM EDT By Trefis Team, Trefis Shutterstock photo \nFord Motor Company ( F ) saw its North America market share decline by 50 basis points in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 to 13.6%. The worrying thing for the company was that, on a year-over-year basis, its sales decline occured in all three market segments in the U.S. auto market-a huge chunk of the overall North American auto market. \nIn the tables below, we look at how Ford saw year-over-year sales declines in all three market segments in the U.S. auto market: passenger cars, SUVs and pick-up trucks. In each of these segments, we take one or two of the highest selling Ford vehicles and compare their 2016 sales numbers with 2015 numbers. The vehicles are: the F-series trucks in the pick-up truck market, the Escape and Explorer in the SUV market, and the Focus and Fusion in the passenger car markets. Since, these five vehicles make up close to a third of the company's overall sales in North America, analyzing their sales numbers gives us a good sense of the high level trends impacting Ford's performance in this market. \nIn the July-September period in 2016, Ford saw the new unit sales of these five vehicles decline by around 9.7% year over year. The biggest decline came in the passenger car market, with sales of Fusion and Focus together declining by 19.6%. Since, the passenger car market in the U.S. is down 8.9% on a year through date basis, a decline in this segment is not surprising, but the extent of the decline shows that Ford isn't well equipped to handle a tough passenger car market. This is not really surprising since Ford's strength has traditionally been the SUV and pick-up truck segments. But the company saw sales in both segments decline in the third quarter, with SUV sales declining by 10.1%. This is really worrying for Ford investors since SUV sales are up 4.2% on a year-to-date basis, with SUV and Crossover sales combined up 6.4%. Similarly, Ford's sales in the pick-up truck segment declined by 3.3%, despite the market growing by 5.6% on a year-to-date basis. \nThe reasons behind the decline are largely to do with Ford trying to keep its incentives competitive instead of lowering its transaction prices just to drive unit sales. Either way, these factors resulted in a 7% year over year decline in revenue in the third quarter. Combined with the defective door latch related vehicle recall, the impact of the Brexit referendum vote and the higher costs associated with the launch of Ford's Super Duty pick-up truck, we expect Ford to post lower profitability in the next couple of years. \nHave more questions about auto companies?

      "text": "Ford And Fisher-Price Propose You Get Your Kids A Mustang This Christmas 24 Nov 2016, 8:56 UTC · / Home / News / U-turn Ford fans have an interesting opportunity ahead of them this Christmas , as the Blue Oval has announced an officially licensed toy in partnership with Fisher-Price. This is not just any toy , but a realistic and high-tech battery-operated Mustang . According to Ford, this creation has been inspired by the real thing, and its design and name are officially approved. Not only that, but it arrives with a computer-controlled drivetrain, which offers innovative features for a toy of this kind, including traction control. Although it might be surprising, you can get a toy car with traction control these days. It happens thanks to the Smart Drive system, which also monitors the stability of the vehicle. That means that the power will be limited or cut-off entirely in case there is a risk of rollover, and the motors are slowed down when wheel slip is detected. Just like in a real car, the throttle can be modulated, which means that the toy car in question will be able to pull off that slow start that the RC cars of our generation could not perform. Furthermore, it can also come to a slow stop, and its top speed can be restricted. Parents will be able to control its top speed, which in the range of 1 to 5 mph. They will also be able to check the battery’s charge level, which appears to be a removable unit that may extend operating time with a quick swap. The Mustang from Fisher-Price also comes with a built-in sound system, which plays engine noise that was recorded from a real Mustang, and matches it to the speed of the vehicle. Furthermore, tech-savvy kids will get to use an auxiliary input jack to play their music. Apparently, the toy Mustang comes with the biggest speaker ever installed in a Fisher-Price product, so you might want to reconsider that part with the music. A toy like this has an MSRP of $359.99, which is less than a sit-on Mclaren P1 electric (designed for smaller kids), but still a pricey gift for a toddler. We think it beats a tablet regarding fun (if you have enough space in your house/garden), but do not buy one as a gift if the children that get it do not have any room to use it appropriately and safely.",

      "text": "By: Kelly Pleskot November 23, 2016 \nW e can safely say the Power Wheels Smart Drive Mustang is way better than any toy car we had as kids. This battery-operated model looks and even sounds like a real Mustang . Plus, it has a number of safety features that will reassure parents. \nAvailable in either blue or pink, the Power Wheels Mustang is the result of a collaboration between Ford and Fisher-Price. It features engine sounds recorded from a real Mustang, rising and falling with changes in vehicle speed just like a real car. Traction control helps keep the car going over wet grass or bumpy surfaces, and a tilt sensor works to prevent rollovers (no joke). A backlit LED touch interface allows parents to set the car’s top speed anywhere from 1-5 mph. Because distracted driving isn’t as pressing of an issue at these speeds, kids can plug in devices through an auxiliary input jack inside the car and play music through the car’s own speakers. \n“Mustang is one of our best-selling sports cars,” said Gary Collins, senior manager of design for Power Wheels, in a release. “For the Smart Drive Mustang, we wanted to amp up the realistic driving experience to make the feeling of getting behind the wheel even more thrilling for kids.” \nIt’s not cheap, but it’s less expensive than paying $20,000 for a real car when they turn 16. The Power Wheels Ford Mustang goes on sale in December for “an MSRP of $359.99,” Ford says.",

      "text": "Peter Lynch Chart of F A bird's eye view Ford recorded quarterly revenue of $35.94 billion, a decline of 6% compared with last year, and generated profit of $1 billion. Ford posted a profit of $1.26 billion in North America before interest and tax. However, the company's operating profit margin plunged to 8.4%. It recorded a strong performance in the Asia Pacific region where it earned $131 million. Europe was a bright spot for the company as it recorded its best third-quarter profits since 2007. The pretax profit in the region was $138 million. In contrast, the company faced a loss of $295 million in South America. Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Ford registered negative cash flow of $2 billion but should bounce back in the fourth quarter. What actually brought down Ford's earnings were the launch costs of the Super Duty and the supply issues. The company might face higher costs in the near future. Its operations in North America, the Middle East and Africa were not profitable. Shanks said the third quarter and year to date metrics for the company were lower. He explains the key reason behind the fall was \"the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging.\" The drop in revenue is attributable to the decline in sales volume as well as the unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency. The company's share of the market also fell. As far as the seasonally adjusted annualized rate is concerned, South America was down 10% to 400,000 cars and vehicles. This was on account of Ford's disappointing performance in Brazil. Looking ahead During the earnings call conference, Marks Fields said that the company has reported strong results so far in the first three quarter of the fiscal. The company is confident of achieving its full-year guidance on adjusted pretax profit, which is expected to come in around $10.2 billion. This would be the second-best results since 2000. Though profit for the third quarter was lower than the prior year, it came in better than expected. The Blue Oval successfully introduced the all-new Super Duty and the Lincoln Continental in its home market. The company also is working out its strategy to address the challenges including stagnating sales in the U.S. retail market, insecurity in Europe after Brexit and the increasing spending on incentives in the U.S. Ford's cash flow for the first nine months of the year continues to be a strong point for the company. The automaker has been rewarding investors with regular dividends. Ford is committed to its strategy to expand its operations and grow its business in the domestic and international market. Besides, the company remains focused on tapping the emerging opportunities in the electric vehicle space for sustainable future growth.

By Paula Pasche , The Oakland Press Posted: # Comments \nDETROIT >> DeAndre Levy will not play today against the Vikings at Ford Field. It’s the 10th straight game he has missed. The Lions linebacker played a complete game in the opener, then was out with quad and knee injuries. He was listed on Wednesday as questionable for today. \nIt’s the second meeting in 18 days for the division rivals. The Lions (6-4) beat the Vikings (6-4) in overtime on Nov. 6. The winner today will be atop the NFC North. \nDefensive tackle Khyri Thornton (foot), who started the last two games, is also inactive. He, too, was questionable. \nZiggy Ansah (ankle), Theo Riddick (ankle), Graham Glasgow (ankle), Don Carey (hamstring) and were also listed as questionable but all are active. Advertisement \nOther Lions’ inactives: Jake Rudock, Cornelius Lucas, Justin Forsett and Joe Dahl. \nVikings WR Stefon Diggs, who had 13 catches for 80 yards in the Nov. 6 game, is out with an ankle injury. \nOther Vikings inactives: Taylor Heinicke, Terence Newman, Marcus Sherels, Rasond Hill, Sharrif Floyd and Stephen Weatherly.

      "text": "The Vikings will be without leading receiver Stefon Diggs today as they play the Lions here at Ford Field in the early Thanksgiving Day game.\nDiggs, who has 67 receptions for 747 yards and two touchdowns, is officially inactive with a knee injury after not practicing this week . He tried to give it a go during early warmups but the team is holding him out.\nWith Diggs out, both Laquon Treadwell and Jarius Wright will suit up and should get snaps alongside Adam Thielen and Cordarrelle Patterson.\nThe Vikings are also without cornerback Terence Newman, who is out with a neck injury, and punt returner Marcus Sherels, who is dealing with injuries to both his ankle and ribs after playing against the Cardinals.\nThere is good news, though. Safeties Harrison Smith and Andrew Sendejo, middle linebacker Eric Kendricks and cornerback Captain Munnerlyn are all active, as is outside linebacker Chad Greenway, who indicated this week that he was prepared to miss the game if his wife went into labor .\nQuarterback Taylor Heinicke, offensive tackle Rashod Hill and defensive linemen Sharrif Floyd and Stephen Weatherly are the other inactives.\nLooking for something to do while waiting for kickoff or your oven to ding? Read this fun story by my colleague Mark Craig about the team’s history with Thanksgiving games . This is their first in a couple of decades.\nOlder Post Newman doubtful, four Vikings starters questionable to play Thursday",

      "text": "By Dr. Warren J. Blumenfeld   \nWhile infatuated with the 2 nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Donald J. Trump seems not to have any affinity for the 1 st . \nNot only has he attacked and threatened the press, demonstrated disdain for people’s right of assembly (especially when demonstrating against him), proposed to restrict entry into the United States of people from Muslim-dominated countries and enact a “Muslim registry” composed of those already here, he seems also not to value our freedom of speech. We will know only too well and too soon his response to our right to petition the government for redress of grievances after he and his administration take office. \nHe has consistently showed his hand, or at least his thumbs, in his tweeting rants and admonitions, which portends a very bleak future for free speech in Trump’s increasingly Un-united States. \nIn a recent tweet, Trump directed his ire against the cast of the Broadway musical “Hamilton: An American Musical,” and indirectly at Actor Brandon Victor Dixon who plays Aaron Burr. The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 \nWith Vice President-elect Mike Pence in attendance, at the end of the performance, the entire cast reassembled on stage to read a message expressing their anxiety over the election of Donald Trump . \nAs Pence attempted to exit the theater, Brandon Victor Dixon requested that he remain to “hear us just a few more moments.” Dixon, very courteously and respectfully thanked Pence for coming to the show, and expressed to those in the crowd who had disparaged Pence’s presence that “there’s nothing to boo here, we’re all here sharing a story of love.” \nReading from the stage, Dixon continued: “We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. We truly thank you for sharing this show, this wonderful American story, told by a diverse group of men, women, of different colors, creeds, and orientations.” \nTrump’s “theater” tweet came a week after he reacted on the Twittersphere to the numerous, largely peaceful, demonstrations throughout the country protesting his election. He implied that people were paid for taking part in these actions: Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 \nHis re action to the cast’s message stands as more-than-ironic, since he and his entire Bannon-inspired and -instigated campaign has created a Ford’s Theater climate in the country against anyone and everyone who do not represent and live up to the mythical though promoted standard of “an American”: white, preferably male, mainline Protestant, financially secure, able-bodied, heterosexual, cisgender, native-born and English-as-first-language speaking, European-heritage, gun-loving, socialism-hating, anti-reproductive freedom, anti- marriage equality , and, of course, anti-mainstream “elite” media, and the list continues ad infinitum . Regarding Trump’s standard of women, one must also conform to the youthful and super-model svelte image. \nTrump has “promised” to turn back many of the gains progressives have made in civil and human rights over the decades. Many groups have very real concerns for their emotional and physical safety while the bully-in-chief gives permission to others by his example to trample of people’s basic Constitutionally-protected guarantees. \nWhen Trump feels that he needs to react to the cast of a Broadway show, when he feels he needs to react to people taking to the streets in largely-peaceful protest, how does Trump intend to act/react when his current bro-crush Vladimir Putin shows Trump the side of himself that he demonstrates to his political rivals in Russia and abroad, and when he invades neighboring countries as he has already done in Ukraine and Georgia ? \nHow does Trump intend to act/react when the people who voted for him begin to turn on him as they inevitably come to understand that beneath the bluster and hyperbole, the emperor has no clothes? \nThroughout the general election, Hillary Clinton was on target in questioning Trump’s temperament regarding his ability to serve as our Commander in Chief. \nUnder a Trump presidency, Ford’s Theater will travel to your community, wherever you live. The price of admission is the mandatory relinquishing of your freedom and liberty, and available only to those of us who fall outside the mythical norm of “an American.”",

      "text": "  Two Ford GTs Were Pulled Over For Doing 101 MPH And Got Off Scot-Free by Michael Hines   No, the Blue Oval didn't \"donate\" to the police department...we think. Do you ever wonder how test drivers keep themselves in line when they’re out on public roads? How do you resist stomping on the gas pedal when the road clears and you’re behind the wheel of a Ford GT prototype ? Well, you don’t. The key is to not get caught, which is something these GT test drivers failed to do. According to Vail Daily , a Colorado state trooper spotted a trio of drivers out testing Ford’s new supercar and clocked two of them doing 101 mph; the third was only doing 50 mph. The three cars drove on for another 30 miles before being pulled over. Now at this point it seems like an open and shut case, right? You got two cars on radar doing 101 mph after all. Well, not so fast. VailDaily reports that the case has been dropped because prosecutors decided it would be too difficult to prove which of the three cars was speeding. “There would have been no way to identify which two of the three were doing the speeding. There was no way we could prove beyond a reasonable doubt which two of the three were speeding,” assistant district attorney Heidi McCollum said. Ford was really lucky here. If it hadn’t been testing a pack of cars then it would have been slapped with a very embarrassing ticket. If anything this story should be a lesson to automakers. Drop the solo test drives and crazy camo. Test drivers will then be able to open things up without fear of reprisal from the long arm of the law. Police photos by Randy Wyrick for the Vail Daily.",

      "text": "Ford's 'Mustang Power Wheels' Toy has a Traction Control Powertrain By: Joey Haar   fisher-price.mattel & cnet The Ford Mustang is one of the icons of American muscle car culture, and the 'Mustang Power Wheels' is a toy that might very well ensure the vehicle's cultural impact for the next generation of drivers. The go-kart toy, which is the product of a partnership between the historical American car manufacturer and Power Wheels, uses advanced technology to offer a safe and exciting ride for kids aged three to seven. The Mustang Power Wheels powertrain is controlled by the Smart Drive system. This system uses computers to give the toy car what would amount to traction control in a full-sized Mustang. Through Smart Drive, the Mustang Power Wheels car will automatically adjust motor speeds when it detects wheel slip, making driving on uneven terrain safer and faster.",

It can also test new models in all climates in a significantly shorter timeframe than before.\n\n“With industry-first features, like the high altitude testing and the ability to simulate heavy snow, this new test facility offers a toolkit that will help us to continue to develop future best-in-class vehicles,” said Joe Bakaj, vice president of product development at Ford of Europe.\n\n“This is a significant step forward that will enable Ford to efficiently simulate the most demanding environments around the globe under repeatable conditions.”\n\nThe facility, which is on course to open in April 2017, will join Ford’s existing test facilities located around the world. These include the Lommel Proving Ground in Belgium, natural sites such as the US's Mojave Desert, which is used for hot weather testing, and sites inside the Arctic Circle, where cold weather evaluation takes place.\n\n*Ford works towards driverless car with new autonomous tech*",

      "title": "VW challenges Ford, Fiat, Mercedes with new Crafter",
      "text": "WRZESNIA, Poland -- Volkswagen aims to grab a greater share of the lucrative segment for large cargo vans dominated by Ford Motor, Fiat and Mercedes-Benz after investing about 800 million euros in a new manufacturing plant that marks a record for its light commercial vehicles division.\nThe move was necessary after Daimler stopped building the Crafter, which was a badge-engineered derivative of the Mercedes Sprinter.\nThe new factory here is expected to build 100,000 units of its entirely redesigned Crafter annually when all body style and powertrain derivatives are available in 2018.\nThe Crafter will offer new features such as front-wheel drive and automatic transmission, both previously not offered. These should help to double the van's current volume according to VW managers. The van also will be equipped with Volkswagen’s RIO open telematics platform, a cloud-based software solution that goes live next spring that can be used by any customer with a mixed fleet of vehicles.\nDemonstrating the importance of the model, both Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and Lower Saxony Premier Stephan Weil, two of VW's most important board directors, flew in to attend the opening ceremony late in October along with the Volkswagen Truck & Bus CEO Andreas Renschler.\nMarket watchers believe the big investment makes sense. \"The life cycles of these vehicles is far longer and they’re not as susceptible to swings in consumer tastes as passenger cars,\" IHS Automotive analyst Ian Fletcher said.\nThe market for \"C/D Transporters,\" as VW calls large delivery vans with 3 to 6 metric tons of gross permissible weight, is more than 1.3 million vehicles in size globally and growing thanks to the trend toward online shopping firms such as Amazon or Zalando in Germany. However, VW mainly competes in the western European market which increased by 14 percent last year to nearly 500,000 units.\n“The C/D transporter segment is the largest commercial van segment with undoubtedly one of the best prospects due in part to online services,” said VW vans chief Eckhard Scholz, adding that the Crafter would benefit from the largest distribution network for light commercial vehicles in Europe.\nWhile anything but sexy, it's a well-known axiom that the commercial vehicle business can be extremely profitable when run properly. \nIt is perhaps no coincidence that Ford of Europe, market leader in light commercial vehicles, earned a 4.9 percent pretax margin during the first nine months.\nMeanwhile, Opel/Vauxhall had long neglected the commercial van businesses and ended up breaking even during the same period -- and then only on an operating level and after adjusting for effects. Addressing this vulnerability has now become an \"fundamental element\" of the General Motors brand's 2022 growth strategy.\nThe risks however have never been higher for VW's van business, best known for building the Volkswagen Bus that became a pop culture icon during the Flower Power era of the 1960s.\nLike many automakers in this comparatively low-volume segment, VW had previously split the development costs by partnering up with a competitor. The outgoing Crafter was based on the Sprinter from Daimler's Mercedes-Benz unit and built by Mercedes. Daimler only supplied the 50,000 units annually that it was contractually obliged to do and in 2013 decided to end the partnership entirely to gain the extra capacity.\nPlatform risk \nMuch like the passenger car market though, larger vehicles are more lucrative than small ones. \"Mercedes' van business makes all its money with the Sprinter,\" said one VW commercial vehicles manager.\nVolkswagen took a risky bet by developing a platform solely for the Crafter which is technically incompatible with the rest of the 12-brand group's vehicle. No other vehicle in the entire product range comes equipped with axles capable of supporting the weight needed for the segment except for the heavy trucks sold by VW Group's MAN and Scania heavy truck brands.\nAdditionally the problem arose that none of the group's 130 manufacturing plants worldwide were adequate to build the Crafter given none had the required dimensions for assembling and painting a model such as the Crafter, which is 7.4 meters in length and three meters high. The paint shop has 12 swimming pool size tanks alone dedicated to various stages of cathodic immersion coating.\nAs a result, the 2.2 square kilometer size of its plant in Wrzesnia - roughly equivalent to 300 soccer fields - makes it the group's biggest factory for one single model.\n\"The length of the vehicle determines the factory,\" Jens Ocksen, president of Volkswagen Poznan, told Automotive News Europe. The Polish unit of VW's commercial vehicles division already builds the small Caddy car-derived van in neighboring Poznan.\nIHS Automotive’s Fletcher said VW had few choices if they wanted to remain in the segment: \"Without building this facility, it was unlikely they could have found the capacity required and they’ve chosen to build it in a cost effective location where they have experience of building vehicles.\"\nVW hopes that by adding front-wheel drive models it can increase volumes mainly from businesses that need a vehicle offering plenty of volume to store a product that doesn't have a lot of weight, for example bakeries or florists.\nAn additional benefit of removing the drive shaft is the corresponding 10 centimeter lower floor. While it sounds minor, VW officials say it saves drivers climbing the equivalent of climbing over 600 stairs every month. The sliding door has also been designed to shave off three seconds each opening and closing. These savings translate to more trips they can take and hence more money operators earn.\nLastly, VW will now finally be able to offer automatic transmissions, which the Crafter needs in Germany to participate in tenders made by emergency services for ambulances or police vehicles.\nVolkswagen is considering whether to launch the Crafter in the U.S. market, where more and more European vans are succeeding thanks to their lower cost of ownership. Ford began building its Transit in Kansas City, Missouri, while Mercedes is investing half a billion dollars to begin manufacturing the Sprinter in Charleston, South Carolina.\nYou can reach Christiaan Hetzner at christiaan.hetzner@gmail.com .",

      "text": "Email \nThe year was 1789 when the first Thanksgiving was celebrated in the United States and Thanksgiving has been a holiday in Canada since 1957. Whether it’s Canadians or Americans, Thanksgiving evokes different imagery for everyone, and that includes classic truck owners. \nThe year was 1997 when the Goodguys 1st Annual Southwest Nationals took place in Scottsdale, Arizona and for Calvin Brandt of Peoria, Arizona almost twenty-two years to the day since he’d bought his 1933 Ford pickup. In the early days Calvin drove his ’33 Ford as a weekend warrior from 1975 until 2009 when he decided he wanted to turn the trusty Ford into a show & go winner. \nThe Goodguys Southwest Nationals mark the end of the Goodguys Rod & Custom Association’s show season, but it was the beginning for Calvin and his 1933 Ford pickup this year. It was just a week short of Thanksgiving 2016 when Calvin was able to drive his freshly completed 1933 Ford pickup to the Goodguys 19th Annual Southwest Nationals. Under the hood Calvin went with the tried, and true totally blacked out 350-inch small-block Chevrolet engine topped with black valve covers and polished aluminum fins. For an automatic transmission Calvin stayed on the tried and true route and went with a TH350. \nIt’s the dashboard where Calvin really went off the beaten path and created a one-off look like never seen before on a 1933 Ford pickup. The shooting gallery instrument cluster is from a 1962 Chrysler 300, but the originality doesn’t stop there, Calvin cut sections out of a fire hydrant and fabricated a dashboard equally as radical as the ’62 Chrysler instrument cluster. Look to the images of the bed and you’ll notice Calvin fabricated a special enclosed area on the tail end that stows a folding chair, and who knows maybe next month Calvin will be able to hide away a few Christmas presents.",

Because there’s no better time to educate your children about the risks of taking a Ford Mustang to a car meet , this one features a variable speed limiter, plus both traction and stability control – like a real Mustang! \nWhile this Mustang doesn’t have a V8 under the hood, it does include a speaker that pipes out engine noises that rise and fall with the Mustang’s speed.

      "text": "This is India’s angriest Ford Ecosport Posted on by Shantonil Nag \nThe Ecosport undoubtedly kickstarted the competition in the compact SUV segment. It’s still a popular choice in the segment for buyers looking for a well built vehicle. Here is one EcoSport from the southern part of India that will make you think twice before you consider any other vehicle in the segment. Modification list \nThe car is customised by Evo Customz based out of Palakkad, Kerala and it definitely redefines the way EcoSport looks like. To start with, the already good looking vehicle gets a Ferrari Rosso Corsa inspired red paint job. Interestingly, Ford does not have the red colour option in their portfolio as of now except the mighty Mustang. \nThe modified EcoSport gets a body kit to give it a more muscular look. The body kit includes customised front bumper, side skirt and rear diffuser. It makes the EcoSport look much lower than the stock version. The headlamps have been upgraded with imported ones and the DRLs look much similar to the old generation Range Rover Evoque. \nThere fog lamps gets LED lamps which are much more powerful and give the car a distinctive look. LEDs also replace the conventional lamps in the tail-lamp unit, which has been blacked out. To make the front fascia more aggressive, the modifier added bonnet scoops too. \nThe rear D-Pillar also gets vertical LED brake lamps. The high-mounted brake lamp on the roof spoiler has been blacked out while there has an added spoiler lip painted in black accentuating the looks for the vehicle. \nThe roof has been blacked out and receives a crossbar to get a more menacing SUV look. The alloy wheels get a black paint job along with ORVMs, and the front grille that highlight the complete set-up. The whole modification job costed Rs. 1.7 lakh. What about the engine? \n\nThe engine has been left untouched with this modification. The EcoSport comes with three engine options. There is the powerful 1.0-litre EcoBoost, 3-cylinder petrol engine with turbocharger that produces a maximum of 123 BHP. \nThere is 1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol engine that produces a maximum of 110.5 BHP of maximum power and then there is diesel 1.5-litre turbocharged engine that churns out a maximum of 98.5 BHP of maximum power. Even though the sales of EcoSport has slowed down in recent times, the solid build of the car still attracts many customers. \nModification and Image: EvoCustomz",

      "title": "ROAD TEST — Two flavours of Ford Fusion",
      "text": "It’s been a decade since the mid-size Fusion slotted into Ford’s lineup between the compact Focus and full-size Taurus sedan. Since then, sedan sales have been whittled down as customers started crossing over to crossovers. But the Fusion still factors significantly in Ford’s bottom line.\nAnd, for 2017, evolving through its second generation of product, the Fusion adds front end styling tweaks, a new rotary dial shifter and other refinements to a lineup that has broadened with a wide variety of models.\nThese range through five trims levels powered by four different gasoline engine offerings, along with hybrid and plug-in hybrid choices.\nCustomers can settle for frugal front-wheel-drive powertrains or opt for all-wheel-drive performance. And choices top out with long lists of equipment packages, optional technologies and the latest luxuries and accessories to choose from.\nIt’s hard to do justice to that kind of a broad-based lineup within a brief car review but we can at least get a taste of two flavours of Fusion in this test session.\nFusion SE FWD:\nThe Fusion lineup includes the S ($23,688), SE ($25,588), Titanium ($34,488), Platinum ($42,288) and Sport ($42,288) trim levels.\nOur first SE tester is one step up from the base model, right in the sweet spot for a typically Canadian compromise, adding a little bit extra to the equipment list while holding the price line to a reasonable limit. Sticking with standard front-wheel-drive saves a chunk of change compared to an optional all-wheel-drive system ($2,000).\nIn many ways, this SE trim level offers the most customer choices compared to higher trim levels where upgrades are included in the standard price. Like the base S model, our SE starts humbly with a standard 175 hp 2.5 i-VCT four-cylinder engine rated at 11.3/7.5L/100km (city/hwy).\nThere are two other optional engine choices here - a 181 hp 1.5-litre Ti-VCT turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder ($1,050) with a 10/7.1L/100km (city/hwy) fuel economy rating or a 240 hp 2.0-litre Ti-VCT turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder ($3,400) with an 11.2/7.6L/100km (city/hwy) rating.\nOur tester harnesses the miniaturized muscle of the 1.5-litre EcoBoost and this “little engine that could” certainly can when it comes to providing both power and fuel efficiency.\nThe motor pulls nicely from a standstill, accelerating smoothly through the six-speed automatic cogs and paddle-shifted if you prefer. Once you get up to speed, however, the “no replacement for displacement” crowd might notice some diminishing oomph in mid-range power and passing. Fuel economy does not disappoint with real world driving results averaging out to a thrifty 7.3L/100km (comb).\nFrom a purely economical point of view, I would be inclined to stick with the standard issue 2.5-litre four-banger rather than try to regain the 1.5-litre’s extra cost with a few years of fuel savings, but customers will have to balance the pro and con costs of their own driving demands.\nOur SE tester blows the budget anyway by adding about $10K worth of options, with everything from a Luxury Packages that includes the optional engine ($3,300) to a Driver Assist Package with lane keeping and blind spot detection ($1,950), a moonroof ($1,250), MyFord Touch Package with Reverse Sensing System ($850), Active Park Assist ($600), navigation ($800), and fancy 18-inch wheels ($700), topped off with a White Platinum Metallic Tri-Coat paint job ($550).\nMid-size sedans make for a nice mix of qualities, with handling not too far removed from the nimbleness of a compact but offering the kind of enlarged accommodation that comes closer to a full-size comforts. And, with or without the extras offered here, the Fusion SE provides an excellent mix of utility and amenities.\nFusion Titanium AWD:\nOur second tester in Titanium trim takes a more inclusive approach. Moving up to the next rung of the trim level ladder adds all-wheel-drive and, along with other extra goodies, also stuffs the more powerful 240 hp 2.0-litre Ti-VCT turbocharged EcoBoost four-cylinder under the hood. The blended addition of more muscle and more sure-footed traction gives this model an extra edge worth considering. My fuel economy results worked out to 10.9L/100km (comb).\nDie-hard performance fans might be tempted to go all-in with the Sport version, topping out Fusion power with the 2.7-litre turbocharged EcoBoost V6’s 325 hp and 380 lb/ft of torque.\nBut again, although this Titanium perches higher than the SE in trim level and price, it is still a good compromise mix of power, panache and bang for the buck.\nAnd this tester, in a handsome shade of Burgundy Metallic clearcoat, wraps up the Fusion package nicely, adding more standard equipment and nearly $8K of options including the same Driver Assist Package ($1,950), Adaptive Cruise Control ($1,500), heated/cooled seats ($600), bigger 19-inch aluminum wheels and more.\nThe Ford Fusion’s varied lineup has made it a capable competitor in the mid-size market where it vies for attention with the segment leading Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\nAnd with refreshed style and content for 2017, Ford continues to offer customers combined qualities of performance and style, in whatever Fusion flavour they prefer.",
