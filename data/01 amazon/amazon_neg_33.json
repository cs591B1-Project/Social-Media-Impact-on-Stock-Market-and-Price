      "text": "Amazon in discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package Leagues include the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball Sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video \nAmazon.com Inc is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. \nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. \nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty programme offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. \nAmazon has also reached out to smaller leagues such as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League for game rights, according to the Journal. The company has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the report said.\nAmong those approached include Univision Communications for Mexican football league games, Walt Disney Co's ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. \nAmazon, the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \n\"We don't comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise, until appropriate,\" World Surf League spokesman said. \nMLS confirmed the talks with Amazon but declined to comment further. \nACC, 120 Sports, NLL, MLL and Campus Insiders could not be immediately reached for comment. \nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. \nTech-giants such as Facebook and Twitter have signed up deals to beef up their video services. \nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some US men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.",

According to a Wall Street Journal report, the online retailer — which has already gone to great lengths to prove that it’s much more than your digital shopping destination — is “exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports.” \nThe Journal reports that over the last few months, Jeff Bezos’ company has held negotiations for live game rights with industry giants like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and the National Football League, as well as other such groups as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, and World Surf League. \n“My sense is they are interested in anything that might be out there,” said Chad Swofford, vice president of digital for the ACC, a college sports conference, told the WSJ. But for the time being, Amazon is staying tight-lipped on any plans for expansion its Prime Video service may have. \nIf Amazon is indeed scouting new entry points into sports broadcasting, which could be a highly lucrative business, it would seem to make sense. After all, live sports is one of the last differentiable elements offered by traditional pay-television. Some other major tech players have already begun streaming such events — Facebook and Twitter are both in the game, and Amazon may be playing a bit of catch-up at this point. \nBut don’t get too excited about the possibility of live sports being added to Amazon. It won’t come free — even if you already have a Prime subscription. As the Journal reports, “With at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear.”",

      "text": "Buy on Amazon (via What’s Eric Playing?) Please note that this refers only to the first edition of Dominion: Intrigue. As the Second Edition has updated cards, I will be covering the differences between the first and second editions in a later review. An important difference is that the second edition will no longer be a standalone expansion; it WILL require the base game to play . Thanks! Well now that I’ve written up one Dominion , I should theoretically be able to write up all of them . I’m not gonna go full consecutive like the Carcassonne Expansions 1 & 2 Bonanza I had a little while back, but … might as well get to them eventually.Dominion: Intrigue is a bit of a weird bird in the Dominion series, as it’s the only expansion that’s actually a standalone, meaning you don’t actually need to buy Dominion (the base game) to play it (which is why the featured photo includes the base cards; a nice touch, if I may say so myself). While some might interpret this as a free pass to skip the base set forever, I actually like some of the base set cards, so I wouldn’t totally recommend that (unless you’re planning to skip just like, Woodcutter, which is an awful card). Additionally, later expansions don’t come with the base cards (Copper, Silver, Gold, Estate, Duchy, Province, Curse, … others, that I will tell you about once we get to my eventual Prosperity or Alchemy reviews), so Intrigue is the only currently standalone expansion. That being said, it’s still Dominion at its core, so I’ll likely refer back to the base game review every now and then but ultimately treat it like an expansion.Let’s talk more about what’s going on, here.",

      "text": "The 2016 Guide to Amazon Sponsored Products \nTactics and Insights for Third-Party Sellers to Advance their Advertising Strategy AMS Category Targeting for Amazon Product Display Ads Posted by Tara Johnson on November 21, 2016 in Amazon \nIn an effort to improve the AMS platform, Amazon has launched Category-level targeting as a new option available for Product Display Ads. \nAccording to Amazon, this new feature allows for easier campaign set-up as opposed to selecting interests or ASINs one at a time . The hope is that this update will allow advertisers to set up Product Display campaigns more quickly, improve relevancy, and ultimately increase sales. Introducing Amazon Product Category Targeting: \nAmazon Product Category Targeting in AMS Product Display Ad campaigns will be eligible to show on every detail page within the categories selected and ads may perform better because they are displayed to shoppers who may be more likely interested to purchase the advertised product . \nPro-Tip: The categories match the Level 4 browse nodes in the Amazon catalog. \nAs seen in the screenshot below, Amazon will prompt you to select the product targeting type based on available categories & selected categories. \nAvailable Categories: Is a list of all the available categories to target in your campaign for the product you have select. \nSelected Categories: Is a list of pre-selected categories Amazon recommends for targeting the products in your campaign. You can click on any category in the list to deselect it. \n“My initial feeling is that this will make production of campaigns much easier and streamlined for advertisers,” Thomas Tiop , Marketplace Channel Analyst at CPC Strategy said. \n“Category-based targeting presents a great opportunity for sellers to advertise their products along with complementary products.” \n“This new feature is a small part of a bigger trend we’re seeing wherein Amazon is actively building a more robust and sophisticated advertising platform .” \n“As Amazon continues to grow, I fully expect to see them continuously introduce features that will give advertisers more granular targeting options.” About AMS Amazon Product Display Ads: \nAmazon Marketing Services (AMS) is an advertising solution used to enhance brand discoverability and drive demand for products sold on Amazon.com through Product Display Ads and Headline Search Ads. \nAmazon Product Display Ads allow advertisers to: Advertise individual products Drive traffic to product’s detail page Create targeted ad campaigns Control spend with bid and budget Pay only when shoppers click Track campaign performance \nAMS Product Display Ads boost product visibility through advertising and reach millions of Amazon shoppers with ads linking to product detail pages. \nAccording to Amazon, Product Display Ads help brands drive sales with interest-based or product targeted advertising. \nTargeting based on shopper interests or target products makes it possible to deliver highly relevant ads to shoppers with certain interests or actively viewed specific products. \nWith Product Display Ads, Amazon vendors have access to customer information from Amazon.

      "text": "Samsung’s 4K player for just $197, plus X-Files: Complete Series Deal on Amazon & new BD announcements November 18, 2016 - 1:43 pm   We’re closing out the week with a bit more announcement news, and some more great Amazon Deals . Let’s get those out of the way first, because they’re pretty damn good and you have to act fast on one of them. \nAlso, if you’re interested in moving up to 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Amazon currently has Samsung’s UBD-K8500 3D/4K UHD Blu-ray Player for just $197 – down the already low $399! As you may know, I’ve reviewed this player in some depth recently here on The Bits (see this link) . It was already a good deal at $399 and now at half that price it’s a steal. I’m still using this as my go-to 4K player here. There will be better 4K players available over the next year, but you’re going to pay a lot more than $197 for them. So I definitely recommend the UBD-K8500 at that price. [Read on here…] All right, in announcement news today, Disney’s Queen of Katwe is officially coming to Blu-ray and DVD on 1/31, with a Digital HD release set for 1/10. \nLionsgate will release The 9th Life of Louis Drax on Blu-ray and DVD on 2/7. The film stars Aaron Paul. \nUniversal will release Ouija: Origin of Evil on both formats on 1/17, along with a Ouija: Two Movie Collection . \nScream Factory has officially announced the Southern Gothic horror film The Devil’s Dolls for Blu-ray and DVD on 12/6. \nThis puts a smile on our faces: Kino Lorber will release Scavenger Hunt (1979) on Blu-ray and DVD on 1/10. Also coming that day are David and Bathsheba (1951), and The Unholy Four (1970) aka Chuck Mool . On 1/3, look for Stryker (1983), Loophole (1981), ZPG: Zero Population Growth (1972), The Internecine Project (1974), and Who? (1975) aka Robo Man . You can see some of the cover artwork below. \nArrow Video has set Emiliano Rocha Minter’s We Are the Flesh for Blu-ray and DVD release on 2/14. \nRaro Video will release Revenge of the Blood Beast (1966 – aka Il lago di Satana ) on Blu-ray on 1/17. \nThe Cohen Film Collection has set Sudden Fear for Blu-ray release on 12/13. \nAnd finally, for you music fans MVD Entertainment has set the Morphine: Journey of Dreams documentary for DVD only release on 12/9. \nWe’ll leave you with a look at some of those Kino Lorber Blu-ray deep catalog titles (click on the covers to pre-order them on Amazon.com)... \nThat’s all for this week. We’ll see you back here on Monday. Have a great weekend!",

      "text": "By Shalini Ramachandran\nSports could be part of Prime Video, or a 'skinny bundle'\nAmazon.com Inc. is exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports.\nIn recent months, the e-commerce giant has been in talks for live game rights with heavy-hitters like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, as well as smaller players like Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League, the people said.\nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon (AMZN) has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear, the people said. A premium sports package could entice new subscribers to Prime and to Amazon's potential \"skinny bundle\" of live channels online.\nAmazon executives have even canvassed traditional TV networks for game rights they aren't using. They have asked if Univision Communications Inc. would consider producing and packaging the extra Mexican soccer league games that it has rights to but doesn't air, one of the people said. And they approached Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN and ONE World Sports, which airs offbeat sports like Russian hockey league matches, to seek leftover, unproduced live games, other people said.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-explores-possible-premium-sports-package-with-prime-membership-1479757001).\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nVenezuela's nemesis is a hardware salesman at a Home Depot in Alabama (http://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-nemesis-is-a-screw-salesman-at-a-home-depot-in-alabama-1479672919?mod=mktw).\nEarthquakes: Reckoning with 'The Big One' in California -- and it just got bigger (http://www.wsj.com/articles/earthquakes-reckoning-with-the-big-one-in-californiaand-it-just-got-bigger-1479643228?mod=mktw).\n-Shalini Ramachandran ; 1650ET\n ",

      "title": "Amazon Explores Rights for Live Sports Packages on Prime",
      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. is exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports.\nIn recent months, the e-commerce giant has been in talks for live game rights with heavy-hitters like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, as well as smaller players like Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League, the people said.\nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear, the people said. A premium sports package could entice new subscribers to Prime and to Amazon's potential \"skinny bundle\" of live channels online.\nAmazon executives have even canvassed traditional TV networks for game rights they aren't using. They have asked if Univision Communications Inc. would consider producing and packaging the extra Mexican soccer league games that it has rights to but doesn't air, one of the people said. And they approached Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN and ONE World Sports, which airs offbeat sports like Russian hockey league matches, to seek leftover, unproduced live games, other people said.\nAmazon also is scouting abroad, on the cusp of a global video expansion. It paid $10,000 for a tender document to potentially bid on the popular Indian Premier League cricket games. And it is discussing licensing an international package of NBA games, a person familiar with the talks said.\n\"My sense is they are interested in anything that might be out there,\" said Chad Swofford, vice president of digital for the ACC, a college sports conference.\nAn Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment on its sports efforts.\nAmazon's potential entry into sports broadcasting could shake up a lucrative business that has long been a stronghold of traditional pay-television. That is in part because \"they take such a view of the long game, while near-term financial returns drive the agenda for most companies,\" one senior sports executive said. Amazon executives are keenly aware that the premium NFL Sunday Ticket package of afternoon football helped DirecTV acquire subscribers when it launched as a new rival to cable, people familiar with their thinking say.\nAmazon even asked to exclusively license the NBA's League Pass, which offers live out-of-market games, one of the people said, but the NBA demurred, having long preferred selling it through many outlets.\nAmazon also is seeking sports packages like NFL Game Pass, which shows replays of matchups, to sell to Prime members as add-on channels, the people said.\nLeading the talks is Amazon's head of sports, James DeLorenzo, a former Sports Illustrated executive hired in March. Also on Amazon's acquisition team: Sunil Dave, a former Dish Network Corp. executive who negotiated with sports networks.\nAmazon is racing to compete against rival tech giants like Facebook and Twitter, as well as BAMTech, the spinoff of Major League Baseball, which are seeking sports rights to beef up their video offerings.\nOne big hurdle: many premium rights are tied up. The NBA's deal with ESPN and TNT stretches until the 2024-2025 season, while the NFL's pacts with ESPN, CBS, Fox and NBC run through early next decade. Many college conferences' rights lie with various TV networks. And Disney's recent investment in BAMTech means ESPN's extra sports rights likely will land in its forthcoming multisport streaming service with BAMTech, one person familiar with ESPN's thinking said.\nAmazon has the firepower and willingness to bid for top-tier, exclusive sports rights when they become available, people familiar with its thinking say. Coming up next year: the NFL-Twitter deal for streaming 10 games. Amazon had bid for those rights this year, a person familiar with the matter said.\nAmazon would be wagering that sports will attract enough new Prime members to offset potentially large yearslong costs. Rival Netflix Inc. has long said viewers don't care to watch sports on-demand after the fact, making it an unattractive investment compared with shows or movies. Already, Amazon's ballooning investments in video are a drag on its meager profits.\nThe company may first grab a toehold in the \"long tail\" of sports, like lacrosse, gymnastics or surfing, sports executives say. Amazon executives believe the e-commerce giant can uniquely target a lacrosse viewer with lacrosse gear, for instance, allowing Amazon to land a greater return on a sports investment.\n\"Amazon's ability to aggregate information about individual consumers is without peer,\" said Alexander Brown, chief executive of TV network ONE World Sports.\nThe ability to re-target consumers could be key to justifying expensive sports rights as traditional networks grapple with declining ratings for some events, like NFL games this season.\nIt isn't uncommon for Amazon to float various ideas and retreat—a potential outcome of its sports foray as well, media executives cautioned. At times there are several overlapping video efforts going on at once—a model that Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos encourages for a bit of \"business Darwinism,\" one person close to Amazon said.\nThere is debate internally about whether a sports package should be available free with Prime or as a premium add-on subscription, the people said. It is still possible Amazon may just opt to license channels, like traditional cable distributors do, rather than acquire sports rights.\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com\n 21, 2016 15:25 ET (20:25 ",

See details on Best Buy That early-morning scramble to find your keys before you leave the house doesn't have to be so frantic if you've got a wireless key finder handy. No bigger than a standard key chain — and even smaller, in some cases — these dongles connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth LE to alert you when your keys are nearby or in danger of being left behind. \nPlenty of key finders promise to keep your valuables close at hand, but after putting a variety of devices through their paces, the second-generation Tile ($25) emerged as the best choice for tracking the whereabouts of your keys, with improved range and a helpful two-way finding feature that lets you locate your phone from your key chain. The makers of Tile recently introduced a new version, the Tile Mate, which costs the same as the second-generation Tile, but is smaller than its predecessor. We plan on updating this guide with a review for the Tile Mate as soon as we get our hands on one.\nOur runner-up was the Duet by Protag ($29), which packs its feature set into a compact design. If you need a device with a loud alarm, check out the TrackR Bravo ($29), while the Pebblebee Honey ($24) adds other features like the ability to control your smartphone's camera.\n\nTile (Gen 2) The good Sleek look and feel Audible alert signal Improved range New two-way finding feature The bad No geofence capability Battery can't be replaced Verdict \n8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $25.00 Amazon \nNext Summary Best Wireless Key Finder How We Tested and Rated Tile (Gen 2): Best Key Finder Duet by Protag: Runner-up Pally Smart Finder TrackR Bravo PebbleBee Honey Chipolo Elgato Smart Key Zomm Wireless Leash XY Find It Kensington Proximo Fob LassoTag iBeacon About the author Philip Michaels @PhilipMichaels Philip Michaels is a senior editor at Tom's Guide.

That is the brand that I hear so much about. How does it stack up with the other key tracker devices. Was it in the test and just didn't rate? 0 mwamac Jan 11, 2016, 3:25 PM This device was not that good. The tile and phone could be right next to each other and not work. It kept losing it's bluetooth connection. Went ahead and returned the tile, if no bluetooth connection, it is useless for finding anything. 0 McMhouse Apr 27, 2016, 11:11 AM I'm looking for a key finder now, and this is the best, most current article I could find. It's a very well-written, in-depth, and comprehensive article. Great work! That said, I agree that the omission of a review of Lapa is a mistake. Would you please add them to your research?\n\n(I also looked into Pixie, but I don't think there's a need to review them in this article.) 0 loaf__ May 3, 2016, 6:24 PM I had a TrackR. It is now in the bin. Didn't work and when I dared complain on the Facebook page they deleted my comment and blocked me. Avoid. 0 CRM123 May 9, 2016, 7:45 AM The Trackr is the worste device. It is barely audible. The bluetooth range is terrible. The bluetooth connection fails all the time and their own tech support recommends that you have to restart the Trackr app on your phone several times per day in order for it to work. Who would do this. Trackr is a useless implementation of a good concept. BUY TILE. 0 larry1976 May 24, 2016, 4:57 PM Hmmmm... If I buy one Tile at $25 and have to replace it for $12 that's $37 spent in just one year. Not to mention if it goes before 11 months I'm out a beacon until I get a new one. Sure they might let me recycle early but I'm still without a Tile until the replacement gets there.\n\nIf I buy any other beacon I'm still spending $25 average and If I replace the batteries once every 4-6 months I'm out $0.25 per battery (CR2032) and I'm never without my beacon.\n\nAlso not having the Geofence is an even bigger set back. I don't want to have to go looking for something once I've lost it. The whole point is to not lose it and having the alert is huge. Walk away and your phone alerts you're out of range... OH! let me go back and get my item now.\n\nSo the number one beacon costs more because you can't replace the battery and won't alert you before you leave an item behind. But it looks cool, beeps, improved their range from the first generation and you can beep your phone but only if you actually have it.\n\nThat doesn't seem right. 0 Bill62 May 26, 2016, 4:22 PM In my experience, the tile has been a dismal failure. I tried an experiment and spent a few months with Bluetooth disabled on my phone to see if my tile locations would be updated by other tile users. Absolutely not one update within a two month period. When I bought my tiles, I did so with the understanding that when the battery died I needed to buy a new tile. I had no problem with that notion until the tile people quit reporting my tile location after one year even though my tile had very little use and still had battery life. They showed up green on my phone app, proving they still had battery life, but we're useless because the folks at Tile decided I needed to buy new tiles even though I had functioning tiles.\nThis is my first post on this topic, but I have a complete documentation of my experience, including communication with Tile support.\nNot impressive. 0 pixienightfae Sep 21, 2016, 2:41 PM I have tried two item finders - Tile and ProTag Duet.\n\nWith Tile, I was actually a Kickstarter contributor, and it was a pretty abysmal experience. They kept changing the date the tags would be sent out, butting right up to when we were supposed to receive them. Which seems okay, but then I couldn't use it with my phone because I had an Android (which not realizing that was my bad)... luckily, i have a husband with an iPhone. Eventually I stopped using it because they added too much bulk to my wallet. We went back to them and then it said we'd have to replace them - which it wouldn't let me do when we transferred two tiles to my own account (because when we started using them again there WAS an Android app). I hear they are developing a thin tracker now (perfect for wallets), so I might recommend it to my husband - who seems pretty happy with them.\n\nWith Duet, getting them was even WORSE. I was really looking forward to because able to have a credit thick tracker and the battery just didn't last NEARLY as long as it indicated it would. mostly because it would make the alarm go off on my phone if I didn't have the app open. Seriously. It was horrible. Then I broke the back of the other tracker when I went to replace the battery in it. So I called it on that one.\n\nI might be trying the pebblebee or the Chipolo next because really - it can't be WORSE than either one of those. If Pixies had an Android app, I'd be down to try them also. 0 MrRickV Nov 1, 2016, 4:57 PM I have tried and tried Tile, and the results were the same - Overated and not worth the annual fees that you must pay not once but two of three times a year. Two purchases, two models, and two returns. Wait for as better product. 0 Comment Firstname Submit",

Although this model is refurbished, it's backed by the same 1-year warranty as Amazon's new Kindles. With its 1448 x 1072 resolution and 300 pixels per inch (ppi) density, this tablet is a joy to read from and a winner of our coveted Editor's Choice award.\n\nWas $169 . Is Now $119.99 . See details on Amazon If your favorite vacations are those you spend reading by the pool, or if you can't possibly fall asleep without finishing one more chapter, an Amazon e-reader such as the $119 Kindle Paperwhite is a must-own. These E Ink devices are lightweight, easy to read in direct sunlight and as close to a paperback — without the bulk — that you can get. Plus, these days, they are almost the only game in town. It helps that Amazon is very good at this game. \nEditor's choice Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Best Overall E-Reader 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $119 Amazon Resolution (pixels per inch) 300 Wireless 802.11n, 3G Dimensions (inches) 6.7 x 4.6 x 0.36 Weight (ounces) 7.2 Claimed Battery Life 6 weeks* Physical Page Turn Buttons No Built-in Light Yes The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite offers the best balance of features and price. It supports all of the latest updates to the Kindle OS, including a new, more readable font and advanced typesetting. It also features a superbright light that makes reading in bed incredibly easy. Plus, you can get it with unlimited, lifetime 3G data connections for a little more than $100. \n\n* Based on a half hour of reading per day with wireless off and the light set at 10. ** Based on a half hour of reading per day with wireless off. \nWhy Kindles? Amazon wasn't the first company to release an E Ink e-reader (that was Sony, which launched the Librie in 2004), but the Kindle's release in 2007 sold out in 5 hours. That initial success was likely due to Amazon's huge library of e-content. Kindles have remained best sellers because of the quality and extra features. The sharp 6-inch displays on all three of Amazon's e-readers are easy on the eyes, thanks to the tablets' glare-free touch screens. With 4GB of storage, these devices can hold thousands of e-books. \nAmazon Kindle e-readers offer the company's excellent FreeTime Unlimited parental controls and child profiles. Plus, through the integration of the Goodreads social network, avid readers can connect with fellow bookworms and get new book suggestions.\nMORE: Best Tablets \nThrough Amazon's Kindle Unlimited service, you can get unlimited e-books for $9.99 per month. Of course, you can borrow e-books from the public library or even from your friends. And if you've finished a book you've bought and decide you want a physical copy, you can use Amazon's Kindle MatchBook program to get a discounted paper version.\nThrough the Family Library feature, you can link two Amazon accounts to share books across devices. Each adult account will retain its own furthest page read location, notes, highlights and social media connections. To link accounts on a Kindle you have to go into Menu > Settings > Registration And Household > Household And Family Library. From there, you tap Add A New Person and Add Adult. You’ll need the new person to enter their Amazon account ID and password. \nYou can also add up to four child profiles under Amazon Households. You’ll follow all the same procedures, but will tap Add Child instead of Add Adult at the end. Parents can then hand select which books their child can access. \nFor those looking to broaden their horizons, Amazon embeds a vocabulary builder and dictionary definitions within texts.\nEach of these devices, which cost from $79 to $199, boasts a broad range of special features that makes it unique.\nHow We Tested In addition to evaluating e-readers' size, weight, claimed battery life and design choices (such as page turns), we run a couple of tests on E Ink devices. If a Kindle offers a backlighting option, we test its brightness using our light meter. We compare page-turn speeds against its competition, too. The experience of reading on the device plays a huge role in these reviews. For instance, we look at the intuitiveness of the interface, the size of the available library of content and how well the special features (such as a Web browser or dictionary) work. \nEditor's choice Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Best Overall E-Reader 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $119 Amazon Resolution (pixels per inch) 300 Wireless 802.11n, 3G Dimensions (inches) 6.7 x 4.6 x 0.36 Weight (ounces) 7.2 Claimed Battery Life 6 weeks* Physical Page Turn Buttons No Built-in Light Yes The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite offers the best balance of features and price.

However, you will have to go without a backlight and forgo superslick construction.\n** Based on a half hour of reading per day with wireless off. \nAmazon Kindle Voyage Best E-Reader Display 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $199 Amazon Resolution (pixels per inch) 300 Wireless 802.11n, 3G Dimensions (inches) 6.4 x 4.5 x 0.3 Weight (ounces) 6.3 Claimed Battery Life 10 weeks* Physical Page Turn Buttons Yes Built-in Light Yes The Voyage is Amazon's flagship e-reader. It offers the highest resolution, with 300 pixels per inch. The battery should last a whopping 10 weeks on a charge. The Voyage boasts a bright light that is smart enough to adjust itself based on ambient light. Best of all, this e-reader offers touch-based buttons on the bezel, so it's the easiest device for both right- and left-handed readers to use.\n* Based on a half hour of reading per day with wireless off and the light set at 10.\nOther E-Readers Reviewed Kobo Aura One 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $229 Kobo Resolution (pixels per inch) 300 Wireless 802.11 b/g/n Dimensions (inches) 7.7 x 5.5 x 0.27 Weight (ounces) 8.1 Claimed Battery Life 1 month Physical Page Turn Buttons No Built-in Light Yes The best non-Kindle E-Reader we've reviewed offers a waterproof design that survived a series of dunks into our fish tank filled with tap water. The Aura One's 7.8-inch screen also helps it stand out, as it's notably larger than Amazon's 6-inch Kindles. Lastly, the Aura One's ambient light sensors offer excellent accuracy, so you won't have to fiddle with brightness settings.\nAmazon Kindle Oasis 7/10 Very good \nReview $289.99 Amazon The only thing holding Amazon's Kindle Oasis back from being among our favorite Kindles is its $290 price. The Oasis offers an awesome E Ink reading experience, lasts longer than other e-readers, and sports a uniquely compelling design. It even comes with its own detachable, leather case that hides an extended battery pack. I particularly liked the physical page turn buttons.\nKobo Aura H20 6/10 Worth considering \nReview $179.99 Kobo Resolution (pixels per inch) 265 Wireless 802.11n Dimensions (inches) 7.04 x 5.08 x 0.38 Weight (ounces) 8.21 Claimed Battery Life 8 weeks Physical Page Turn Buttons No Built-in Light Yes Pools, bathtubs and the beach are often favorite spots to read. Kobo is the only e-reader maker to make a water-resistant model, with the Aura H20. The bright and crisp screen is easy to read, and if you're not into Amazon's ecosystem, you can get books through Kobo's large store. Kobo makes reading a game, giving you awards for reading duration, location, time of day, etc. However, for $179, I would also want parental controls, better e-book prices and the ability to read a newspaper.\nBarnes & Noble Nook GlowLight Plus 5/10 Meh \nReview $129.99 Barnes & Noble The Barnes & Noble Nook GlowLight Plus suffers from sluggish performance. It also happens to be more $10 more expensive than the Kindle Paperwhite. However, it does sport a water- and dust-resistant, metal design, which makes it bathtub friendly. And it's sharp display is backlit, which makes it bedtime friendly, too. So, for my money, I'd get a Kindle. But if you're a bookworm that's invested in the Barnes & Noble universe, you might want to take a look. \n\n\nGadgets DEALS \nAmazon's Kindle for Kids Bundle includes the latest Kindle eReader, a free cover, and a 2-year worry-free guarantee that replaces your Kindle free of charge in the event it breaks.

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nNovember 21, 2016 5:22pm \nDespite the lack of an official announcement from Amazon, it looks like Amazon Prime Video originals are now available to stream in Canada, at least some of them. \nWhen setting up an Amazon Prime account in Canada a notification still states that Amazon Prime Video is now available in Canada . However, when you navigate to Amazon Prime Video on the U.S. Amazon website, as long as you also have a U.S. Amazon account, many of the platform’s originals like The Grand Tour, The Man in the High Castle and Red Oaks, are available to stream in Canada without the use or a proxy DNS or VPN service. \nOther Amazon content that isn’t an original, including content like Happy Gilmore, Matilda, Equals and Eye in the Sky, however, will not stream. A content licensing notification appears across the screen (see below). \nGizmodo Australia reported earlier today that Australians are able to access original content in Prime Video as well. In a statement to the publication, Amazon said the following: \n“We have not launched Amazon Prime in Australia. The service some Australians have signed-up for is the US or UK Prime Membership, which provides free, fast shipping within the US or UK, as well as access to some Amazon Originals, such as The Grand Tour, where we have the global rights.” \nSpecific Amazon originals, such as Transparent, Alpha House and Mozart in the Jungle, also receive a geographical content licensing error. These are Amazon originals currently available on Rogers and Shaw’s soon to be shuttered Shomi platform. Shomi is set to close on November 30th and once the service is dead, that original content might become available on Amazon Prime video as well. \nIt’s likely that the release of this content is likely a precursor to an official Canadian/global launch of Amazon’s streaming video service. \nIn a tweet posted to his official Twitter account, former Top Gear host and current host of The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime Video, Jeremy Clarkson, stated that his new show can be viewed in Ireland, Canada, Australia and “pretty well everywhere else,” emphasizing that Prime will soon go totally global. When we reached out to Amazon for comment, however, the service claimed the global release only applies to The Grand Tour. \nBNN recently reported that Amazon has been quietly acquiring Canadian rights to a variety of different shows over the past year, according to two of the publications sources. \nIf you’re interested in testing Amazon Prime Video out for yourself, follow this link . We’ve reached out to Amazon for comment and will update this story when we hear back. \nThanks Pat! \nIts working for me. Watching the grand tour! Al \nHow? Did you have to sign up on the US side? If I do, will Prime Video Canada automatically be working or would I have to sign separately? Patrick \nYou can sign up for a free trial in the USA until the Canadian launch happens and cancel the us one before paying Al",

      "text": "Asus ZenFone Max 3 Lands in the U.S., Priced to Sell for Just $149 GO It's now available at Amazon and B&H Photo retailers Nov 22, 2016 06:20 GMT · By Andrei Vlad · Share: The Asus ZenFone Max 3 is a pretty decent smartphone, which was officially unveiled back in the summer , but never actually made its debut in the United States. But now that the winter is coming, Asus has decided that its affordable Android smartphone would make a great gift for those who wish to buy such a phone. The ZenFone 3 Max is a mid-range smartphone that's now available for purchase at Amazon and B&H Photo for the same price, $149. Customers who order one benefit from free shipping and U.S. warranty. As mentioned earlier, the ZenFone 3 Max is a pretty decent device that comes with the Android 6.0 Marshmallow operating system right out of the box. We doubt it will be updated to Nougat, but anything is possible, especially that the phone was announced this year. Spec-wise, Asus' mid-range phone sports a 5.2-inch display that supports HD (720p) resolution and features a 75% screen-to-body ratio, as well as 400 nits brightness. On the inside, the ZenFone Max 3 packs a quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor, along with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory (expandable via microSD card). It features dual cameras with 13-megapixel photo snapper on the back and a secondary 5-megapixel selfie camera in the front. Asus Zenfone 3 Max Asus also added a fingerprint sensor on the back side, which is positioned right below the main camera. You can also swipe the fingerprint sensor to take a picture, a gesture that's been implemented by Google inside its Pixel phones. Another major highlight of the phone would be the impressive 4,100 mAh battery that should provide up to 18 hours of Wi-Fi web browsing, Asus claims. If you plan to buy the Asus ZenFone Max 3, then you should know that this is the unlocked version of the smartphone, so while it will work on AT&T and T-Mobile networks, it's not compatible with Sprint and Verizon. It's also worth mentioning that the smartphone comes with two SIM slots , one for microSIM and one for nanoSIM, which can only be used to add a microSD card. CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (6 Images)",

      "text": "Published: 6:20 AM, November 22, 2016 Updated: 7:50 AM, November 22, 2016 \nAmazon.com Inc <AMZN.O> is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. \nAmazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday. \nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty program offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99. \nAmazon has also reached out to smaller leagues such as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League for game rights, according to the Journal. \nThe company has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the report said. ( http://on.wsj.com/2eZJ4dy ) \nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican soccer league games, Walt Disney Co's <DIS.N> ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said. \nAmazon, the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment. \n\"We don't comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise, until appropriate,\" World Surf League spokesman said. \nMLS confirmed the talks with Amazon but declined to comment further. \nACC, 120 Sports, NLL, MLL and Campus Insiders could not be immediately reached for comment. \nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. \nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc <FB.O> and Twitter Inc <TWTR.N> have signed up deals to beef up their video services. \nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.

      "text": "Tamar Melike Tegün \nA Peruvian legend was proven by scientists: the boiling river of the Amazon exists. \nOne Peruvian geoscientist studying geothermal energy accidentally discovered a childhood legend. Andrés Ruzo followed a myth told by his grandfather about a boiling river. The childhood legend And proved to be fascinatingly real. \nAccording to the legend, Incan emperor Atahualpa was captured and killed by Spanish conquerors looking for gold. The Spaniards got what they wanted and returned to Spain to boast in their successes. However, gold brought on more Spaniards to the Incas. The Spaniards demanded to know where the gold could be found. Looking for revenge, the Incas told them to go deep into the Amazon: \n“You’ll find all the gold you want there. In fact, there is a city called Paititi made entirely of gold.” \nLegend says that the conquerors set off into the jungle, but the few that returned came back with stories of powerful shamans, warriors with poisoned arrows, trees so tall they blotted out the sun, spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole – and a river that boiled. [Image source: TED ] \nRuzo said the legend always fascinated him. Ruzo became a Ph.D. student working on geothermal energy potential in Peru. During his studies, he kept going back to the legend his grandfather told him. He began to wonder if the boiling river could actually be real. \nRuzo started asking questions to his colleagues, oil companies, mining companies, gas companies and even the government. None of his queries returned fruitful. Boiling rivers are most often associated with volcanic activity. Water needs a powerful heat source to produce such a large amount of geothermal energy. However, there are not volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in the majority of Peru. There shouldn’t be a boiling river. \nHowever, Ruzo said family members kept affirming his hunch: [Image source: TED ] \n“Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, ‘But no, Andrés, I’ve been there. I’ve swum in that river.’ Then my uncle jumps in. ‘No, Andrés, she’s not kidding. You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it’s protected by a powerful shaman. Your aunt, she’s friends with his wife.'” \nAccording to the Ruzo, he found himself hiking into the jungle, guided by his aunt. And 700 km away from the nearest volcanic center, they found the river. [Image source: TED ] \n“I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C. This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough. The river flowed hot and fast. I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman’s apprentice to the most sacred site on the river. And this is what’s bizarre — It starts off as a cold stream. Here, at this site, is the home of the Yacumama, mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit who births hot and cold water. Here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life. And learned indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, ‘boiled with the heat of the sun.'” [Image source: TED ] So why does the river boil? \nRuzo explains that the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults. Where these arteries come to the surface, we get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in this case, the boiling river. The deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets (aka geothermal gradient). The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seep down deep into the earth and come out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geological setting. \nRuzo and his friends are still working on to solve the unique secret of the river. And finding new things every day. If you like to learn all the story and get further scientific information, you can watch his TED Talk above. He also recently published a book about his adventures called The Boiling River .",

      "text": "The first episode of the reincarnation of the hit TV series \"Top Gear\" has become the biggest show premiere on Amazon's streaming service. \n\"Millions of Prime members\" streamed the first episode of \"The Grand Tour\" over the opening weekend in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan, the company said in a press release on Monday. \nViewership exceeded the previous record-breaking debut which was called \"The Man in the High Castle\", Amazon said without revealing exact figures. On the day that \"The Grand Tour\" debuted, total new Prime membership signups exceeded all previous days, apart from on its annual shopping event Prime Day. \nSource: Amazon The Grand Tour an Amazon original series Amazon Prime is the e-commerce giant's $99-a-year subscription service that gives users access to same-day deliveries, music and video streaming services. Prime Video is the name of Amazon's movie and TV streaming service included with the yearly subscription. The spike in Prime memberships was helped by the fact that Amazon cut its Prime membership price down to $79 over the debut weekend of \"The Grand Tour\". \nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May star in \"The Grand Tour\" which follows the trio's car adventures across the world. Amazon signed the group up last year after their show on the BBC called \"Top Gear\" was axed following a \"fracas\" involving Clarkson. \n\"The guys are back, doing what they do best - the chemistry between Jeremy, Richard and James is what makes 'The Grand Tour' so entertaining,\" Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, said in a press release. \nPrevious reports suggested that Amazon paid around $160 million to acquire the show. But, rival Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said this number is likely to be low. \n\"That's an under-reported number,\" said Sarandos. \"It was about a quarter of a billion dollars. We'll be able to figure out later what it was that made the show the show. It'll be interesting with 'Grand Tour' to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of Top Gear will people miss?\" Sarandos told The Telegraph in an interview on Monday. \nThe Netflix executive said that the streaming service also \"made a play\" for the show. \nBoth streaming services are on a spending drive to make original content. Netflix forecast that it will spend $6 billion on content in 2016 with 1,000 hours of new originally produced shows. In July, Amazon said it will double its video content spend in the second half of 2016, and triple its spending on original content.",

      "text": "Amazon Reportedly Interested In Sports Streaming by Ryan McQueeney Published on November 21, 2016 Trades from $ 3 \nAccording to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) is exploring several different options for entering into the sports broadcasting sphere and has been in talks for the livestreaming rights to games from the NBA, MLB, NFL, and a variety of smaller leagues. \nThe WSJ report cites people familiar with the matter who say that Amazon has been in discussions with these leagues over the past several months. Other than these giant domestic leagues, Amazon has also reportedly been in talks with Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, World Surf League, and sports networks like Campus Insiders and 120 Sports. \nThe report goes on to suggest that Amazon is interested in setting up a “premium, exclusive sports package” with some of these leagues, including the NBA, which would accompany an Amazon Prime subscription. \nAmazon has also apparently approached traditional TV networks, seeking game rights that aren’t currently being used. For example, the report says that Amazon has approached Univision Communications to see if it would consider packaging Mexican soccer league games that it could air but doesn’t; the report also says that Amazon has talked to Walt Disney Co.’s ( DIS - Free Report ) ESPN and ONE World Sports, which have the rights to a range of offbeat games and leagues. \nAmazon’s sports interest is also at an international level, as the company recently paid $10,000 for a tender document to potentially bid on Indian Premier League cricket games. Amazon is also looking at packaging an international package for NBA games, according to the report. \nIt seems like Amazon is going with the “cast a wide enough net” philosophy when it comes to its sports ventures, and that makes sense for a company that has no experience in this business. Whatever happens, any sports streaming offerings would take Amazon Prime one step closer to being a must-have living room feature. \nStocks that Aren't in the News.

      "text": "Amazon is taking yet another step toward satisfying cord cutters’ every television need. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the online retailer — which has already gone to great lengths to prove that it’s much more than your digital shopping destination — is “exploring an ambitious offensive aimed at infiltrating the last bastion of traditional pay-television: live sports.”\nThe Journal reports that over the last few months, Jeff Bezos’ company has held negotiations for live game rights with industry giants like the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and the National Football League, as well as other such groups as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, and World Surf League.\n“My sense is they are interested in anything that might be out there,” said Chad Swofford, vice president of digital for the ACC, a college sports conference, told the WSJ. But for the time being, Amazon is staying tight-lipped on any plans for expansion its Prime Video service may have.\nIf Amazon is indeed scouting new entry points into sports broadcasting, which could be a highly lucrative business, it would seem to make sense. After all, live sports is one of the last differentiable elements offered by traditional pay-television. Some other major tech players have already begun streaming such events — Facebook and Twitter are both in the game, and Amazon may be playing a bit of catch-up at this point.\nBut don’t get too excited about the possibility of live sports being added to Amazon. It won’t come free — even if you already have a Prime subscription. As the Journal reports, “With at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear.”\nIt’s true — Instagram confirms that it’s working on a live video feature Google signs with CBS as plans for its live TV streaming service move forward Amazon looks to get in the game by streaming live sporting events",

      "text": "If you’re angling to get a new MacBook Pro but aren’t up for spending a minimum of $1799 to pick up a model featuring Apple’s new Touch Bar, Amazon is currently selling Apple’s entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans the Touch Bar) for just $1399. All told, that represents a $100 discount compared to what you’ll find anywhere else.\nDON’T MISS: Samsung says the Galaxy S7 isn’t prone to explosions like the Note 7\nSpec wise, the machine sports a 13.3-inch display, a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, a revamped keyboard design, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB worth of storage. Sure, you may not get Apple’s newfangled Touch Bar, but seeing as how it’s been quite a few years since Apple refreshed its MacBook Pro line in a meaningful way, this particular deal is worth paying attention to if you need a new machine and aren’t keen on breaking the bank this holiday shopping season.\nFor what it’s worth, reviews of Apple’s new MacBook Pro line up have been mostly positive. The Touch Bar aside, reviewers have found the machine to be faster than the specs would otherwise indicate. Additionally, battery life was found to be superb.\nWe should also mention that Apple’s new MacBook Pro models are incredibly light and weigh in at just a hair over 3 pounds. If you’re still toting around an old Apple notebook, you’ll definitely notice an immediate weight difference once you upgrade to one of Apple’s newer models. In effect, Apple managed to roll out a MacBook Pro in a MacBook Air’s body.\nTo this point, Ars writes:\nAt 3.02 pounds, the new Pro is around half a pound lighter than last year’s and roughly the same weight as the 13-inch MacBook Air. I’m jumping from the 13-inch Air to the 13-inch Pro since I can’t quite live with the 12-inch MacBook’s performance or its individual port, so if you’re making that jump the laptop is going to feel exactly the same in your bag. The weight savings is noticeable but not life-changing if you’re coming from an earlier Retina model, but remember that it’s a full 1.5 pounds lighter than a pre-Retina, 13-inch unibody Pro—if you’re coming from one of those older machines, it makes a huge difference.\nMake sure to check the deal out over at Amazon while it’s still hot.\nTrending right now:\nSay goodbye to Apple’s Wi-Fi routers How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 Every movie and TV show being removed from Netflix in November See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

So a month sago, I just picked it up for £36 with the DLC and not regretted it once. OMG its awesome! Ok, they have reduced Rush down to 24 instead of 64 which kinda sucks as I loved Rush bu the Operations mode kind kills over everything else. Wow its intense and its just a great game. Glad they didnt go for a modern shooter. I Loved Battlefield 1942 and now WW1, hell yeah! have some heat OP!",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe British edition of Top Gear holds the record for being the most widely watched factual television program in the world. Having departed that show under a cloud, the presenting trio of Clarkson, Hammond and May had a lot to live up to with their new show on Amazon, but it turns out The Grand Tour fully met expectations, and then some. \nIf you’ve watched it, you’ll know it’s pretty much Top Gear with a much, much bigger budget. As it’s an Amazon Prime exclusive and currently only available in the US, UK, Germany, Austria, and Japan (officially anyway), it was never going to match Top Gear for viewing figures but it is still Amazon’s biggest hit to date. \nThe retail giant hasn’t released any actual viewing figures -- presumably because they’ll be much lower than most big broadcast television shows -- but it does say \" The Grand Tour has become the biggest show premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video, with millions of Prime members streaming the first episode\". \nIn addition, Amazon says The Grand Tour is \"also receiving unprecedented customer and critical acclaim with the show being the top rated TV show or movie on IMDb, the world’s most popular source of movie and TV data, with an overall rating of 9.6 and over 10,000 votes. The show is rated 4.9 out of 5 stars by more than 15,000 customers on Amazon, and currently has a score of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes\". \nLast Friday, on the day The Grand Tour debuted, Amazon says new Prime membership sign-ups \"exceeded all previous days with the exception of Prime Day\", which is the day when Amazon introduces numerous exclusive offers for Prime members. \nNew episodes of the show are released on Fridays, and Amazon is planning a worldwide launch in December. \nDid you watch the first episode, and if so, what did you think of it?",

      "text": "Tweet \nFor a limited time, the price of the Sony Xperia XZ has been reduced by $74.22 on Amazon . For those keeping track, that’s a $74.22 on top of the $50 price reduction the Xperia XZ was given in late October, lowering the final price to just $575.77 . The Sony Xperia XZ’s main highlight is its 23MP camera with triple image sensors (Predictive Hybrid Autofocus, Laser Autofocus, and RGBC IR) which can capture images instantaneously and track moving object better than any other smartphone on the market. \nThe Sony Xperia XZ sold by Amazon does come with a US warranty and is fully compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile networks. Since the Sony Xperia XZ’s reduced price is featured as part of Amazon’s Black Friday Deals Week , don’t be surprised if the phone’s regular $649.99 price tag shows back up in the next day or two. \nSource: Amazon Nick is a tech enthusiast who has a soft spot for HTC and its devices.

      "title": "Pilot Strike May Hurt Amazon's Air Operation During Holidays - Bloomberg",
      "text": "Pilot Strike May Hurt Amazon’s Air Operation During Holidays Spencer Soper November 22, 2016 — 2:51 AM EST November 22, 2016 — 3:28 AM EST Union says Amazon partner ATSG lacks pilots to meet demand Cargo carrier handles 35 daily flights for online retailer \nAbout 250 pilots employed by a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc. went on strike to protest alleged staffing shortages at the cargo carrier, threatening to ground flights for Amazon.com Inc. and DHL Worldwide Express during the busy holiday shopping season. \nATSG’s ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, which will be affected by the strike, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. The pilots are picketing outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe action comes as the retail industry’s busiest period gets into full swing and spending continues to shift from physical stores to computers and smartphones. Online spending in November and December will increase 11 percent this year to $91.6 billion, according to an October forecast from Adobe Systems Inc. \nThe union says ABX Air is violating its contract by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments -- preventing them from taking time off -- because it doesn’t have enough pilots to meet the growing demands of companies like Amazon. The world’s biggest online retailer in March announced plans to lease 20 Boeing 767 freighters from ATSG to help it move inventory around the country. Amazon, DHL and ATSG weren’t immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours. \nPilot strikes in the U.S. are rare due to the Railway Labor Act, a 90-year-old federal law intended to prevent labor disputes from disrupting commerce. The pilots say their strike is allowed because of the contract violations, and voted to authorize a strike in May. \n“For the past two years, we’ve been warning them that they are dangerously short on pilots,” said Rick Ziebarth, 59, who’s been with ABX for 39 years. “The lifestyle of our crews have really taken a nose-dive. I can’t tell you how many birthdays, anniversaries and even funerals pilots can’t attend as a result of these emergency assignments.” \nPilots on Amazon runs fly night and day from Wilmington to Dallas, Texas, to Stockton, California, to Rockford, Illinois, and back to Wilmington -- sometimes with nowhere to rest but the cockpit, Ziebarth said. Such routes can increase fatigue because of rotations between night and day, he said. Pilots are willing to make accommodations for customers but want the company to abide by its contract by honoring vacation time and regulating emergency assignments, he said. \nAmazon’s air cargo operation is part of efforts to reduce its dependence on United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp., as it expands a $99-a-year Prime membership service that can deliver orders in as little as a day. In addition to ATSG, Amazon in May entered into an agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. to acquire and operate 20 Boeing Co. 767-300 freighters for the online retailer. \nA dedicated fleet helps Amazon shuffle inventory around the country more efficiently to meet demand spikes, while reducing the inventory it has to carry nationally.

Its logistics partners have to compete for pilots with UPS, FedEx and passenger carriers that pay better wages and offer better benefits. That’s a different game than filling warehouses with temporary workers because pilots require years of training, especially for big aircraft, said Matt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics in Golden, Colorado.\n“I don’t think Amazon has encountered a problem like the pilot shortage before and it doesn’t have a quick and easy solution,” Barton said. “A lot of these carriers are going to have a hard time finding the pilots they need.\" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "Amazon mulls bundling premium sports package for Prime subscribers By John Glenday - 22 November 2016 09:35am Amazon mulls bundling premium sports package for Prime subscribers \nAmazon is reportedly seeking ways to make its Prime membership package more tempting to consumers by bundling a premium sports package offering live basketball and American Football. \nThe bold move would usurp the traditional dominance of pay to view broadcasters in airing live coverage of the NBA and NFL , both of which are said to be amongst those to have entered talks with the e-commerce provider. \nBy sweetening the Prime deal Amazon hopes to lure many more subscribers willing to stump up $99 per year to become a member of the Amazon family although the firm has yet to comment publicly on its plans. \nTraditional broadcasters are likely to be sitting up and taking notice however, mindful that any bleed of sporting rights to streaming services could sweep the rug from under much of the industry. \nAmazon isn’t alone in its pretensions however with Facebook and Twitter also seeking to ramp up their sport offerings in tandem with ratings declines on the major broadcasters. \nSource: WSJ John Glenday \nJohn Glenday is responsible for compiling The Drum's daily morning bulletin and ensuring that overnight breaking news is covered while you're still brushing your teeth. Can also make a mean cup of tea.",

      "text": "Amazon has big plans to expand its online tickets business A program called Prime Tickets is coming, too. Amazon has sold tickets to De La Soul concerts in the U.K. Tristan Fewings / Getty Amazon launched its online ticketing business just last year, but it already has plans to expand it in Europe, Asia and potentially the U.S, according to a series of job listings posted recently. The hiring efforts are part of a new initiative to “position Amazon Tickets as the world’s premier destination for purchasing tickets,” according to one posting. The job listings also hint at plans to integrate ticket sales into the Prime membership program with something Amazon is calling Prime Tickets, the details of which were not laid out. Amazon first launched Amazon Tickets in the U.K. last year to sell tickets to concerts featuring artists like Elton John and theater performances such as “Wicked” and “The Book of Mormon.” Part of the company’s pitch has been that it displays ticket fees upfront, and customers can easily pay with the payment method they have on file with Amazon. \nCode Commerce Series is coming to SF on Dec. 6 \nDon't miss interviews with Jack Dorsey, Kate Hudson and Apple Pay Register Now In one of the recent job postings, Amazon said it is looking to hire new employees “to develop our international expansion strategy for Europe and Asia.” The company has also been hiring Amazon Tickets employees at its headquarters in Seattle, potentially signaling plans for a U.S. ticketing business. “[O]ur vision goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show,” one posting reads. “The ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.” An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. The initiative is being led by a vice president, Ian Freed, who has been with Amazon for more than a decade and once served as CEO Jeff Bezos’ technical assistant. Freed was most recently the executive who launched Amazon’s Fire Phone. He then took a year-long sabbatical, and now runs Amazon’s fledgling restaurant-delivery service, in addition to Amazon Tickets . If Amazon attempts to enter the U.S. ticket-selling business, it would face an uphill battle. Ticketmaster and its parent company Live Nation are already dominant here, and Amazon could struggle getting access to quality ticket inventory. Venues, music artists, promoters and sports teams in the U.S. often cut exclusive deals with these sites, so Amazon would have to convince them to alter their practices. recode_divider",

      "text": "Source: Wikimedia Commons Over 16 million cars and light trucks will be sold in the U.S. this year, and millions more in the U.K. and Germany. Tapping into that market, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) paid an extraordinary sum to launch an auto TV show, “The Grand Tour,” for its Prime members. Based on early results, the investment appears to have paid off. However, in keeping with tradition, Amazon did not offer exact numbers.\nThe company reported:\nThe debut episode of the highly anticipated new Amazon Original Series, The Grand Tour, has become the biggest show premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video, with millions of Prime members streaming the first episode in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan over the opening weekend. Viewership has even exceeded that of the previous number one show, The Man in The High Castle. Additionally, the day The Grand Tour debuted, total new Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon’s renowned Prime Day.\nThe Grand Tour is also receiving unprecedented customer and critical acclaim with the show being the top rated TV show or movie on IMDb, the world’s most popular source of movie and TV data, with an overall rating of 9.6 and over 10,000 votes. The show is rated 4.9 out of 5 stars by more than 15,000 customers on Amazon, and currently has a score of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that Amazon paid $250 million for the program. The hosts of the show previously appeared in “Top Gear,” which aired on the BBC.\nThe Grand Tour represents two risks for Amazon. One is that it ups the original programming price wars, which reflect investments by Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), movie studios, and cable channels. When it released earnings, Netflix management said it would spend $6 billion on programs in the next year. It is not certain that these investments are better than content licensed from other sources.\nThe other risk is that the market is saturated. The media is crowded with car magazines, car shows, car ads, and car races. Gaining attention is hard, to say the least.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   \n \n ",

      "text": "\"We're now in distribution abundance,\" says Jon Fine, \"so if you're telling me that Amazon is bad for culture, like seriously, fuck you.\"\nFine is the executive editor of Inc. and the author of the acclaimed new memoir, Your Band Sucks: What I Saw at Indie Rock's Failed Revolution (But Can No Longer Hear) , a rollicking tour of his days in the alternative music scene of the late 1980s and '90s.\n\"Somewhere in the latter half of the eighties, it became much easier for weird bands to do band things: play shows, make records, go on tour. The hows and whys that had been so elusive just a few years earlier were now shared through surprisingly effective samizdat and word-of-mouth networks,\" writes Fine, a member of \"resolutely non-famous bands\" such as Bitch Magnet and Coptic Light. \nYour Band Sucks is at once a remembrance of things past and a polemic against the generic, mainstream culture and political correctness that Fine found deadening while growing up in New Jersey and attending college at Oberlin. It's a book that is by turns angry, funny, and infuriating. Throughout, it perfectly captures the adolescent anger and inchoate longing that has always fueled rock music and provided the soundtrack to DIY forms of cultural production and consumption.\n\"If there's anything that will turn you into a foaming-at-the-mouth Tea Party[er] and get you throwing stones at every liberal shibboleth you can get your hands on, it's going to Oberlin,\" Fine says. At the same time, his urge to create radically different music far beyond anything that was being played on MTV or commercial radio. \"I felt like there was a lot not being said\" in the mainstream, he explains. \"Howard Jones had a song called ' Things Can Only Get Better ,' really bouncy, annoying optimistic. I was like, 'You're actually wrong! Things suck and they are getting worse!'...I actually got mad about it: 'How dare you say that!' You couldn't find music easily that was talking about the other stuff....There was so much shading I wanted to get at.\"\n\"Any time you're identifying strongly with a subculture that's a minority in America, whether it's weird underground music or libertarianism, you've gotta know that you're gonna be kind of despised,\" says Fine, drawing an analogy between outre art and politics. \"You've got to be a little bit pugilistic about it and furthermore, you understand yourself not just by the people around you but the people who are not around you and are doing the things you think are weak and inept.\"\nNick Gillespie talked to Fine about how alternative and independent culture has flourished over the past 30 years and whether—Howard Jones be praised!—things may actually be getting better.\nAbout 7.30 minutes. Produced by Joshua Swain, with camera by Swain and Todd Krainin.\nSpecial Note: Scroll down for a special MP3 recording of the full conversation between Fine and Gillespie. This 44-minute conversation ranges as widely and obscurely as a Bitch Magnet tour across questions of politics, music, and culture.",

      "title": "Pilot strike could hurt Amazon’s air operation during holidays",
      "text": "Seattle: About 250 pilots employed by a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc went on strike to protest alleged staffing shortages at the cargo carrier, threatening to ground flights for Amazon.com Inc and DHL Worldwide Express during the busy holiday shopping season.\nATSG’s ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, which will be affected by the strike, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. The pilots are picketing outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.\nThe action comes as the retail industry’s busiest period gets into full swing and spending continues to shift from physical stores to computers and smartphones. Online spending in November and December will increase 11 per cent this year to $91.6 billion, according to an October forecast from Adobe Systems Inc.\nThe union says ABX Air is violating its contract by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments — preventing them from taking time off — because it doesn’t have enough pilots to meet the growing demands of companies like Amazon. The world’s biggest online retailer in March announced plans to lease 20 Boeing 767 freighters from ATSG to help it move inventory around the country.\nPilot strikes in the US are rare due to the Railway Labor Act, a 90-year-old federal law intended to prevent labour disputes from disrupting commerce. The pilots say their strike is allowed because of the contract violations, and voted to authorise a strike in May. \n“For the past two years, we’ve been warning them that they are dangerously short on pilots,” said Rick Ziebarth, 59, who’s been with ABX for 39 years. “The lifestyle of our crews have really taken a nose-dive. I can’t tell you how many birthdays, anniversaries and even funerals pilots can’t attend as a result of these emergency assignments.”\nPilots on Amazon runs fly night and day from Wilmington to Dallas, Texas, to Stockton, California, to Rockford, Illinois, and back to Wilmington — sometimes with nowhere to rest but the cockpit, Ziebarth said. Such routes can increase fatigue because of rotations between night and day, he said. Pilots are willing to make accommodations for customers but want the company to abide by its contract by honouring vacation time and regulating emergency assignments, he said.\nAmazon’s air cargo operation is part of efforts to reduce its dependence on United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp., as it expands a $99-a-year Prime membership service that can deliver orders in as little as a day. In addition to ATSG, Amazon in May entered into an agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc to acquire and operate 20 Boeing Co. 767-300 freighters for the online retailer.\nA dedicated fleet helps Amazon shuffle inventory around the country more efficiently to meet demand spikes, while reducing the inventory it has to carry nationally.\nThe ABX strike underscores how a national pilot shortage could hinder Amazon’s air cargo aspirations. Its logistics partners have to compete for pilots with UPS, FedEx and passenger carriers that pay better wages and offer better benefits. That’s a different game than filling warehouses with temporary workers because pilots require years of training, especially for big aircraft, said Matt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics in Golden, Colorado.\n“I don’t think Amazon has encountered a problem like the pilot shortage before and it doesn’t have a quick and easy solution,” Barton said. “A lot of these carriers are going to have a hard time finding the pilots they need.”",

      "text": "Amazon Launching $100,000 Esports Tournament in Las Vegas Getting paid to play. By Seth Macy \nAmazon revealed Champions of Fire, its new appstore eSports tournament. The event is being held in Las Vegas, NV on December 2. \nThe \"world’s biggest celebrity video game streamers\" will be competing for a piece of a $100,000 USD prize \nA two-hour special of highlights from the tournament will air on the CBS Sports Network December 12 at 7 pm PT, and the live event will stream on Twitch as it happens. \nFive competitors will go head to head in \"Disney Crossy Road, Pac-Man 256, Bloons TD Battles, 8 Ball Pool,\" and Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition, according to Amazon. All 16 competitors must \"show their supreme skills\" in all 5 games to win the $30,000 grand prize. \nOn the docket for the event are streamers Boxbox, Professor Broman, Northernlion, lolRenaynay, Brian Kibler, \"and more,\" according to Amazon. \nFree tickets for the event are offered on the Champions of Fire tournament's official website. \nAmazon dipping its toes into the eSports tournament scene is probably not surprising, given that the company is sending out feelers into all sorts of different pop culture places. Its success with original programming has led to the creation of a new mafia crime Amazon original series starring Robert DeNiro and Julianne Moore.

      "text": "Source: Wikimedia Commons Over 16 million cars and light trucks will be sold in the U.S. this year, and millions more in the U.K. and Germany. Tapping into that market, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) paid an extraordinary sum to launch an auto TV show, “The Grand Tour,” for its Prime members. Based on early results, the investment appears to have paid off. However, in keeping with tradition, Amazon did not offer exact numbers.\nThe company reported:\nThe debut episode of the highly anticipated new Amazon Original Series, The Grand Tour, has become the biggest show premiere ever on Amazon Prime Video, with millions of Prime members streaming the first episode in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan over the opening weekend. Viewership has even exceeded that of the previous number one show, The Man in The High Castle. Additionally, the day The Grand Tour debuted, total new Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon’s renowned Prime Day.\nThe Grand Tour is also receiving unprecedented customer and critical acclaim with the show being the top rated TV show or movie on IMDb, the world’s most popular source of movie and TV data, with an overall rating of 9.6 and over 10,000 votes. The show is rated 4.9 out of 5 stars by more than 15,000 customers on Amazon, and currently has a score of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that Amazon paid $250 million for the program. The hosts of the show previously appeared in “Top Gear,” which aired on the BBC.\nThe Grand Tour represents two risks for Amazon. One is that it ups the original programming price wars, which reflect investments by Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), movie studios, and cable channels. When it released earnings, Netflix management said it would spend $6 billion on programs in the next year. It is not certain that these investments are better than content licensed from other sources.\nThe other risk is that the market is saturated. The media is crowded with car magazines, car shows, car ads, and car races. Gaining attention is hard, to say the least.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   \n \n ",

      "text": "Meet Brand Central, Amazon's secret new plan to squash counterfeits Meet Brand Central, Amazon's secret new plan to squash counterfeits Just ahead of holiday shopping, the e-retailer is confronting its problem with knockoffs and fakes by going on the offensive. Meet Brand Central, Amazon's secret new plan to squash counterfeits 0 Up Next The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 Enlarge Image \nHere are a handful of phony Amazon listings using stolen designs from baby clothing seller Fayebeline. The California company got Amazon to remove the listings. Photo by Courtesy of Fayebeline \nHugh Milstein wishes Amazon had rolled out its Brand Central fraud-fighting tools last month. \nBack then, DigitalFusion , his 25-employee digital photography business in Culver City, California, was selling high-quality space art on the e-retailer's site. The posters got great reviews, including a shout-out from Star Trek 's George Takei . \nThen, a rash on knockoffs showed up on Amazon, undercutting Milstein's prices and dragging down his reputation. \n\"This is unfair competition,\" Milstein said of the fakes. \"Our sales have gone to virtually nothing.\" \nMilstein's complaints haven't fallen on deaf ears. Amazon, plagued by everything from phony Birkenstock sandals to knockoff iPhone chargers , is going on the offensive. One step it's considering is Brand Central, a suite of digital tools under development to help sellers protect their brands from fakes and knockoffs, according to two people with knowledge of the project. \nThat effort comes as the company filed its first-ever lawsuits against alleged counterfeit sellers last week. More suits are expect. \nDetails about Brand Central remain vague, but the people describing the project say Brand Central will help smaller sellers protect their trademarks and other intellectual property. Ensuring the source of products is also part of the project. \nIt's unclear when, or if, Brand Central will roll out publicly or whether that name will be used. \nWith more than 300 million listings, it's hard to know how significant Amazon's counterfeit problem is. In its lawsuits, Amazon attributed the activity to a \"a small number of bad actors.\" Still, Amazon's latest actions demonstrate it wants to get rid of fakes before those products erode consumer trust. Without that confidence, Amazon might struggle to maintain its customer-focused reputation and ensure shoppers keep coming back. \nAn Amazon spokesperson on Monday declined to confirm the existence of Brand Central but said in a statement the company \"has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site\" and it's working aggressively to remove fakes. 13 Amazon Prime Now: A peek inside the Manhattan warehouse (pictures) \nAmazon isn't the only online seller to face a counterfeiting problem. Chinese e-retail juggernaut Alibaba and handmade goods marketplace Etsy have also struggled with the issue. And the problem isn't limited to the online world; nearly half a trillion dollars in phony goods were imported worldwide in 2013. \nAmazon already has a Seller Central site that helps its third-party vendors list and maintain their inventories. Seller Central, however, doesn't offer many tools to assist companies that own a brand name. Instead, the site is more useful for resellers of commodity products like paper towels or phone cases. \nOne of the people familiar with Brand Central said Amazon has made the project a priority because sellers with their own brands are among its fastest-growing segments and the company wants to support those new merchants. \n\"I do feel very good about the efforts they are bringing forward,\" said Randy Hetrick, founder and CEO of exercise equipment maker TRX , who said he will be part of a test group for Brand Central. \"Conceptually, it's long overdue.\" \nAfter working closely with the company on the issue, he said Amazon's approach to killing off fakes has undergone \"a sea change.\" Hetrick, a co-plaintiff with Amazon in one of the new lawsuits, said he expects the online seller to significantly attack the counterfeit problem over the next year as it adds staff and digital tools. \nAmazon already has a handful of anti-counterfeiting measures, including reporting tools for sellers and a registry to help merchants manage their brands on Amazon. The company recently made it harder for unauthorized sellers to list items by requiring third-party merchants to pay a fee for listing top brands like Nike or Hasbro. They also have to prove they got the inventory from the manufacturer or an authorized distributor. \nShowing support for these third-party sellers is particularly important, since half of what Amazon sells comes from them.

AP Photo/Ben Margot\nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season.\nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages.\nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price.\nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots.\nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union.\nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing.\nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union.\nAmazon and ABX Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.\nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nSEE ALSO: Shipping disaster looms as UPS workers vote to strike NOW WATCH: We put the most popular frozen pizzas to the test — the winner was clear Retail Amazon Holiday Shopping Shipping Holidays Black Friday",

      "text": "AP Photo/Ben Margot \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages.  \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to  Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nSo far this year,  pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to  the union.  \nAmazon and ABX Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled. \nNOW WATCH: These are the best watches at every price point \n",

      "text": "(A pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon.AP Photo/Ben Margot) \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nAmazon and ABX Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled. \nNOW WATCH: Fashion designer Christian Siriano explains why malls are dying \n\nMore From Business Insider \nWalmart's Cyber Monday plans should have Amazon terrified \nBlack Friday is dying a slow death \nAn unlikely type of store is expected to defy the curse plaguing retail and crush Black Friday",

      "text": "Get Titanfall 2 for £25 on Amazon right now By Richard Scott-Jones \nUs PC folk can get an Origin code for Titanfall 2 for only £24.99, as Amazon gets ready for Black Friday. \nWhat other crazy deals are coming up this weekend? Catch them all by following our Black Friday coverage. \nThe deal is available now on Amazon here , and is the latest nadir in tumbling prices for the triple-A game despite it launching less than a month ago. \nTitanfall 2's mostly stellar reviews were not reflected in its sales , with many criticising publisher EA for choosing to launch the game within weeks of the year's other two biggest shooters. Despite this, EA insists it is \" committed to the franchise \". \nTitanfall 2 launched with a full-fat, £50 price tag, meaning Amazon's sale represents a half-price cut. For comparison, EA's other big shooter, Battlefield 1, launched a week before Titanfall and is reduced to £29.99 . \nSuch drastic reductions on premium games that are less than a month old is a relatively recent phenomenon, and perhaps reflects the impact of Black Friday sales on the games industry. Or perhaps they reflect a broader problem with triple-A this year . It'll be very interesting to see how well the big publishers do out of this weekend's big sales.",

      "text": "0 COMMENTS LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN: Amazon wants to get in on a game that could tip the scales for possible cord-cutters: live sports. The e-commerce giant has been in talks for live game rights with heavy-hitters like the NBA, Major League Baseball and the NFL, as well as a number of smaller players like Major League Soccer, the ACC and lacrosse leagues, reports The Wall Street Journal. While the details of a potential premium exclusive sports package are still up in the air, the mere presence of sports could help Amazon attract new Prime subscribers and customers for a possible online “skinny bundle” of live channels, potentially undoing the “glue” holding the cable bundle together. In its aggressive content play, Amazon has gone so far as to canvass traditional TV networks for game rights they aren’t using, as well as look for overseas rights to cricket and NBA games. The challenge is that premium rights are largely tied up in multibillion-dollar contracts with broadcast and cable networks until early next decade. But Amazon is in this for the long game, and that could be a real threat to traditional pay TV.\nTO THE TOWER: President-elect Donald Trump invited top executives and anchors from the major broadcast and cable networks to an off-the-record meeting on Monday at Trump Tower, where he criticized their election and postelection coverage. He complained about the media’s predictions that he would lose to Hillary Clinton and chastised NBC News for using an unflattering picture of him , reports CMO Today. The meeting, during which Mr. Trump said he wants to wipe the slate clean, included executives like CNN President Jeff Zucker and Fox News Co-Presidents Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine, as well as on-air talent like NBC’s Lester Holt and ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. The New York Post described the meeting as a “firing squad”--a report that Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, dismissed. She told reporters that the meeting was “cordial” and allowed both sides to “hit the reset button.” After the meeting, Mr. Trump bypassed the media and uploaded a YouTube video in which he describes his transition plans. Mr. Trump had made plans to hold a second meeting with the New York Times on Tuesday, but early Tuesday morning he tweeted that he canceled it when the Times “changed the terms and conditions of the meeting at the last moment.”\nIMITATION GAME: They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Facebook’s photo-sharing app Instagram has unveiled private photos that disappear after being viewed —a new product that takes direct aim at the vanishing-pic pioneer Snapchat, reports The Wall Street Journal. It’s also launching a live video product where the video can’t be viewed again after the stream ends. The product will live within Instagram Stories, where people share photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. Instagram hopes to make live video less about broadcasting and more about hanging out, said Kevin Weil, Instagram’s head of product. Instagram adopted its Stories product , which is also akin to Snapchat’s, this summer. These launches might make competitor Snap Inc. seethe on an ordinary day, but Snap is keeping busy with its own PR blitz as it brings its new Spectacles product to New York City . The company is selling its camera-enabled glasses through a vending machine in a pop-up in Midtown Manhattan following a similar launch strategy in other cities.\nGETTING COMFY: BuzzFeed and NBCUniversal are getting cozier. NBCU confirmed its latest $200 million strategic investment in the digital media darling, including efforts for the two companies to intertwine their ad sales and production , reports CMO Today. With NBCU doubling down on its investment, the companies will now co-sell ad packages that could include space on each other’s properties, as well as combine content studio resources to work on native ad production and social distribution. But for NBCU, the latest investment means more than just access to a content studio that produces branded cat videos. It means more control over its position in BuzzFeed, people familiar with the matter told CMO Today. Provisions include the right to additional shares if BuzzFeed’s IPO price comes in lower than NBCU’s investment valuation, as well as being first in line for a pay back if the company is sold. For BuzzFeed, the funding and resources provide security and more scale as it targets an IPO by 2018.\nElsewhere Reese Witherspoon has teamed up with Otter Media, a joint venture of the Chernin Group and AT&T, to launch Hello Sunshine. The consumer-facing content company plans to create and aggregate “powerful content by and for women across all platforms.” [ Variety ]\nThe Financial Times is looking at possible acquisitions of companies that can boost its digital subscriptions business, as well as technology firms that can strengthen its data and analytics capabilities. [ Bloomberg ]\nA number of brands that buy internet ads using automated technology, including Allstate, ModCloth, Nest, Earthlink and SoFi, want to blacklist alt-right news site Breitbart, which has been accused of catering to white nationalists, among other things. Many brands didn’t know they were appearing on the site, which has come under scrutiny since its former chairman, Steve Bannon, was named as President-elect Donald Trump’s chief strategist. [ Digiday ]\nMonths after acquiring Cablevision from the Dolan family, Altice is entwined in public and heated negotiations over programming fees with cable brand AMC Networks, which is also controlled by the Dolans. [ New York Post ]\nThe fake news epidemic shows no signs of abating with the next generation of voters, at least according to a Stanford University study of 7,804 students from middle school through college. The study found that 82% of middle-schoolers couldn’t distinguish between an ad labeled “sponsored content” and a real news story on a website. [ WSJ ]\nAT&T Inc., Dish Network and ad holding company WPP have together acquired addressable ad technology company Invidi Technologies Corp. AT&T will hold a controlling stake. [ WSJ ]\nConservatives are taking to the app stores on Apple and Google to give low ratings to apps from publishers like CNN, Mic, Quartz and USA Today, which they accuse of having a liberal bias. [ Digiday ]\nThe BBC has named Amol Rajan its first media editor to cover an industry that faces “unprecedented challenges,” said BBC Director of News and Current Affairs James Harding.
