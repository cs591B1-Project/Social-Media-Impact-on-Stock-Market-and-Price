      "text": "Unless you live under a rock, you must have come across this viral video on Facebook over the last few days. It came out of nowhere and conquered our feeds, yet all for good reason. Parallel Studio directed the short animation that is simply entitled “Unsatisfying,” which is about unsatisfying life situations: the frustrating, annoying, disappointing little things of everyday life, that are so painful to live or even to watch. As you watch short, which is just over a minute long, you will most likely recognize each situation that you are presented with and remember the unsettling feeling when you were last in that situation. Simply brilliant and beautifully animated at the same time.\nDirection Animation and illustration : Parallel Studio\nSound Design : Zelig Sound\nMusic : Samuel Barber\nSpecial Thanks to : Hugo Leick\n",

      "text": "Evidently, just because you have a child does not automatically mean you are at liberty to name him/her whatever you want. \nOver the years, courts have had to ban parents from giving their children ridiculous names. \nHere are 10 funny examples. Cyanide \nA woman was recently told by the court that naming her child ‘Cyanide’ would only hurt him in future. Chow Tow \nThe Malaysian government has banned parents from naming their child “Chow Tow,” the translation for which is roughly “smelly head”. \nREAD ALSO: Dad stops his daughter’s wedding so her stepdad could walk down the aisle with them Anus \nOne set of parents had to appeal to the Denmark government to grant them permission to name their kid Anus. A request which was denied. @ \nIn China, the baby’s parent was banned from using this name which is pronounced “ai-ta” over there. Facebook \nA state in Mexico banned a few names because they “lacked in meaning.” Facebook was on that list. Other names that made the list were Burger King, Hitler and Robocop. Lucifer \nLucifer was on a list of 77 banned names in New Zealand. Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii \nA girl had to go to court to change her name which she hated. Her parents named her Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii. A judge granted her request. \nREAD ALSO: Yoruba vs Calabar, which has the most beautiful women? III \nPronounced ‘Three,’ this name was banned in California in 1984 on the grounds that it is a symbol and symbols can’t be names. Venerdi \nJudges prevented a couple from naming their child Venerdi, which means Friday. They say the name would expose the boy to mockery. Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 \nInterestingly, the Sweden couple who gave their child this name said it was pronounced “Albin.” The court made them pay a fine and banned the name. \nWhich of these names can you give your child?",

      "text": "print \nNowThis \nIf you aren’t particularly tapped into what young people are sharing on Facebook, the fact that social news startup NowThis landed an interview with President Obama on Wednesday might have come as a surprise. \nIt shouldn't. \nThe interview, which has already been packaged into 5 bite-sized videos (with more on the way), is just the most recent step in NowThis’ bid to dominate news video on social networks like Facebook, according to the company’s president, Athan Stephanopoulos. \nThe presidential race has been a moment in the spotlight for NowThis, whose election coverage videos alone have snagged a whopping two billion views. \nObama wasn't the first big get for NowThis. \n“We reached out to the presidential candidates early,” Stephanopoulos tells Business Insider. NowThis interviewed Bernie Sanders as he was igniting a progressive movement, and the videos that resulted racked up 30 million views in a month. “It was a watershed moment,” Stephanopoulos says (they got Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren as well). \n“It is hard to avoid the scale that NowThis has,” head of content Tina Exarhos adds. Facebook waves \nIt wasn’t always like this. NowThis was started in late 2012 by digital media heavyweights Eric Hippeau and Ken Lerer, on the concept that news video should live natively on whatever platform audiences were on. But that strategy didn’t catapult NowThis into the spotlight until Facebook began to heavily promote its video offerings, around 2014, to compete with YouTube. \nNowThis' Athan Stephanopoulos NowThis \nThough NowThis makes all kinds of videos, the company built itself into a powerhouse on short ones, with overlaid text, which spread through Facebook like wildfire. And it makes a lot of them. Currently, NowThis’ 120 employees produce about 65 videos per day across all channels. \nNowThis' Facebook prowess is no doubt how it got on the White House's radar. The Obama administration also understands the composition of NowThis' audience (80% millennial), and its implications. \n“The White House was keen on reaching young people,” Stephanopoulos says. Obama has done interviews with digital media companies like BuzzFeed, Vox, Vice, and Mic. For this particular interview, Obama wanted to make sure young people made it to the polls   \n“Oh my God, young voters need to show up,” Exarhos says, describing the sentiment. You can tell. In one of the NowThis interview videos, Obama speaks directly to the camera, exhorting young people to get out and vote. It's worth noting that NowThis' voice leans progressive, which the company doesn't apologize for, as it believes this reflects its younger audience. \nThere were some things NowThis wanted out of the Obama interview as well. \nOne big one was to get him to talk about the Dakota Access pipeline, which Exarhos says they knew was a huge issue for the NowThis audience. How? A big sign: A video about the pipeline the day before had racked up 10 million views. Obama ended up going on the record for the first time, she says. After Hillary v. Trump \nThe election has been a huge moment for NowThis, but afterward, Stephanopoulos and Exarhos say the key to success will be what NowThis has always done: experimentation. \nNowThis' Tina Exarhos NowThis \nRight now, a big focus is on cracking what works on Facebook Live, the social network’s live video component. \n“So many people approached it like TV,” Exarhos says. But NowThis has found that overproduced segments can get less views than having literally two bobbleheads on camera. “We’re still trying to figure it out.” \nBut one thing NowThis knows is that live video on social media is a two-way conversation. Exarhos gives the example of the last presidential debate. The NowThis live stream got around three million views total (second only to ABC News’ stream), but what Exarhos found particularly interesting was that the concurrent views hardly dropped off when the debate ended. “The conversation was still going on” in the comments, she says. The money question \nAnother aspect of Facebook that NowThis, and all social publishers, have to figure out is how to make money. \nThere is some to be made from sponsored videos, and NowThis has its own branded content studio. But it’s expensive to make video, even with the lean operation NowThis has. And Facebook’s lack of progress in helping publishers make money has many in the media business worried. The venture funding, of which NowThis has raised $27 million, can only go so far. \nStephanopoulos says he’s not worried. \nNowThis is in contact with Facebook and Snapchat on an almost daily basis, and Stephanopoulos says that many of Facebook's product developments in video have come from NowThis’ feedback. He's confident that Facebook will be one pillar of a thriving business. \nNowThis has grabbed an enormous audience. Now it needs to prove it can turn that audience into a viable business. “We look at the glass as half full,\" Stephanopoulos says.",

      "text": "By Ruth Eglash November 6 at 10:19 AM Follow @reglash Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, chairs the weekly cabinet meeting, at his office in Jerusalem on Sunday. (Abir Sultan, via AP) \nJERUSALEM – Israel’s ruling Likud party used Facebook to track the activities and posts of certain journalists it perceives as anti-government, a member of the party, which is headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in a public debate on Saturday. \nLikud parliamentarian David Bitan, who serves as chairman of the government coalition, told the gathering that he and some friends had been following the Facebook pages of journalists hired recently to set up a new public broadcasting service. \n“We went and we checked the Facebook pages of these people. We saw what they are writing and I will tell you that we are talking about people who are leftist. They want to impose their own agenda on the new channel,” he said in the forum. \nBitan has been leading a crusade recently against the establishment of the Israel Broadcasting Corporation. The new public television and radio channel, which was slated to launch in the coming months, was approved by the government in 2014 to replace the country’s antiquated Israel Broadcasting Authority. \nLast week, Netanyahu expressed his agreement with Bitan, establishing a committee tasked with finding a way to keep open the old Israel Broadcasting Authority and shutter the new media outlet. The committee will present its findings in three weeks. \nThe prime minister and his supporters believe the new public service channel is not working out as initially planned because there is not enough government supervision and some of the newly employed journalists are overtly critical of his government and policies. \nIt’s a huge U-turn for Netanyahu, who two years ago called the change “essential” and “necessary.” \nDespite the political wavering, intensive work breaking down the old television and radio channels has already started. Deals were reached with powerful unions and generous severance packages handed out to workers who agreed to quit voluntarily. \nThe new broadcasting corporation has started its work, too, poaching media personalities from competing outlets and preparing content for a launch date that has already been postponed several times. \nThe whole process has cost Israeli taxpayers millions of dollars. \nAnd, the actions of Netanyahu, who also holds the post of Communications Minister, have come under severe scrutiny. The revelation on Saturday that members of his party were snooping around the private Facebook pages of journalists has also drawn a harsh response from the local media. \nCritics of the prime minister maintain the new public broadcasting service should be free of political influence. They see Netanyahu’s intentions as a clear attack on press freedom. Other say that yet another deviation from what was originally proposed will be a huge waste of public funds. \nHe also faces political opposition, including from members of his own coalition. Finance minister Moshe Kahlon announced last week that he would not support the dramatic turnabout citing excessive costs and the loss of jobs for hundreds of people recently hired by the new corporation. Kahlon even said he would be willing to see new elections on this issue. \nThose who support Netanyahu’s aims to dismantle the new service say it is the corporation that is a waste of public funds, especially if it turns out to be anti-government. \n“It’s not going in the direction that we want, it is clear that the corporation will be left leaning, according to what they are talking about. The journalists and workers are talking, they are tweeting, there is a red line that we will not allow it to cross,” said Bitan during an interview last week with Israel’s Channel Two news. \nEstablished in 1948, the Israel Broadcasting Authority was Israel’s sole television and radio outlet until commercial channels began broadcasting in the 1990s. Until four years ago, it was funded by an annual tax levied from television set owners. Now it is financed by the government. \nRevelations several years ago that the authority’s expenditures were hugely inflated even as it draws a small percent of television audiences led the government to deem an overhaul of public service television was necessary.",

In fact, it hasn’t even begun. \nA woman tells grammy, \nI know you didn’t want a bachelorette party, so we had to make it a surprise bachelorette party. \nAt that point, she passes out (dies?), which is a real shame, because she misses Benedict Cumberbatch as a stripper. \nHe’s part of a two-piece act from the “construction company” that has come with a “delivery of some heavy wood.” \nThe minutes that ensue are a kind of a blur. It’s a casserole of flesh and sleaze. They mount a now dead grammy and give her the classic: A fun sandwich.",

      "text": "  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg Investigated By German Prosecutors Over \"Hate\" Postings Nov 6, 2016 2:43 PM 0 SHARES \nLess than two weeks after Angela Merkel accused Facebook and Google of \"distorting\" the public's perception with its automated curation of news stories, and demanding access to the media giants' algorithms, Spiegel reported over the weekend that prosecutors in the Bavarian capital are conducting an investigation into Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other heads of the social media giant for failing to stop hate speech and over potentially illegal posts on the website. \nCOO Sheryl Sandberg, European policy director Richard Allan and Eva-Maria Kirschsieper, who heads the company’s Berlin office, are all also under investigation, according to Spiegel. \nProsecutors confirmed the investigation to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) as well. \nAccording to The Local , investigators must prove whether there is enough evidence of a criminal offense and whether it would fall under the Munich prosecutors' jurisdiction. \nThe probe was initiated after a Bavarian lawyer reported the company to police, accusing its management of allowing racism, Holocaust denial and violent threats to remain on the site without consequence. Facebook is legally bound in Germany to delete all known content which can be considered incitement of hatred. \nThe criminal complaint lists a series of postings which were reported to the company but were not deleted, with the complainant either being ignored or receiving a standard reply describing the post as “harmless” Spiegel reports. A Facebook spokesman told FAZ that the company would \"examine [the situation] calmly and if necessary respond with a statement\". \nA criminal complaint against Zuckerberg at the start of the year failed after prosecutors said that they could not investigate because the accused did not reside within the borders of the German justice system.Facebook has come in for heavy criticism from German politicians for over a year for what they say is its unwillingness to deal with hate speech on its site. \nIn October Volker Kauder, a key member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, said that social media giants like Facebook should face penalties if they fail to tackle hate speech, after a surge in xenophobic comments linked to the migrant influx. \n“The time for round-tables is over. I've run out of patience,\" said Kauder, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union's parliamentary group. \nDespite a pledge in December last year by Facebook, Twitter and Google to examine and remove offensive posts in Germany within 24 hours, users have reported that their requests to take down hate speech have often hit a wall. Kauder said that if the companies fail to remove offensive posts within a week after they have been reported, then they should be penalized, with a suggested fine of €50,000 per post . \nIn an interview in October, Justice Minister Heiko Maas noted that the online giants had taken action only in a minority of cases. Out of the cases reported to Twitter in Germany, only one percent was erased, he said, while for Facebook, the proportion was 46 percent. \n\" If the companies refuse to meet their responsibility, then there will be consequences ,\" Maas told business daily Handelsblatt.",

Nick Wass, AP Voted NASCAR'S most popular driver every year since 2003, Earnhardt enjoys an adoring fan base and always draws a roar from the crowd during driver introductions. Nick Wass, AP Earnhardt and Danica Patrick, who drives for his JR Motorsports team on the Nationwide circuit, can be seen together at the track and off. They appear in several ads together. Brian Czobat, AP The driver of the No. 88 Chevrolet took over the Sprint Cup points lead July 29 after finishing fourth at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. It marked the first time Earnhardt had led the points in nearly eight years. Jerry Markland, Getty Images for NASCAR Earnhardt snapped a 143-race winless streak on June 17, when he won at Michigan International Speedway. Tim Fuller, US Presswire Many people in the sport thought the breakthrough was the beginning of a second-half season resurgence. Earnhardt said he thought the win 'would be all relief, but it wasn't relief at all. It was all excitement.' Jared C. Tilton, Getty Images When Earnhardt finally broke his winless streak, defending Sprint Cup champion Tony Stewart said \"it's not a national holiday.\" Tim Fuller, US Presswire Fullscreen In addition to bringing a trophy to Hendrick Motorsports with his first win in four years, Earnhardt got to ring the 'victory bell.' \"I'm going to ring that damn thing as hard as I can,\" he said. \"... I like seeing the smiles on everybody else's face. It's so awesome to see how many other people it affects. It feels good to be able to bring those guys what they deserve.\" Davis Turner for USA TODAY Sports Steve Letarte, left, became Earnhardt's crew chief at the beginning of the 2011 season. When they won, Letarte said: \"... We are not crazy. What we have been trying to do has been working.\" Brian Czobat, AP Fullscreen Earnhardt first stepped out with girlfriend Amy Reimann at the 2011 NASCAR awards ceremony. He also brought her to the White House in April -- when President Obama honored Sprint Cup champion Tony Stewart -- and kissed her in victory lane at Michigan. Mark Wilson, Getty Images This year, Earnhardt opened Whisky River, a replica Western town on his 200-acre property, to the media. A commercial was shot there for the Sprint Cup all-star race. Victory Management Group Fullscreen For Earnhardt, 38, this season has been about personal growth. \"I was just really nervous about what people’s perceptions would be, so I held a lot of stuff in and just kept a lot of stuff private for a long time,\" he said.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (photo credit:AFP PHOTO) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nGerman prosecutors are investigating Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives, a spokesman for the Munich prosecutor's office said on Friday, following a complaint alleging the company broke national laws against hate speech and sedition by failing to remove racist postings.The spokesman declined to provide further details. German attorney Chan-jo Jun had filed a complaint with prosecutors in the Bavarian city in September and demanded that Facebook executives be compelled to comply with anti-hate speech laws by deleting racist or violent postings from its site. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Facebook's rules forbid bullying, harassment and threatening language, but critics say it does not do enough to enforce them and has failed to staunch a tide of racist and threatening posts on the social network during an influx of migrants into Europe.Prosecutors in Hamburg earlier this year rejected a similar complaint by Jun on the grounds that the regional court lacked jurisdiction because Facebook's European operations are based in Ireland.\"There is a different view in Bavaria,\" his firm Jun Lawyers of Wuerzburg in Bavaria said in a statement.\"Upon Jun's request, Bavarian Justice Minister Winfried Bausback said that Hamburg's view was wrong and German law does indeed apply to some of the offences,\" it said.Jun's complaint named Facebook founder and chief executive Zuckerberg and nine other managers at the company, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.Facebook said it had not violated German law and was working on fighting hate speech online.\"We are not commenting on the status of a possible investigation but we can say that the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees,\" a company spokesman said.Jun has compiled a list of 438 postings that were flagged as inappropriate but not deleted over the past year. They include what some might consider merely angry political rants but also clear examples of racist hate speech and calls to violence laced with references to Nazi-era genocide. Following a public outcry and pressure from German politicians, Facebook this year hired Arvato, a business services unit of Bertelsmann, to monitor and delete racist posts.A rash of online abuse and violent attacks against newcomers to Germany accompanied the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants last year, which led to a rise in the popularity of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and has put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/AP) — Across Florida, the battleground state that could tip this year’s elections, voters have streamed to the polls on the final day of early voting ahead of Tuesday’s election.\nSpurred on by the frenzied campaign put on by both major candidates, nearly half of Florida’s 12.9 million registered voters had already cast ballots even before the final push that came on Sunday.\nPastors aligned with Democratic leaning organization held “souls to the polls” events across the state, designed to encourage African-American churchgoers to vote. President Barack Obama visited Kissimmee in central Florida, where during a rally he exhorted those who had not yet voted to get their relatives “off the couch” and get them out to vote.\n“I love you Florida, let’s finish the job,” said Obama to a crowd of roughly 11,000, while campaigning for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nSo far nearly 48 percent of all registered voters in Florida had already either voted at an early voting site or voted by mail, according to the latest numbers reported by the state Division of Elections.\nDemocrats had a slight edge of nearly 33,000 votes over Republicans with just one day of early voting left. Of 6.15 million votes cast, 2.4 million votes have come from registered Republicans, compared to more than 2.43 million votes from Democrats. More than 1.16 million voters registered with no party affiliation have also voted.\nWhile many counties around the state have already wrapped up early voting, it was still going on Sunday in 16 of Florida’s 67 counties, including some of the state’s largest. The Democratic strongholds of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties had polls open, as will Pinellas, Hillsborough and Orange counties along the strategic Interstate 4 corridor.\nRepublicans continued to do their own final push for voting as well. GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence visited Panama City Beach, while Republican nominee Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Sarasota on Monday as part of a four-state sweep on the eve of the election.\nEven though Republicans are now trailing Democrats, David Chiokadze, a spokesman for Trump’s Florida’s campaign, said in an email to reporters that Republicans trailed Democrats by a much wider margin heading into Election Day back in 2012. Chiokadze also pointed out that there was a higher percentage of Republicans voting in this election than four years ago.\nPart of the drive to increase turnout came from Democrats who held early voting rallies in more than a dozen locations throughout the state. The event in Tallahassee, which drew several hundred participants, was part political rally, part street carnival as organizers grilled hamburgers and sausages and handed out snow cones to participants. Roz Booker was on hand with members from her church for the event and she said that while the election was a “mess” that she had voted because people had fought and died to win the right to vote for African-Americans.\nRev. Jesse Jackson, who spoke to the crowd, evoked the chaotic 2000 presidential election that was won by George Bush after the U.S. Supreme Court halted a statewide recount that had been ordered by the Florida Supreme Court.\n“This time we will vote again with so many votes they can’t take them away,” Jackson said.\n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

      "text": "By Ophier Gottlieb , Yahoo Finance Contributor While Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) and Facebook Inc. ( FB ) may seem to be headed in opposite directions with respect to growth, it turns out that both companies have arrived to similar crossroads, with similar risk and similar opportunity.\nFacebook Inc. crushed earnings last week week, showing 91% year-over-year EPS growth and 56% revenue growth. Both are astonishing for a company of its size, but the stock tanked after the report.\nThat stock drop was predicated on comments from Facebook’s CFO Dave Wehner when he said that ad revenue growth would be materially lower after mid-2017. Specifically, Wehner said the company expects that “ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017” and that, going forward, Facebook expects to “see ad revenue growth rates come down materially” ( Investopedia ).\nWhat’s going on? Facebook Inc. generates more than 90% of its revenue from advertising and the company noted, again, that ad load, which is the number of ads each user is shown, will be decreasing in the future.\nFurther, the company noted rising expenses as it invests in research and development. Slowing revenue growth and increased costs pushed the stock down.\nFacebook’s “problem” is that it relies ever so much on one product, advertising, and it needs to innovate around that one product to create new business lines. The recipe of slowing growth, heavy reliance on a single product and high expenditures to innovate is exactly the one to cook up another tech giant, Apple Inc.\nTim Cook. Credit: Reuters/Lucy Nicholson More When Apple released its quarterly earnings earlier in October , the company reported its first full year over year revenue drop in over a decade. The focus, like Facebook, was on slowing growth for its single product champion, the iPhone, which accounts for more than 60% of revenue.\nWhile Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, confidently noted that Apple would return to growth as of this quarter, the reliance on the iPhone is a strong headwind.\nHuge opportunity While Facebook and Apple face a slowdown in their overly concentrated revenues, the two have something else in common: over 1 billion users.\nThe social media site and the phone maker have amassed gigantic user bases, and while the core products may be slowing, there is a huge opportunity to introduce that billion person user base to the “next thing.” The good news is, both companies seem to know exactly what that “thing” is.\nWhile Facebook has focused on its virtual reality hardware and ecosystem with Oculus Rift, that niche is yet to hit the mainstream. But Facebook’s real power is the 1.8 billion monthly active users on its platform, and it has turned its attention to that moat with its newly launched Facebook Marketplace.\nFacebook’s Next Product\nFollowing the successful business model of Internet auction wunderkind eBay, Facebook has created its own commerce ecosystem, Facebook Marketplace.\nThis business line has a simple goal: generate revenue from an existing massive user base from something other than advertisements. If Facebook can re-leverage its user base, it could have another winning monetization strategy as well as its first real diversification. Apple sees the same potential, in its own right.\nRead More Apple’s Next Product\nApple is actually further down the line in its revenue diversification through its “Apple Services” segment. That segment is already 90% as large as Facebook in terms of revenue and is realizing accelerating growth.\nApple Services comprises of iTunes, iCloud, the app store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and other Apple software and services. The revenue base, like Facebook, is built on the back of an install base of over one billion people. While Apple Services accounts for approximately 14% of Apple’s revenue, it makes up nearly a quarter of its operating income.\nTim Cook noted on the last earnings call that Apple Services would be showing growth even if iPhone sales stagnate, implying that the current install base of users is spending more and more money with their iPhone on services, so it is a legitimate diversification play for Apple.\nFurther, While Apple Pay has yet to make a material impact on revenue, the growth is astounding, standing at 500% year-over-year per the last earnings call, with more transaction volume in September alone than all of last year.\nWhat now Facebook is finally showing slowing growth as its primary product, advertising, has reached near capacity. Apple showed, for the first time in over a decade, a full year of lower sales due to saturation of its kingpin product the iPhone.\nBut, both firms have accomplished the hardest part, which is to say they have both accumulated a user base that tops one billion people. The next step for each is to sell something else to the base. Apple has shown it is capable and it is succeeding. Facebook is on deck.\nThe author is long shares of Apple Inc. and has no position in Facebook Inc.",

      "text": "You're ruining Facebook (and friendships) with political rants \nIt’s the “Year of the Woman” once again, according to the media. \nRolling Stone magazine, USA Today, the Financial Times and countless others have made the proclamation. Women are important in this election, we’re told, and a woman has a good chance of being our next president. This is our year! \nSo why does this celebration of women feel so much like a pat on the head by a bunch of condescending men? \n“Know a woman voting for Trump? Send her THIS VIDEO,” goes the tagline on a Keith Olbermann video for GQ magazine. In it, he spends more than five minutes lecturing female Trump voters, asking over and over again, in the most obnoxious possible way, “doesn’t it bother you?” about a variety of Trump scandals. He calls it “startling” that Trump has any percentage of the female vote larger than zero. \nBut why? Why should women be any more outraged by Donald Trump than men? Is Donald Trump mean or rude to women? Sure. But is he any different to men? Does he insult men and call them names? Ask “little Marco Rubio” or “lying Ted Cruz.” \nHe said he likes soldiers who weren’t captured, disrespecting, in one fell swoop, all prisoners of war — a group made up almost entirely of men. Yet few make the argument that men specifically shouldn’t be voting for Trump, lest they betray their gender. \nInevitably comes the next question: “What about the accusations from women that Trump assaulted them?” Well, if the accusations are believable, then why should only women be outraged by them? It’s not only business owners who grasp the problem when Trump is accused of not paying his venders. If a man accused him of assault, it wouldn’t be just men from whom we expect outrage. \nLiberal men like Olbermann think they’re being pro-women when they treat us like some small special-interest group that will have all the same positions and ideals. If he finds Trump’s treatment of women so noxious, why doesn’t he expect other men will, too? \n“The woman vote” isn’t some kind of monolithic action by a small segment of the population. In fact, women make up more than half the country — and of voters — and have a variety of reasons for voting however we choose to. \nWhile men get to vote on issues like taxes or foreign policy, “women’s issues” always seem to come down to children and abortions, as if having or not having children is all that we’re about. \nLouis CK pushed this line during his appearance on Conan O’Brien’s show last week. CK told O’Brien that Hillary will make the best president because she’s a mother: “A mother — she’s got it! A mother just does it. She feeds you, and teaches you, and protects you . . . We’ve had 240 years of fathers!” \nThe clip went viral, as Hillary Clinton’s supporters posted it on social media as a great defense of the woman whom they support. \nThey didn’t seem to notice what an insult it is to imagine that all moms are the same or that having a child uniquely qualifies them for the presidency. Does Sarah Palin’s experience as a mother mean she’s a better choice for president than any father? Something tells me Louis CK would disagree. \nLet’s not pretend that there’s some higher respect for women at play here. \nI won’t be voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday, but it won’t be “as a woman.” I won’t be voting for him as a conservative. He doesn’t line up with my values. And despite our being the same gender, neither does Hillary Clinton — so I won’t be voting for her, either. We’re both women, we’re both mothers, but that’s nowhere near enough. \nAs the election of this “Year of the Woman” comes to an end, let’s remember that the last media-proclaimed “Year of the Woman” was 1992, when womanizing Bill Clinton became president with his defender, Hillary Clinton, by his side. \nWomen deserve more than to be patronized once every few decades in this way. We deserve to be taken seriously as individual voters with a range of issues important to us. \nMaybe 2020 will finally be the year for that. Share this: ",

She’s trying to revitalize the ancient art of traditional Inuit tattooing, which her ancestors practiced for thousands of years until colonial missionaries arrived and the custom began to die out.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) – Former Attorney General Janet Reno, the first woman in U.S. history to become the government’s top lawyer, has died at the age of 78. \nPresident Bill Clinton tapped her for the post in 1993.\nBy the time she took office, a crisis was already building at a compound in Waco, Texas. The Branch Davidian religious sect, led by David Koresh, was in a standoff with the FBI. Reno ordered agents to storm the property, saying she believed children were being abused. About 80 people died in the raid. Reno took full responsibility.\nReno also drew fire for her handling of the case of Elian Gonzalez. The 6-year old refugee had been living with relatives in Miami when Reno ordered federal agents to storm the house. The child was sent back to Cuba to live with his father. The the Cuban American community was enraged. \nThat case and the fallout from Waco haunted Reno for years, but she was also recognized for enforcing civil rights and her efforts to regulate violence on TV.\nHer candid manner brought her many fans who also appreciated her offbeat image. At six foot two, she had a no nonsense style that made her a popular target for Saturday Night Live where she eventually made a cameo appearance with Will Ferrell.\nReno had been at the Justice Department for just two years when she noticed her hand shaking and was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. With medication to control the trembling, she continued her work and became an inspiration for other patients managing the disease.\nShe returned home to Florida in 2001 and launched a campaign for governor, driving around the state in her signature red pick-up. \nShe lost in a close primary race the next year and decided to retreat to a quieter life. Never married, she retired to her modest family home near the Everglades and declared herself a private citizen. Public life had brought dark times but looking back she described her career in politics as “an activity of joy.”",

      "text": "Follow The Fan: Facebook | Twitter \nCLEVELAND (AP) – Tony Romo will get more work at practice this week, moving the Dallas quarterback closer to his long-awaited comeback. \nThat day looks as far off as ever. \nUntil further notice, the Cowboys are Dak Prescott’s team. End of discussion. \nPrescott threw three touchdown passes , maybe three of the easiest scores the rookie will have in his career, and Ezekiel Elliott ran for two TDs as Dallas won its seventh straight, 35-10 on Sunday over the hapless Cleveland Browns. \nPrescott improved to 7-1 as a starter, and his latest performance has pushed Romo deeper into the background of what is developing into a special season for the Cowboys. \nFollowing the game, Dallas owner Jerry Jones was peppered with the usual questions about a quarterback situation that may never reach controversial levels. \nPrescott has the Cowboys rolling, and despite his love and loyalty toward the 36-year-old Romo, Jones, who has made rash decisions in the past, doesn’t appear ready to make any moves. \n“We’ve got a great luxury and wonderful problem to have,” Jones said. “We’ve got some real talent at our quarterback position. I think Tony Romo is one of the best quarterbacks that has played this game. \n“My real regret would be to have had him here and not win a Super Bowl with him. He’s that talented. And then I look at Dak and how he’s playing, his future. \n“I just don’t have a problem with this situation.” \nRomo returned to practice last week, and while his exact progress remains something of a mystery, Prescott has only strengthened his grip on the starting job. \nThe fourth-round draft pick completed 21 of 27 passes for 247 yards against the woeful Browns (0-9), who offered little resistance and are more than halfway to a winless season. \nPrescott and the Cowboys built a 25-point lead after three quarters and coasted to their most lopsided win this season in front of thousands of Dallas fans, who invaded FirstEnergy Stadium and made the guys in blue and white feel as if they were home. \n“It’s America’s Team,” Prescott said of the support. “I expect that everywhere we go.” \nAnd it’s getting to the point where the expectations for Prescott are soaring as well. He broke a few more of Troy Aikman’s rookie passing records and showed uncanny poise for a player with only eight games under his belt. \n“He doesn’t act like a rookie,” said tight end Jason Witten, who caught a 26-yard pass from Prescott . “He’s critical of himself when he makes mistakes. He takes ownership in it. Through eight weeks you look at what he’s done, it speaks volumes about him, his preparation and his ability to trust the people around him. He’s done a great job.” \nPrescott looks as if he’s going to keep it for a while. \nKESSLER INJURED: Browns rookie Cody Kessler passed for 203 yards and threw a 12-yard TD pass to Terrelle Pryor in his first game back from a concussion. \nKessler hurt his right leg in the second quarter, but finished the game and believes he’ll be ready to play Thursday night in Baltimore. \nZEKE THE FREAK: Elliott rushed for 92 yards and has 891 this season, the third most by a rookie in league history after eight games. Only Adrian Peterson (1,036) and Eric Dickerson (995) have gotten off to a better start than Elliott, the former Ohio State star who enjoyed playing in front of some familiar faces. \n“Ohio means a lot to me, kind of like a second home,” he said. “Just the memories I had here and the friends I made while at Ohio State and just the other things I accomplished at that great university. So it was very important for me to come here, have a good game and play in front of these great fans.” \nBAD, BAD BROWNS: Cleveland is hoping to avoid joining the 2008 Detroit Lions as the only teams in league history to go 0-16. First-year coach Hue Jackson, who has endured several seasons worth of injuries, said his team’s problems are too numerous to single out one. \n“It is not just about the defense,” he said. “It is me. It starts with the coaching. It is a top-down deal. We are not playing well right now anyplace. It is not just defense. It is offensively and special teams. I am not just going to dump on one group. We have to play better as a team. We are not playing good enough, and that is what it is.” \nFIGHT CLUB: The Browns lost starting center Cam Erving on their first series when he was ejected for fighting with Dallas defensive end David Irving, who was also tossed. The two tangled away from the ball near Dallas’ sideline. \n“I let my emotions get the best of me,” said Erving, who did not speak with reporter but provided a comment to a team spokesman. “I’ll learn from this mistake and put it behind me.” \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Facebook \n– There is palpable fear in Kogi state currently over the whereabouts of Governor Yahya Bello who some believe is ill \n– The state government has reacted through the governor’s spokesperson, Kingsley Fanwo, but this is yet to douse the tension \nThere has been panic across Kogi state, Nigeria over the whereabouts of Yahaya Bello, the governor . \nReports say Governor Bello had not been seen in public for over two weeks thus fueling speculations that he may be ill. Governor Yahaya Bello has reportedly not been seen for over two weeks \nThe speculation was further boosted by the fact that many, even in government, could not tell where he actually travelled to. \nDaily Times reports sources as saying that the governor might have been flown abroad to treat an undisclosed ailment. \nIn his absence, all state functions have been put on hold and the report says this had left Simon Achuba, the state deputy governor, with only the duty of receiving visitors on behalf of his boss. \nIn reaction however, the governor’s spokesperson, Kingsley Fanwo, denied that his boss was ill. \nFanwo reportedly released a statement from the state government house urging the public not to believe the rumour. \nPM NEWS quotes Fanwo as saying: “My attention has been drawn to the spurious rumour that there are concerns over the health of the Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello. \n“I want to state clearly here for the avoidance of doubt that the rumour lacks any iota of truth. It is a reflection of the depth the enemies of Kogi state have gone in their desperate angst against fate. \nREAD ALSO: Kogi people are solidly behind Buhari – Bello \n“The governor is hale and hearty, healthy and unwavering in his vigour to make Kogi state the Confluence of Excellence. \n“I urge all Kogites of goodwill to discountenance the rumour as His Excellency will return from his two weeks break on the 12th of November, 2016.” \nHe however did not mention the specific whereabouts of the governor.",

      "text": "Updated 2016-11-07 21:53:20 \nThree NGOs today lodged three police reports against Satees Muniandy, the private secretary of Penang Deputy Chief Minister P Ramasamy, for having allegedly insulted Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar of Johor on Facebook. \nThey are Pertubuhan Martabat Jalinan Muhibbah (MJMM), Ikatan Usahawan Kecil dan Sederhana Malaysia (IKHLAS) and Ikatan Rakyat Insan Muslim Malaysia (IRIMM). \nMJMM president Abdul Rani Kulup Abdullah, speaking on behalf of all three NGOs, said Satees had allegedly uploaded a statement insulting the sultan on the social media facility. \n\"We hope that the police and the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission will investigate and take the appropriate action as Satees' (alleged) action is unacceptable,\" he said to reporters after the reports were made at the Dang Wangi Police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur. \nThe Facebook post is believed to have been uploaded following the sultan's statement on Nov 3 at the Bangsa Johor gathering that he would not allow street demonstrations in Johor. \nMeanwhile in Johor Baru, vice-president of the Coordination Council of the Gabungan Persatuan NGO Melayu Negeri Johor Abdullah Md Yusof also urged Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) Youth chief Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman and Satees to make a public apology. \nAbdullah said the Facebook posts of the two individuals had insulted many people as it was posted in total disregard of the constitutional monarchy institution. \n\"We advise them to immediately apologise for their statements in which they allegedly questioned the sultan's statement as if he did not understand the Federal Constitution. \n\"We, the people of Johor, support the sultan's call not to hold street demonstration or badmouth our leaders because we want to maintain peace and harmony among the multi-racial people,\" he told a press conference today. \nAlso present were representatives of Gabungan Persekutuan Tiong-Hua Johor Baru and Gabungan NGO India Johor. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:",

      "text": "Right: Facebook / Kimberly DeFalco \nLeft: Flickr / Michael Vadon J.J. Holmes really, really wanted to go to a Donald Trump rally being held in Tampa, Florida. Not because he supports Mr. Trump, but because he really, really does not. Donald Trump has an extremely spotty record in his treatment and respect of Americans with disabilities, and Holmes is a 12-year-old with cerebral palsy\nHe is wheelchair bound, and can only communicate with the help of a computer device. Reluctantly, his mother agreed to let him protest the Trump event and they made the drive out to Tampa.\nWhen they got there, they were treated about as badly as you would expect. Reporter Kimberly DeFalc reported the following in a Facebook post :\nThis is truly disturbing to me … What I witnessed while covering a Trump rally today. Wheelchair-bound JJ Holmes, 12, who has cerebral palsy, and his family were ordered out of Saturday’s Trump rally by Trump after they chanted for Hillary Clinton. JJ begged his mom, Alison, to travel over two hours so he could attend.\nUnable to speak, JJ communicates through a special device similar to Stephen Hawkings. JJ is passionate about politics and concerned about the future of all humans but especially those with disabilites. Alison said the family was kicked by Trump supporters and had to shield JJ’s wheelchair as Trump supporters gathered to push JJ’s wheelchair out of their space.\nThe reporter, moved by JJ’s courage and the Trump crowd’s hate, decided to try to make the kid’s day by arranging a meeting with President Obama:\nAlison was called a child abuser and a murderer. This is just so, so sad! Tears are burning my eyeballs but then I look at JJ smiling afterwards when he asked his mom if she is proud of him.\nIf anyone can help, JJ is going to see President Obama in Orlando Sunday as he and Hillary are his heroes. I’m am pulling out all the stops of connections to arrange a meeting. I’m just not that well-connected. If anyone can help connect the dots, this would be life-changing for JJ and also send powerful encouragement for all who live with disabilities and rise up despite them! With gratitude, Kim\nWith help from Kim DeFalc, J.J. Homes got the opportunity to meet his hero, President Barack Obama at a Hillary Clinton rally.\nYesterday, this young man was kicked out of a Trump rally. As he was leaving, people kicked at his wheelchair. Today, he met his President. pic.twitter.com/VI4g2tKANG \n— Steve Schale (@steveschale) November 6, 2016 \n\nWhen asked about the GOP nominee, the 12-year-old used his specialized computer to say: “I hate Donald Trump, I hate Donald Trump.” \nKimberly’s Original Facebook Post ",

      "text": "An undercover police officer busted Mariza Reulas for selling some ceviche on a Facebook recipe share group.\nReulas was a member of a local group that shared recipes and held potlucks in the Stockton, Calif., area. Sometimes, money was exchanged for prepared food.\n\"Somebody would be like, 'Oh I don't have anything to trade you but I would love to buy a plate,' like they'd be off of work.\" she explained.\nThis arrangement is illegal according to authorities.\n\"It was just like unreal that they were saying you could face up to a year in jail,” said Reulas.\nAuthorities conducted a sting on the group because a majority of members didn't have a permit to sell food. Reulas refused to take the plea offer of three years probation.\n\"I don't write the laws, I enforce them. And the legislature has felt that this is a crime,” said San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Kelly McDaniel. She says selling any food not subject to health department inspection puts whoever eats it in real danger, not to mention it undercuts business owners who do get permits to make their food.\nShe says the 209 Food Spot Facebook group was sent a warning before charges were handed down.\nIs there a difference between someone who occasionally sells food and a restaurant whose primary business is selling food to the public? In the eyes of the law, there is not. But how extensively do we want to regulate the behavior of private citizens—to the point of putting them in jail? Should the law prohibit school bake sales and children's lemonade stands? Whatever happened to caveat emptor? You know the risks of buying food from an \"unpermitted\" person on a Facebook group. Why does the government need to be involved?\n\"When they talk about potential jail time for this, what goes through your mind?,\" asked FOX40.\n\"My kids,” responded Reulas.\nWithout a father in their life, Reulas says the thought of having to leave her kids scares her. Every court appearance takes a toll on her youngest son, six-year-old Justice.\n\"The night before he always asks like are you going to come back?” said Reulas.\nJust what we need: more people in jail and families broken up.\nWell done, nanny state, well done.\nWatch the video on the next page.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/parenting/2016/11/07/single-mother-faces-jail-time-for-selling-homemade-ceviche-on-facebook/\nprevious Page 1 of 2 next View as single page",

      "text": "The Democratic nominee's look has inspired social media posts, flash mobs, and even at least one new business. \n[Photo: Samantha Clark] Samantha Clark 11.07.16 10:59 AM \nScroll through the Instagram account hillarystreetstyle , and you’ll find more than 100 colorful collages of Hillary Clinton. The feed puts her next to best-dressed regulars like Rihanna and Gigi Hadid, juxtaposing her past and present outfits with the latest looks worn by celebrities. Remember Beyoncé’s electric-yellow pantsuit? Well, Clinton wore it first more than a decade ago, with pearls and a straw hat to top it off. She also rocked red before Ken Bone. And then there’s Clinton in between Anna Wintour, the real-life queen of fashion, and Olivia Pope, the fictional queen inside the Beltway. They’re all wearing clean white trench coats . \nThe woman behind hillarystreetstyle is just one of many on social media who’ve dubbed Clinton a sartorial star. Tired of being criticized for their own appearance, they’re embracing the presidential candidate’s fashion, from bold nail art to memes of photos with the former First Lady’s forehead and the punchline \"Eyebrow Goals: Hillary Clinton 1992.\" They’ve adopted Clinton as a symbol of girl power. \nThis election has been one of the most heated in recent history, and women have watched her confront Donald Trump over and over again when he attacked her as lacking that \"presidential look,\" or when he called women \"pigs,\"\"dogs,\" and \"slobs,\" or when he excused his comments about groping women as locker-room talk. The creator of hillarystreetstyle, a New York lawyer who asked to remain anonymous, said she started the account this spring to counterbalance the bias she saw. She felt there was too much of a negative focus about Clinton being a woman.\"At this point in the election, it’s retail therapy. It’s just to have fun, but at the beginning, it was more to open up a conversation,\" she said, adding that she is not affiliated with the Clinton campaign. \"I wanted to provide a space for people to look at Hillary’s looks, to look at celebrity looks, to think about fashion and relate to it on a personal level.\" \"It’s been kind of a 'screw you' to people who’ve criticized her.\" \nSome women have even launched a business inspired by Clinton’s style. A year ago, Meredith Fineman, 29, who runs a public relations firm in Washington, D.C., and her best friend, Morgan Gerard, who is a 27-year old attorney, started selling scrunchies with printed caricatures of Clinton’s face for $10.99 each. They advertise them as \"100% cotton, 100% feminist, 100% made in the USA.\" Scrunchies fell out of fashion in the '90s, but Clinton used them to pull her hair back during her busy globe-trotting days as secretary of state. Headlines poked fun, her staff tried to ban them, and Oscar de la Renta, a designer and friend, told her to cut her hair. Hillary scrunchies \n\"It’s been a fun, tongue-and-cheek reference and kind of a 'screw you' to people who’ve criticized her,\" Fineman said, adding that she couldn’t believe that her campaign didn’t include the throwback hair ties as part of her official merchandise. She said they’ve sold thousands of scrunchies so far. Now they’re working on a Michelle Obama version with her flexing her arms. Some supporters and feminists find all this fashion talk to be more of a distraction. They want to see more discussion about Clinton’s ideas.\"I think it’s cool to reclaim fashion, but this is a political campaign,\" said Herlinda Aguirre, 26, an organizer at a community center in San Francisco. But Clinton herself seems to have embraced the movement. In her Twitter bio , she not only calls herself a senator, secretary of state, and presidential candidate but also a \"hair icon\" and \"pantsuit aficionado.\" On her Instagram, she posted a Throwback Thursday of herself wearing a wide-brimmed fedora saying, \"'80s fashion wasn’t all bad.\" The photo garnered more than 18,000 likes. \nClinton’s campaign has used fashion to reintroduce their candidate to a young generation of voters, who know her name but may know little about her. Staffers have also flooded social media with old photos of her as a little girl, a dedicated student, a gung-ho public servant, and a young mom.\"We always found archival photos to be incredibly popular as another way for people to feel a closer connection to our candidate,\" said Laura Olin, who ran the Obama campaign’s social media in 2012 and now works as a consultant to the Clinton campaign through the marketing consultancy Precision Strategies. The tactic appears to be working. Appreciating her sense of fashion, women are sharing the photos across the internet. On Instagram, jewelry designer Sophie Buhai posted a picture of Clinton wearing a Donna Karan shoulderless dress to her first state dinner in 1993 and called her a \" fox .\" Others are taking it a step further and adopting the look for themselves. Lena Dunham, creator of the television show Girls , paid tribute to Clinton and that same dress by uploading a picture of herself wearing a similar sweater in a side-by-side collage on Instagram. Pantsuit Uprising \nThere’s one look of Clinton’s that has stood out above all, catalyzing a cult following: the pantsuit. Once mocked, her signature uniform is now seen as representing her professionalism and pragmatism. The look has inspired Libby Chamberlain, a 33-year-old educational counselor in Maine, to create a Facebook group and declare Election Day, November 8, as \"National Pantsuit Day.\" She wants to convince as many supporters as possible to join her in wearing a pantsuit to the voting booth, and then share a selfie across social media with #pantsuitnation. \n\"It wasn’t until the 1990s that women were even allowed to wear pantsuits on the Senate floor,\" she said. \"What better way to celebrate this historic election and celebrate a candidate we are so passionate about.\" \nShe came up with the idea after a friend told Chamberlain about having to defend Clinton’s clothing choices to a group of young women after the last presidential debate. They talked about how her pantsuit was an emblem of the hard-fought cultural battles of Clinton’s generation, which might be lost in younger circles. In about two and a half weeks, membership to the invite-only page has swelled to 1.75 million people, some of whom have shared stories about what Clinton’s candidacy means to them. \n\"I’ve seen her wearing pantsuits for 20 years. It’s not news to me.\" \n\"I wanted to do something to reappropriate that symbol and everything that it means to me as a feminist and Clinton supporter,\" Chamberlain said. But Dr. Jane Katcher, a 71-year-old supporter of the Democratic nominee, didn’t remember Clinton as ever being a style icon.\"I’ve seen her wearing pantsuits for 20 years,\" said the retired pediatric radiologist in Miami. \"It’s not news to me. That’s what professional clothing looks like.\" Her voice, though, seems to be a minority. Events celebrating Clinton are promoting pantsuits as a rallying point. At a concert for the candidate last Friday in Cleveland, Ohio, Beyoncé and her dancers performed \"Formation\" in pantsuits. She wore black with white polka dots. They wore matching blue. Some 200 people also wore a rainbow array of pantsuits last month at a flash mob in New York City. They danced for Clinton to the tune of Justin Timberlake's pop song \"Can’t Stop the Feeling.\" When the video went viral, a group of mothers and daughters were so inspired by it that they organized a flash mob of their own in Berkeley, California. [Photo: Samantha Clark] \nMore than a dozen little girls—and one boy—danced in T-shirts bearing Clinton’s logo and \"The Future Is Female\" under oversized blazers in an approximation of a pantsuit. Music pumped into the streets as they jumped around performing a routine they practiced for three hours every night for a week.\"I’m with her!\" they shouted in the middle of a closed-off intersection downtown. Ten-year-old Tessa Rose-Scheeres, who choreographed the dance, likened Trump to a playground bully and said Clinton stands up for herself. Clinton shows that girls can do anything, she added.\"When I wear this, I feel strong,\" she said while straightening her bright red jacket. \"I’m going to start wearing it to school.\" Newsletter Get the latest Fast Company stories delivered to your inbox daily.

      "text": "Technology News | Mon Nov 7, 2016 | 12:04pm EST Facebook partners with news outlets for Election Day live video blitz A 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of a displayed stock graph in this illustration taken November 3, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration By Amy Tennery | NEW YORK \nNEW YORK Facebook said on Monday it would partner with 50 broadcast stations, print and online publications for an Election Day live video blitz, as the social media company aims to build on the momentum of its popular Facebook Live video streaming service. \nThe move comes as Facebook and rival sites like Twitter increasingly embrace live video to draw in users and boost traffic. \nFacebook warned last week that revenue growth would slow this quarter because of \"ad load,\" or the number of ads that Facebook can put in front of customers without alienating them, offsetting strong earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates. \nEach outlet partnering with Facebook will publish a 15-minute live video centered on the presidential election in one of the 50 states. The content will be featured on Facebook's \"Election 2016\" site on Tuesday and include the hashtag #50states. \nWhile Facebook is not selling ads on the Election Day livestreams, it could generate more visits to the site, bolstering its reputation as a destination for live news and pushing back against Twitter, where users often \"live-tweet\" major events. \nAsked whether the Facebook Live initiative was a response to the popularity of “live-tweeting” events among social media users, Jason White, manager of U.S. news media partnerships at Facebook, said Facebook Live was something that “works really well on our platform.” \n“I think for us we really wanted to give the news media and especially local (outlets) something to raly around on Election day,” said White, regarding the 50 States project. \nHe said the company is exploring the possibility of including advertising breaks in live video in the future but said that no specific plans had been made yet. \nFrank Mungeam, vice president of digital content for broadcast and digital media firm TEGNA, told Reuters that six of his company's local broadcast stations, one each from Colorado, Washington state, Minnesota, Idaho, Maine and South Carolina, were participating. Mungeam, who said Facebook was not paying his company for the content, added: \"Facebook's platform offers an extended reach.\" \nTwitter said last week its government-focused handle, @gov, would provide election information to users via direct message, while Snapchat on Sunday featured a photo filter encouraging people to vote. \nFacebook launched Facebook Live for selected public figures in 2015 and made it available to all users in April 2016, allowing members to broadcast video live from their smartphones. \nSocial media sites have been seizing on live video content to attract users. In September, Twitter broadcast its first National Football League game, attracting generally positive feedback. It launched its livestreaming app, Periscope, in March 2015. \nAsked about live-streaming video and social media in general, Stefan Sideris, director of global social media operations at Amobee, a digital marketing technology company, said he saw a clear trend toward bigger companies adopting the technology. \n\"Brands and media companies are interested in connecting and engaging with consumers to bring the conversation together over live video,\" Sideris said. \"Live will ultimately drive a lot of social activity.\" \n(Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "Sting nabs Stockton mother selling ceviche through Facebook group Samantha Schmidt, The Washington Post Updated 9:31 am, Monday, November 7, 2016 Video: Ceviche lady arrested \nMariza Ruelas never expected a plate of ceviche would lead her to the courthouse and maybe even a possible jail sentence. \nFor more than a year, undercover investigators in San Joaquin County, California tracked the sales of food - such as homemade tamales, tortillas and cakes - through a community Facebook group, a sting that Mariza Ruelas called a \"waste of time and resources and taxpayers' money.\" \nRuelas, a single mother of six, first came across the Facebook group about two years ago when she needed a last-minute cake for her daughter's quinceañera, the Hispanic coming-of-age celebration on a young woman's 15th birthday. \nThe community forum, 209 Food Spot, allowed Stockton, Calif. residents to share recipes, organize potlucks and occasionally sell or exchange food items. \nAs a hobby, about once a month, Ruelas began offering up her own dishes - a tray of rice and beans in exchange for a birthday cake, her staple chicken-stuffed avocados to those who requested it, she said in a phone interview with the Post.

Ruelas, along with several other group members, faced citations for two misdemeanors - operating a food facility and engaging in business without a permit. An undercover investigator had ordered a ceviche from her through the Facebook group in October 2015 as part of a sting. \nAt least a half-dozen other members accepted a plea deal of one year of probation, a $235 fine and 40 hours of community service. Ruelas was offered a deal with twice the community service, three years of probation and the $235 fine, so she refused to accept it, she said. \nThe single mother of six is headed to trial and faces up to a year in jail for her misdemeanors. \n\"We didn't see any harm in that,\" she said, of selling and exchanging meals through the group. \"There wasn't anybody selling it daily. A lot of times, they were just getting back what they put into the ingredients.\" \nShe hadn't ever looked into obtaining a permit, Ruelas said, because she only sold or exchanged food items once or twice a month at most, as a hobby on occasional weekends. It was an activity she enjoyed sharing with her children, ages 6 through 20, who would help prepare and deliver some of the dishes with her. \nSometimes, during the holidays, Ruelas and her children would donate the meals to the homeless, Ruelas said. \n\"The purpose wasn't to sell food,\" Ruelas said. \"We wanted to bring something positive to our community.\" She mentioned Stockton's high crime and soaring homicide rates. \n\"They took the time to be investigating for over a year now,\" she said of her case. \"But they can't solve all these unsolved murders?\" \nKelly McDaniel, the San Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney, told the local Fox affiliate that the 209 Food Spot Facebook group was sent a warning before charges were filed. She added that selling any food not subject to health department inspection is a danger to the public and undercuts business owners who purchase permits to cook and sell food. \n\"People are assuming that I was taking from other businesses,\" Ruelas said. \"It's not something that I was trying to make a business out of.\" \nRuelas has been out of work for two years, for personal reasons and to care for her children. After paying rent, electricity, water and other monthly bills, she only has $200 per month left for food and necessary shopping, she said. Simply paying the $230 fine for her misdemeanors would be a blow to her family's finances. \nAlthough she rarely earned much of an income from the food sales through the Facebook group, she occasionally received useful items - such as clothes for the kids - in exchange for food. When a neighbor knew she needed furniture for her home, he offered to give her family couches in exchange for a home-cooked meal. \n\"I have two kids that are going to have a birthday party next week and I have no idea what I'm going to do about it,\" she said. \nOn Sunday, Ruelas posted a message from her 17-year-old daughter, Mariyah, on Facebook. She said she didn't want to be home when her mother made phone calls to her lawyer or to reporters about the case. It scared her, she wrote, thinking about her mom going to jail and leaving her and her siblings without a parent. \n\"That's just sad,\" Ruelas wrote in the Facebook post. \"I need this done already so we can just breathe.\" Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "Qais Usyan/AFP/Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nThe phrase “survival of the fittest” makes it tempting to think of natural selection as an unequivocal engine of progress, one that only makes humans stronger and healthier specimens. But, in reality, the process is more complicated. \n“I preach about this in my classes all the time,” Karen Rosenberg, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Delaware, tells mental_floss . “We think of ‘fit’ to mean aerobically fit, or able to run far, but in evolutionary biology, ‘fit’ means being reproductively successful.” In other words, you just need to be able to survive long enough to pass on your genes to the next generation. \nTo achieve reproductive success, natural selection sometimes makes compromises, and as a result, humans have developed some traits that pose real challenges to our health today. From back injuries to difficult childbirth, here are six downsides of being human that you can blame on evolution. 1. WE HAVE BACK PAIN. \nThe birth of bipedalism was a high point in human evolution. Standing upright allowed us to travel long distances and freed up our hands to use tools and carry food, but it also came at a cost. \nIn chimpanzees and our other quadrupedal cousins, the vertebral column acts like a suspension bridge. “But if you take that horizontally stable structure and tilt it vertically, it loses its stability,” Jeremy DeSilva, a paleoanthropologist at Dartmouth College, tells mental_floss . \nThe most obvious way to make a structurally sound spine in an upright creature would be a straight stack of vertebrae. But this arrangement would block the birth canal, and clearly you need to have babies to ensure the survival of your species. So the human spine had to evolve into the “curved mess” that it is today to make way for our big-brained babies to be born, DeSilva says. The price we pay is back pain—and prevalent injuries like slipped disks and spontaneous compression fractures. 2. WE HAVE WEIRD APEY FEET. \nIf you look at the most high-tech prosthetic feet available today, their structure is more like an ostrich’s foot. They don’t replicate human anatomy because the anatomically correct human foot is sort of awkward. \n“Humans were not designed from scratch,” DeSilva says. “We’ve inherited a lot of the anatomies we have from our ape ancestry, and the foot is a wonderful example.” \nWhen we starting walking on two feet, we no longer needed the flexible feet that our ape ancestors required to climb trees and grab branches. In order to give us more stability and allow us to better push off the ground, evolution took a “paper clips and duct tape” approach, DeSilva says. But because we walk around on modified ape feet that can twist and roll quite easily, we sprain and break our ankles. We get shin splints, plantar fasciitis, and collapsed arches. This isn’t just a modern phenomenon; scientists even see some of these common foot injuries in the fossil record. \n\"It works well enough, and that’s all you really need in evolution,” DeSilva says. “What we have as a consequence of a just-good-enough foot is a billion-dollar podiatry industry.” 3. CHILDBIRTH IS TRICKY. \nCompared with other apes, humans experience very difficult childbirth. That’s largely because the human pelvis is very narrow relative to the big heads and broad shoulders of our babies. \n“The pelvis serves two conflicting functions in humans: allowing us to walk on two legs and allowing us to give birth to big-brained babies,” Rosenberg says. The shape of the pelvis is a compromise between those two things. \nBut humans have come up with an interesting cultural answer to the problem of long and painful birth. While birth is a solitary event for most mammals, Rosenberg pointed out that virtually all human mothers seek delivery assistance from relatives, midwives, or doctors. \nIn a paper in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , Rosenberg and her colleague Wenda Trevathan wrote that natural selection likely favored the behavior of seeking assistance during birth. This probably wasn’t a conscious decision by expectant mothers. Rather, seeking help might have been driven by fear, anxiety, and pain, but over time, this led to reduced mortality. 4. WE CRAVE JUNK FOOD. \nThere’s a good reason it’s hard to give up fast food and candy. Sugar is a basic form of energy, and excess sugar is stored as fat to get us through times of hardship. Before the rise of agriculture and industrialization, when food sources were scarce or unreliable, a taste for sugar was necessary for survival. But now that processed sugar is readily available in grocery stores, humans are overdoing it. As a result, we’re facing an obesity epidemic and a rise in conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. \n“The food industry has made a fortune because we retain Stone Age bodies that crave sugar but live in a Space Age world in which sugar is cheap and plentiful,” Harvard evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times a few years ago. (He was arguing at the time that New York City’s proposed ban on big sodas might actually help restore the healthy constraints of a hunter-gatherer world.) 5. A LOT OF US HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS. \nNatural selection didn’t weed out potentially harmful conditions like schizophrenia and depression, even though many of these disorders are associated with lower birth rates. Some scientists have theorized that the unaffected siblings of the people with mental disorders might be responsible, as they may pass the mutations on to their own children, keeping these disorders in the gene pool. Other scientists have looked at the origins of mental disorders, showing that while devastating, some of these illnesses seem connected to an evolutionary advantage. \nFor example, while some symptoms of depression can be debilitating, some researchers have argued that the condition can also promote an analytical style of thought that can be very productive at solving problems. Other research has shown that schizophrenia-related genes may have helped humans achieve complex cognition. 6. OUR THIRD MOLARS ARE A PAIN. \nAfter humans started walking upright, we underwent another major transformation: Our brains got much bigger. To accommodate a larger brain, the shape of our faces changed, and our jaws had to become narrower. But for many people, this means that their third molars, or wisdom teeth, once vital for chewing, have no room to erupt through the gums, so they become impacted. If these impacted teeth are not extracted, they can become extremely painful or cause infections. \nBut natural selection is still at work: A genetic mutation that stops wisdom teeth from forming has been spreading, and more people today are born without third molars.

      "text": "filed under: technology , sound Like us on Facebook \nIn the future, editing audio might be as easy as opening up Photoshop and cropping a picture. Adobe’s Project VoCo, two years in the making, is designed to make audio editing “really easy for the average person” according to Zeyu Jin, an audio researcher and intern at Adobe's Creative Technologies Lab. With Project VoCo, you can easily crop out certain words by searching through a transcript—and even generate new words in the speaker’s voice. \nThe program debuted as one of 11 experimental projects at Adobe Sneaks, an event where the company shows off new technology “that doesn’t have a place in a product yet—or may never,” as Adobe Senior Research Scientist Stephen DiVerdi explains it. \nProject VoCo just needs an audio sample and a transcript of the recording, then you can edit the transcript and let the program handle the audio, instead of cropping and stitching together the recording yourself. If you need to edit out curses or misspoken words, it's just a matter of searching the text of the transcript. More impressively, the program can analyze a person’s voice and create new speech that sounds just like them, by cobbling together syllables and sounds the person used in the initial recording. (Because of this process, you can’t insert words that require sounds that person never used in the audio sample provided.) \nFor instance, you can change this first sentence below into one with a whole different meaning: \nSee a live demonstration at the recent Adobe Max conference in the video below. The meat of the demonstration starts just before the one-minute mark. \nIt doesn’t take much data for the program to be able to synthesize someone’s voice—it can do it with 10 minutes of audio, though for a really good mimic, 30 minutes is better. \nIn the ideal use case, you could fire up this program to fix speeches or podcasts or voice-overs where there was a mistake in the initial recording, and you need to re-record. Since audio is so sensitive, changes in the sound of the room or in the person's voice (say, if they've developed a cold) make it next to impossible to re-record just a segment of the audio clip in question—to make it sound really good, you need to re-record the whole thing. Here, you can make corrections that sound seamless. That said, the ability to create audio featuring someone’s voice saying words that never came out of their mouth is ripe for serious misuse. But the Adobe researchers say that it’s not unlike the ability to Photoshop misleading images, like the fake viral images that circulate on the web. \nStill, Jin says they “are looking for a technological solution to prevent misuse. We are investigating deep learning detectors to find the edited part [of the audio]” and create some sort of watermark for it. \nAll images courtesy of Adobe More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "By David via Wikimedia Commons // CC BY 2.0 Like us on Facebook \nA video that sent the internet abuzz over the weekend tells a familiar story: A husband comes home to find his wife cheating with another man and a violent brawl to win her love ensues. But unlike in more common tales, all the players involved in this saga are penguins. \nNatGeo Channel tweeted the clip , titled “Homewrecking Penguin,” on Friday, November 4 and it’s since racked up 300,000 likes. Dramatic music and narration set the mood as the male Magellanic penguin returns to his nest only to discover he’s been replaced. The scene plays out violently from there, with the males swinging their solid-boned wings \"like baseball bats,\" according to the narrator, and using their beaks to peck at each other’s eyes. The original mate eventually concedes to losing both his wife and children. Toward the end he makes a final plea for the female to reconsider, but as the narrator cruelly notes \"she’s got no time for losers.\" \nBecause the only thing the internet loves more than cute animals is juicy drama, the domestic dispute immediately took Twitter by storm. Numerous memes have been shared and @husbandpenguin and @wifepenguin Twitter handles have been created (based on follower count alone most people seem to be siding #teamwifepenguin). \nThe video is difficult to watch but viewers shouldn’t feel too bad for the scorned penguin—as NatGeo points out, a colony of 200,000 provides him with plenty of chances to meet someone new.",

      "text": "Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nWhen it comes to Dana Carvey, the question most people ask isn’t “What’s your favorite Dana Carvey impression?” or “Is Wayne’s World 3 still happening?” It’s “What the hell happened to Dana Carvey?” The former Saturday Night Live star has kept a rather low profile since his 2002 bomb, The Master of Disguise . But now he’s back in the spotlight thanks to his Netflix special, Straight White Male, 60 . Here are five quick facts about the comedian to catch you up on his multi-decade career. Party on, Dana. 1. HE HAD SMALL PARTS IN HALLOWEEN II AND THIS IS SPINAL TAP . \nBefore Dana Carvey landed his star-making gig on Saturday Night Live in 1986, he racked up a few film credits in blink-and-you'll-miss-him roles. His first movie was Halloween II , in which he played a news crew assistant with zero lines . At least he got more to do in Rob Reiner’s definitive mockumentary, This Is Spinal Tap . That time, he appeared as a mime waiter alongside Billy Crystal. Watch them gripe outside the kitchen in the clip above. 2. HE AUDITIONED FOR SNL WITH ROBIN WILLIAMS AND JIMMY STEWART IMPRESSIONS. \nCarvey is famous for his impressions, and they certainly helped him win over Lorne Michaels in his audition for Saturday Night Live . As you can see in the above video, he warmed up with his take on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous host Robin Leach before moving on to Jimmy Stewart, “senile” Robin Williams, and John Travolta. You can also see flashes of Wayne’s World co-host Garth Algar in his impersonation of his brother Brad, who inspired the character . 3. HIS SHORT-LIVED SHOW HELPED LAUNCH THE CAREERS OF LOUIS CK, STEPHEN COLBERT, AND STEVE CARELL. \nAfter leaving SNL in 1993, Carvey made a few movies, like Clean Slate and Trapped in Paradise . Then, in 1996, he debuted his own sketch show —The Dana Carvey Show . The series featured an insane slate of comedic talent: Saturday Night Live veteran Robert Smigel co-created the show, Louis CK was the head writer, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell wrote and performed on the show, and the writers room was populated with future showrunners and screenwriters like Robert Carlock ( 30 Rock ) and Charlie Kaufman ( Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ). Still, the show struggled with ratings, so ABC canceled it before the eighth episode even aired. The Dana Carvey Show enjoys a cult status among comedy nerds today, particularly for skits like Carell and Colbert’s “Waiters Who Are Nauseated by Food.” 4. HE TURNED DOWN HOSTING NBC’S LATE NIGHT . \nBefore Carvey developed his failed series, he was approached with an intriguing offer. David Letterman’s jump from NBC to CBS left a hosting vacancy on the Late Night show. Carvey was offered the job, but turned it down because he thought it was too big of a commitment . So instead, the hosting spot went to another SNL alum (albeit in the writing department): Conan O’Brien. 5. HIS WORK WAS REFERENCED AT GERALD FORD’S FUNERAL. \nMany public figures bristle when an SNL actor impersonates him or her on TV. But not George H.W. Bush. The former president was a huge fan of Carvey’s impression of him. He invited the comic to stay at the White House, and the two even exchanged letters . But perhaps Bush’s most public endorsement came during Gerald Ford’s funeral. In the middle of his remarks, Bush observed , “[Ford] had a wonderful sense of humor, and even took it in stride when Chevy Chase had to make the entire world think that this terrific, beautifully coordinated athlete was actually a stumbler. Ford says it was funny. He wrote that in his memoir. I remember that lesson well, since being able to laugh at yourself is essential in public life. I'd tell you more about that, but as Dana Carvey would say, ‘Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.’” More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Federal prosecutors are confident that former Wilton Manors resident Craig Jungwirth used Facebook to threaten to \"exterminate\" gays and lesbians in South Florida, but they can't tell yet which account he used to issue the ominous statement.\nJungwirth had 59 different accounts, Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc Anton told a federal judge during a hearing Monday. Investigators became aware of the threat on Aug. 30, when a tipster sent a screenshot of the threat to the FBI.\nAccording to that screenshot, the threat came from Jungwirth. But when investigators executed a search warrant on one of Jungwirth's accounts, they were unable to locate the post. \"At this point we have not been able to identify the specific account from which the threat was sent,\" Anton told U.S. Magistrate Judge Patrick Hunt. Additional warrants are needed to go through the other accounts, Anton said.\nJungwirth, 50, has been charged with making an online threat and faces up to five years in prison if convicted. The trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 14.\n\"If you losers thought the Pulse nightclub shooting was bad, wait till you see what I'm planning for Labor Day,\" the post said.\nThe Pulse nightclub in Orlando was the scene of a mass shooting on June 12 that left 49 dead and 53 injured.\nJungwirth's lawyer, Michael Spivack, said Monday he was baffled by what he called the government's inability to tie the threat to his client.\n\"Is that all they have, really?\" Spivack said, holding up a copy of the screenshot. \"It doesn't even have my client's photograph!\"\nHunt gave prosecutors until Thursday to turn over any additional information that surfaces from a search of Jungwirth's other accounts.\nrolmeda@sunsentinel.com , 954-356-4457, Twitter @SSCourts and @rolmeda \n  Crime Pulse Nightclub Massacre",

      "text": "Prosecutors defend possible jail time for California woman who sold ceviche dish through Facebook Prosecutors defend possible jail time for Facebook food sale NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  34 PM \nThe California woman who sold an undercover investigator ceviche through Facebook deserves her possible jail sentence, prosecutors said Monday. \nStockton single mom Mariza Ruelas, 37, faces two misdemeanor charges of operating a food facility and engaging in business without a permit. The rap carries up to a year behind bars, and jail would be merited if she’s found guilty, San Joaquin Chief Deputy District Attorney Sherri Adams said. \nAdams told the Daily News she “highly” doubts that Ruelas would end up receiving the maximum sentence. Yet she noted the investigation into a 15,000-member local Facebook group called 209 Food Spot stemmed from concerns around state laws involving both health and business. \n“The bigger issue is the health and safety. They could be cooking it out of the garage and having absolutely no cleanliness,” Adams said. “There’s a lot more to some of these businesses than, ‘I’m just making food for my friends.’” \nCalif. woman who sold food on Facebook facing possible jail time \nAdams said the county’s Environmental Health Department alerted the D.A.’s office that members of the group were selling one or two dishes at a time. The undercover investigator made 10 purchases, and authorities filed the same rap last year for all the users who sold food, she said. \nYet Ruelas revealed to a local TV station on Friday that she is the only one of them who has declined so far to take a plea deal from prosecutors. She acted as the administrator of the group, which shared recipes, organized potlucks and occasionally resulted in the sales between members. Mariza Ruelas poses with four of her children. She says she was charged with a crime just for participating in a community Facebook group about food. (Mariza Ruelas) \nRuelas, a mother of six whose father is from the Mexican coastal state of Colima, told the News she received a message from the undercover agent last December. He was asking her about her ceviche, a classic Latin American seafood dish and a specialty family recipe of hers. \n“He just contacted me and said he was interested,” Ruelas said, noting she was asking $12 for the dish. “I just said, ‘I have a couple left over that I can sell you if you’d like.’” \nSupporters who saw her story on social media plan to rally Wednesday outside the courthouse in the suburban Bay Area city, Ruelas said. She wrote on her GoFundMe page , which had raised over $1,400 by Monday afternoon. that she plans to consider opening a small restaurant after her case is over. \nShe just thinks the prosecutor’s office could have used its resources for better purposes, she said. \n“They have hundreds of unsolved murders. There’s shootings daily,” Ruelas said. “It was outrageous that they would focus so much time. It was very upsetting.” Ruelas provided this picture of her ceviche, a family recipe and one of her specialties. She said the undercover investigator wanted to buy one serving for $12. (Mariza Ruelas) \nShe rejected prosecutors’ offer of three years of probation, a $235 fine and community service in part because other people from the group received just one year of probation, she said. Yet Adams said she got an offer with the longer term because she kept selling food on Facebook. \n“Even after being charged, she continued to offer food,” Adams said. “There’s a lot more to her story than she’s revealing.” \nRuelas denied that she kept trying to sell her food, and she said the group has long since shut down. She doesn’t even know what happened to the ceviche in question, she said. \n“Omg that's what I asked my lawyer if he can find out!” she wrote in a Facebook message. “I hope he at least gave it to a homeless guy along with all the other food he bought from the other people.” Join the Conversation:",

He was not harassed by soldiers or cut off from all communication. He was given a small television set that could pick up one or two channels, plus daily newspapers, and he was provided three meals a day. He was allowed visitors, but only on the specific authorization of Babangida. In most cases, his visitors were members of his family, although because they lived in the north of the country, and Benin was in Edo state in the south, travel was a problem. \n“Buhari’s daily routine was much the same every day. He would get up around 5 a.m. for Muslim prayers, and then go back to bed; get up again around 8 or 9 a.m. and have breakfast;read; have lunch; rest; exercise; pray; eat dinner; read and sleep. The only exercise he could get was to jog around outside the house. \n“He read not only newspapers, but also novels, history books and Qur’an.” \nPresident Buhari arrived Benin airport to begin a two-day working visit to Edo on Nvember 7, Monday . He was received by Governor Adams Oshiomhole. \nThe president inspected a guard of honour mounted by military personnel before he proceeded to the palace of the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare N’gidigan II, on a courtesy visit. \nOshiomhole, who was first inaugurated on Nov. 12, 2008 and won his second term in 2012, is expected to hand over to the governor-elect, Godwin Obaseki, on November 12.",

Clinton talked about the future of America if she is elected, encouraging others to get out the vote and what would make her a better president than Donald Trump. Eric Seals/Detroit Free Press (Photo: Eric Seals) \nALLENDALE -- Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, visiting suburban Grand Rapids on the eve of Tuesday's election, told a college crowd that she often doesn't recognize the country described by her opponent, Republican Donald Trump. \nTrump has \"a dark and divisive vision for America,\" Clinton said at the Grand Valley State University Fieldhouse in Allendale, a few hours before Trump was scheduled to visit nearby Grand Rapids, with Michigan emerging as a pivotal state in the final days of a bitter campaign. \n\"I know we've got problems,\" Clinton said, but \"since when do we become pessimistic?\" and decide Americans can't solve problems together, she asked. \n\"Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger,\" she said. To heal the country after Tuesday, \"we've got to start listening to each other, respecting each other.\" \n► Related: Will Michigan voters decide whether Trump or Clinton wins it all? \nThe university arena where Clinton spoke for 35 minutes seats a little more than 4,000 people. Some bleachers were not in use to allow for a press area. But with the seating area full, more than 1,000 supporters filled the floor area. Officials said the fire marshal pegged the crowd at 4,600. Many in the crowd were students who chanted \"Hillary\" and hoisted signs in support of Clinton. \nClinton got some of her loudest cheers Monday when she voiced her support for LGBT rights, clean energy and \"equal pay for women's work,\" and relief from the high cost of tuition and student loan debt. \n\"I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran,\" Clinton said of the Vermont senator who challenged her for the Democratic nomination and drew huge support among young people. \"When it was over, we actually got together.\" \nAs Michigan was emerging as a critical state in the presidential election, some observers said western Michigan -- where both Clinton and Trump were campaigning Monday -- could determine whether Clinton or Trump wins the state and its 16 electoral votes. \nThough western Michigan is generally thought of as a Republican stronghold, it's not monolithic. The City of Grand Rapids has a strong Democratic base, and in 2008 President Barack Obama won Kent County, which includes Grand Rapids, defeating Republican John McCain there by about 1,500 votes. In 2012, Michigan native Mitt Romney won Kent County with about 53% of the vote, compared to 46% for Obama. Obama in Ann Arbor says Trump 'uniquely unqualified' to be president \nThough she was only a few miles from the Grand Rapids border, Clinton campaigned in Allendale, which is in Ottawa County, a much more solidly Republican area than Kent: McCain beat Obama 61% to 37% there in 2008, and Romney beat Obama by an even wider margin there in 2012, 67% to 33%. \nNo Republican presidential candidate has won Michigan since George H. W. Bush in 1988. \nClinton pledged not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year and promised tax cuts for small businesses. She criticized Trump's tax plan as one that would mostly benefit the wealthy. \nOne self-described undecided voter was hoping to attend both the Clinton and Trump events Monday before casting her vote on Tuesday. \n\"What are the chances of having both presidential candidates in Michigan on the same day?\" asked Mary Redford, 25, a law student at Western Michigan University who was waiting in line to see Clinton. \nShe said she planned to attend the Trump rally, scheduled for 11 p.m. in Grand Rapids, \"if I'm awake.\" Buy Photo \n(Photo: Paul Egan/Detroit Free Press) \nRedford said both candidates \"have pros and cons.\" \nShe said it's important that Clinton is the first female presidential candidate from a major party, and that she's experienced and knowledgeable. \nBut she also likes the fact that Trump is \"business savvy and different,\" she said. \nScott Hagerstrom, Trump's Michigan director, said“ the Clinton campaign is limping to the finish line in Michigan.\" \n\"As Donald Trump expands the electoral map, it's clear that Michigan is ready for change,\" Hagerstrom said in a statement issued soon after Clinton finished speaking. \"For too long, Washington insiders like Hillary Clinton have put their own interests before the American people's. Now it's our turn to elect an outsider who has no loyalties to the special interests and lobbyists whose deep pockets influence every decision in our nation’s capital.” \nMichigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon, a former state representative from Grand Rapids, said Monday that polls suggest Trump is not performing as well as he needs to in western Michigan, and the Clinton campaign hopes to take advantage of that. \n\"This area has been trending a little bit more Democratic in the last few cycles, and you have a large contingent of college-educated women\" who could find it difficult to back Trump, Dillon said. \nAlso, Trump's economic message -- focused on the loss of manufacturing jobs and the need to renegotiate international trade deals -- may not play as well in western Michigan, where the economy is booming, as it does in some other parts of the state, Dillon said. \nJohn Inhulsen, chairman of the Kent County Republican Party, said \"I think Kent County is going to be the turning point for Michigan this time,\" with Trump winning big in Macomb County and Clinton winning Oakland County, and western Michigan needing to ring up votes for Trump to give him a chance for victory. \nAlso, \"I do think that as Michigan goes, the national election is going to go,\" Inhulsen told the Free Press Monday. \nInhulsen said it will come down to the ground game and which party does a better job of getting its supporters to the polls. As for Trump's economic message, workers in some parts of western Michigan have been hurt by the loss of manufacturing jobs, he said. \nTrump has an 11 p.m. rally scheduled at DeVos Place in downtown Grand Rapids.",

      "text": "Do you want to get more out of Facebook ads? \nLooking for ways to make your campaigns more cost-effective? \nSome simple tactics can help you maximize the performance of your Facebook campaigns, especially if you’re on a tight budget. \n  four ways to optimize your Facebook ad campaigns for better results . #1: Combine Multiple Objectives in a Single Ad \nIf your business is relatively new or has a small customer base, consider optimizing your campaign for multiple benefits simultaneously . Although this practice is not recommended for larger businesses that want to put all of their efforts into one objective, optimizing for several objectives can be effective for small budgets. \nIn the ad below, a Facebook page with a relatively small audience is trying to promote their page and encourage likes. Notice they’ve included a link to their site and are using the ad to promote their blog . This ad promoting the company’s Facebook page includes a link to their website in the text. \nThis tactic works well in this instance because the ad shows people that despite being small, this business has a website for customers to find more information. If people visit their website, it can help encourage trust in the brand, making users more inclined to like the Facebook page. \nIncluding a link in an ad designed to promote a page also lets people find out more about the content the business shares. If users click on the website and find content they enjoy, they might become long-term followers of both the page and website. \nKeep in mind that this tactic can be harmful to your campaign if your Facebook ads are optimized for two or more objectives or have multiple objectives that don’t work in harmony (for example, app installs and event responses). #2: Take Advantage of Targeting Features to Refine Your Audience \nTo create a low-cost, high-performing Facebook ad, you need to narrow down   This will help ensure your ads reach the right people , giving you the best chance of success. You’ll also avoid spending money serving ads to people who won’t be interested in your business. Define   \nHere are the parameters to define within your ad set to optimize ad targeting . \nLocations \nSpecifying a location in your ad set lets you target people in a certain geographic area who have something in common with what you’re promoting. \nFor example, suppose that you have an organic beauty business with multiple locations and you want to create an ad to promote your Facebook page. If the ad is specifically for your Los Angeles store, use location targeting to serve your ad to people in the Los Angeles area who may already be familiar with your brand or are more likely to visit your store. Target Facebook ads in a specific geographic area. \nNow repeat this targeting for all of your store locations. Tailor your ad’s text and imagery for each audience to improve the success rate of your campaign. \nAn added benefit to location targeting is it gives you a way to split test a campaign . If you separate your ad sets by city , you can see which locations are responding well to your ads and invest more of your ad budget into those. \nTip : Adding text like “Visit our LA store” to your ad copy can help you target local customers and increase the chances of people engaging with the ad. \nAge and Gender \nNext, think about your buyer persona , which will include the age and gender of your perfect buyer. \nUse this information in your campaign targeting by specifying that age and gender. You want to serve your ads to people who might be interested, as opposed to people with no connection to the products or services you’re promoting. Target an age range and gender. \nIf your in-house data shows that your highest-value customers are females ages 18-30, use this information to enhance your targeting efforts and show the ads only to people who share these traits. \nDetailed Targeting \nThe Detailed Targeting section is where you specify the behaviors, interests, and demographics of your ideal customer . You want your ad to be shown to people who have already expressed an interest in certain areas. These are the people who are more likely to engage with and respond to your ads. \nFor your organic beauty brand, you want to target people who have already expressed an interest in organic products. Here’s a selection of interests and behaviors you may want to target. Focus on user interests that are related to what your business offers. \nConnections \nDepending on your ad objective , you can also use connections targeting , which lets you show your ad to people you have a connection with on Facebook , such as people who’ve liked your page. \nFor your organic beauty brand ad, your objective is to get new fans for your Facebook page, so exclude people who have already liked your page in your targeting. If you want to reach a new audience, exclude people who already like your page. \nFacebook also lets you target people who like your page, and friends of people who like your page. Either option is ideal if your campaign objective is to increase visits to your website or encourage post engagement. #3: Split Test to Shift Resources to Top-performing Ads \nIf you have a small ad budget, it’s important to split test your campaigns . This allows you to identify well-performing ads and adjust your spend based on the results. \nSuppose you’ve created four ad sets that each target a different city. Your Los Angeles ad is performing well and getting a cost per result (CPR) of $0.25, but your Chicago campaign is running with a CPR of $1.32. Taking this data into consideration, it makes sense to turn off the Chicago ad, or assign more budget to the Los Angeles campaign, because that’s where you’re getting the best return on your investment. \nIn the example below, the ad set with a CPR of £0.03p has double the budget of the one with a CPR of around £0.25p. This business can now invest more resources into the successful ads and get a higher (and more valuable) return for their investment. Review your ad performance and shift resources to better-performing ads. \nIf you’re running a Facebook campaign and have a small budget to work with, you should analyze your ads as they run to help you minimize the chances you’ll waste money on ads that aren’t performing as well as others. #4: Add Special Offers to Prompt Conversions \nDid you know that around 93% of shoppers have used a discount code or coupon in the past year? Using special offers and discount codes is a classic marketing technique to entice new and existing customers to buy your products or services. Not only do offers help you boost sales, but they also give the audience an incentive to buy from you . \nThe main objective of this Amazon Prime campaign is for people to install the app through iTunes. To persuade them to make the download decision, Amazon is offering a £5 off discount code for a first-time purchase if they act quickly. Amazon Prime offers a special discount to the people they’re targeting in this campaign. \nWhen you include an offer that can be used only when people are exposed to your Facebook ad campaign , you’ll be able to see how successful your ads were within your customer database. If the offer with the code FB$10DISCOUNT gains 200 more sales than one with $10OFF, you’ll know that the best way to promote sales vouchers is through Facebook ads. \nThis tactic helps you identify the best marketing tactics for your business and maximize your return on a small investment. \nConclusion \nAs you can see, with a few tweaks to your Facebook ads, you can get a better return on your investment. \nWhat do you think? Do you use some of these tactics to get a better return on your Facebook ad campaigns? What tips can you offer? Please share your thoughts in the comments below. Related Posts",

      "text": "Screengrab via Spartanburg County Sheriff/CBS News (CC-BY) The suspect is a convicted sex offender who police believe could be involved in seven murders. \nOver the weekend, police in South Carolina found a woman chained up in a shipping container and her boyfriend dead on the property of a man now suspected in seven murders. \nThe couple, Kala Brown and Charlie Carver, went missing around Aug. 31, though someone claiming to be Carver continued to post on his Facebook page over the past two months. The posts suggested the pair had gotten married and were expecting a daughter, but the messages were odd and rambling, and eventually they drew national attention to the case. Within those posts were lyrics to an Eagles song that may link registered sex offender and suspect Todd Kohlhepp to the kiddings, murder, and postings. \nA verse of \"Hotel California\"—which includes \"Last thing I remember, I was running for the door\"—not only appeared on Carer's Facebook's page, but was also referenced in an Amazon review of padlocks that Kohlhepp wrote. These were padlocks that Kohlhepp said in another review he had used on a shipping container. Brown was discovered in a shipping container \"chained up like a dog.\" \n\"Facebook has always been real good to work with us in this kind of investigation, so we’re just trying to figure it out if it was him or somebody else that did it,\" Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said at a press conference. He said \"it's very possible\" Kohlhepp wrote the Facebook posts on Carver's account, though the sheriff's department has yet to serve Facebook with a warrant, according to the Daily Beast . \nKohlhepp also wrote about the couple's disappearance on his own Facebook page on Sept. 15: “Reading the news... this person missing, that person missing, another person missing... oh wait... that person just went to beach with friend, other person found with her parole violation boyfriend.” \nA friend of Brown's told the AP that Brown and Carver had been hired to clean properties that Kohlhepp, a 45-year-old realtor, was planning to sell. Then he \"pulled out a gun and took them hostage.\" \nPolice believe Kohlhepp could be connected to a total of seven murders. In 1986, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl, for which he spent 15 years in prison. Another body was discovered on Monday, as police continue to search his 100-acre property.",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \nFacebook Inc ( FB.O ) said on Monday, it was testing a feature that would let page administrators create job postings and receive applications from candidates, a move that could pressure LinkedIn Corp's ( LNKD.N ) recruiting business. \"Based on behavior we've seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we're running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,\" a company spokesman told Reuters. \nLinkedIn makes most of its revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people on what's often known as the social network for business. \nTechnology news website TechCrunch first reported the news on Monday. ( tcrn.ch/2fwHLSB ) \nWith Facebook's jobs features, companies could drive more traffic to their Facebook pages while allowing them to pay the social network to get their job openings in front of more candidates, TechCrunch said. \nIn October, Facebook launched Marketplace to allow people to buy and sell items locally as the social media network tries new ways to keep its users engaged. \n(Reporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Leslie Adler)  ",

      "text": "Join a chat \nWhat’s unclear at this time is if Facebook plans to monetize this service. LinkedIn makes a hefty chunk of its revenue by tapping job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to connect. These individuals are then able to contact potential employers, post a resume, and connect with people within the corporate social hierarchy. \nFacebook’s jobs feature would have the unfortunate task of trying to mix business and pleasure, something most of us are probably doing on the platform anyway. For job seekers and employers though, this could be great news. Tapping the world’s largest social network for potential jobs — or the best hires — makes a lot of sense. \nPlus, we’re typically following our favorite businesses on Facebook anyway. As a final bonus, it keeps us from having to jump in waist-deep while trying to wade through the hell hole that LinkedIn has become. \nNo word on when the service might launch, but we’ll update you as we know more.",

      "text": "AP November 7, 2016, 9:23 PM Calif. mom selling homemade ceviche on Facebook could face jail time \nFacebook displayed on a computer screen. Dan Kitwood, Getty Images Stumble \nFRESNO, Calif. -- A single mother of six in California is headed to trial and possibly a year in jail for selling homemade ceviche through a Facebook group she created as a hobby, officials said Monday. \nMariza Ruelas, 37, was cited with two misdemeanor counts after launching the online forum called “209 Food Spot” -- a group for Stockton-area residents to trade recipes and sell their specialty dishes. \nThis case has no place in the criminal courts, said San Joaquin County Deputy Public Defender Benjamin Hall, who described Ruelas as being part of a new, shared economy that’s evolving through social media. He compared it to ride-sharing ventures, such as Uber and Lyft. \nProsecutors say, however, that Ruelas did not have a business permit or undergo health inspections required of restaurants that protect people from eating food prepared in unsanitary kitchens, which can turn fatal. \n“When it can cause death, it’s our responsibility to enforce laws that protect the public,” said Kelly McDaniel, who is prosecuting the case. “It’s not unreasonable to be enforcing this type of law.” \nThe home-based enterprise went well beyond a hobby, McDaniel said. She cited federal statics that roughly 3,000 Americans each year die from food-borne illnesses. \nRuelas’ cooking hasn’t sparked a formal complaint of illness, but McDaniel said she’s not waiting for that to happen. People like Ruelas also undercut restaurant owners who obtain the proper permits, the prosecutor said. \nAuthorities say they first warned Ruelas and others in her online forum with a letter. She continued to operate and got into trouble when she unwittingly sold an order for ceviche to an investigator. \nCeviche is a popular Latin American dish often made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices and served cold. \nRuelas later rejected a plea deal to spend one year on probation and perform 80 hours of community service -- avoiding the potential of jail time. She now plans to fight the case in trial. \n“It’s a hobby, it’s creating this Facebook page about community and bringing people together around food,” said Hall, Ruelas’ public defender. “That’s not what the criminal justice system should be used for.” \nRuelas is raising money through the website GoFundMe and says she hopes to open her own restaurant, replacing the Facebook enterprise that got her in trouble. \n“It was a hobby my girls and I enjoyed doing together on a free weekend,” she wrote on the post. “Never in a million years did I ever imagine that things would get this bad.” © 2016 The Associated Press.

Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, a section of city northwest of downtown, has sometimes been called \"porn valley\" because so many adult film production companies have set up shop there. \nThe state's workplace safety enforcement agency, Cal-OSHA, is already charged with making sure actors where condoms in adult films for their own protection. Plus, Los Angeles voters approved a measure in 2012 requiring condom use. \nProposition 60 backers say enforcement of that law isn't vigorous enough because the agency only acts on complaints. Only four citations were issued in 2014 and 2015, the state's legislative analyst says. \nOne in four performers in the porn industry have sexually transmitted diseases, including chlamydia and gonorrhea in far greater proportions than the general population, says the organization backing the measure, the For Adult Industry Responsibility (FAIR) Committee. \nAs such, those who don't wear protection pose a wider threat than just to fellow actors. \n\"The diseases contracted in the porn studios don’t always stay in the studios or in the porn industry. In one widely publicized case last year, a porn actor had sex with 17 people outside the industry (and with five others inside the industry) in 22 days before it was discovered he had HIV,\" the committee contends. \nCritics, including the adult film industry's association, the Free Speech Coalition , say the measure goes too far. They also point to a Los Angeles County Department of Public Health analysis which says \"passage of Proposition 60 may result in some adult film productions going underground or relocating outside the state.\" Opponents also include both the California Republican and Democratic parties.

      "text": "Singapore President Tony Tan will not stand in next Presidential Election In a Facebook post, President Tony Tan Keng Yam said he looks forward to seeing Singapore's first Malay President after 46 years. Posted 08 Nov 2016 16:36 Updated 08 Nov 2016 16:45 File photo of President Tony Tan Keng Yam. (Photo: TODAY) A \nSINGAPORE: President Tony Tan Keng Yam on Tuesday (Nov 8) announced that he will not seek a second term in office, as the upcoming election will be reserved for eligible Malay candidates. \nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said earlier said in Parliament that under the hiatus-triggered model proposed, the next election, due to be held by 2017, will be reserved for Malay candidates . \n\"I look forward to seeing a Malay President after 46 years,\" Dr Tan wrote on Facebook. Singapore has not had a Malay head of state since the first President Yusof Ishak. \nDr Tan added that his priority as President remains unchanged. \"I will continue to focus on performing my current role as President as well as I can for the remainder of my term, strengthening community ties and forging better international relations for Singapore,\" he said. \nIn his post, Dr Tan also reiterated his message delivered by Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob on Monday. \"The proposed amendments will ensure that our Constitution as a living document is aptly refreshed. As I said in my Presidential message to Parliament yesterday, the institution of Elected Presidency has to stay relevant with time and our local context,\" Dr Tan said. - CNA/dl",

Sort of. Let's say it's humorous in a crass, awful, call for lynching kind of way, if such a thing could be funny. Which it can't. \nBut I'm not going to get all worked up over it. \nJournalists have always been the targets of public figures. It's just that Donald Trump has taken that demonetization to an entire new level. So, at a Trump rally in Minnesota you get a guy like this -- which lots of people are apparently enjoying -- and an opportunity to purchase the t-shirt. \nNice. \nA photographer from Reuters took the picture. Again, our photographer took this in Minnesota. I had the location wrong the first time. Apologies. pic.twitter.com/OwuCt7WAUr — Patricia Zengerle (@ReutersZengerle) November 6, 2016 \nI wish I could say that I thought things would get better after the election. I'm not so sure. I fear we may have crossed a line from which there is no going back. I hope that's not the case. The thing is to keep things in perspective. \nIt's a stupid t-shirt. \nNo one is organizing vigilante parties to hunt down journalists, tie us up and head for the nearest forest. \nYet.

      "text": "Shining light on Facebook’s AI strategy Posted Investors   \nIn a speech today at Web Summit, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer laid out a vision for the role artificial intelligence and machine learning will play in the company’s ambitions to improve global connectivity, technology accessibility, and human computer interaction. \n“People want to stay connected and close to other people, so whatever is the best current technology to deploy that is the business we want to be in,” said Schroepfer. \nLarge companies like Facebook play an incredibly important role in the artificial intelligence and machine learning ecosystem. Their sheer size and ability to corner the market on talent makes almost every strategic decision they make an industry-wide declaration. Connecting everything to everything \nDespite setbacks, like the explosion of Facebook’s satellite aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 earlier this summer, the company remains steadfast in its goals to better connect the world. It is pursuing a number of infrastructure projects, made possible by machine intelligence, aimed at augmenting both urban and suburban internet connectivity. \nProject Aquila, which has been well documented , is designed to bring connectivity to suburban areas. The carbon fibre, solar powered, planes fly in a constellation at altitudes higher than a commercial airliner. Planes remain in communication with each other via laser and communicate with the ground via radio frequency. Facebook is using trained neural networks to identify population centers across Africa that could be targeted by the planes. \nFor urban connectivity, Facebook is using LiDAR, the same technology behind many self-driving car projects, to map out utility polls. Identifying the location of these polls is critical to optimizing connectivity. Teams at the company are building virtual network graphs on top of the data to create the best data mesh. Using LiDAR data to enable urban connectivity in San Jose Art first, AI revolution later \nFor consumers, the easiest way to visually interact with Facebook’s ML work is through Style Transfer. Built on top of a new mobile deep-learning platform called Caffe2Go, the feature lets users capture artistically stylized video footage in real-time. Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, previously demoed the technology at WSJDLive — showing the audience how they can make their own content look like it was created by Van Gogh himself. \nWhen engineers first began to build Style Transfer, the best they could do with the computational resources of a smartphone was to stylize a small frame within a full-frame video. The version we got to see not only altered the entire frame in real time, but didn’t display any noticeable signs of lag. It’s set to be integrated into the FB app soon and is already being tested in a few countries. \nCaffe2Go won’t remain limited to Style Transfer — it holds the key to deploying convolutional neural nets across Facebook’s suite of mobile apps. \n“For anything we build on the server, we now have a vehicle to ship it to mobile devices,” noted Schroepfer. \nBringing machine intelligence to the smartphone is just step one. For the time being, the world still doesn’t have an answer for training neural networks on mobile devices. The prospect, coupled with Facebook’s long-term roadmap, makes a compelling argument for a future where the average person could design and train a custom neural net on their own smartphone for daily use. Betting big on virtual reality \nUsing today’s cutting edge technology, researchers still had to generate hundreds of artistic stylizations and painstakingly hone in attributes to deliver the best possible Style Transfer experience. With continued research, Facebook hopes to someday leverage our own facial expressions to give us another way to interact with its technology. \nNear term, this could manifest itself as a “surprise” filter being laid over a selfie taken with wide-eyes, but improvements in facial tracking could someday let use seamlessly share our emotional state with the technologies around us — perhaps most interestingly while in virtual reality. \nOf course, all of this becomes more interesting once corded VR is no more. The next set of VR problems will require leaps forward in computer vision. Facebook has already rolled out new stabilization technology for 360 videos , but there is more to be done. Related technologies like inside-out tracking and speech recognition will also improve the realism of VR experiences. \n“We have talked about doing things in the long term in augmented reality,” added Schroepfer. “We would absolutely build devices for it because I think that will be a way you will communicate with AIs in a real-time basis.” Don’t count sheep, label training sets Image captioning struggles to identify that the plane in the right image is crashing \nEven with a concrete vision about how investment in artificial intelligence can bolster Facebook’s products and services, it’s important to remember that our cutting edge AI research leaves a lot to be desired. \nMachine intelligence thrives on patterns, and unfortunately our world is full of an almost limitless number of outliers. Regardless of the barriers, Facebook has little choice in prioritizing AI as its competitors pour billions into beating the company to the next great breakthrough — though the mere fact that everyone is all in on the race is perhaps what makes it so interesting.

      "text": "Facebook suspends WhatsApp data use after UK privacy probe The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is putting the squeeze on the social media giant. Save Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images \nIt's fair to say that news of WhatsApp sharing user data with its parent company Facebook hasn't gone down well. Users have questioned why the social network needs to collect phone numbers, profile names and photos, online statuses and last seen timestamps, while European privacy watchdogs have expressed \"serious concerns\" over the app's new privacy policy. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is now eight weeks into its own probe, but that pressure has paid off: Facebook has agreed to pause data collection from UK WhatsApp users. \nIn a statement on the ICO's website, Elizabeth Denham, the UK's Information Commissioner, explained the reasons for the probe: \"I had concerns that consumers weren't being properly protected, and it's fair to say the enquiries my team have made haven't changed that view. I don't think users have been given enough information about what Facebook plans to do with their information, and I don't think WhatsApp has got valid consent from users to share the information. I also believe users should be given ongoing control over how their information is used, not just a 30 day window.\" \nWhile Facebook has stopped using WhatsApp data for \"advertisements or product improvement purposes\" for the time being, the ICO isn't stopping there. It's asked the company to sign an \"undertaking\" that lays out how it will collect and use data and give users \"ongoing control\" over what is shared. \"We think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook and WhatsApp haven't agreed, said Denham. \"If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, it may face enforcement action from my office.\" \nThe ICO is aware that as startups and digital companies harvest data, bigger corporations are snapping them up purely to merge datasets and reveal \"intrusive\" details about them. \"It's a problem that is broader than data protection, and we're speaking with industry, competition regulators and consumer groups to see how we can make people clearer on the law,\" the Commissioner concluded.",

      "title": "Uber competitor Karhoo shuts down after blowing through $250M",
      "text": "Uber competitor Karhoo shuts down after blowing through $250M Posted Shining light on Facebook’s AI strategy \nSo much for fighting the Uber fight. Today Karhoo — a company that wanted to take on Uber by pulling together various other competing car services under a single app — announced that it is shutting down its service and looking for “the next steps for its business” after running out of money and failing to raise more. The full statement is below. \nIt’s a pretty large crash and burn for the company. Karhoo, founded by Daniel Ishag, had never publicly disclosed how much it raised but a report in the FT last year noted that it was around $250 million with ambitions to raise $1 billion in total. Investors according to that FT article included David Kowitz, co-founder of Indus Capital Partners, the US hedge fund; Jonathan Feuer, managing partner at CVC Capital Partners, the European private equity group; and Nick Gatfield, former chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment, the record label. Eric Daniels, the former chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was a board director at the company. \nKarhoo’s business model was based around the company taking a small commission on rides booked through its platform, but that business is based on very large economies of scale to have any kind of reasonable margin. And building out any transport service before it can get to that scale is extremely capital intensive — as Uber has demonstrated. \nKarhoo’s was active only in London and starting trials in New York, with ambitions also to extend to Singapore. \nWe’d been hearing for about a week now that times were tight at the company, with employees skipping paychecks as times got lean. Then yesterday Sky posted a memo to employees that stated that it had to shut down its R&D operations temporarily in Israel after being unable to pay workers, but that it was close to securing an emergency round of funding from a backer that was willing to support the company to profitability. \nIt looks like that never came to pass, however. \nAs Uber, which has raised at least $60 billion, continues to grow globally, many smaller regional competitors have fallen by the wayside, consolidated or been snapped up by strategic backers. In Europe, have included Gett picking up strategic investment from VW; Hailo getting acquired and merged with MyTaxi. We’ve even heard that Lyft in the U.S. has considered acquisitions in recent times. \nMore to come. Full statement from Karhoo below. It is with much regret that we have to announce that Karhoo has had to close its service and is now looking at the next steps for the business. The Karhoo staff around the world in London, New York, Singapore and Tel Aviv have, over the past 18-months, worked tirelessly to make Karhoo a success. Many of them have worked unpaid for the last six weeks in an effort to get the business to a better place. Unfortunately, by the time the new management team took control last week, it was clear that the financial situation was pretty dire, and Karhoo was not able to find a backer. We would like to thank our staff, our partners, the fleets around the world that shared our vision, and the hundreds of thousands of people who downloaded the app and supported what we were trying to do. The world needs a Karhoo. Featured Image: xijian/Getty Images",

      "title": "UK watchdog gets Facebook to temporarily stop collecting data from WhatsApp",
      "text": "\nFacebook \"pauses\" WhatsApp data collection in the UK.\nWhatsApp announced back in August that it would start sharing data with Facebook to \"better fight spam on WhatsApp\" and offer \"better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads\" on Facebook. Although the service offered a 30-day window to let users opt out of sharing data with the social network, it mentioned that it would collect anonymous information to help Facebook tackle spam and abuse.\nAs expected, the announcement drew a lot of ire from customers as well as government regulators, including the UK's Information Commissioner's Office . After an eight-week probe into the company's privacy policy, the information commissioner has found that WhatsApp didn't get \"valid consent\" from its users when it comes to sharing data with Facebook. The watchdog's intervention has led to Facebook agreeing to \"pause\" data collection from WhatsApp users in the UK:\nI don't think users have been given enough information about what Facebook plans to do with their information, and I don't think WhatsApp has got valid consent from users to share the information. I also believe users should be given ongoing control over how their information is used, not just a 30 day window.\nWe've set out the law clearly to Facebook, and we're pleased that they've agreed to pause using data from UK WhatsApp users for advertisements or product improvement purposes.\nWe have now asked Facebook and WhatsApp to sign an undertaking committing to better explaining to customers how their data will be used, and to giving users ongoing control over that information. We also want individuals to have the opportunity to be given an unambiguous choice before Facebook start using that information and to be given the opportunity to change that decision at any point in the future.\nWe think consumers deserve a greater level of information and protection, but so far Facebook and WhatsApp haven't agreed. If Facebook starts using the data without valid consent, it may face enforcement action from my office.\nThe result could have a cascading effect in other regions as well, with 28 data protection authorities in the EU requesting WhatsApp to stop sharing data with Facebook. For its part, the social network is working with local regulators:\nWhatsApp designed its privacy policy and terms update to give users a clear and simple explanation of how the service works, as well as choice over how their data is used. These updates comply with applicable law, and follow the latest guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office.\nWe hope to continue our detailed conversations with the ICO and other data protection officials, and we remain open to working collaboratively to address their questions.\n",

(Photo: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren) \nEver since online travel agencies have existed, airlines have attempted to control their access to airfares, granting it, taking it away, then granting it again. But now these third-party websites are fighting back in unison, and they've attracted the attention of the U.S. Department of Transportation. \nYou may not realize it, but when you attempt to compare airfare on sites like Hopper, Expedia, TripAdvisor, Farecompare and many others, you often don't see every possible airline or airfare. You won't see Southwest's fares (Skyscanner does show them, but in my experience they are \"cached\" rather than real time, so they're not always accurate), or in many cases those sold by Allegiant Airlines. For a while, American didn't share fare data with Hopper (it does now), and AA also had access tussles with Orbitz over the years. \nBut a group calling itself the Travel Technology Association, which advocates for \"increased transparency and competition in air travel,\" has taken its case to the government and it looks like they'll get a hearing. The D.O.T. has issued a request for information concerning these practices. \n\"Concerns were raised about practices by some airlines to restrict the distribution and/or display of flight information by certain online travel agencies (OTAs), metasearch entities that operate flight search tools, and other stakeholders involved in the distribution of flight information and sale of air transportation.\" \nAirlines, not surprisingly, are fighting back. “Dictating to the airline industry distribution and commercial practices would only benefit those third parties who distribute tickets, not the flying public,” Airlines for America president Nicholas Calio said in a written statement. Just how transparent pricing wouldn't benefit consumers is a mystery to me. \nJust why do airlines restrict access to their schedules and prices? It's complicated, but commercial spats over how much third-party sites pay for referral traffic has played a part in the past. \nA larger question is what other industries restrict comparison shopping? Do electronics manufacturers restrict third-party sites, such as Google Shopping or Nextag, from displaying how much retailers are charging for their products? \nThe airlines’ restrictions place the burden on the consumer to figure out, for instance, that Southwest.com is listing $152 round-trip for an Atlanta-NYC nonstop on a wide variety of flights and dates, while Google Flights is showing a similar fare on Frontier on just one possible flight (and Frontier charges for even carry on bags, while Southwest doesn't charge for bags at all). \nAt the very least, third-party travel websites should make it very clear which airlines they lack data for. That would be a good first step toward transparency. And airlines should make it publicly known exactly why they choose not to list fares and schedules on some sites in favor of others. ",

      "text": "Facebook opens sponsored messages to all advertisers in newest version of Messenger Posted Google Maps urges users to vote with its new polling place finder \nAs Messenger continues its steady growth as a communications channel distinct from its social network parent Facebook, the company today is taking the wraps off a new version of the platform that will give developers some new tools for how they present content in it, but it also opens the door wider to a new phase of how Messenger is evolving: get ready for more Messenger traffic from advertisers. \nAs part of a new update to the platform, version 1.3, Facebook today said that it would making sponsored messages — where advertisers are able to send you messages on the platform — generally available to all advertisers. The move comes about six months after we reported that Facebook was starting to test the feature among a small group of brands and users. \nThe news — announced on stage today by VP of product for Messenger, David Marcus, at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon — comes with interesting timing: just earlier, Facebook paused its intention to share data between its platform and its other big messaging product, WhatsApp, at the request of the UK’s data protection watchdog, the ICO. \nThe data relationship between WhatsApp and Facebook is also being scrutinised at the European level, and has rubbed many users the wrong way, coming as it does after numerous assurances from Facebook, when it acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, that it would run it as a completely independent business . \nBut we digress! When we first wrote about sponsored messages in Messenger in April of this year, we noted the risk of them feeling spammy, especially in an environment where you usually only get messages from people you want to hear from (usually…). Sponsored messages could feel like they are breaking that experience by arriving to you unsolicited. \nFacebook is putting some “controls” in place to try to counteract that. For starters, for now, businesses cannot start sending you messages if you weren’t already in a thread with that business. And if you were in a thread but forgot about it and suddenly it’s been revived by an advertiser to your dismay, you can block that message, or the person or advertiser who sent it to you. I’ve asked Facebook how long that block can stay in place and will update this post with its reply. \nSo how would a business get into a conversation with you in the first place? That might be through a bot interaction, or a subscription for some updates that you might have made in the past. Or, through a response to a Facebook News Feed ad, by way of click to message ads . These were first announced in September during our Disrupt conference, and today Marcus said that they were also widely available. Some early users of these ads include Absolut Vodka, Tommy Hilfiger and Activision, Facebook said. \nClick to message News Feed ads tap into an interesting bit of linkage between Facebook and Messenger: now when an advertiser catches your attention through an ad in your News Feed, instead of taking you to a website, off Facebook’s network, you can essentially stay within Facebook’s walled garden and continue the conversation through Messenger, most likely using one of the bot-based interactions that power many business services on Messenger. \n\nThe other updates that Facebook is announcing today for version 1.3 of the platform include several updates for bots. Per Facebook: Reference Params for M.me Referral Links: Developers can now add reference params to their m.me vanity link, allowing them to determine where their bot traffic is coming from Deep Linking for M.me Referral Links: With the new reference param, developers can also deep link someone into a particular bot experience. For example, if someone clicks on the m.me link from a particular section within a website, a developer can now send a message that references that section. List Templates: Developers can now leverage new list templates, which showcase information in an easy-to-digest list. You can add a CTA or image to items in the list to customize the look and feel of the template. Pre-Checked Plugin: Developers can now add a checkbox plugin to easily allow customers to opt into a Messenger conversation with their business. Improvements to Search Results: We’re also releasing improvements to our bot search results, which will make it easier for people to find and discover bots. \nMore to come.",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nI am the BIGGEST crybaby. \nSeriously, I blubber at everything and anything (I blame it on the fact that I’m a Cancer ). And this year’s presidential election has been no exception. \nIt all started this July when I was watching the coverage of the Democratic National Convention. I found myself weeping insistently. \nFrom Bernie Sanders’ brother and his heartfelt speech to Michelle Obama’s inspiring and powerful words , I turned on the waterworks and haven’t been able to shut them off since. \nI’ve always been passionate about politics (if you don’t believe me, feel free to check out the massive amount of student loans I had to take out to pay for my political science degree ayoooo), but lately, my tears have been about so much more than just political phenomena. \nThis election is one of the most important in our nation’s history. I know, I know. People say that during every election cycle. \nThe thing is, this time, it’s true . With important issues at stake such as the Supreme Court and the environment , America needs voter turnout now more than ever. \nSo, given my blubbering history and the stakes in this election, I give to you the four reasons I’m going to wear waterproof mascara on November 8: I’ll cry because I’m proud. \nI’m crying because after 239 years of being around, the United States has finally made history: Hillary Clinton was the first woman in history to become a presidential nominee. \nThis is a big deal. \nWomen make up over 50 percent of the population, yet they only hold about 19.4 percent of the seats in the United States Congress. \nLike one of Clinton’s ad campaigns states: Our kids are watching. When young girls see a strong, intelligent woman such Hillary Clinton addressing the nation as a presidential nominee, they realize their dreams may not be as unattainable as they once thought. \nUpon cinching the nomination, Secretary Clinton spoke these powerful words : \nTonight’s victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible. In our country, it started right here in New York, a place called Seneca Falls in 1848 where a small but determined group of women and men came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights and they set it forth in something called the declaration of sent and it was first time in human history that that kind of declaration occurred. \nIf Hillary makes another speech as powerful as this one, you can bet I’m going to need a box of tissues. I’ll cry because I’m going to miss the Obama Administration. \nI LOVE THE OBAMA FAMILY. \nI was proud to cast my vote for Barack Obama in 2012, and I’m proud of his legacy to this day. \nI’m going to miss the way President Obama seems to handle every situation with grace. I’m going to miss his quick wit . I’m going to miss his perfect wife, Michelle , and his badass daughters, Malia and Sasha. I’m going to miss his dad dancin’ . \nHe, like Hillary, has made me proud to be an American. \nSaying goodbye to the Obama Administration is just one more reason I’ll be a teary mess on Tuesday. \nOn the bright side, in less than 20 years, Malia will be old enough to run for office. Fingers crossed. (Michelle could also run for office… let’s not talk about the tears I’ll cry if THAT happens.) The Stupid Reasons We Vote On Tuesdays To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video I’ll cry because I’m scared. \nLet’s just talk about the elephant (political pun!) in the room: Donald Trump. \nI am absolutely terrified at the prospect of Trump becoming our political leader, and I’m certainly not alone in that fear. \nHe has proven time and time again that he is unfit for the job (don’t even get me started on his VP choice, Mike Pence, who is also the certified WORST™ ). \nI’m scared because for the last year (and lifetime), Trump has been breaking the law , spewing hateful rhetoric, inciting violence and stomping his big, dumb feet all over MY rights . \nI’m scared that if people don’t vote, he could win . Please, please, America, don’t let him win. I’ll cry tears of relief. \nAfter a very long, tumultuous journey, this election will finally be over. Well, kind of . \nAfter November 8, our country, for better or for worse, will never be the same. \nDon’t be idle this election season. Tomorrow, find your polling place , pack your tissues and vote. Your vote matters. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.",

      "title": "Catholic priest puts aborted fetus on altar, posts live video on Facebook to get out the vote for Donald Trump",
      "text": "On Sunday, ahead of the presidential election, the Rev. Frank Pavone took an aborted fetus, laid it upon an altar and posted a live video on Facebook. Pavone, a Catholic priest who heads New York-based Priests for Life, said the fetus was entrusted to him by a pathologist for burial.\nDuring an already heated and divisive campaign season, Pavone’s video has raised questions for some about what is appropriate anti-abortion and political activism in the church. As of Tuesday morning, the video, which is 44 minutes long, had 330,000 views. In it, he holds up a poster of graphics of abortion procedures.\nIn Pavone’s Facebook appeal, he says, “We have to decide if we will allow this child killing to continue in America or not. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic platform says yes, let the child-killing continue (and you pay for it); Donald Trump and the Republican platform says no, the child should be protected.”\nJae C. Hong/AP A pastor prays for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as his wife, Melania, watches In this Jan. 31, 2016, file photo from Council Bluffs, Iowa. A call placed to the spokesman for the Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which is Pavone’s diocese, was not immediately returned Monday. The receptionist, however, said her phone had been ringing off the hook.\nIn a blog post for Patheos, Scott Eric Alt argued that what Pavone did was sacrilege, a violation of Catholic Church canon law, which states that the altar is “reserved for divine worship alone, to the exclusion of any secular usage.”\nIt is the antithesis of respect to use a dead child as a political prop to lobby for your presidential candidate\n“Being pro-life is about respecting the dignity of the human person,” Alt wrote. “It is the antithesis of respect for the dignity of the human person to use a dead child as a political prop to lobby for your presidential candidate the day before an election.”\nPavone is a high-profile anti-abortion activist who has clashed with leadership within the Catholic Church. In 2014, Cardinal Timothy Dolan cut ties with the priest after Dolan suggested that Pavone had stonewalled financial reform within his organization, which is based out of Staten Island. A spokesperson for Dolan, who is also chairman of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Pro-Life Activities, said the archdiocese does not have a relationship with Pavone and has no comment on the video.\nRelated Trumpty Dumpty: For Trump, language (like everything else) is competition instead of communication Matthew Fisher: At a southern rally, Donald Trump supporters predict a ‘landslide’ — ‘God wants this’ ‘Partial-birth abortions aren’t a thing!’ Samantha Bee blasts Chris Wallace and Donald Trump In a blog post for the Archdiocese of New York, Ed Mechmann wrote about the “revulsion” he felt about the video.\n“A human being has been sacrificed and the altar of God has been desecrated, all for politics,” he wrote. “Everyone who respects the dignity of every human person should reject and disavow this atrocity.”\nTrump has been a divisive candidate for anti-abortion activists, who have tried to keep women at the forefront. Earlier this year, the GOP candidate suggested that women who have abortions should be punished, a position he later reversed.\nMary Altaffer/AP New Yorkers rally to condemn Donald Trump's remarks about women and abortion on March 31, 2016. If anything, Pavone’s actions are a signal that the older anti-abortion groups are on their way out, said Charles Camosy, a bioethics professor at Fordham University and a board member of Democrats for Life of America. The use of graphic images has been a divisive issue in the anti-abortion movement, and Camosy said Monday that nearly everyone he knows, including conservatives, have condemned Pavone’s video.\n“This plays into the narrative so many people have of us, that this is a bunch of wild extremists who will put an aborted fetus on Facebook Live. Come on!” Camosy said. “This is the death rattle for the culture-war-focused pro-life movement.”\nThe video comes after a group of Catholics inserted fliers into parish bulletins in San Diego claiming that a vote for a Democrat is a mortal sin. San Diego’s Bishop Robert McElroy criticized the flier.\nAnd on Saturday, Pope Francis condemned the political use of fear and the building of walls, describing the refugee crisis as “a problem of the world” and urging political leaders to do more.\n",

      "text": "Hillary Clinton campaigning in Nevada. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nIt's no secret that Democratic presidential nomineeÂ Hillary Clinton loves pantsuits.\nThey've been her outfit of choice for decades, and while at times in the past the press has mocked her for her apparent lack of style, the pantsuit has eventually grown toÂ become a meme Â beloved by her own supporters.\nThousands of Americans have joined in support of the pantsuit and Clinton by wearing one of their own pansuits on Election Day.\nThe push to don pantsuits â which can be worn by both men and women â started with a private Facebook group created by Maine resident Libby Chamberlain after the presidential debates.\nDubbed \"Pantsuit Nation,\" it began as a place for friends and fellow Clinton supporters to share their stories. But in the weeks since the debates, the page has swelled in popularity, reaching nearly two million members and growing into a fundraising platform for the Democratic candidate. It has spawned a public Facebook page (though it has much fewer members than the private one), plus a Twitter and Instagram profile.\n\"We talked about how beautifully and stoically Hillary embodies women's fight for equality, and how the pantsuit is an emblem of that struggle,\" Chamberlain recently told CNN. \"It's a symbol that might be lost on younger women, and so I wanted to do something to re-appropriate that symbol and everything that it means to me as a feminist and Clinton supporter.\"\nMany of those supporters are sharing their getup with the hashtag #pantsuitnation on Twitter. Many are also wearing white in a nod to the 20th-century suffragette movement.\nmy moms and I are #withher #WearWhiteToVote #pantsuitnation #VirWINia @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/vh0RrYBgfq\nâ e m i l yđŚđ (@emmybreese) November 8, 2016 Â\nOh hello #pantsuitnation đşđ¸ pic.twitter.com/5HoZ5BuNPp\nâ Aminatou Sow (@aminatou) November 8, 2016\nReady in OH #pantsuitup #OHDEMS #pantsuitnation #OHHillYes #Hillary #GOTVforHRC pic.twitter.com/KXHYgnAcpO\nâ Wendy Henoch (@Persnykity) November 8, 2016\nHey @IvankaTrump ! thx 4 the epically blue last min @tjmaxx bargain! đ I just put it to good use! #PantsuitNation #ImWithHer @pantsuitnation pic.twitter.com/qwNVKvSPzJ\nâ Nina Chase (@ninakennychase) November 8, 2016 Â\nWorked hard for my office, want her to get her's.

      "text": "49 Just looking for a photo that screams \"fake!\" \nElection Day. Facebook. This is not a good combination when it comes to supporting that little slice of the multiverse we know as “ reality .” \nPoliticians have always played fast and loose with the truth, cable news networks have always gotten stories wrong, and the internet has always been a place for conspiracy theories and misleading stories and photos. \nBut the 2016 campaign has seen an unprecedented increase in the sheer number of false news stories being shared on Facebook or posted to genuine-looking but entirely fake news sites run by tech-savvy young people looking to make some money off this long and bitter election. \nWhen a story runs on Daily Kos , you might notice that it tends to have this little thing called sources . Sources that almost certainly do not feature stories on the latest machinations of the lizard men. Links that actually go somewhere. But the Facebook page of your Uncle Rico or zany Cousin Flo? Those stories … are not so real. Neither are their sources. \nTake the Denver Guardian, which earlier this month ran a story with the attention-grabbing headline “FBI AGENT SUSPECTED IN HILLARY EMAIL LEAKS FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE.” The article ricocheted across Facebook and gained tens of thousands of shares despite the fact that there is no such thing as the “Denver Guardian” and that the “story” in question is a complete fabrication. \nAll of this would be easier if fake news didn’t have an alternate spelling. Fox News is out there today pushing stories of voter fraud. \nAustyn Crites, a Republican protester who was assaulted at a Trump rally in Nevada, was stunned to see a TV report associating him with fraudulent voting connected to a grandmother Fox News claimed died in 2002. \nShe was alive and well, although somewhat baffled that she was having to prove her identity to correct a TV broadcast that reported that she died 14 years ago. \nIn the last cycle it was pushing a theme of voter intimidation. \nIn November 2012, Fox News aired a video clip showing a member of the Black Panthers standing outside a polling station in Philadelphia. It was a single person at a single polling station in a heavily black, heavily Democratic area, but Fox anchors strongly suggested that it was part of a broader pattern of voter intimidation by militants determined to stop then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney. The segment was rebroadcast frequently throughout the day. \nYou can bet that the not-dead status of Crites’ grandmother won’t stop that story from appearing on Fox for hours, or days, to come. Because Fox and facts simply don’t mix. \nNon-factiness has proven so profitable for Fox that it has generated a whole legion of sites that go all-in on the fake—sites which provide fodder that launched a billion Facebook shares. \n… a website called ConservativeState posted an article with the headline “Hillary Clinton In 2013: ‘I Would Like to See People Like Donald Trump Run for Office; They’re Honest and Can’t Be Bought.’” \nThe story was a complete fabrication, but it immediately went viral, racking up more than 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook in less than a week. \nThat completely fake story drew many times as many views and shares as did legitimate stories about the election. With the alt-right already claiming that the media can’t be trusted, it’s easy for them to treat an invented story on a freshly minted site as having more credibility than a well-researched piece in the Washington Post. It’s not just frustrating, it’s genuinely dangerous . \nIn the last couple of weeks, Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets have exposed millions of Americans to false stories asserting that: the Clinton campaign’s pollster, Joel Benenson, wrote a secret memo detailing plans to “salvage” Hillary Clinton’s candidacy by launching a radiological attack to halt voting (merrily shared on Twitter by Roger Stone, an informal adviser to the Trump campaign); the Clinton campaign senior strategist John Podesta practiced an occult ritual involving various bodily fluids; Mrs. Clinton is paying public pollsters to skew results (shared on Twitter by Donald Trump Jr.); there is a trail of supposedly suspicious deaths of myriad Clinton foes (which The Times’s Frank Bruni heard repeated in a hotel lobby in Ohio). \nWe may be—and often are—dissatisfied with the print media. With rare exceptions (God bless you, Mr. Fahrenthold) reporting in this election cycle has mainly consisted of reaction, of printing statements and speeches as quickly as they flew, and of failing to do the more serious work required to get beyond superficial analysis. The press has also proven to be, as always, easily led toward the most colorful, ridiculous story of the moment while allowing serious issues to die in the wings. \nThe American press is badly, badly flawed and in need of serious improvement. Unfortunately, what it’s getting is the other thing. \nThat contraction in the reporting corps, combined with the success of disinformation this year, is making for some sleepless nights for those in Washington who will have to govern in this bifurcated, real-news-fake-news environment. \n“It’s the biggest crisis facing our democracy, the failing business model of real journalism,” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri and a longtime critic of fake news, told me on Saturday. \nNewspapers aren’t growing. Even in this circus season, heavy staff cuts are an almost universal experience. \nIt does not augur well for the future. Martin Baron, the Washington Post executive editor, said when we spoke last week, “If you have a society where people can’t agree on basic facts, how do you have a functioning democracy?” \nWe’re at that point already. But what happens when there aren’t any basic facts to find, just oceans of fabrication? What’s to stop another Trump from riding into office on a tidal wave of purpose-built propaganda?",

      "text": "Facebook speeds up its data center network with the launch of its Backpack switch platform Posted Deliveroo riders in North London push to unionize \nFacebook is on a mission to make the fiber optic networking inside of its data centers go from 40G to 100G. Its Wedge 100 top-of-rack network switch (basically, the device that connects all the servers in a rack to the wider data center network) was already accepted into the Open Compute Project and today, the company lifted the veil of Backpack, its next-gen 100G switch platform for connecting all the racks inside of the data center together. \nAs Omar Baldonado, Facebook’s Director of Software Engineering for Networking, told me, the company is looking at this faster networking technology for a number of reasons, but it’s mostly driven by the need to be able to support more live and recorded video, as well as 360 photos and video. Facebook’s own internal data center traffic also continues to increase as developers look at new ways to gather analytics and use that data to improve the user experience. \n100G, however, is still very much at the leading edge of high-speed networking. Facebook is obviously not the only company working on this. LinkedIn, for example, has also recently talked about how it plans to take its data center in Oregon to 100G in the future. Unlike others, though, Facebook is committed to opening up the designs of its servers and networking technology — and the software that power them — for the rest of the industry. iso_front_1",

      "text": "Artificial Intelligence Facebook's new filters are like Prisma for video The filters represent a big step forward for mobile AI and will be available in the US soon share Facebook Ever thought your selfies were as good as a Rembrandt? Or your party pics as apocalyptic as something by Hieronymus Bosch? Well, Facebook hears you, and it’s got something to help. This morning, the company announced that a number of AI-powered art filters would soon be arriving on its mobile app, allowing users to overlay photos, videos, and even live broadcasts with various artistic styles. This type of AI feature is known as \" style transfer \" and has been around for a while now. Russian app Prisma popularized it earlier this year, and in October, Facebook showed off a prototype version working with live video. According to a report from Wired , the feature is now available in Facebook's main app in Ireland and is \"due soon\" in the US. You can see what sort of effects it produces below: \nBut as interesting as this is, purely as something fun to play with (and an example of Facebook putting more emphasis on the camera in its primary app), it's the technology that underpins it that's really significant. \nLike many of the most interesting consumer AI applications out today, Facebook's art filters are built using deep neural networks . These are a type of computer program that's meant to mimic the actions of neurons in the brain, and that are trained using large amounts of data to recognize common patterns. Deep neural nets are used for everything from voice recognition in digital assistants to categorizing your holiday snaps in Google's Photos app. \nThe miniaturization of AI is a big step forward \nRunning these programs can be tricky, though, as they take up a lot of processing power. Often, programs that use this sort of AI need a connection to the internet to work. They send off your request to a server farm somewhere which does the actual computation, and then sends the results right back to you. With its new art filters, though, Facebook has managed to make these neural nets work locally on your phone. \nTo achieve this, Facebook has created an entire new deep learning architecture called Caffe2go. You can read about this technology in more technical detail in a Facebook blog post , but suffice to say, it's impressive work. The seminal paper on style transfer was published in 2015 , and the resulting software worked only on images and had to run on a massive data center that still took seconds to deliver results. By comparison, Facebook's implementation processes 20 frames per second using just your smartphone's hardware. \nThis miniaturization of AI and Facebook's new Caffe2go infrastructure (which is available to developers) is going to enable lots of new features, says Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer. \"We can create gesture-based controls, where the computer can see where you're pointing and activate different styles or commands,\" writes Schroepfer. \"We can recognize facial expressions and perform related actions, like putting a 'yay' filter over your selfie when you smile.\" \nThese examples probably don't sound like the grand future of AI you might have imagined, but they're just the beginning. Facebook already uses its AI to describe the content of images to visually impaired users , but imagine the same process happening offline with real-time video. In true 21st century style, better selfies are just the beginning. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Facebook \nOn Tuesday, November 8, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for the first time announced that it was recruiting for 2016. \nThe commission in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren said the ongoing exercise is in line with due process and in conformity with federal character principle. \nUwujaren also said such clarification became necessary due to call and complaints from applicants who were disqualified from the recruitment exercise. \nThe commission also debunked claims that such applicants were disqualified out of nepotism or god-fatherism. \nUwujaren said: “This is far from the truth as criteria were set albinitio as qualification for enlistment into the EFCC.” \nHe added that candidate must, “be informed that due to the rigorous nature of the Cadet Training program, all candidates must be physically, medically and mentally fit in conformity with regimental standards.” \nHe also listed criteria for the selection of candidates for employment into the commission. \nBelow are 11 criteria an applicant must meet up to: \n1. The candidate must not be more than 27 years old \n2. The candidate must be single \n3. Height (Minimum Male: 1.67 m; Female: 1.64 m) \n4. The candidate must have Body Mass Index (BMI) OF NOT MORE THAN 30. (Not obese) \n5. Chest Measurement (Not less than 34 inches for males) \n6. Must have a good hearing, good eye-sight and sound mind (This is for the purpose of weapon handling and other law enforcement gadgets) \n7. No recent medical surgery, no respiratory ailments or life threatening illnesses that can cause harm to the cadet and others during training \n8. No tattoos of any form \n9. Must not have any criminal record \n10. No membership of any cult or terrorist group \nREAD ALSO: FACT CHECK: Jonathan lied! 6 examples of abuse and nepotism under his rule \n11. Must not be a user or dependent on any illicit substance or recreational drugs (Strict penalties will be applied to any candidate/cadet who is caught during Medical Screening/Random Testing) \nUwujaren also said: “It is also pertinent to state that over 200, 000 applications were received; as against the advertised 750 (seven hundred and fifty) vacancies. The 750 Cadets are meticulously being screened.” \n“The exercise which is still on-going for the Detective Inspectors (DI) and Detective Superintendents (DS) Cadres (the Detective Assistants, DI, Cadre has been concluded), is conducted transparently and every state is given equal representation. \n“We also reiterate that there was no inappropriate conduct by any official during the exercise as being alleged. The physical fitness and medical tests were conducted by officers from the Nigerian Air Force Hospital who are well trained and adhere to the relevant code of medical practice. \n“The media must therefore be wary not to become instruments of blackmail by applicants who failed the fitness test,” he said.",

We share prayer together that this persecution will come to pass and it will surely come to pass. \n“I am here to visit and identify my friend, Chief Fani-Kayode. I came into Abuja yesterday and I am being my brother’s keeper, and I felt that within the 24 hours that I will spend in Abuja I have to visit him. \n“I met him in an office. They brought him in an office to see me. He is in good spirit. But when you state, there are two different issues. If you say state of mind, he is in good spirit. But I don’t have access to where he sleeps and the condition in which he is kept but speaking with, he is in good spirit. \n“It is obvious that the commission has made up their mind on charge him on the November 10. And it shows that they have made up their mind even before I visited him. He has been granted bail before and I would have expected them to allow him to go and come back since he didn’t run away. So I just believe that this over zealousness will cease and get better.” \nREAD ALSO : EFCC grills APC chief for bribing judge, seizes his passport \nWhen asked about the stream of high-profile visitors to, Fayose said it was not uncommon for a person in detention to receive visitors. \nHe said: “These people are only accused. An accused person are at liberty to be visited even people convicted are to be visited. They are human beings it is there right to be visited. \n“Are you saying that people should be locked away without access to family and friends? That would be abuse to human rights. There is a difference between being accused and found guilty. After from that even if you are found guilty people still have a right to visit you.”",

      "text": "Shutterstock An Atlanta-area mayor who used Facebook to encouraged Democrats to vote on the incorrect day has deleted Facebook post — and his entire public page — after being criticized. But he insists he was just being funny. “Remember the voting days: Republicans vote on Tuesday, 11/8 and Democrats vote on Wednesday, 11/9,” Mayor Jefferson Riley of Mansfield, Georgia, wrote in the status update, which is now only available via screengrabs. Wow. Just got this screengrab from a friend. Jefferson Riley, the Republican mayor of Mansfield, Georgia trying to fool Democratic voters. pic.twitter.com/g2JpxdxBUX — Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) November 8, 2016 In response to social media criticism, he begrudgingly deleted the post, complaining about the humorlessness of his followers. “People take things so seriously,” he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . “You can’t joke about anything anymore — especially on social media.” “Anything” is probably a bit of a stretch. But he’s right that misinformation about voting, especially by an elected official, is generally considered serious. Part of that is because this kind of activity — spreading misinformation about how or when to cast a ballot, targeted to particular demographic groups or parties — is a very real technique that’s been used in attempts to shape the outcome of elections. On its surface, it has a lot in common with recent efforts by Donald Trump supporters to suppress support for Hillary Clinton in advance of Election Day. As German Lopez reported , an account infamous for its racist, sexist, and homophobic tweets recently posted a series of advertisements with misinformation about voting by text. Twitter just informed me that attempting to disenfranchise voters is not a violation of their Terms of Service. @jack @Support pic.twitter.com/YXVdt8sHwA — Robert McNees (@mcnees) November 2, 2016 Two of the three ads in the examples seemed to be designed to appeal minority voters, with one of the ads written entirely in Spanish and all of them specifically targeting Clinton supporters. “This isn’t the only way Trump supporters are apparently aiming to stop Clinton voters from reaching the polls. Previously, Trump supporters told the Boston Globe that they plan to intimidate nonwhite voters on Election Day,” Lopez wrote. Hopefully even Riley can now see that anything that has the effect of infringing on voters’ rights — regardless of how it’s intended — is unfunny.  ",

His Game 6 performance in the 2004 ALCS remains one of the most breathtaking athletic feats I've ever seen, and to this day I defend it. \nIt wasn't ketchup. His ankle was hurt. He fought through the pain, unimaginable, excruciating pain, and got the Boston Red Sox a win, in a game that I can remember to this day. I know where I watched the game, who I was sitting next to. I remember the feeling of watching him pitch, the pride, the joy. The disbelief. For a kid from New England, that game was a highlight in what was - maybe to this day - the best three weeks of my life. Schilling was my hero, and I will never, ever forget what he did for me. \nOn Monday night, Curt Schilling sent out a tweet that featured a shirt calling for the hanging of journalists. He sent it out with the caption \"OK, so much awesome here.\" He's since deleted it, but here you go:",

      "text": "Pantsuit Nation, a private Facebook group with more than 2 million members, showed its sartorial support for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by wearing pantsuits to the polls. The “safe haven” for the former secretary of state’s supporters serves as a positive space for women — and men! — to express their feelings. The group even caught HRC’s attention, and she delivered a message via Jenna Lowenstein, who runs digital for Hillary for America. “This election hasn’t been easy: It’s been long, hard-fought, and at times it made us question who we are as Americans. For some of you, it’s been difficult to feel like you could wear your support on your sleeve — and that’s why this community has been such a special place,” Clinton shared. “Your stories and photos of family members and friends are wonderful to see, but what truly warms my heart is the thousands of comments of support and love you all send to each other. I’m honored and humbled to have all of you with me, but I’m even prouder to see this community represent the best of America: people of all backgrounds and beliefs who share a vision for a brighter future for our children, and who have each other’s backs.” Clinton added that she hopes to “finally break through that highest, hardest glass ceiling together, and use those pantsuits for the best occasion of all — celebrating!”\nFollow us on Instagram , Facebook , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.",

      "text": "Photo via Lorie Shaull (CC-BY-SA) The Facebook group has nearly 3 million members. \nPantsuit Nation , the private Facebook group for Hillary Clinton supporters, has nearly 3 million members as of election night. That’s enough for Clinton to have taken notice, and today she had a message specifically for the group. \nClinton’s message was posted to the page by Jenna Lowenstein, the digital director of Hillary for America, who said that she told Clinton about the group. Clinton writes: Dear Pantsuit Nation (have you ever heard a better name?!),On this historic day, I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your support from the bottom of my heart.This election hasn't been easy: It's been long, hard-fought, and at times it made us question who we are as Americans. For some of you, it's been difficult to feel like you could wear your support on your sleeve -- and that's why this community has been such a special place. Your stories and photos of family members and friends are wonderful to see, but what truly warms my heart is the thousands of comments of support and love you all send to each other. I'm honored and humbled to have all of you with me, but I'm even prouder to see this community represent the best of America: people of all backgrounds and beliefs who share a vision for a brighter future for our children, and who have each other's backs. That's who we really are, and tonight, we're going to prove it.Thank you all so much for your support, your hard work, and your votes. Tonight, I hope we'll finally break through that highest, hardest glass ceiling together, and use those pantsuits for the best occasion of all -- celebrating!-H Screengrab via Facebook The post has over 13,000 comments, with many members saying they’ve been moved to tears. Lowenstein said she also told Clinton about the people paying tribute to Susan B. Anthony at her grave. Pantsuit Nation encouraged its members to vote while wearing pantsuits today.

Eric Holcomb will face great challenges and big opportunities. Let’s hope this begins a new era for Indiana. Buy Photo Eric Holcomb, the Republican candidate for governor, at the Statehouse, October 15, 2016. (Photo: Jenna Watson/IndyStar) Buy Photo \nThis might be hard to believe. But if you live in Indiana, if you root for and worry about Indiana, or if you just love Indiana, the most important election on Tuesday was the somewhat overshadowed race for governor. It was the one, after all, that will likely have the most impact on your life. \nAmid the Donald Trump mania and Hillary Clinton madness that dominated our conversations and our thoughts, we Hoosiers elected a new governor. In about two months Eric Holcomb will take over a state that has been through a lot in recent years, both good and bad. He will offer a new voice, a new perspective and a new leadership style after far too much division. \nMost important, he will take control of the governor’s office at a time of challenges and opportunities as vast as the tens of thousands of square miles between the Ohio River and Lake Michigan. He can be one of the greats, one of the bold-thinking leaders who have truly left a mark, or he can be a caretaker. Let’s hope he goes boldly and not gently into these next four years. \nCongratulations, Governor-elect Holcomb. \nYou now have the chance to move Indiana forward on a number of critical issues and to make very loud and very clear that we simply don’t have time for the type of silly distractions and petty debates that have marred too much of the past four years. As a Hoosier who loves this state, as a Hoosier who has long said that you would be a solid governor, all I can now do is ask and hope that you wake up every morning not with politics or partisanship on your mind but rather an urgent desire for positive and lasting change in this state. \nThis great state. \nWe’re counting on our new governor in so many ways. We are counting on him to guide Indiana through complex times and complicated issues. But it seems there’s a simplicity here — one based on the notion that every state agency and every administration agenda item should have at its core the goal of making life better for Indiana’s children, workers, families, retirees and those who are struggling. \nIt sounds so simple but far too often such goals have been pushed aside to help special interest friends, partisan allies, powerful lobbies and those with an agenda that might please certain factions but does little to help Indiana. \n“Don’t do anything foolish.” That’s the advice a man named Bob Feeser offered the next governor when I stopped by a polling site Tuesday afternoon in Nora. He offered that thought with a smile but in all seriousness. \nWhat’s foolish? Well, it is anything that doesn’t help improve Hoosier jobs, wages, schools, safety, infrastructure or quality of life. If it doesn’t help with those things, there’s a decent chance that it’s foolish. If it’s driven by ideological allies, backward-looking culture warriors, or overly partisan state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, it’s probably foolish. And it’s probably an unnecessary distraction. \nIn Broad Ripple later Tuesday afternoon, I met a friendly voter named Paul St. Angelo. The 63-year-old’s advice for the next governor was just as wise as Feeser’s. \n“We don’t compromise enough and he has to do better at that,” St. Angelo told me. “That’s the basis of democracy. Whenever there isn’t compromise going on, you get big problems and nothing gets done.” \nOr foolish things get done. \nLike Hoosiers from Evansville to Gary, I had my preferred candidate in Tuesday’s election. But after years of covering both Holcomb and Democrat John Gregg , and after many hours of conversations with both, I walked into the voting booth confident that either would do a good job leading our great state. Both spent this election cycle talking about the right issues and promising to focus on the serious policy matters —jobs and education, as well as infrastructure and mental health and addiction — that matter more than any others in the daily lives of Hoosiers. \nLet’s hope Holcomb, a man who will face countless requests from allies and encounter a neverending stream of political fires in the coming years, stays focused on the right things. \nLet’s hope he pushes policies — from making Indiana more attractive to good jobs to addressing a harmful skills gap — aimed at helping Indiana residents achieve higher wages. Let’s hope he works to make Indiana as attractive as possible to life-sciences and high-tech employers, while also looking out for those workers who are too often left behind. That’s a hard goal that will take years to achieve; it will require an obsessive and committed focus from the top of state government. \nLet’s hope he works diligently to bring the various factions in Indiana’s education debate closer together. There are good ideas and good people on all sides of these debates. The new governor must insist on a better working relationship between them. \nLet’s hope social issues are tackled only when they help Indiana. Yes, we need expanded and fair protections against discrimination, not only because that is right and just but also because that will help Indiana attract and retain employers and workers. What we don’t need are destructive culture wars driven by a small but powerful group of insiders. Enough is enough. \nLet’s hope the new governor does everything he can to attract a top-notch staff. A state government cannot overcome poor management and while a newly elected governor owes electoral success to a lot of insider friends, that cannot be what determines the next generation of state leadership. The caliber of the people selected to run the administration and state agencies will determine both the new governor’s success and the state’s direction. \nPerhaps most of all, let’s hope Holcomb, soon to be the state’s 51st governor, works hard to bring Indiana together. That means more work to improve regional cooperation and intense attention not only to Central Indiana but also to far-flung parts of the state that sometimes feel neglected, from rural towns to bustling counties that are geographically tied to other states. Too often, Indiana seems to be fighting against different parts of itself, forgetting that what’s good for one part of the state helps all it. A governor can help bridge our divides. \nSo, once again, congratulations Eric Holcomb. You ran a good campaign and you won. And now a state of 6.6 million people is counting on you. I wish you success. Now, please, don’t do anything foolish! \nThank you for reading. You can reach me at Twitter.com/matthewltully.

      "title": "Students flee as professor strips NAKED during anatomy lecture (photos, video)",
      "text": "Facebook \n– An anatomy professor removed all his clothes during the lecture \n– Shocked female students took to their heels as soon as the man stood stark naked behind a tribune \n– Video of the incident was later posted to the internet, the professor is likely to be fired \nPlease, scroll down for photos and video below! \nStudents in Makhachkala, Russia, got the shock of their lives after an anatomy professor stripped naked in the middle of the lecture. \nKamil Magomedov, who has been working at the state medical academy for 10 years, was giving a lecture on microscopic anatomy, when he suddenly took all his clothes off. \nREAD ALSO: Do you see a naked woman on this picture? Look closely and you’ll be surprised! \nThe incident was filmed by one of the students, who is heard saying: “I told you he is crazy. He definitely will be fired after this. Girls, do not look at him!” \nMeanwhile, the 34-year-old professor is simply walking around the lecture hall and female students are seen running out of the class in horror. Video of the incident was later leaked to the internet \nOne eyewitness told Russian media: “We could not understand what was happening. He started to take his clothes off all of a sudden without any warning, and then he was totally naked. \nHe didn’t even have his underwear on. To be honest people didn’t know what to do, the girls were running out scared and only then did he put his pants back on.” \nIt remains unclear what made the professor strip off but they say the man suffers from *schizophrenia and when he came to himself he started crying. \nThe professor would be fired over the incident, according to locals education officials. \nWatch video: \n*Schizophrenia is a long-term mental disorder of a type involving a breakdown in the relation between thought, emotion, and behavior, leading to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of mental fragmentation.",

      "text": "Above: Viber: Violet’s Kitchen Page\nViber has announced a new suite of tools designed to connect businesses and marketers with the mobile messaging app’s 800 million users.\nWith Public Accounts, Viber is pushing to become a platform through which companies can both broadcast messages en masse and communicate one-to-one with customers. It’s being touted for use across customer service, marketing, and sales.\nIt’s perhaps fair to say that Viber is borrowing at least one page from Facebook, which has been turbo-charging its Messenger platform credentials over the past year or so , and is well on its way to becoming a central tool for connecting brands with customers.\nIndeed, Public Accounts seem a lot like Facebook Pages, with users able to follow and receive updates. Viber’s API also allows companies to connect with their existing customer relationship management (CRM) system, while they can also manually connect individually with customers through live chats with humans or with chatbots.\n“We are, of course, aware of what’s going on in our field, but we take pride in crafting the best possible solution based on what we believe is the most suitable experience for people using Viber,” explained Viber COO Michael Shmilov, who officially launched the new service at Web Summit today\nViber for Business This isn’t the first time Viber has courted businesses. Through Viber for Business , companies could already access a Public Chats feature, which was designed as a way to let brands broadcast messages and create a public presence on Viber. But with Public Accounts, Viber is going several steps further by giving businesses more ways to communicate directly with their customers.\nAbove: Violet’s Kitchen: 1-2-1 chat\n“On Viber, people already connect securely and freely with their families, friends and colleagues,” added Shmilov. “Today, we are introducing a way for people to start connecting with businesses, too. The first set of tools will enable businesses to reach their audience on Viber using messaging and rich interfaces, which can be tailored to the various needs of any business.”\nFounded out of Israel in 2010, Viber today claims more than 800 million users on Android, Windows Phone, iOS, and desktop. Like Facebook and other messaging apps, Viber enables group or individual chats, and also offers voice and video calling functionality. The company was acquired by Japanese ecommerce giant Rakuten for $900 million in 2014.\nPublic Accounts are available around the world from today, launching in partnership with a number of brands including The Weather Channel, Yandex, and The Huffington Post.\nThough any business is able to create a Public Account, at first companies will have to apply to Viber, with approval promised “shortly after” if nothing untoward is detected. “Later, we will enable creation from within the app, ” Shmilov told VentureBeat. “We just want to test and optimize moderation and discovery functions.”\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "It’s been over three months since Facebook’s Instagram copied Snapchat’s popular stories feature and placed it at the very top of everybody’s feed. Now Snapchat is hitting back by copying one of Instagram Stories’ most useful features: the rewind button.\nInstagram’s version of Stories is very much the same as Snapchat’s, however, there’s a handy feature which allows users to “rewind” to the previous clip by tapping on the upper left side of the story. After a night out with friends, it’s an essential tool for jumping straight back to that embarrassing clip they uploaded, without the need to scroll all the way to the bottom to the full friends list to watch the entire story reel in full again — like you had to in Snapchat, until today.\nWhen you update to the latest version, you’ll see that you can tap the left side of any snap in a story to return to the previous snap, or if it’s only a one snap story, you’ll be returned to the previous user. Pretty handy.\nAs well as Rewind, Snapchat has also added augmented reality filters for the front and rear camera, named World Lenses. World Lenses allow the user to change the environment around them, like adding a sleepy cloud that rains down rainbow puke.\n\nThe new World Lenses are accessible alongside the ordinary Selfie Lenses you swipe through once you tap on the camera screen. Download the latest version of the app to try them out.\nIs your Snapchat feed feeling a little lifeless? Here are nine great food accounts you should be following.\n",

      "text": "\nFacebook has just launched a new app called Flash, which is yet another attempt by the company to take on Snapchat . The app is being billed as a Snapchat competitor for emerging markets, as it boasts a small memory footprint and will work in areas with more limited data connectivity.\nFlash weighs in at “less than 25MB” in size, which is approximately a third of the size of Snapchat’s Android app. It’s also smaller than Facebook’s core app, which comes in at around 54MB, varying slightly depending on the device. The app was apparently developed by a team specialized in building apps for emerging economies.\nThis is not the first time that Facebook has attempted to take on Snapchat with what is essentially a software clone. The company’s Poke and Slingshot apps both failed to pick up many users and have been pulled from Google and Apple app stores over the past couple of years. Facebook is also testing camera-first features in its core app and is adopting familiar features with Instagram too.\nBut rather than challenging Snapchat head on for a third time, it would be incredibly tough to catch up to the app’s 60 million daily users in the US and Canada, Facebook’s new strategy is to beat Snapchat in emerging market adoption. As the app boasts similar features but uses less data, customers may be tempted to download Facebook’s option instead, which could finally be a winning formula.\n“In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share.” – Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg \nFlash launched in its first market, Brazil, on Tuesday, and the company has plans to bring the app to other markets too. Facebook hasn’t given out information on regions or a timeline yet though, but it seems likely that Flash will be targeted at markets with limited WiFi availability and lower Snapchat adoption rates.\nSee also: WhatsApp testing out Snapchat-like “Status” feature 5 days ago ",

      "text": "Chances are, if you've spent any time on Facebook you've seen the sales pitches. Rodan and Fields representatives hawk their skin care line like it is liquid gold. And it is, for doctors Kathy Fields and Katie Rodan. The two self-proclaimed \"Wrinkle Warriors\" have been at the forefront of a successful skin care line since the 1990s. You've surely heard of their first product–the popular acne treatment Proactive. Today, their Rodan + Fields business is a billion dollar baby, but the two dermatologists still put on their white lab coats two days a week to treat patients at their respective San Francisco Area dermatology practices. These two entrepreneurs met back in the 1980s and a billion dollar, decades long friendship was born.\nKathy Fields and Katie Rodan met at Stanford in 1984. Fields was straight from the University of Miami Medical School and Rodan from the USC School of Medicine. They were in Palo Alto to do their dermatology residencies. They quickly bonded over a shared sense of fashion that their classmates did not share and remained friends as they studied for their board exams and joined separate all male dermatology practices in San Francisco. A few years later in 1989, Rodan found herself frustrated by the lack of advances in treating acne and felt the market needed a new alternative. So she decided to create the acne solution that wasn't available at the time. The first person she called to tell her idea to was Fields.\n\nIn 1990 the two women signed a contract with each other declaring themselves equal partners in a company created to make an acne treatment. The contract marked the official beginning of their business partnership, built on an already deep friendship. The only problem was, they lacked capital. They were young doctors with children at home. Trying to decide whether to fund a prototype or buy diapers was a challenge.\nThe two set out to create a product to fill the gap they saw in the acne care market. They kept their day jobs while working nights and weekends at their kitchen tables to turn their side project into a wildly successful household name. That product was Proactiv and unlike other acne treatments, Rodan and Fields' formula felt like a high-end beauty cream.\nIn 1993 Rodan and Fields paid a visit to Neutrogena's headquarters with Baggies full of their new acne product. Neutrogena told them that infomercials would be the way to market the brand. At the time, infomercials were in their infancy and terrible cheesy. They were where subpar products like hair color in a spray paint can went to hawk their wares. The doctors were horrified. They were Stanford educated. They weren't infomercial material. Neutrogena kept them on the hook for about a year, but ultimately turned them down. The doctors thought that was it. After all, they were doctors, not businesswomen, or so they thought at the time.\nBut Neutrogena had given them an idea. Rodan's mother provided an introduction to one of the co-founders of infomercial company Guthy-Renker and talks began. In 1995 Fields and Rodan licensed their product to Guthy-Renker. They had spent $30,000 of their own money over five years developing Proactiv. Guthy-Renker marketed and distributed the product and paid the doctors an estimated 15% in royalties from sales.\nProactiv quickly became Guthy-Renker's most successful product and was responsible for approximately half of the company's sales. The acne treatment brought in a reported $1 billion in sales in 2015. In March 2016, Guthy-Renker entered into a deal with Nestle to expand Proactiv's international sales. As part of the deal, Fields and Rodan sold their remaining rights to Proactiv royalties. For that, they were paid a lump sum estimated to be more than $50 million.\nAfter selling the rights to Proactiv, the duo could have gone back to their dermatology practices full time. Both are adjunct professors at Stanford's School of Medicine. But they were still passionate about solving skin care problems. Both doctors noticed that over the years, the people coming into their offices complaining about wrinkles were getting younger and younger. Their deal with Guthy-Renker allowed them to sell other skin care products as long as they didn't market them on TV, so the pair set their sights on the anti aging market.\nThey launched the Rodan + Fields line, selling in department stores, in 2002. The following year Estee Lauder bought the brand. And then it languished in the cosmetics giant's massive portfolio of brands. Four years later, in 2007, the doctors bought their brand back. In the meantime, they had studied direct-selling firms and tested that format by holding a Rodan + Fields party. A TV station covered the party and interviewed the doctors about direct selling. The station was flooded with phone calls from people wanting to get involved.\nRodan + Fields has been a multi-level marketing company ever since. Consultants are paid a commission for their own sales and for the sales of people they recruit. More and more salespeople are signing up with Rodan + Fields each year. When Rodan + Fields relaunched as a multilevel marketing company in 2008, the company had just 1,350 consultants; today it has 150,000.\nFor the past six years Rodan + Fields revenues have increased an average of 93% a year, growing from $24 million in 2010 to $627 million in 2015. The women are quick to point out that they are doctors, not businesswomen, but their success at building not one but two lucrative skin care brands has netted them each an estimated net worth of $550 million. They may not feel like businesswomen, but their success absolutely proves they are.\nRead more: These Two Dermatologists Built A Billion-Dollar Brand From Their Kitchen Tables ",

      "text": "My Facebook feed, on election day, was a study in contrasts. There were “Make America Great Again” hats on one side and primary-colored pantsuits on the other. The Hillary Clinton supporters in my feed, many of them women, were especially pronounced. For one thing, there are a lot of them. And many of the Clinton supporters I know clearly felt compelled to share what November 8 meant to them: They often appeared in selfie form, grinning and wearing “I Voted” stickers, ready to watch history affirm what all little girls are told: A woman can be president. A woman will be president. Someday.\nIt hasn’t happened yet. After Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential race, American women are back to wondering whether a woman will be elected president in their lifetimes. And Facebook, resistant as ever to acknowledging its role as the world’s most powerful media company, hasn’t exactly caught up with the news.\nThe result: My Facebook feed this morning is a disorienting mesh of hope and anguish. It’s still filled with so many of those pantsuit selfies—along with the Clinton-supporting dads who took their daughters to the polls to witness history, and even the guy who found in his closet the nearest approximation of a Clintonesque pantsuit to wear to work yesterday—all mixed in with stunned reactions to the outcome of the race. (The Trump supporters I know have been mostly, though not entirely, restrained in their Facebook celebrating.)",

      "text": "Ashley King Nov 9th, 2016 \nFacebook has been expanding how businesses and people interact with its social media platform. That expansion now includes offering businesses the ability to send “highly-targeted, in-context” ads to customers they’ve interacted with before. These ads will show up in Messenger threads like any other message you’d receive from one of your contacts. Before you start rioting in the streets about more Facebook advertising, the company says sponsored messages can’t be sent to all Facebook users. Rather, the businesses’ mailing list will only include customers who have interacted with them using the platform before while requesting information from the business. Facebook doesn’t make a distinction between users interacting with live customer support reps and chat bots, though. \nFor businesses that are already using chatbots, these new messaging features are available. If you’ve reached out to a chat bot on Facebook, you can probably expect an influx of ads in your feed as advertisers begin testing the waters with these new ways to reach people.",

      "text": "\nHow do you feel about ads on top of your ads? What about advertisements embedded into your messages as \"sponsored\" messages?\nIf you're a Facebook Messenger user, you may start seeing advertisements pop up in the middle of your conversations. The company wrote a blog post directed towards \"brands\" to learn how to embed this sort of feature. Sponsored messages won't go out to all Facebook users, but if you've \"liked\" a page, you will likely start seeing interactive ads from those companies show up in your messages. This could be anything from a restaurant offering you a free drink during happy hour or a retailer slipping a discount coupon your way.\n\nIt looks like chatbots may be proliferated as an advertising medium, and it makes sense. After all, what better way to entice someone to spend money somewhere than to make them feel like the transaction is somewhat personal? It's genius, but here's to hoping that Facebook's new advertising gimmick doesn't turn into a headache for its users. Especially mobile users.\n",

      "text": "In her concession speech today, Hillary Clinton thanked her supporters, and specifically called out to those who showed their support online, \"even in secret, private Facebook sites.\" \nMillions joined the Facebook group \nThe line seemed to allude to groups like Pantsuit Nation, which gained late notoriety in the campaign , as thousands posted photos of themselves in Clinton's trademark outfit. The group was invitation-only, but that did not stop millions from joining. \n\"To the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to their neighbors, posted on Facebook — even in secret private Facebook sites,\" Clinton said to applause, starting at about 51 minutes into the video above. \"I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward.\" \nThe election, of course, did not come out out the way those supporters hoped, as the expected celebration instead marked Donald Trump's shocking ascendance. Still, her speech included a note of hope for young women in the country. \"To all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams,\" she said.

(Photo: Doug McSchooler/for IndyStar) \nScouting Indiana has now served National colleges and universities with recruiting information and evaluations since 2008. Throughout each calendar year they attend numerous high school games, multiple spring & summer grassroots tournaments, the IBCA Top-100 workout, as well as fall leagues & tournaments in order to familiarize themselves with the state’s top girls’ teams and prospects. With the 2016-2017 high school season getting started, Scouting Indiana takes a look at some of the top teams and players in the Hoosier state. This third installment will focus on Class 3A. Throughout the season be sure to follow them on twitter @ScoutingINGirls. Before we get started, Scouting Indiana would like to offer a special thank you to Hoosier Basketball Magazine, specifically Kip Wesner, and to the high school coaches who helped to provide information included in this preview. \nClass 3A this season looks to remain pretty steady with a lot of familiar faces competing for the crown. While there have been some significant graduation losses, a lot of those teams were very deep with talent, and it’s going to be somewhat difficult to knock off the upper-tier squads again this season. \nIn this preview we’ve taken the time to identify who we think should be some of the best teams in Class 3A this season. Additionally we’ve pointed out several of the better players/prospects in Class 3A who’ve already made quite a name for themselves through their strong play. Scouting Indiana’s Preseason Top-20 Teams in Class 3A \n1.) South Bend Saint Joseph (25-2, regional champs in 2015-2016) Last season was pretty impressive for the Indians, considering the loss of a pair of Division-I guards in the 2015 class. This year one of their most versatile players, Brooke Juday (8.1p, 4.5r), has graduated and is now playing at Division-II Eckerd College. Also gone via graduation is guard Hannah Mauch (4.0p), plus Head Coach Eric Mauch has departed. But there’s more, as shortly after the 2015-2016 season ended, 6-0 wing Emma Applegate transferred to Niles H.S. in Michigan due to family ties. With that said, Saint Joseph is still one of the deepest and most talented teams in Class 3A. Leading the way are a pair of dynamic 5-8 senior guards in Daly Sullivan (14.6p, 2.8r, 2.7a) and Nicole Konieczny (12.2p, 3.3r, 2.6a), with the former drawing Division-I interest and the latter having already committed to Valparaiso University. Both were Junior All-Stars. They will be helped up front by experienced 5-11 seniors in wing Abby O’Connor (5.9p, 3.3r), forward Savannah Scott (2.7p, 4.0r), and post Killian Mountford (2.6p, 2.6r). Juniors returning with experience are 5-9 wing Abby O’Dell, plus 5-10 forwards Addison and Grace Quinn. One newcomer who should prove to be a significant addition is 5-11 freshman wing Keegan Sullivan. She’s powerful enough to play inside, but she’s skilled enough to play like a guard. \n2.) Tippecanoe Valley (25-2, sectional champs in 2015-2016) Two years ago Tippecanoe Valley made a lot of noise by making it to the State Finals. Last season they fell to Heritage Christian in the Regional Final. What’s scary for opponents is the fact that this year might be the deepest, most talented team they’ve had to date. They did lose Brynda Krueger (6.6p, 3.3r, 3.9a) and Karis Tucker (3.7) to graduation. Krueger is now playing at Ancilla College, while Tucker is playing at John Wood Community College. The standout for the Vikings is 6-0 senior front-liner Anne Secrest (16.7p, 8.2r, 1.8b). She was a Junior All-Star who committed to Youngstown State last year. Helping Secrest in the paint is 5-10 senior forward Hannah Dunn (6.7p, 3.6r) and 5-11 junior post Asia O’Connor (2.4p). Dunn committed to Anderson University this fall. On the outside the Vikings return veterans in 5-8 senior wing Meredith Brouyette (8.7p, 2.2r, 57-3’s) and 5-7 junior wing Addy Miller (8.2p, 2.4r, 55-3’s). Both are outstanding shooters. 5-6 sophomore guard Sophie Bussard (5.4p, 3.0r) is an athletic playmaker who returns. Newcomers include 5’4 senior point guard Kilee Slone, who had to sit out last season due to her transfer ruling. Talented 5-8 sophomore wing Emily Peterson should help as well, as she missed last season with an injury. Also look for junior Olivia Trippiedi and sophomore Sarah Tucker to add backcourt depth. \n3.) Heritage Christian (26-4, state champs in 2015-2016) Heritage Christian has had a dominant run in both Class 2A and Class 3A over the last 14 seasons. Over that span they have won 12 sectionals, nine regionals, they’ve been the Class 2A state runner-up once, and they’ve won six Class 2A State Titles and a Class 3A state title. Obviously they’re expected to be a favorite again this year, but they’ll have to do so without graduates Tyasha Harris and Darby Foresman. Taking on a much bigger load this year will be talented 5-11 junior guard Katlyn Gilbert (13.0p), who has already committed to the University of Notre Dame. Also back for the Eagles is 5-5 senior guard De’Shawna Harper, an Alabama A&M commit who sat out most of last year due to her transfer ruling, but she did return during the state tournament and averaged 15.0 ppg during that time. 5-9 senior forwards Hannah Williams (6.0p) and Sydney Buis (3.0p), plus senior guards Reyna Williams (2.0p) and Kendall Clark also return. One boost could come from Carmel transfer Madison Ferguson, a quick 5-5 sophomore point guard. She can create offense for others or score the ball herself. \nNorth Harrison coach Missy Voyles looks up at the clock in the closing seconds of her 200th win. (Photo: David R. Lutman/Special to The CJ) \n4.) North Harrison (28-3, state runners-up in 2015-2016) The North Harrison Cougars fell just six points short (51-45) of winning a Class 3A state title last year, losing to perennial power Heritage Christian. In her second stint as the coach at North Harrison, Missy Voyles has the program rolling again, and they welcome all comers this season as they look to head back to Banker’s Life Fieldhouse. Leading the way this time are 6-1 sophomore forward Lilly Hatton (12.4p, 7.6r, 4.7b) and 5-8 junior guard Cali Nolot (12.3p, 2.7r, 2.6a). Hatton has seen her college interest explode in the last six months, while Nolot was actually absent during the State Title Game due to an injury. With her back in the mix, the Lady Cats should again be a force in Southern Indiana. 5-6 guard Taylor Rennirt (7.4p, 2.7r, 2.9a), 5-5 guard Hallie Hinton (5.3p, 2.8r, 2.5a), 5-6 wing Stevi Burns (4.7p, 3.1r), 5-3 point guard Jessicka Chiquito (2.9p, 2.3a), and 5-10 front-liner Emma Nokes (2.3p) all return with quality varsity experience. All are juniors except for Burns, a senior. Depth can be addressed through a handful of different players, most notably senior Lexi Terrell, junior Shelby Kondovski, and sophomores Savana Rhodes and Madison Shelton. \n5.) Greensburg (22-4, Sectional Champs in 2015-2016) The Class of 2018 at Greensburg has been pretty stout for some time now, and Pirate fans have to be excited about this year’s team. After a 22-win season and a Sectional Title last season, a deeper run in the State Tournament is a definite possibility. The Pirates did graduate Taylor McIntosh (6.2p, 2.8r, 2.5a) and Maddi Hellmich (2.9p, 2.3r), but they return a great deal of depth and experience. The best of the bunch is 5-6 junior guard Kyra Whitaker (16.7p, 3.7r, 3.5a, 63-3’s). Whitaker is an athletic combo guard who can play either guard spot equally well. 5-5 junior guard Bailey Meyer (9.5p, 2.5r) is a tough-nosed, gritty kid who has good athleticism; as does her twin sister, 5-6 junior wing Ashlynn Meyer (4.9p, 2.4r). They are the daughters of Greensburg’s successful boys’ coach, Stacy Meyer. 5-9 junior forward Rheagen Day (5.8p, 3.6r) and 5-11 junior post Kiersten Lynette (4.1p, 4.7r) round out the junior returnees, while 5-11 senior post Claire Fleetwood (3.0p, 6.2r) adds a nice defensive presence. Seniors Samantha Cain and Sydney Meyer, and junior Cameron Jones work for bigger roles, while freshmen Micah Morrison and Aliyah Evans should get an early taste of varsity action this season. Class 2A statewide girls basketball preview \n6.) Fort Wayne Concordia (14-12, sectional champs in 2015-2016) While the Cadets may not be an obvious choice at #6, they did play against one of the toughest schedules in Class 3A last season while starting two freshmen in the backcourt, and they managed to win yet another Sectional Title. In fact, over the last ten years Concordia has won seven Sectionals, three Regionals, and two State Titles. And while they did graduate Brooke Macke (3.6p, 2.5r) and Addison Gepfert (3.1p, 2.6r), they do return a majority of their statistical production. Back for their senior seasons, and creating a nice presence up front, are 5-11 forward Shania Kelly (16.1p, 10.0r, 1.9b) and 6-1 post Hannah Nack (2.9p, 3.8r). Kelly has already given a commitment to Walsh University. Also returning up front is 5-11 junior Libby Hetler (3.2p, 3.0r). In the backcourt Coach Miller has two potential Division-I recruits in 5-6 Carissa Garcia (10.5p, 4.0r, 2.6a) and 5-8 Sylare Starks (10.3p, 45-3’s), both just sophomores. Looking to add depth to the Cadets lineup are sophomore Hope Kanning and junior Paige Patterson, but 6-2 freshman Cleasia Craig could eventually be a difference-maker as well. \n7.) Northwestern (14-9 in 2015-2016) There has been a lot of talk about the young kids coming up through the Northwestern program the last couple of years, and now they have finally all arrived at the high school. Though young, the Tigers have as much depth, size, and talent as anyone in Class 3A. They did graduate stalwarts Brooke Treadway (12.1p, 10.0r), Whitney Zeck (7.9p, 44-3’s), and Michelle Hunkeler (3.6p, 4.4r), but strong freshmen and sophomore classes should help to make up for their departure. The leading returning scorers are 5-5 senior guards Brianna Hahn (12.5p, 3.6r) and Sophia Beachy (8.3p, 2.9r, 2.1a). 5-7 junior guard Sarah Vas (3.4p) also returns on the perimeter. 6-0 forward Stephanie Burns (6.7p, 6.8r) and 5-10 wing Taylor Boruff (3.1p, 2.1r) both got their feet wet last year as varsity freshmen, and both are already drawing college interest. This season look for wing Madison Layden and post Kendall Bostic, both 6-0 freshmen, to have an instant and major impact at the varsity level. Both are drawing Division-I interest because of their play this summer. Also looking to add to the Tigers’ success are senior Beza Townsend, juniors Morgan Mercer and Kora Loer, and sophomore Olivia Eddington. Class A statewide girls basketball preview \n8.) Vincennes Lincoln (21-6, sectional champs in 2015-2016) The Alices have been a combined 40-12 over the last two seasons, but they’ve flown somewhat under the radar due to the success of neighboring Vincennes Rivet. Lincoln has a nice mixture of youth and experience, but they must fill the void left by graduated guard Jene’e Goodwin (17.8p, 2.5r), who is now playing at Indiana Wesleyan University. Also gone to graduation are Shelby Boger (4.6p, 5.0r) and Lauren Frederick (3.3p, 2.5r). Looking to step up and lead this season is 5-7 junior point guard Abi Haynes (11.6p, 3.6r, 4.5a), who is long, athletic, and sneaky good. 5-11 sophomore forward Allison Hein (8.0p, 4.6r, 2.2b) and 6-2 junior post Lindsey Sparks (4.6p, 3.4r) should provide a strong presence inside the arc, while twin 5-6 senior wings Haleigh (4.1p, 5.8r) and Lauren Hipsher (3.6p) can score it from the perimeter. 5-9 junior forward Chasity Trueblood (3.0p, 2.8r) and 5-4 senior guard Kacy Cramer (2.0p) also return for the Alices. Senior Kendall Jewel and junior Payton Sievers look to add depth. \n9.) Crispus Attucks (17-5 in 2015-2016) The Tigers of Crispus Attucks have become the hunted in girls’ basketball throughout the Indianapolis Public School system, winning 38 games the last two seasons. This year they are as deep, versatile, and athletic as they’ve ever been, though they did see Rodnikka McCormick (8.1p, 3.5r), Torri Brewer (3.7p), Aubrey Baker (3.0p, 2.9r, 2.4a), and Amber Stringer (2.2p) leave via the diploma. The success of the Tigers this season will likely revolve around their backcourt, as 5-6 senior Lauren Sheppard (11.8p, 3.0r, 2.1a), 5-4 junior Mikia Keith (10.5p, 2.6r, 5.0a, 4.7s), 5-5 senior Shay Harper (6.6p, 2.0r), and 5-9 junior Teague Brewer (6.8p, 4.0r) are all capable and aggressive perimeter scorers. In fact Keith has already earned multiple Division-I offers. If they can get consistent production up front out of 6-1 senior forward Chyna McMichal (9.8p, 5.5r, 3.2s), 6-2 post Charese Cook (4.2p, 2.4r), and 5-9 forward Erica Ballard (2.5p, 2.5r), they will be tough to beat. 5-6 junior guard Taylor Hall is another nice athlete in the mix, while juniors Kamani Alsum and Princess Davis, and sophomore Kiara Barnett seek an opportunity. \n10.) John Glenn (18-8 in 2015-2016) Last year saw the most losses the Falcons have suffered over the past four seasons, but it was also one of the toughest schedules they’ve played in a while. This year they look to continue their success, while trying to figure out a way to get past Saint Joseph in the Sectional. Glenn will do so minus the services of Ashley Burnett (5.7p, 2.3r) and Hayley Preston (4.7p, 5.7r) who both graduated, but they return explosive 5-4 senior point guard Kyannah Stull (13.6p, 4.3r, 3.4a, 3.8s) for one more run. Stull has already signed with Grace College. Another nice backcourt scorer is 5-8 junior wing Mariah Plunkett (11.0p, 3.3r). 5-8 senior wing Kelly Freehauf (4.3p, 4.0r), 5-8 junior forward Riley Groves (3.9p, 2.3r), and 5-5 sophomore guard Morgan Plunkett (2.3p) also earned valuable varsity minutes last season. Potential newcomers include senior Abbie Drzewiecki, juniors Delaney Patterson, Elizabeth Sarber, and Abby Schmidt, and sophomores Bethany Hayden, Dessa Lang, and Ryley Miller. HS girls basketball season preview: Class-by-class capsules \n11.) Princeton (27-1 in 2015-2016) Princeton could be a very tricky team to figure out this year, as for the first time in four years they are playing with a whole new identity. Gone is McDonald’s All-American, Miss Basketball, and all-everything Jackie Young (34.9p, 9.5r, 5.0a, 3.8s). She was obviously their heart and soul, but she is off playing at the University of Notre Dame now. Also gone for the Tigers are Hannah Brewer (4.5p, 5.1r, 3.7a) and Kiana Hardiman (2.3p). With those losses, several players will need to step up. 5-11 senior front-liner Brooke James (13.6p, 5.8r) looks like the top candidate to fill that void. She’s a physical, tough-nosed kid who can play around the basket or in the mid-post. Also back are 5-6 junior wing Kiare Young (6.8p) and 5-4 senior guard Kaycee Russell (2.4p). Look for 5-7 senior forward Easton Chandler, 5-8 junior forward Ava Little, and 5-8 sophomore forward Emma Ault to get a lot more opportunity on the floor. 5-5 guard Alyssa DeHosse and 5-9 forward Emma Satore could also see the floor early and often as freshmen. \n12.) Rushville (10-13 in 2015-2016) The Lions are a team who could sneak up on some people this year. They played a tough schedule last season, and they did so with two freshmen in the starting lineup. They did graduate Lilly Cramer (7.2p), Brooklyn Herbert (3.1p, 2.5r), and McKenzie Woolston (3.0p, 2.3r), but they return quite a bit of production and add some nice young talent as well. Leading the way for Rushville is 5-3 senior point guard Kaitlyn Howe (12.9p, 3.8r). She’s a quick little guard who can create offense for herself or others. The two youngsters who stepped up last year are 5-8 sophomore wing Allie Smith (9.3p, 5.0r) and 5-10 sophomore forward Taylor Browning (8.9p, 5.0r). Additional depth comes from 5-1 senior guard Kayla Fogg (4.9p, 4.4r) and 5-2 senior guard Alisha Markley. Look for 5-9 senior forward Brandi Adkins and 5-8 freshman Tori Campbell to also contribute immediately. Waiting in the wings are two additional freshmen who could see the floor this year. They are 5-7 Madi Turner and 6-2 Kourtney Ash. \n13.) Fort Wayne Dwenger (14-8 in 2015-2016) Last year the Bishop Dwenger Saints won their most games since the 2005-2006 season, and then they promptly graduated star wing Taya Andrews (23.4p, 6.9r) and guard Madison Ream (4.8p, 2.3r). Andrews is now playing at Division-II Roberts Wesleyan. But there is a lot of optimism for Dwenger to be even better this year, and it centers around the return of a pair of underclassmen. 5-11 junior forward Ellen Ross (10.8p, 8.2r) is a rugged and tough-nosed forward who can score inside or out, and she’s already earned a few Division-I offers. The other talented youngster is 5-2 sophomore point guard Jayda Smith (7.5p, 2.8r, 2.7a) who can make plays off the dribble. 6-2 senior post Josie Kolkman (5.3p, 5.1r, 2.0b), 5-9 senior wing Natalie Mowery (2.9p, 2.0r), and 5-8 junior forward Olivia Sterba (2.7p, 3.1r) also return to the lineup. Looking to add depth this season are senior forward Heather Nellum, junior wing Caitlyn Ryan, and junior guard Winnie O’Brien. \n14.) Scottsburg (14-10 in 2015-2016) It’s been nearly five years since the Warriors have won a Sectional Title, but if they can figure out a way to knock off North Harrison, this could be the year they get it done once again. Scottsburg is coached by Donna Cheatham, the state’s all-time winningest girls’ coach, and she is entering her 42nd year on the sidelines, her 30th year at Scottsburg. The Warriors did graduate a key cog in guard Taylor Means. She is now playing at NAIA IU-Kokomo. Scottsburg does return 5-9 do-everything senior forward Paige Barrett (16.8p, 10.0r). Barrett has already given a verbal commitment to play at Division-I Murray State University. Also back are 5-7 senior guard Emma Waskom and 5-8 senior forward Emilee Davidson. There is also a solid junior class that goes 5-strong and should definitely help fill the void left by Means. They are Katelynn Jennings, Leah Hunefeld, Alyssa Hall, Katie Horstman, and Shelby Sandlin. HS girls basketball preview: ALL-USA Indy-area Super Team \n15.) West Lafayette (21-4 in 2015-2016) The Red Devils are typically a team who gets after it, while also playing with a great deal of discipline. This year shouldn’t be any different. West Lafayette did suffer some significant graduation losses in Maggie Wodicka (12.1p, 3.6r), Julia Bittner (9.3p, 3.6r), Abby Martin (8.4p, 2.7r), and Mary Kate Cartwright (2.1p, 3.2r). Wodicka is playing at Division-III Johns Hopkins. Returning, however, is talented 5-8 junior guard Kylie Martin (10.7p, 3.1r, 3.4a). She is a versatile kid who can handle or play off the ball, and she’s a nice athlete. Also back are 5-6 senior guard Madi Jacobs (6.1p, 5.4r), 5-11 senior forward Kaia Harris (6.0p, 6.3r), 5-10 junior forward Teagan Parker (3.3p, 2.5r), and 5-6 senior guard Allie Jin (3.2p). Juniors Sydney Williams and Riley Holloway, and sophomore Caroline Sautter have seen some varsity action already, but they look to contribute a lot more this season. Looking for their first opportunities are sophomores Emma Tate and Ashley Weatherly, while freshman Alaina Omonode looks to provide a boost to the frontcourt. \n16.) Beech Grove (13-11 in 2015-2016) The Hornets have won a mere five Sectional games since their Class 3A State Title back in 2003, but there is a lot of optimism heading into this season, as they played a lot of younger players one year ago. Leading the way are two talented sophomores in 5-9 point guard Cameron Cardenas (14.0p, 2.5r, 4.2a, 4.3s) and 6-0 inside-out forward Katherine Giller (15.4p, 9.3r, 2.5a, 1.9b). Both are receiving a great deal of college interest, and they’re trying to return Beech Grove to its prominence of the early 2000’s. The Hornets also return 6-0 junior post Mallory Storms (8.0p, 6.7r), senior McKiyla Kimbrough (2.0p, 2.1r), and junior Skyler McGregor. Beech Grove has good size, and they only add to it with 6-0 sophomore forward Bre Small. She’s looking to make an impact for the first time this season. Also looking to contribute are seniors Angelina Robison and Asia Clifton. \n17.) Indian Creek (21-5, sectional champs in 2015-2016) It seems like year after year Indian Creek is having to deal with the loss of a key player or two, and year after year they continue to bounce back and be successful. This season is no different, as they graduated talented wing Candace Danz (now playing at Marian University), 5-8 junior forward Lacie Tekulve transferred to Whiteland, and 5-10 junior forward Celina McElroy (8.0p) will miss much of the season due to a knee injury. However fans are still excited because a young and talented nucleus does return. This year the Braves will be led by 5-4 junior guard Addie Rund (9.4p), 5-11 sophomore forward Katie Burkman (9.2p), and 5-7 sophomore guard Caitlyn Snyder (6.5p, 3.2r). Also returning with quality varsity experience are 6-0 senior post Madelyn Gary (3.5p, 2.9r), 5-5 junior guard Makenzi Sizemore (3.0p), and 5-5 sophomore guard Stevye Gonzales (2.0p). The Braves could also find a significant role early this season for versatile 5-7 freshman wing Heather Maddox. \n18.) Hamilton Heights (11-12 in 2015-2016) Since their run to the State Finals in 2013, the Huskies have been snakebitten with injuries to key players each season. This year will start no differently, but there is enough young talent that they should be able to overcome and be a nice squad when some of those pieces return later this season. 6-3 senior Taylor Boyd has struggled with injuries and she, along with 5-4 junior Lexi Branham (5.6p, 2.9r, 3.5a), will miss a good portion of the season with knee injuries. The Huskies also graduated Bri Henson (4.4p, 2.6r). However 5-11 junior forward Kayla Kirtley (12.2p, 5.4r) returns to shoulder the load. She’s a skilled inside-out forward, and she’ll be joined in the lineup by 5-8 junior forward Ana Collar (8.9p, 7.3r, 3.7s), 5-8 senior wing Ashton Runner (6.7p, 4.9r), and 5-11 sophomore forward Sydney Griffey (4.5p, 5.2r). 5-10 senior forward AireAnna Stretch (3.3p) and 5-6 senior wing Audrie Catron (2.2p) bring additional experience, while 5-3 freshman Bayleigh Runner could eventually see some time. \n19.) Western Boone (18-8 in 2015-2016) Western Boone has had a nice run of success since the 2006-2007 season, but it seems like more times than not they run into a tough Lebanon team come state tournament time. With their biggest rival experiencing significant graduation losses, the Stars could become the favorite in Sectional 25 this year. Western Boone did graduate some key players themselves, as Rachel Ramey (13.2p, 5.5r), Taylor Vanderpool (7.3p, 2.5r, 3.2a), Julia Hole (6.1p, 5.4r), and Lexie Raby (3.2p, 2.8r) are all gone now. But returning is dynamic 5-7 sophomore guard Madison Jones (14.2p, 4.0r, 3.1a, 3.1s). She’s a passionate competitor who can score, distribute, and defend. Also back are 5-8 senior wing Callie Gubera (6.2p, 3.6r) and 5-6 senior guard Olivia Hole (5.9p). 5-7 senior forward Maddie Wright and 5-5 junior guard Alayna Raby, along with a quartet of freshmen, look to step up big this season. \n20.) Cardinal Ritter (17-6 in 2015-2016) Since coach Tom Downard took over at Cardinal Ritter four seasons ago, the Raiders have amassed a 71-24 record, but just one Sectional Title because of some strong Sectional fields. This year they look to regain that title, but they must do so without Taylor Speckman (15.8p, 4.6r, 3.2s), Julia Keesling (12.4p, 5.7r), and Megan Diagostino (3.0p, 6.7r), all gone due to graduation. Back however is crafty and versatile 5-7 senior point guard Abby Downard (14.5p, 3.0r, 4.8a, 3.3s). She is a competitive kid who has a tremendous IQ and feel for the game. She’ll be aided by 5-7 junior guard Maddie Briggeman (5.0p, 2.7r) and 5-5 junior wing Jenna Purichia (2.8p, 2.5r). Also look for 5-7 junior guard Mya Kiner (4.1p, 2.9r) to contribute. She’s a transfer from Terre Haute South. Senior guards Phoebe Schembre and Katie Waters add backcourt depth. Up front is where it could get a little dicey, as there isn’t much size or experience returning. Two junior forwards who should contribute are 5-8 Emma Eifert, and 5-10 Perry Meridian transfer Faith Smith. 15 More Teams in Class 3A to Keep an Eye on This Season \nAndrean, Benton Central, Charlestown, Evansville Memorial, Fort Wayne Canterbury, Gary Lighthouse CPA, Indianapolis Chatard, Lebanon, Leo, Marion, Mishawaka Marian, NorthWood, South Bend Washington, Southridge, Washington \nPlayer Spotlight: 50 Prospects Who Stand Out in Class 3A: \n(arranged alphabetically) \nPaige Barrett, 2017, 5-9 F, Scottsburg, Committed to Murray State Tayra Breitbach, 2017, 6-0 F, Bishop Chatard Meredith Brouyette, 2017, 5-8 W, Tippecanoe Valley Cameron Cardenas, 2018, 5-9 G, Beech Grove Ariyanna Carroll, 2018, 5-11 F, Brebeuf Jesuit Cassidy Crawford, 2019, 5-11 W, Tipton Abby Downard, 2017, 5-7 G, Cardinal Ritter Erika Foy, 2018, 5-10 F, Mississinewa Carissa Garcia, 2019, 5-6 G, Fort Wayne Concordia Katlyn Gilbert, 2018, 5-11 G, Heritage Christian, Committed to Notre Dame Katie Giller, 2018, 6-0 F, Beech Grove Brianna Hahn, 2017, 5-6 G, Northwestern DéShawna Harper, 2017, 5-5 G, Heritage Christian, Committed to Alabama A&M Brianna Harvey, 2018, 5-9 W, Charlestown Lilly Hatton, 2019, 6-1 F, North Harrison Abi Haynes, 2018, 5-7 G, Vincennes Lincoln Abbie Heischman, 2017, 5-9 G, Leo, Committed to Kentucky Wesleyan Erika Hendrixson, 2018, 5-11 F, Pike Central Kaitlyn Howe, 2017, 5-3 G, Rushville Grace Hunter, 2019, 5-8 G, Belmont Brooke James, 2017, 5-11 C, Princeton Madison Jones, 2019, 5-7 G, Western Boone Mikia Keith, 2018, 5-4 G, Indianapolis Crispus Attucks Shania Kelly, 2017, 5-11 F, Fort Wayne Concordia, Committed to Walsh Kayla Kirtley, 2018, 5-11 F, Hamilton Heights Nicole Konieczny, 2017, 5-8 G, South Bend Saint Joseph, Committed to Valparaiso Madison Layden, 2020, 6-0 W, Northwestern Kylie Martin, 2018, 5-8 G, West Lafayette Brooke Montgomery, 2017, 5-6 G, Lebanon, Committed to Indianapolis for softball Cali Nolot, 2018, 5-8 G, North Harrison Abby O’Connor. 2017, 5-11 F, South Bend Saint Joseph Stacy Payton, 2017, 5-11 W, Northview, Committed to Ball State for softball Talia Roldán, 2017, 6-2 C, Andrean, Committed to Grand Canyon Ellen Ross, 2018, 5-11 F, Fort Wayne Bishop Dwenger Anne Secrest, 2017, 6-0 F, Tippecanoe Valley, Committed to Youngstown State Lauren Sheppard, 5-6 G, Indianapolis Crispus Attucks Daijah Smith, 2018, 5-10 W, Gary Lighthouse CPA Sylare Starks, 2019, 5-7 G, Fort Wayne Concordia Kyannah Stull, 2017, 5-4 G, John Glenn, Committed to Grace Victoria Styers, 2017, 5-7 G, Culver Academy Daly Sullivan, 2017, 5-8 G, South Bend Saint Joseph Keegan Sullivan, 2020, 5-11 W, South Bend Saint Joseph Taitlyn Trenshaw, 2017, 5-1 G, NorthWood, Committed to IU-South Bend Meghan Urbanski, 2018, 5-6 G, Mishawaka Marian Mason VanHouten, 2017, 5-8 G, Fort Wayne Canterbury, Committed to Cal State-Fullerton Raegan Walther, 2017, 5-8 G, Kankakee Valley Kaylie Warble, 2017, 6-1 C, West Noble Lyric Ward, 2018, 5-7 W, Gary Lighthouse CPA Hattie Westerfeld, 2019, 6-2 C, Batesville Kyra Whitaker, 2018, 5-6 G, Greensburg Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/2fftUzu Most Popular ",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nYesterday was one of the most nerve-wracking events of the year. \nAs votes poured in from polls across the country, a lot of Americans anxiously awaited to hear the results of the presidential election. \nSeriously: This was more nerve-wracking than watching the season finale of “Game of Thrones.” \nAlthough it was a close race in the end, it was Donald Trump – not Hillary Clinton – who conquered the ballots of America. Giphy \nAs you can imagine, a lot of people were pretty shocked at the fact that Donald Trump won the election . \nNow, people are basically losing their shit over the news that Trump is going to be the next president of the United States. \nIf you’re like most people, you probably did the only logical thing one can do in this situation: You had a nervous breakdown and called your mom, while frantically packing your bags for Canada. The Trumpocalypse To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nBecause let’s be real: When life has you feeling down – or, you know, terrified about what’s going to happen to America with Trump in the White House – you can always count on mom to say the right thing and make everything better. \nPlus, everyone knows moms are a hell of a lot cheaper than therapists. \nApparently, a lot of people received words of encouragement from dear old mom last night, and shared all sorts of texts on social media that are guaranteed to make you tear up. I need my mom right now. pic.twitter.com/mGy7h1otK4 \n— Amanda Fama (@AmandaFama_) November 9, 2016 \nIf you ask me, these calming texts (and a good cry) are exactly what we all need to soothe our frazzled nerves right now. \nTake a look at the pictures below to see these sweet texts from moms about the election… and grab a box of tissues while you’re at it. \nTrust me: You’re going to need them. Hi mom, just wanted to let you know I’ve decided to drop out of college and live a simple life in Siberia with my BFF Obama. Twitter Cookies and Canada are always the solution. Twitter Trump may be president, but look on the bright side: At least your mom still loves you. I love you, no matter what…. except, of course, if you voted for Trump. Twitter At least your mom doesn’t let you down like America does. Twitter A little alien probing sounds like nothing compared to enduring the pain of seeing Trump become president. Twitter Hi honey, don’t forget to pack underwear before you flee the country. Twitter Everything is going to be fine. We live in Maryland… not one of those other asshole states who voted to put Trump in office. Twitter Listen to your mother, and don’t let anyone hold you back from achieving your goals.

      "text": "Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nMIAMI (CBSMiami) — After Donald Trump’s sweeping win against Hillary Clinton for the U.S. presidency Tuesday, parents like CNN Political Analyst Van Jones immediately worried about the next step.\n“You tell your kids ‘don’t be a bully,’ you tell your kids ‘don’t be a bigot’ and then you have this outcome. You have people putting children to bed tonight and they are afraid of breakfast. They’re afraid of ‘how do I explain this to my children,'” said Jones.\nIt was a topic the Clinton campaign zeroed in on early in the election cycle. They ran ads of Trump openly mocking and insulting women, disabled people, immigrants and others that make up America as boys and girls listened and watched closely.\nBy Wednesday morning, parents had turned to social media, venting their frustrations and fears.\nCBS4’s Donna Rapado spoke to local parents who had to have conversations with their children, especially after such nasty and contentious election cycle.\nDiamond Williams and his wife have a 6, 7 and 13-year-old. Williams said the kids don’t really watch much TV but they still know about the biggest competition in the land and that can sometimes get ugly.\n“Our daughter, she takes it quite hard. She’s seven and the 13-year-old is starting to form his own opinions,” said Williams.\nIndeed, child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Dan Bober pointed out that talking to small children and teenagers each require a different approach.\n“Things have to be in a developmentally appropriate context. The older kids, the adolescents tend to be more in a period of their development where their self-esteem is more fragile, where they are in different peer groups. And so, I think, the language Mr. Trump used and the divisiveness will have more of an effect on them,” said Bober.\nDr. Bober also says often children model their parents’ behaviors or take on their anxieties about the election.\n“There’s been a lot of divisive talk and a lot of polarization in the country. It’s been a very ugly, nasty election,” said Bober. “It’s important for people to mobilize their supports and come together and talk it out and speak about their feelings rather than holding them inside.”\nFor Diamond, the number one rule is a positive one.\n“In our house the number one rule is, you know, love,” said Diamond.\nClick here to read more about Campaign 2016.",

      "title": "Simple new process turns sewage sludge into \"biocrude\" oil",
      "text": "Share on Facebook © WE&RF \nThis \"disruptive\" new technology uses heat and pressure to convert sewage waste into an oil that has properties very similar to petroleum. \nUsing a technology called hydrothermal processing (HTP), researchers at the US Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) have produced a \"biocrude\" oil that can be further refined into liquid fuels similar to petroleum products, which calls for another round of singing \" Oh, the wonderful things that poo can do. \" \n\"The best thing about this process is how simple it is. The reactor is literally a hot, pressurized tube. We've really accelerated hydrothermal conversion technology over the last six years to create a continuous, and scalable process which allows the use of wet wastes like sewage sludge.\" - Corinne Drennan, PNNL \nThe new process developed at PNNL has earned it the distinction of being called a \"highly disruptive\" technology in an evaluation by the Water Environment & Reuse Foundation ( WERF ), and the results of the bench-scale testing show that some 60% of the available carbon in the sewage sludge is converted into biocrude, with the other byproducts being a methane-rich gas (also a fuel) and water. This technology, when scaled up, has the potential to turn municipal wastewater treatment plants into renewable energy producers, while \"virtually eliminating\" the need for the processing, transport, and disposal of residuals from sewage treatment. \n\"HTP converts organic material into biocrude oil, natural gas, or both, with potentially more than 99% conversion of organics. HTP uses the same processes which form fossil fuels, (heat, pressure, time, and water), but amplifies these conditions so the conversion occurs in a much shorter timeframe. This technology is specifically designed for wet feed stocks. The byproduct is clear, sterile water.\" - WERF \nThe HTP process pressurizes the sludge to about 3,000 pounds per square inch, and then feeds it into a reactor that operates at about 660 degrees Fahrenheit, where the heat and pressure breaks down the cells of the feedstock into the biocrude oil and \"an aqueous liquid phase\" which can then also be treated and used to create other fuels and chemical products. \nBy enabling the use of a wet feedstock, this HTP process could open a lot of new doors for cleaner liquid fuels from organic materials, including agricultural waste, that have previously been dismissed as being inappropriate for biofuel production due to the need to dry them before using, which rendered them both expensive and energy-intensive to convert into fuels. However, before you start imagining that someday you could fuel your vehicle just with your own waste, PNNL estimates that a single person \"could generate\" just 2 to 3 gallons of biocrude per year, which isn't very much, but which could add up to the equivalent of some 30 million barrels of oil each year if all wastewater treatment plants in the US used the HTP process. \nPNNL has licensed the new technology to Genifuel Corporation , based in Utah, which is working toward the creation of a demonstration plant with Metro Vancouver that could be operating as soon as 2018. And for those interested in a lifecycle analysis of the HTP process, PNNL has you covered right here .  ",

      "text": "Clinton urges supporters to speak outside secret Facebook groups It's a recognition that you need public discussion on social networks to make a difference. Save Reuters/Brian Snyder \nA political candidate's online support isn't always in the open, and Hillary Clinton wouldn't mind changing that. In her presidential campaign concession speech , she indirectly thanked \"secret, private\" Facebook support groups like Pantsuit Nation, a 3 million-strong outfit she'd messaged (through her digital team leader) on election day. At the same time, she didn't want supporters keeping their message bottled up in these groups -- she wanted them \"coming out from behind that\" to make sure their \"voices are heard.\" You can see the statement below at the 15:15 mark. \nBoth statements were brief, but they acknowledge both the importance of social networking in modern political campaigns as well as the problems it can create. The very fact that millions of supporters had their own space to discuss the campaign and political issues is relatively novel, and opening it to the public could easily have invited trolling and harassment. However, a private group also isn't sharing its ideas with the outside world. How many voters might have been swayed if they could have seen and participated in some of these discussions? As important as organizations like Pantsuit Nation might be to galvanize fans, they risk creating bubbles that prevent messages from spreading.",

      "text": "Facebook buys black market passwords to keep your account safe The company's security chief says account safety is about more than just building secure software. Jaap Arriens, NurPhoto via Getty Images \nFacebook's Alex Stamos: \"Safety is a different word to security.\" Brendan Moran/Getty Images \nFor a data-saturated company of its size and scope, Facebook has markedly managed to avoid the kind of security scandals, breaches and hacks that have affected many other major web companies. \nTake a closer look, and you'll see why. Though on the surface all seems calm, below the waves the social network is kicking its legs frantically and working around the clock to keep users' accounts safe. \nKeeping Facebook safe and keeping it secure are two different things, the social network's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, said Wednesday at Web Summit in Lisbon. Security is about building walls to keep out threats and shore up defenses, but according to Stamos, safety is bigger than that. \n\"It turns out that we can build perfectly secure software and yet people can still get hurt,\" he said. \nStamos came to Facebook in summer 2015 from Yahoo and now leads a team at the social network that tries to get ahead of hackers and other threats and head off trouble before it strikes. The biggest headache he deals with is caused by the humble password. \n\"The reuse of passwords is the No. 1 cause of harm on the internet,\" said the security chief. \nWhen passwords are stolen en masse and traded on the black market, it becomes apparent just how many of them are the same -- \"123456\" and its consecutive numerical brethren are the main culprits. If you're using one of these passwords , that automatically makes your account more vulnerable to being compromised. This is something Facebook is keen to help you avoid. \nTo check that Facebook members are not choosing these commonly used passwords for their accounts, Stamos revealed, the social network buys passwords hackers are selling on the black market and cross-references them with encrypted passwords used on the site. He described the task as \"computationally heavy\" but said that as a result of the exercise Facebook has been able to alert tens of millions of users that their passwords needed changing because they weren't strong enough. \nFacebook provides a whole bunch of tools for users to make the security on an account nice and tight , ranging from traditional two-factor authentication to identifying faces of friends. But for Stamos, this is only part of the solution when it comes to keeping people safe. \n\"Even though we provide these options, it is our responsibility to think about those people that choose not to use them,\" he said. \nOne way the company does this is to apply machine learning algorithms to Facebook's social graph to establish whether activity on your account is fraudulent. Another concept currently in the works tackles the problem of account recovery. If hackers find their way into your email, it's easy for them to seize your Facebook account too, by choosing the password reset option. Instead, Facebook wants people to allow their close friends to verify an account-recovery request on their behalf. \n\"Usernames and passwords are an idea that come out of 1970s mainframe architectures,\" said Stamos. \"They were not built for 2016.\"",

      "text": "Can Somebody Please Tell Facebook's Algorithm Hillary Lost? \nGil C/Shutterstock.com Increase size \nMy Facebook feed, on election day, was a study in contrasts. There were “Make America Great Again” hats on one side and primary-colored pantsuits on the other. The Hillary Clinton supporters in my feed, many of them women, were especially pronounced. For one thing, there are a lot of them. And many of the Clinton supporters I know clearly felt compelled to share what Nov. 8 meant to them: They often appeared in selfie form, grinning and wearing “I Voted” stickers, ready to watch history affirm what all little girls are told: A woman can be president. A woman will be president. Someday. \nIt hasn’t happened yet. After Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential race, American women are back to wondering whether a woman will be elected president in their lifetimes. And Facebook, resistant as ever to acknowledging its role as the world’s most powerful media company, hasn’t exactly caught up with the news. \nThe result: My Facebook feed this morning is a disorienting mesh of hope and anguish. It’s still filled with so many of those pantsuit selfies—along with the Clinton-supporting dads who took their daughters to the polls to witness history, and even the guy who found in his closet the nearest approximation of a Clintonesque pantsuit to wear to work yesterday—all mixed in with stunned reactions to the outcome of the race. (The Trump supporters I know have been mostly, though not entirely, restrained in their Facebook celebrating.) \nThis is because Facebook doesn’t rely on chronology or newsworthiness to determine what tops your feed. Any given Facebook post is prominent in large part because of how much engagement it has already gotten. (See also: the writer Katie Notopoulos’s case study involving Facebook and overnight oats.) \nSo when a friend’s smiling, pro-Clinton voting selfie gets 83 likes, that image might linger high up in your feed for days—despite her subsequent posts about disappointment with the outcome of the election, or another friend’s post about binge-watching \"Lord of the Rings\" clips as a post-election coping mechanism, or any other newer updates for that matter. (Instagram, too, is a mishmash of pre-election and post-election sentiment this way. Even Twitter, still the most real-timey of social publishing platforms, isn’t strictly chronological anymore either.) \nOf course, Facebook isn’t just where people overwhelmingly go to find the news . It’s also where they go to process major events. In my feed today, for instance, you’ll find Dalai Lama quotes and anti-anxiety gifs aplenty. \nAmong the Clinton supporters I know, there is a palpable sense of despair: I see a friend from high school and her husband wearing all black in protest. I see many, many parents of young children describing the agony of breaking the news of the election to them. I see messages of disbelief, sorrow and anger. People are scared. \nBut then there are the smiling ghosts from yesterday. Scroll past one and two more appear. For every status of mourning, there is another image of yesterday’s hope. They are wearing bright colors and big smiles. And I can’t stop looking at them. Partly because they won’t go away . And maybe they shouldn’t. There they are, staring directly into the camera, challenging us all to remember how things almost went differently, promising that someday they will. More from",

Now that she is the next First Lady, here are 5 things to know about Mrs. Trump. VPC President-elect Donald Trump greets wife Melania after speaking at the New York Hilton Midtown in New York on November 8, 2016. (Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) \nThe historic 2016 presidential election keeps on producing first-ever landmarks, and that includes the next first lady of United States, Melania Trump. \nSo what kind of FLOTUS will she be? According to first-lady historians, here's a hint: Think Jackie Kennedy, not Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama. \n\"In terms of the evolution of the first lady, I see this (Trump) moving us back to the more traditional role,\" says Jean Wahl Harris, who studies the role of first lady at the University of Scranton. \"A very traditional social hostess is something I think she will be comfortable with.\" \nBut she will be expected to be front and center, not shy and retiring like Bess Truman in the 1940s. But Trump was hardly on the campaign trail so what's to stop her from doing the unexpected as first lady? \n\"Starting with Kennedy, the expectations have ratcheted up, it's not just about being a good wife and mother,\" Harris says. \"Americans expect (first ladies) to be a celebrity, to be seen, to support your husband, to have a project that's good for the nation. And we expect to see you.\" \nShe \"will surely rise to the rather rigid strictures of a job whose very existence is something of an anachronism,\" adds Elizabeth Mehren, professor of journalism and expert on first ladies at Boston University. \"Mrs. Trump has signaled that her 'cause' may be cyber-bullying, a safe bet for the mother of a 10-year-old, but less safe for the wife of someone who sends mean tweets at 3 in the morning.\" Facebook Posted!

They married in 2005, and have one son, Barron. \nBarron Trump, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner stand on stage and acknowledge the crowd during Donald Trump's election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) \nFirst to have posed nude: She took it all off for photographers at least twice: The New York Post ran one set of images in July of Trump in her birthday suit in 1995 when she was 25. British GQ ran its own set of images, from 2000, in March, and again online on Tuesday, of Trump sprawled on a fur throw, wearing nothing but jeweled bracelets on her wrists and a handcuff. \nFirst not to speak English as her first language: Her native language is Slovenian but she also speaks four others: English, French, Serbian and German. \nThis fluency could come in handy, as it did for President Kennedy, whose wife spoke French and Spanish. \n\"I see her going back to a Jackie Kennedy model of first lady,\" says Harris. \"She's not going to want to be in the public eye. Jackie Kennedy wanted to protect her children and herself. Melania will be like that, she won't like talking in public.\" \nDouglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, also sees her in the \"mold\" of Jackie Kennedy. \"Somebody who has keen eye on fashion, who doesn’t interfere with policy making in a public way. She will travel and be courted around Europe as someone who is glamorous....There's no advantage for her to get involved in politics in a visceral way.\" \nAs a former fashion model, she can help boost the fortunes of the American fashion industry, the way Mrs. Obama did almost every time she appeared in public. Trump also will be expected to fill the \"oldest job\" of the first lady role, says Lisa Kathleen Graddy, curator at a first ladies exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \nPresident elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania are seen after voting at a polling station. (Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) \n\"The through-line between Martha Washington and Michelle Obama is the role of administration hostess, the public face of the administration,\" Graddy says. \nBut since Trump himself was a mold-breaker, so might be Melania, says Mark Feldstein, a professor of journalism at the University of Maryland. \"I think all bets are off as far as usual expectations and that applies to the first lady as well as Trump himself.\" \nMelania can help soften Trump's tempestuous image, Brinkley said. \"She is going to be seen as the temperancefigure, keeping his temper down to earth,\" he said. \"She'll do fine, she's not likely going to be a pioneering first lady. But being a mom is a big deal and raising her son is going to be all consuming.\" \nAnd she probably can count on Americans to help her, even those who didn't vote for Trump, says veteran Hollywood insider Howard Bragman, founder of Fifteen Minutes Public Relations. \n\"I think people are going to want to give her a chance,\" he said. \"She knows exactly who her husband is and what he is, she'll be a good ear for him, a kinder, gentler one, I would hope. I think people will be more judgmental about him, and they will give her a chance.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "  @07:05PM from the right-and-wrong dept. Max Read makes his case via New York Magazine for how Facebook was the reason for Donald Trump's surprise victory on November 8th . Though, to be fair, \"Facebook\" is called out specifically due to its large online presence, but in reality all the \"large and influential boards and social-media platforms where Americans now congregate to discuss politics\" are to blame. The main reason why has to do with Facebook's \"inability (or refusal) to address the problem of hoax or fake news\" that is spread rampantly and effortlessly across the platform: Fake news is not a problem unique to Facebook, but Facebook's enormous audience, and the mechanisms of distribution on which the site relies -- i.e., the emotionally charged activity of sharing, and the show-me-more-like-this feedback loop of the news feed algorithm -- makes it the only site to support a genuinely lucrative market in which shady publishers arbitrage traffic by enticing people off of Facebook and onto ad-festooned websites, using stories that are alternately made up, incorrect, exaggerated beyond all relationship to truth, or all three. Many got hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of shares, likes, and comments; enough people clicked through to the posts to generate significant profits for their creators. The valiant efforts of Snopes and other debunking organizations were insufficient; Facebook's labyrinthine sharing and privacy settings mean that fact-checks get lost in the shuffle. Often, no one would even need to click on and read the story for the headline itself to become a widely distributed talking point, repeated elsewhere online, or, sometimes, in real life. When roughly 170 million people in North America use Facebook every day and nearly forty-four percent of all adults in the U.S. say they get news from Facebook , the spread of \"fake news\" is all the more detrimental. The problem is that Facebook seems \"insecure about its power, unsure of its purpose, and unclear about what its responsibilities really are.\" Earlier this year, Facebook acted on what was right and wrong by censoring the iconic \"napalm girl\" photograph , later issuing a statement saying \"These are difficult decisions and we don't always get it right.\" Of course, lies and exaggerations have always been central to real political campaigns; Facebook has simply made them easier to spread, and discovered that it suffers no particular market punishment for doing so -- humans seem to have a strong bias toward news that confirms their beliefs, and environments where those beliefs are unlikely to be challenged.",

      "text": "print Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Reuters \nFacebook has produced yet another computer network innovation that will once again floor the $41 billion network tech industry. \nAnd Facebook will again share it with the world for free, putting commercial network tech vendors on notice. (We're looking at you, Cisco). \nThe new innovation, revealed on Tuesday, is something called Backpack and it's a second-generation computer switch, the successor to the one it released last year called the 6-Pack that directly challenged tech made by market leader Cisco (and others, like Juniper). \nThe difference is, the Backpack is way, way faster. \nThe 6-Pack was a 40G switch, which means it could stream 40G worth a data around a data center network. The Backpack is an 100G optical switch, which means it's 2.5 times faster, and using fiber optics (aka light) to move data around instead of the traditional and more limited copper wires. \nThe Backpack is also a companion to the new switch Facebook announced last spring, called Wedge 100 . The Wedge 100 is what's known as a \"top of rack\" switch, that connects a computer rack of servers to the network. The Backpack then connects all the Wedge 100 switches together. In network jargon this is known as a \"network fabric.\" \nFacebook is attempting to build itself a fully 100G data center and these two pieces get it much of the way there, along with the network equipment it announced last week that put the telecom equipment industry on notice. Going on sale in 2017 \nThere are two key thing about this new switch. First, Facebook is turning it over to its game-changing Open Compute Project, which has gained cult-like status in the few years since Facebook launched it. \nFacebook engineer Omar Baldonado LinkedIn/Omar Baldonado \nOCP creates open source hardware, where engineers can freely take hardware designs and work on them together. \nOCP offers designs on racks, servers, storage drives and other hardware. Contract manufactures stand by to build them. OCP has even inspired other internet players to build their own hardware completely from scratch, such as LinkedIn. \nIn the case of Facebook's switches, Facebook went the extra step of arranging for its contract manufacturer, Accton, to mass produce the devices so anyone can buy them. \nAnd Facebook also open sources the software to run the switch, and worked with other network startups to get their software to work on its switches . \nFacebook plans to do all of this for the Backpack, too, Omar Baldonado, a member of Facebook's network engineering team tells us. \n\"We anticipate it will follow same path. Later in 2017, people will be able to get a Backpack. We are working with the software eco-system, too. That's why we are contributing ot OCP,\" he said. Mind-blowing technology \nIn order to create Backpack, Facebook had to work with chip makers and optical materials vendors to do what's never been done before, create special chips and special optical fiber that brings the cost of such switches down. \nThe optical switches on the market today are not typically used in the data center to connect servers together. They are typically used in the \"Backplane,\" the part of a network that stretches between data centers or across cities. \nAnd because they've been targeted for metro-scale networks and beyond, such switches tend to use a lot of power, throw off a lot of heat, and are very expensive. \nFacebook helped design a switch that uses less power and generates less heat, can operate at around 55-degree Celsius, Baldonado says, which has never been done before. Folks in the network industry have told us Facebook's 100G work is \"mind blowing.\" \nTo bring costs down, this switch, like the other OCP switches, is modular, meaning you can pull it apart and swap out parts, using different chips, different network cards and different software. \nAt one point, a former Facebook OCP engineer named Yuval Bachar (who is now working at LinkedIn) declared the a goal that networks should cost as little as $1 per gigabyte. This goal has not been achieved, and Baldonado is the first to admit it. But with this switch and all the other hardware, Facebook is bringing costs down, he says. In this case, even if the switch is still pricey to buy, it will cost less to operate, he says. \nFacebook is leading this charge into faster, cheaper, mind-blowing networks and data centers because one day we will all be using the social network to hang out in virtual reality, in addition to live-streaming more video. \n\"We are now creating more immersive, social, interactive 360 video sorts of experiences and that demands a much more scalable and efficient and quick network,\" he says.

      "text": "Facebook and Twitter Contend With Their Role in Trump's Victory Former employees of both companies are grappling with Facebook's and Twitter's role as a news filter. Sarah Frier November 9, 2016 — 6:53 PM EST November 9, 2016 — 7:36 PM EST \nHow Social Media Impacted the U.S. Election \nAmerica just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it. Facebook Inc. will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. “This is a landmark,” he said. “Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didn’t really have the influence.” In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: “While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.” Online (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company's role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn, today said the company's news feed was responsible for fueling “highly partisan, fact-light media outlets” that propelled Donald Trump's ascension to the presidency. “News feed optimizes for engagement,” Goodlatte wrote. “As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.” In the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: “News feed isn’t perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.” Behind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasize media posts, in favor of posts from friends and family. The company’s public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the \"invention\" of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news. \n“We can’t read everything and check everything,” Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. “So what we’ve done is we’ve allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.” \nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false. Echo chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter Inc. gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. \"I can’t think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,” Wasserman said.

But it hasn’t all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trump's critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitter’s inability to effectively address abuse on its platform -- a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site.\nTwitter’s executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response. “We have the world talking on this thing about the world,” Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. “So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.” \nTwitter, like Facebook, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. One former software engineer, Ben Matasar, posted this tweet: \"For my @twitter alum friends: What did we build?\" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "US elections results: The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem during the campaigns. (Source: Reuters) America just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media. And the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it.\nFacebook Inc will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history. Forty-four percent of American adults get their media through the site, many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree. The proliferation of fake news on Facebook has also been a problem: false stories about the Clinton family committing murder and Huma Abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organisations. Those stories shaped public opinion, said Ed Wasserman, the dean of the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.\nDonald Trump’s Victory Speech: Says Will Make America Great Again US Presidential Elections 2016: Why US Media Needs To Introspect England Dominate Day 1 Of First Test Against India Delhi: Major Fire Breaks Out In Tibetan Market, Guts All 138 Stalls Government Says New Currency Notes In ATMs From November 11 Trump Wins US Elections 2016: Neelam Deo Analysis The Outcome US Presidential Elections 2016: Republican Donald Trump Becomes 45th US President Bigg Boss 10 November 9 Episode Review: Cat Fights And True Friendship Rs 500 & Rs 1000 Illegal: Scuffle At An ATM With People Queuing Up To Withdraw Money Rs 500 & Rs 1000 Currency Notes Now Illegal: People React To Govt’s Decision Long Queues Outside ATMs As Govt Abolishes Rs 500 & Rs 1000 Notes Here What You Can Do With Old Rs 500, Rs 1000 Currency Notes Rs 500, Rs 1000 Will No Longer Be Legal, Says PM Narendra Modi US Presidential Elections Fun Facts Experts & American Voters On US Presidential Election 2016 “This is a landmark,” he said. “Trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public. You had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority. And the media that spoke with authority, the authority that comes after careful fact checking, didn’t really have the influence.”\nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said: “While Facebook played a part in this election, it was just one of many ways people received their information – and was one of the many ways people connected with their leaders, engaged in the political process and shared their views.”\nOnline (on Facebook, of course), current and former employees debated the company’s role as an influencer. Bobby Goodlatte, a Facebook product designer from 2008 to 2012, according to his LinkedIn , today said the company’s news feed was responsible for fueling “highly partisan, fact-light media outlets” that propelled Donald Trump’s ascension to the presidency. “News feed optimizes for engagement,” Goodlatte wrote. “As we’ve learned in this election, bullshit is highly engaging.”\nIn the past, Facebook has pushed back publicly against these concerns with a simple premise: News feed is just an amplification of what people would experience in a world without it. In response to Goodlatte, Andrew Bosworth, a veteran Facebook executive who helped create news feed, defended the company: “News feed isn’t perfect but it is at least or more diverse than the alternatives which dominated consumption in the late nineties.”\nAlso read: Trump’s election victory ignites fears over US encryption, surveillance policy\nBehind the scenes, Facebook has been studying and analyzing its effect on news consumption. The issue was tackled at high-level meetings this summer, leading to a revision of priorities for news feed to de-emphasise media posts, in favour of posts from friends and family.\nThe company’s public relations department has worked to frame Facebook as a technology company rather than a media company, celebrating the “invention” of news feed on its 10-year anniversary, for example. Meanwhile, Facebook intensified its analysis of its role in creating an echo chamber and spreading fake news.\n“We can’t read everything and check everything,” Adam Mosseri, the head of news feed, said in an August interview. “So what we’ve done is we’ve allowed people to mark things as false. We rely heavily on the community to report content.”\nOf course, if false news is spreading in communities that want to believe it, few will mark it as false.\nEcho chambers on Facebook may have helped Trump win, but Twitter Inc gave him a way to reach American voters constantly and without an editor. Clinton also had her own Facebook and Twitter accounts, but Trump, with almost 14 million followers on the site, would often start his own news cycles with deeply opinionated and often incendiary posts. “I can’t think of another instance, in commercial or political communication, where Twitter was used as effectively,” Wasserman said.\nRead more: US election results: Five expected actions of ‘President Donald Trump’\nTwitter’s shares rose 4.1 percent Wednesday, boosted by investor recognition of its role in the election outcome. But it hasn’t all been good for the company. As Trump rose on the platform, so did a set of racist, misogynist harassers supporting him, and that caused a major headache for the company. These trolls, not officially endorsed by the campaign, would regularly attack Trump’s critics, in many cases causing Twitter users to feel unsafe. The clashes highlighted Twitter’s inability to effectively address abuse on its platform — a problem that was one reason The Walt Disney Company walked away from a potential bid for the social media site.\nTwitter’s executives, when asked about these issues during the election, said that the site is a place for all ideas. If false information or hateful rhetoric surfaces, others on the site will tweet in response. “We have the world talking on this thing about the world,” Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in an interview earlier this year. “So we see every spectrum of idea and conversation.”\nTwitter, like Facebook, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. One former software engineer, Ben Matasar, posted this tweet: “For my @twitter alum friends: What did we build?”",

      "text": "Dane Chinnery is the first victim to be named (Picture: Facebook) The first victim of the Croydon tram crash which killed seven and injured 50 has been named as Dane Chinnery.\nHe died when a tram derailed and overturned early yesterday morning.\nWitnesses described how they believed the driver may have ‘blacked out’ while others said that one of the victims was decapitated.\nThe driver, a 42-year-old man from Beckenham, has been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.\nTributes have been paid to him online.\nOne said: ‘Dane is the funniest boy i’ve ever met in my life. If anyone ever needed anything he’d be there doing all he can to help. Rest up bro, love you.’\nThe tram derailed yesterday morning (Picture: Jim Bennett) \nAnother said: ‘All my prayers and thoughts to Dane Chinnery’s family through these tough times, was a great lad full of banter and a die hard palace fan. May he rest in peace.’\nRui De Sa said: ‘One man beside me was screaming and had his arm trapped outside the tram as it skidded along on its side.\n‘The man next to him had his whole head out of the tram crushed underneath. I can’t get that image out of my mind.’\nThe driver of a tram that derailed killing at least seven people is being questioned by police amid suggestions it failed to brake before taking a corner at speed.\nInvestigators said the vehicle was travelling at a ‘significantly higher speed than is permitted’ and are probing whether the driver may have fallen asleep.\nSeven people died in the crash (Picture: PA) More than 50 people were injured when the tram left tracks and flipped on its side as it travelled through Croydon, south London, during the morning rush hour on Wednesday.\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan, who visited the scene on Wednesday, warned the death toll ‘may well increase’.\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) said forensics teams are expected to stay at the crash site until Thursday evening at the earliest and identifying the dead may be a ‘complex and lengthy process’.\nThe tram was operating from New Addington to Wimbledon via Croydon when the accident happened at 6.10am.\nOne witness described seeing a man get decapitated (Picture: Getty) Investigators are looking into whether the driver may have fallen asleep (Picture: Reuters) Scenes in the wake of the crash were described as ‘total carnage’ and ‘like something out of a film’ after the two-carriage tram tipped over in heavy rain next to an underpass.\nSurvivors rescued from the wreckage said they recalled the tram failing to brake in its usual place at a bend on the track after speeding up. One said the driver told them he thought he had ‘blacked out’.\nRoyal Navy veteran Kevin Snow, 57, was on his way to work in central London when the busy service overturned.\nMartin Bamford who was on the tram (Picture: National) The father-of-seven from Barnsley, south Yorkshire, said the service, which he had been using regularly while working in London, failed to slow down at its usual point coming out of a tunnel between the Lloyd Park and Sandilands stops.\nHe told the Press Association: ‘Usually as you come out the tunnel you feel the brakes, but I didn’t seem to at all. I thought, he should be braking in a minute.\n‘The next thing I knew we were on our side. Everyone was screaming and shouting, a lot of people were injured – lots couldn’t move.’\nMore than 50 people were injured (Picture: PA) He said the tram slid for between eight and 10 seconds before coming to a halt.\nMartin Bamford, 30, from Croydon, said he recalled the tram ‘speeding up’, adding: ‘Everyone just literally went flying.’\nSpeaking outside Croydon University Hospital, where he is being treated for fractured or broken ribs, he said people were screaming and there was ‘blood everywhere’, describing the scene as ‘like something out of a film’.\nAsked what he had seen he added: ‘There was a woman that was on top of me … I don’t think she made it at all. She wasn’t responsive. There was blood everywhere.’\nAsked about the driver, he said: ‘I asked him if he was okay. He said “yeah”. I said to him “what happened?” He said he thinks he blacked out.’\nPeople on the tram said it failed to slow down (Picture: BBC) The 42-year-old man, from Beckenham, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and taken into custody for questioning.\nThe tragedy is being probed by BTP and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB).\nBTP assistant chief constable Robin Smith said they were investigating whether the driver of the Wimbledon-bound tram fell asleep at the wheel, alongside ‘a number of factors’.\nInitial findings of the RAIB show that the tram came off the tracks as it was negotiating a ‘sharp, left-hand curve’ with a speed limit of 12mph.\nAn RAIB spokesman said: ‘Initial indications suggest that the tram was travelling at a significantly higher speed than is permitted.’",

      "text": "J enny always uses Facebook carefully. She knows the company probably knows more about her than most of her friends – the location settings might show she spent time in hospital last week, for instance – but she’s careful with what she posts. Her WhatsApp is similar. Nothing too sensitive. But the app does have access to her phone contacts, so could see the number of her counsellor, and of the addiction clinic she’s been in touch with. If those two sets of data were put side by side, Jenny’s personal, private information suddenly wouldn’t seem quite so private.\nThat’s the worry that many could be facing as a result of Facebook’s decision to co-opt some of the data of WhatsApp customers . It’s a worry I share. I don’t think people have been given enough information about what Facebook plans to do with WhatsApp users’ data, and that’s left people concerned about how extensive the data sharing could be. And I don’t think users have been given enough control over what’s happening.\nFacebook 'pauses' WhatsApp data sharing after ICO intervention Read more \nMy office has asked both companies to pause what they’re doing, which they have , and we’ve asked them to commit to doing things differently, which so far they have not.\nConsumers are protected by the law. The Data Protection Act requires businesses to use people’s information fairly, and in this case that means telling them what is happening. What’s more, we’re clear that WhatsApp needs to get its users’ permission to use the data in some of the ways it plans to, and the “are you happy with our new terms and conditions?” option it has taken so far doesn’t do that.\nClearly our work here is ongoing. As it stands, unless you opt out of data sharing within the first 30 days, the only option if you’re not happy is to delete your account. As a Canadian living in Cheshire who uses WhatsApp to stay in touch with my kids, I know from personal experience how impractical that is.\nWe all rely on digital services for important parts of our lives. But these apps create rich portraits of who we are, even when we are careful what we post, and the companies have legal responsibilities to treat that data with proper care and respect.\nThere’s always a concern when personal data becomes an asset to be bought and sold\n\nOf course we could all be more careful ourselves. Most of us would benefit from a quick audit of what access we’re giving to our apps: are location settings turned on? Does it really need access to our contacts? Using the highest privacy settings when you first create a profile, then gradually adjusting them as you feel comfortable is always a good rule of thumb.\nIn some cases we’re happy to accept making information available. We can appreciate that to get a good service – to get a free service – we sometimes have to share our data. That’s our entry fee, and so long as it’s clear what information is being gathered, and what it’s being used for, then that’s fine.\nBut what about Jenny’s problem? We might be happy with the data deal we’ve agreed with one service, happy with the deal with a second, but not happy when the two services come together.\nThis is a growing problem. There’s a clear trend of technology companies buying up smaller services specifically to access their customers’ information. Social media companies are of particular value here. There’s always a concern when personal data becomes an asset to be bought and sold. That concern is greater still when the value of a merger is based primarily on how a company thinks they can match up customer details they’re buying with customer details they hold themselves.\nDon’t let WhatsApp nudge you into sharing your data with Facebook | John Naughton Read more \nThe difficulty with digital services is that because we’re so invested in them, we become dependent on a service that we can’t always easily extricate ourselves from. As big companies buy up their competitors, are there realistic alternative services out there? And even if I can find an alternative messaging service to WhatsApp, that only works for me if my friends and family move service too. In those situations, we need to have better protections for consumers.\nAnd that’s just the consumer angle. Do these deals cause ripples of concern among diplomats and politicians, who are said to rely on tools like WhatsApp ?\nIt’s a problem that overlaps data protection and competition law. We need to start thinking more about the obligations that follow personal data, and how people are being protected. If a company makes a promise, then that promise needs to be honoured, irrespective of corporate manoeuvres.\nA successful digital economy is important to us all. The economy wants the jobs it brings, the companies want the profits it offers, and we all want the services that make our lives easier. But the whole building begins to crumble if the foundations aren’t secure. If people feel they are losing control of information that profiles entire aspects of their lives, that should be a very real concern.",

      "text": "Facebook’s Workplace chat platform for businesses just got a huge boost.\nSingapore’s civil service is adopting the platform for all 143,000 of its public servants by March 2017. It’s the first civil service in the world to use Facebook’s business-focused chat platform, according to Peter Ong, the head of Singapore’s civil service.\nTo get an idea of how big this is, if Singapore’s entire civil service indeed starts using Workplace, it would represent about 11% of Slack’s paid user base. That’s rapid progress for Facebook’s product that was just launched a month ago.\nWorkplace charges $1 per user per month for groups larger than 10,000 people, which suggests $1.7 million in revenue for Facebook each year from the Singapore deal. What’s more, the city-state’s civil service grows at a rate of 2.5% annually, according to the government , which means an additional 2,860 accounts per year for Workplace.\nOng said in a speech at an awards ceremony that 5,300 civil servants already use Facebook’s messaging app as part of its first phase of adoption, which started in October. The platform is apparently a hit: Some 82% of civil servants who activated their accounts are active weekly users, Ong said. The number of emails has gone down—replaced by Workplace posts—and there is an “explosion of activity” as workers collaborate more actively than before, he said.\n“Wouldn’t it be amazing,” Ong noted, “that 143,000 people can form sub-groups, go onto one, whole-of-government platform to share ideas, collaborate, and find out about one another?”\nSingapore’s civil service is in the midst of another sweeping technology change: it’s removing internet access from workers’ computers to reduce hacking risks. Over 100,000 computers used by the civil service will not have direct internet access by next May. It’s unclear, then, whether Workplace will be accessed solely on workers’ mobile devices, which are allowed to connect to the internet. We’ve asked the civil service to clarify this point.\nThe work-messaging scene is hot right now. Microsoft entered the market with its Teams product earlier this month, and Slack duly played the role of the rebellious upstart by taunting it with a full-page ad in the New York Times.\nNabbing Singapore’s government as a Workplace customer is a coup for Facebook, and it puts Microsoft, with its prowess in selling enterprise software to governments and corporations, on notice. And Slack, which first made enterprise chat cool, certainly has its work cut out for it.",
