      "text": "By: BenevolentAI via PR Newswire   06:03 AM EST British Artificial Intelligence Firm Announces Exclusive License Agreement with Janssen for Clinical Stage Drug Candidates, Facilitated by Johnson & Johnson Innovation \nLONDON , November 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- \nBenevolentAI, a leading British artificial intelligence (\"AI\") company today announced significant progress in one of its key ambitions; to improve and innovate the drug development process using AI technology and provide the best medicines to the right patients. BenevolentAI has signed an exclusive license for a series of novel clinical stage drug candidates with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (\"Janssen\"), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The agreement was facilitated by the Johnson & Johnson Innovation Centre in London . \nBenevolentAI has acquired a license to a select number of novel clinical stage drug candidates and their extensive related portfolio of patents. BenevolentAI scientists leveraged the AI technology to evaluate the potential of these small molecule compounds. The results indicate that there is strong promise to develop new medicines for hard to treat diseases. \nUnder the terms of the license agreement, BenevolentAI will have the sole right to develop, manufacture and commercialise these novel drug candidates in all indications and in all territories. This agreement will enable BenevolentAI to accelerate its development pipeline and use its unique artificial intelligence technology to explore and provide a rich source of clinical data. BenevolentAI intends to begin late stage Phase IIb clinical trials in mid 2017. Financial terms were not disclosed. \nJackie Hunter , Board Director of BenevolentAI and CEO of BenevolentAI Bio, commented: \n\"We are delighted to have acquired rights to these compounds under a license agreement from Janssen. The agreement adds further depth to our clinical and pre-clinical development pipeline and marks a very exciting time for the role of artificial intelligence to benefit scientific discovery and humanity. The compounds come with a wealth of clinical and biological data that enables BenevolentAI to have further insights into the biology of diseases. Securing these novel clinical drug candidates perfectly aligns with our strategy of developing first-in-class and best-in-class stratified medicines to help patients with high unmet needs.\" \nSOURCE BenevolentAI Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

In psoriasis, the skin grows fast and causes a build-up of red, thick white, or silvery patches. It modifies the normal cell cycle of the skin such that new cells move to the surface of the skin quickly to form patches called plaques. These plaques are commonly found on the knees, elbows, scalp, hand and feet. The condition mostly occurs among adults (18 years-35 years), but can also be seen in adolescents (12 years-18 years) and children (under 10 years).\nPsoriasis is more prevalent among Caucasians compared to African-Americans. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) document of 2015, the global prevalence of psoriasis is approximately 2%-3%. However, it is approximately 4.6% in developed countries. In addition, the risk of an individual getting diagnosed with psoriasis is 41% if both parents have psoriasis, 14% in case one parent is affected, and 6% if a sibling has psoriasis.\nBrowse More Detailed Information about Global Systemic Psoriasis Therapeutics Market Research Report @ http://www.360marketupdates.com/10292810\nThe report provides a basic overview of the Systemic Psoriasis Therapeutics Market 2016-2020 including definitions, classifications, applications and market Sales chain structure.

      "title": "Johnson & Johnson Back At It Again? In Discussions To Acquire Actelion Ltd.",
      "text": "Johnson & Johnson Back At It Again? In Discussions To Acquire Actelion Ltd. Nov.26.16 Summary \nActelion is a Swiss pharmaceutical company that has captured the eye of Johnson & Johnson. \nActelion features a portfolio with drug offerings that still have room to expand in the global market. \nJohnson & Johnson would benefit from an acquisition as it looks to hedge against the risk of biosimilars drawing revenue from its blockbuster drug Remicade. \nJohnson & Johnson has the cash and credit resources to seamlessly pull off such a deal. Early Friday morning, it became public that Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) has approached Switzerland based biotech company Actelion Ltd. ( OTCPK:ALIOY ). Actelion is one of Europe's largest biotech pharmaceutical companies, currently valued with a market cap of just under $17B. It will generate revenues of about $2-2.5B in fiscal year 2016. Click to enlarge Source: Google finance Who is Actelion Ltd.? The Swiss pharmaceutical company operates its US operations out of San Francisco, CA, but is headquartered in Switzerland. Its product portfolio is headlined by a pair of drugs used to treat Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) - which is a hypertension disorder that causes the artery walls in the lungs to tighten and stiffen. Click to enlarge Click to enlarge Just under 80% of sales for Actelion come from Opsumit and Tracleer. These two drugs are the likely primary reason for Johnson & Johnson's interest in acquiring Actelion. Actelion launched Uptravi in the US in January of 2016, which has resulted in a strong first half of fiscal year 2016. Operating income is up 11% over last year and product portfolio sales are up 13% due in large part to the Uptravi US launch. Actelion is also in late stage trials for numerous other drugs that provide potential portfolio diversity if final approvals are met. These late stage drugs would offer potential treatments for Multiple Sclerosis , Pediatric PAH , Eisenmenger Syndrome , and C.Diff.Colitis . Click to enlarge How would Johnson & Johnson benefit from a deal? In Actelion, Johnson & Johnson would be receiving a shot in the arm to its pharmaceutical division. Actelion's Opsumit and Uptravi still have room to grow as they are newer to the US and still not fully introduced globally. Tracleer is steady, although it is being cannibalized by Opsumit. The pipeline is filled with a handful of late stage projects that would further bolster growth upon approvals. In addition to the 4 drugs in Phase III trials, another 7 are in Phase II development at this time. Johnson & Johnson's pharma division has represented an increasing portion of company wide revenues over time. The pharma division now represents more than 40% of revenues, compared to its consumer and medical device divisions. Inside the pharma division a huge portion of revenues are made up of its main blockbuster drug Remicade. Source: Johnson & Johnson As illustrated above, Johnson & Johnson is in the process of diversifying its revenues to protect itself as biosimilars to Remicade are introduced into the market. The potential acquisition of Actelion is another step in that direction. How would Johnson & Johnson get it done? Johnson & Johnson is sitting on a mountain of cash of over $40B. Assuming Johnson & Johnson were to acquire Actelion for around $20-$21B - which would represent a 20% premium to its current market cap - Johnson & Johnson could fund the deal entirely in cash. This isn't likely as Johnson & Johnson probably wouldn't want to eat into its cash pile so aggressively. This is especially true as Johnson & Johnson would need to bring in cash from offshore, which, until a repatriation law is passed, would result in heavy federal taxes. A more likely method would be to partially fund the deal with debt since Johnson & Johnson is among the select few companies with a AAA credit rating. Debt could be raised for the deal at little to no interest. Conclusion Actelion is an interesting mix to the fold as Johnson & Johnson continues to build its pharmaceutical division and buffer itself from the loss of revenue from Remicade biosimilars. While it would be a huge deal for any company, few companies are as financially sound and well managed as Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson possesses the capital resources to pull off such a deal in a way that wouldn't negatively affect its balance sheet and would enhance its core earnings power moving forward.

(Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Safe Kids Worldwide) Jason Kempin Previous Next \nJohnson & Johnson was hit with a $1 billion penalty by a Texas jury after the company was found responsible for hiding problems with hip implants. \nA federal jury found the major pharmaceutical company responsible and awarded $30 million in actual damages for the six plaintiffs along with $1 billion in punitive damages, Bloomberg reported . \nThe company denied any wrongdoing and plans to appeal, according to the International Business Times . \nAbout 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Johnson & Johnson after problems occurred with Pinnacle hip replacements. Patients have said the metal-on-metal hip replacements causes metal poisoning. The lawsuit claimed Johnson & Johnson knew about the problems but pushed sales for profit, according to Bloomberg. \nThe company's DePay unit, which makes the hips issued a statement saying the companies plan to appeal the decision. \n“We have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products, and our goal is to create medical innovations that help people live more active and comfortable lives,” said Mindy Tinsley, spokesperson for DePuy. “DePuy acted appropriately and responsibly in the design and testing of ULTAMET Metal-on-Metal, and the product is backed by a strong track record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain.” ",
