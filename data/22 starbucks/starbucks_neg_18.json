      "text": "The culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It’s always Starbucks, isn’t it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the “Christ” out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is “ Trump ” so that she will have to call out “Trump, party of three!”\nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops.\nThe company’s current foray into the headlines comes from several Trump-related incidents in stores over the past couple of weeks. On Nov. 16, a video of Miami real estate remodeler David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks employee who he claimed refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter went viral. (A witness said that Sanguesa got angry that his coffee order took too long.) “We want nothing to do with you,” he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. “You’re trash.”\nTwo days later, 29-year-old Timothy Treadstone, whose Twitter handle is @bakedalaska, posted a video of Starbucks employees allegedly calling the police on a man who insisted that baristas write “Trump” on his cup. Operation #TrumpCup was born: Treadstone encouraged Trump supporters to go to Starbucks, give their name as Trump, and take video if the barista refused to use the name.\n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone told The Washington Post. “Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.”\nThe First Amendment protects your right to speech and expression without government interference. But it does not protect against interference by private businesses, such as Starbucks. Besides, taking customers’ names is not even official company policy. It’s “a fun ritual in our stores,” said spokesman Reggie Borges, who said that Starbucks does not require employees to call out names.\nSnowflakes, Santa, Starbucks: Coffee chain turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs Tribune news services Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about...\nInstead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about...\n(Tribune news services) The movement is an “attempt to troll (Starbucks’) famously liberal baristas into being hypocritical in some fashion: to refuse to serve a customer in the same way that some opponents of same-sex marriage want to refuse service to gay couples,” said Erik Owens, interim director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College.\n#TrumpCup is a spinoff of a movement called #MerryChristmasStarbucks, which Joshua Feuerstein, an evangelical social-media personality, started in 2015 when Starbucks released a minimalist red cup that people criticized for being too plain — a design that Starbucks intended as a blank-slate holiday celebration for all faiths.\n“I felt as though a point needed to be made that we as Americans are tired of political correctness and the cultural cleansing of anything related to Jesus (i.e. Christmas),” Feuerstein wrote in an email.\nIn a video, he encouraged his followers to go to Starbucks and give their names as Merry Christmas, so that baristas would write it on the cup. Feuerstein’s video alleged that Starbucks employees are instructed not to say “Merry Christmas.” Borges denied that: “Our baristas are not provided a script or a policy around greeting customers,” he said.\nStarbucks rolls out 'unity' cup ahead of Election Day Tribune news services One week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it says is meant to be \"a symbol of unity.\"\nThe green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz calls it \"a divisive time in our country\" and...\nOne week before Election Day, Starbucks has unveiled a new cup in the U.S. that it says is meant to be \"a symbol of unity.\"\nThe green cup features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz calls it \"a divisive time in our country\" and...\n(Tribune news services) The movement caught on, and even President-elect Donald Trump, then one of 14 candidates in the Republican primary field, jumped into the fray.\n“That’s the end of that lease,” he said at a rally, referring to the Starbucks in Trump Tower. “If I become president, we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again, that I can tell you.”\nIronically, instead of boycotting the business, many of the Starbucks-related social-media movements involve mobilizing people to actually spend money at a company whose views they presumably disagree with. Feuerstein said that his followers “flooded Starbucks to participate” in #MerryChristmasStarbucks. (He did not answer a question asking whether his message outweighed the company’s potential financial gain.) Treadstone was fine with spending money there: “This was never meant to be a boycott,” he told The Washington Post of his call to arms. “I love Starbucks.”\nAs many have pointed out on social media, the people who are offended by Starbucks cups are often the same people who accuse their political rivals of being too sensitive about things like the Confederate flag.\n“It’s a transparent attempt to stir up false conflict in order to rally a certain subset of Christians against so-called liberal culture,” Owens said.\nStarbucks’ holiday cups have often featured nondenominational holiday symbols, such as snowmen and stars. Those images have been politicized too: In 2011, the company was accused of featuring a nutcracker that looked like the Guy Fawkes mask, then a symbol of Occupy Wall Street . Starbucks said it was a coincidence.\nAnd it is not the only company to stick to bland seasonal greetings. Last year’s McDonald’s cup was purple (!) with an image of a wreath and the phrase “Welcome home.” This year’s design features a Christmas tree, as does the Dunkin’ Donuts cup.\nThe Starbucks design is a lot spiffier this year. Inspired by customers who drew on last year’s plain red cups, the company has released elaborate but secular designs — birch trees, snowflakes, strings of holiday lights and Santa with his sleigh.\n“It would have been difficult for us to ignore the feedback from last year, and we take it in stride, both positive and negative,” Borges said.\nMaybe that is why a promotional video features a cup with a drawing of Jesus in the manger — a design that does not appear on any cups in stores. Still, Feuerstein and others seem pleased with the change.\n“Looks like the American people have been heard,” Feuerstein said. “And we not only saved Christmas, we elected Donald Trump as our next president and saved the country!”\nThe idea that something as simple as a Starbucks cup could either save or ruin Christmas would have seemed absurd for much of the company’s history. In the early days, Starbucks was almost snooty, serving espresso to people who were too good for regular drip coffee. It was distinctly Left Coast. Not to mention, it required Americans to learn Italian: The country struggled with words like doppio, venti and macchiato.\nToday, Starbucks has more than 12,000 shops in the United States, and 80 percent of the country lives less than 20 miles from a grande eggnog latte.\n“Starbucks has a broader target, based on the ubiquity of the brand,” said Derek Rucker, a marketing professor at Northwestern University. “With that broader target, you’re more likely to get difference of opinion.”\nPart of the reason Starbucks is a frequent target is because its chief executive, Howard Schultz , is outspoken about his politics. In 2013, he requested that customers not bring guns to his stores, even in states where “open carry” is permitted. He launched “Race Together,” a widely mocked attempt to start a conversation about race in stores. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. And just before the election, Starbucks released a green cup with an illustration of more than 100 people drawn with one continuous line — “a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,” Schultz said in a news release. People thought it was the holiday cup, and a mass freakout ensued. Schultz, by the way, was raised Jewish.\nBut other companies headed by Democrat-endorsing chief executives have not found themselves in the cross hairs nearly as much. Calls for Republicans to boycott Netflix and Costco did not take off the way that Starbucks protests have. This may be because Starbucks’ history of these types of protests builds upon itself, making the brand a symbolic target for right-wing demonstrators.\n“The stage has almost been set, for not only consumers, but also media to be sensitive to what Starbucks has done, perhaps more than other brands,” Rucker said.\nIt may also have something to do with consumers’ relationship with the brand.\n“Many of us go to the same coffee shop every day, so when there’s a violation, it’s not so easily overlooked,” Rucker said. Potentially, customers are “more vested in their experience there.”\nCoffee is a ritual, and when it gets political, it is personal. After all, your name is on the cup — except when it’s Trump’s name instead.\nWashington Post\nMaura Judkis covers culture, food, and the arts for The Washington Post.

You were like -- \"it will work.\" This is a true story for his secretary of defense Donald trump has chose an retired marine general whose nickname is \"mad dog.\" So sleep well, America. Mad dog's got it all covered. [laughter] mad dog, no, no. ANDY: There's a crisis, what do we need? A mad dog. CONAN: A mad dog. This will take some finesse. ANDY: Yes. CONAN: Mitt Romney is having a hard time. Mitt Romney is being mocked by many Republicans for going to a fancy French dinner with Donald trump. Yeah. Also not helping that afterwards Romney let trump get to third base. That's the part that people don't like. Trump paid. What are you going to do, you know? ANDY: Yeah. CONAN: Very expensive. Sources say Donald trump's daughter ivanka will take on many of the duties normally associated with the first lady. Yeah. This was at the recommendation of trump's new surgeon general Dr. Freud.

      "text": "0 \nAmerica may run on Dunkin’, as the slogan goes, but according to an article in The Battalion , Texas A&M University runs on Starbucks. In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nA recent story in the school’s student newspaper examining the increased intake of campus caffeine consumption around finals week found that the university’s three Starbucks locations sell 119 gallons of coffee a day. That’s the equivalent of 1,270 cups of tall-sized (12 ounce) cups of coffee. \nThe Battalion even made an infographic out of their findings: The Battalion. \nAssistant director of Chartwells dining services Ben Walters said that number places A&M’s Starbucks locations first in revenue among college campus spots in the country. \n“At the Hullabaloo location we do about 700 transactions a day,” Walters told The Battalion. “At Starbucks Evans, they do close to 2,000 and the Corps store being close to 1,000.” More: Starbucks: Schultz to step down as CEO, focus on innovation \nAnd according to Walters, A&M students are consuming more and more caffeine as finals week draws near. \n“We’re seeing more of, ‘I’ll have drip coffee with shots of espresso’ or, ‘Iced coffee with espresso in it.’ We’re constantly having people ask us how to get more caffeine,” he said. More: Austin among top 10 ‘cities for coffee fanatics’ \nRecently, Texas A&M health researchers released an infographic that listed eight reasons to quit drinking coffee. Among the reasons were increased stress hormones, which may not help when you’re cramming for that biology final. \nBut, no matter how much coffee Texas A&M students drink, Austinites can rest assured that they still live in Texas’ most caffeinated city (at least, according to WalletHub). \n",

      "text": "Home News Starbucks, Schultz Foundations Give $2 Million to Address... Starbucks, Schultz Foundations Give $2 Million to Address Homelessness December 3, 2016 \nThe Starbucks and Schultz Family foundations have announced gifts and commitments totaling more than $2 million to Mary's Place in Seattle in support of the organization’s annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign. \nFollowing a 20 percent jump in Seattle's homeless count last year, families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets or in cars and parks across the city. In addition to a $1 million gift, the Starbucks Foundation will match up to $1 million in donations to the organization made by Starbucks customers in King County during the month of December and will commit an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits working to connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs and other critical services. \nStarbucks founder Howard Schultz and his wife, Sherri, also will commit $1 million to the organization through the Schultz Family Foundation to help expand its shelter capacity and support its efforts to transition more of the estimated five hundred unsheltered families in Seattle into permanent housing. \n\"No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,\" said Microsoft president Brad Smith in announcing a pledge of $1 million to the campaign. \"We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.\"",

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Dec 2, 2016 7:12 PM \n[CHICAGO] After turning Starbucks Corp into the world's largest coffee chain, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will hand the reins to a lieutenant who could solidify its role as a technology company. \nKevin Johnson, a 33-year veteran of the tech industry who became Starbucks' chief operating officer last year, will take the helm from Schultz on April 3. \nThe move is a nod to the company's growing reputation for innovation: It introduced the world's first successful mobile-payment service, beating out the likes of Apple Inc and Google Inc, and gets an increasingly large portion of its revenue from that source. \nMr Schultz will keep the role of executive chairman at Starbucks, focusing on the rollout of its upscale Reserve brand. \n\"I'm not leaving the company,\" Mr Schultz, 63, said on a conference call after the change was announced Thursday. \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge.\" \nMr Johnson, who joined the board in 2009, was tapped for the operating chief job after Troy Alstead went on sabbatical. \nMr Johnson, 56, previously worked at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc. \nIn 2008, he was named to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he served under presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama. \nThe CEO change jarred investors, who briefly sent the shares down as much as 12 per cent, though Mr Johnson was seen as a possible successor since he took the No 2 job last year. \nFor many shareholders and customers, Mr Schultz has embodied Starbucks. Over the past three decades, he turned much of the world into coffee aficionados, bringing lattes and mochas to 70 countries. And he's used the company to pursue social causes - occasionally clumsily - such as racial strife and sustainability. \nMr Schultz will focus on expanding Starbucks' Reserve Roasteries, a chain of massive coffee houses that provide tastings and other experiences, as well as new Reserve retail stores. \nThe executive has been working to position the Reserve name as Starbucks' new higher-end brand. Mr Schultz also will continue the company's \"social impact\" efforts. \nAs CEO, he's already pushed to open stores in low-income areas and supported gay marriage. It hasn't always gone smoothly. Mr Schultz's idea for employees to discuss race relations with customers was criticised as ham-fisted. \nInvestors weren't anticipating Mr Schultz's departure as CEO so soon, though having both executives focus on different parts of the company could have benefits, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. \n\"The timing of this is a surprise,\" she said. \n\"I do think the 'divide and conquer' strategy is probably good for the company long-term.\" \nStarbucks' digital and technology prowess has put it ahead of its peers, allowing it to serve more customers faster. Same-store sales rose five per cent in the Americas region in the most recent quarter. Mobile payments accounted for about 25 per cent of US transactions in that period. \nStarbucks built on its tech leadership with an order-ahead feature, which lets customers select and pay for drinks in advance. They then can pick up the beverages at a shop without waiting in line. \nSince Mr Johnson became operating chief, Starbucks has rolled out mobile ordering across the US and even tested delivery. The Seattle-based company also is boosting spending on digital ventures, including taking its app and rewards platform to countries such as China. \nThough shares of Starbucks tumbled immediately after the announcement, they recovered some of that ground. The stock was down 2.4 per cent in Germany to the equivalent of US$57.13 in trading before US markets opened on Friday. \nThis isn't Mr Schultz's first retirement as CEO. After serving in the job from 1987 to 2000 - punctuated by an initial public offering in 1992 - he stepped down in 2000. But Mr Schultz returned in 2008 after Starbucks faltered. The company had opened too many locations too quickly and got hit by the financial crisis. Profit plunged. \nMr Schultz put Starbucks back on firmer footing. \n\"The difference between then and now couldn't be greater,\" he said on Thursday. \n\"In 2007-2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies and Starbucks was not immune.\" \nThe company now has the \"strongest leadership team in history,\" he said. \nIt's been speculated that Mr Schultz might make a run for US president, though he's repeatedly said he has no intention of doing so. \nWhile speaking at a conference in New York last month, Mr Schultz said he wouldn't serve as part of President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet. He also denied rumors of running for president last year in a New York Times opinion piece. \nIt's probably too early to tell if Mr Schultz has designs on the White House, Ms Bartashus said. \n\"Certainly if he is interested in a political career, he has the next 2 1/2 years to sow those seeds,\" she said. \n\"A lot will depend on the first half of the Trump administration.\" \nBLOOMBERG ",

      "text": "acquisition , KPIs , Loyalty , pitfalls , Rewards , ROI , Starbucks , Webinar \nThe banking industry lives and dies by relationships. Establishing a mutually beneficial customer-bank relationship is fundamental to everything banks do, so it’s no surprise that so many financial institutions have turned to loyalty programs to help them deepen customer relationships. \nAmericans have embraced loyalty programs, establishing 3.3 billion memberships in 2015, according to Colloquy . A third of bank customers participate in at least one financial institution loyalty program, research by Accenture indicates. However, multiple studies indicate many financial institution loyalty programs aren’t working optimally — for banks or customers. \nWhile a majority of financial institution loyalty program members say good deals inspire them to join, just slightly more than half of all FI rewards programs are successful at retaining customers, Accenture says. Just 13 percent of loyalty program administrators are completely satisfied with their programs, and 15 percent are either somewhat or completely unsatisfied, according to a Forrester Research poll. Is it time for a change? \nWhen a loyalty program isn’t working for customers or the financial institution, it’s in everyone’s best interest to fix what’s broken. However, change is rarely easy. It can be difficult to know how much or how little to revise. Webinar: How Loyalty Programs Influence the Customer Journey December 13, 2016 at 12 pm central – Register today ! \nSudden, sweeping changes can alienate even the most engaged customers — witness what Starbucks went through earlier this year when it changed its rewards program. Too little change can mean continuing to fall short of program goals. \nBefore making any decisions to alter a loyalty program, financial institutions must answer these questions: Is the program working at all? If so, what’s working and what’s not? Do current results fall short of justifying current investment? Is additional investment likely to improve things? Does the program align with the financial institution’s brand identity and objectives? What are the key performance indicators by which you measure ROI of your loyalty program? Do they need to change, too? What is the budget for changes/revisions? Could this program be saved/revived with minor changes, or does it need a complete overhaul? Mandatory first steps \nAssessing program performance against KPIs is mandatory. Clearly defined objectives help marketing departments assess ROI, and illustrate to key decision-makers the program’s vision. However, if your program is failing to meet KPIs, the program itself might not be the only thing that needs revision. You should also assess how realistic your objectives actually are. \nFor example, acquiring new customers is a key objective for 66 percent of bank loyalty program managers, Forrester’s research tells us. Yet experience consistently shows that quality loyalty programs are far more valuable as a tool to deepen engagement and elevate customer satisfaction. Exciting initial offers may bring in customers, but relevant rewards are what keep them engaged. If your KPIs overlook this important aspect of a loyalty program, they’re undercutting the program’s ROI from the start. \nBefore deciding on any changes, review your KPIs and program objectives. Make necessary changes to those areas first, and then allow your new vision to inform actual alterations to your program. Potential pitfalls to avoid \nRevising a loyalty program can be as challenging and frustrating as sifting through political campaign rhetoric. Wrong moves can also make the process as inflammatory as a hard-fought presidential campaign! \nAs you weigh what needs to be done, be aware of common pitfalls: Failing to find out what customers want. If you make changes to your program without knowing what customers are thinking, you risk further undermining the program’s effectiveness. Polling current and potential members on what they want from your program, what they like about it and what turns them off is a wise investment of time and money. Failing to communicate. Communication is key to every aspect of the bank-customer relationship, and loyalty programs are no exception. Alerting customers well in advance of coming changes gives them time to prepare, achieve understanding of the new order, and even give you feedback that may affect your implementation of changes. Failing to justify. No one likes change for the sake of change, but if you fail to communicate to members why you feel revision is necessary they’ll have no way of understanding what you’re doing and why. Clearly communicate why you’re making changes and enumerate the concrete benefits members will reap from the updates. Failing to prepare for complaints. You can’t please everyone all the time, no matter how well you do at communicating what’s coming. Empower your customer service staff with scenarios and scripts for dealing with unhappy program members. Little changes mean a lot \nAs noted earlier, it’s not always necessary to make significant changes. Sometimes a loyalty program can be vastly improved by making a few minor tweaks. Here are a few small tactics that can deliver big rewards for financial institution loyalty programs: Introduce extras to drive specific behaviors. This can be as simple as offering double points to members who take a featured action, such as enrolling in online bill pay or signing up for automated overdraft alerts. Simplify apps and dashboards to make it as easy as possible for members to enroll, track and redeem rewards no matter what device they’re using. Increase the number of ways in which members can earn rewards. Increase the ways in which members can redeem/claim rewards. Boost the rate of interaction and offer-making. More frequent contacts can encourage greater engagement, as long as offers are relevant, compelling and delivered through the customer’s preferred channels. \nBig changes often come with significant costs, both in initial investment to create the change and potential loss of business if the implementation is slipshod or customers react badly. Tweaking your loyalty program may be a better way to create effective, engagement-building change while minimizing potential costs.

      "text": "How Starbucks Makes Money (SBUX) By Greg McFarlane | Updated December 2, 2016 — 4:00 PM EST \nIn the late 20 th century, coffee was merely a beverage, not a lifestyle brand with its own inescapable culture. Then Starbucks ( SBUX ) began spreading across the United States and the entire world, and neither caffeine delivery nor the retail real estate industry would ever be the same again. \nWhether you’re a loyal Starbucks customer or not, you’re probably familiar with the broad strokes of the company’s history. Starbucks was founded in Seattle in 1971, expanded to a few dozen stores (in Seattle, Vancouver, and Chicago) by the late 1980s, then metastasized seemingly overnight into a 25,000-store colossus. (For more, see: A Closer Look at Starbucks ) Beans, Water, and Fire \nThe Starbucks concept is about as low-tech as modern business gets, and the corresponding margins are delicious. Even an unadorned black coffee at Starbucks sells for quadruple its underlying costs. So what’s the company’s secret, and how did a glorified neighborhood espresso bar invade 75 countries and turn the consumption of coffee an activity unto itself and an $83 billion business? From Humble Beginnings \nThe company divides its operations primarily geographically, into the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); China/Asia Pacific; and something called Channel Development, which the corporate-speak way of saying “everything other than retail stores.” Channel Development includes the packaged ground coffee you get at the supermarket, and the single-serving Frappucino bottles at the convenience store. \nWith 25,085 stores, it’s a given that Starbucks has to franchise, right? Wrong. Starbucks has a very, very limited number of franchisees in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and doesn’t accept franchise submissions in North America. But that doesn’t mean that every one of those stores is company-owned in the strictest sense. Thousands of stores operate under licensing agreements. The airport kiosk, the bookless corner of your neighborhood Barnes & Noble ( BKS ), the stand-up service counter at the entrance to Safeway – all of those locations help Starbucks pervade the minds of its customers, and make it inescapable. (For more, see: China Loves Starbucks ) \nThe licensed stores are familiar on Starbucks’ home continent, if not dominant. They comprise 42% of the company’s total of 15,607 North American stores. But in the rest of the world, licensed stores are in the majority – including 55% of the company’s 6,443 stores in China/Asia Pacific, and 80% of stores elsewhere. Add it all up, and company-owned stores predominate by only the slimmest of margins, 50.6% to 49.4%. Right down the middle, but… Dollar for Dollar \nNot exactly. The company's own stores accounted for 79% of total FY16 revenue of $16.8 billion. Starbucks company stores encourage loitering, which might seem counterintuitive. But company store customers end up buying a lot of coffee on their extended visits, more than the people who fill up at the licensed stores with the intention of getting their drink on and getting out. Licensed stores’ operating margins are higher than conventional stores’. Also, the relative numbers have something to do with the licensed stores being located in North America, where the sedentary act of buying coffee and then settling in for a long and relaxed linger is well-established. Coffee drinkers in the rest of the world, at least outside of Vienna, have yet to adopt that behavior en masse . (For more, see: Starbucks' 6 Key Financial Ratios ) \nThe company also owns other brands that the uninitiated might think compete with Starbucks: Seattle’s Best and Teavana, among others. At the retail level, the dominant majority of Starbucks’ revenue comes from drink sales. Beverages account for over 70% of the sales mix. Pastries, sandwiches, and other comestibles account for a historically consistent 20% of sales, with the remainder almost evenly split between packaged coffee/tea and “other” – e.g. espresso machines, and music CDs for uninteresting middle-aged women. Built For the Future \nStarbucks’ revenue continue to rise, faster than you’d expect for a company that appears to have permanently saturated most parts of North America. But it’s a big planet, and double-digit growth is standard for Starbucks overseas. In FY16, total revenue increased by 22.7% in China/Asia Pacific. North American revenue is 88% of the total annual take, and increased by a healthy 11.3% in FY16. As for the Channel Development division, its revenue increased by 11.6% to $1.9 billion. Starbucks cites premium single-serve products as the catalyst here, and why not? Modern single-serve coffee machines retail for more than machines that can brew 12 cups at a time, a circumstance that would seem to stand classical economics on its head. People enjoy paying for cachet, even when it makes no sense to do so. By and large, those are your Starbucks customers. The Bottom Line \nWholesale coffee prices fell 39% in the last year, and if you think that Starbucks passed the savings onto its customers, that’s adorable. Any elementary school student should be able to explain what happens to already large margins once the price of the raw materials decreases. To Starbucks’ credit, the company is only too happy to tell shareholders that decreased coffee bean prices are responsible for much of the company’s recent fortunes. \nDepending on where you live and how early you wake up, packed drive-thrus are a common sight at Starbucks throughout the world. Not only are the people in the cars devoted to Starbucks’ particular varieties of high-margin whole-bean coffee, those people value coffee more than they do their own time.

      "text": "The Top 4 Starbucks Shareholders (SBUX) By Matt Rego | Updated December 2, 2016 — 1:02 PM EST \nThe Starbucks Corporation's (NASDAQ: SBUX ) rise to fame started from a single coffee shop in Seattle's Pike Place Market in 1971. As of October 2, 2016, the coffee giant owned over 25,000 company-operated and licensed stores globally. With humble beginnings, Starbucks' explosive success is among the many great American business stories that entrepreneurs study. \nWhile Starbucks is known for its coffee, the company continues to find growth through other beverages, such as tea, beer and wine. Starbucks has also continued to focus on its café presence through a wider range of food options, stylish restaurant remodeling, a revamped rewards program and continued international expansion. As the company reported another strong year of earnings per share (EPS) at $1.90 per share in fiscal 2016, Starbucks' top shareholders stand to be the major beneficiaries. Howard Schultz \nThe founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Starbucks Corporation, Howard Schultz is the single largest holder of Starbucks shares. According to Yahoo Finance, Schultz holds around 29.6 million shares of the coffee giant's stock as of December 2015. Schultz joined the Starbucks Coffee Company as the director of retail and marketing in 1982. He later incorporated Starbucks in 1985, after his Il Giornale Coffee Company bought up Starbucks Coffee Company's assets. Since returning to Starbucks in 2008, Schultz served as the president and CEO. At the end of 2016, he announced that he would be turning over the position of CEO to Kevin Johnson in 2017. John Culver \nAfter longtime chairman and large shareholder James Shennan Jr. sold off a majority of his Starbucks stake in February 2016, John Culver became the newly-minted second-largest individual shareholder of Starbucks stock. As of May 2016, Culver held 314,768 shares of Starbucks according to Yahoo Finance. Since joining Starbucks in August 2002, Culver has held many positions, including president of Starbucks' China and Asia-Pacific business, president of Starbucks Coffee International, and served in other senior executive roles with the company's Global Consumer Products segment, food service business and Seattle's Best Coffee business. Culver currently is a group president of Global Retail at Starbucks. Clifford Burrows \nClifford Burrows, who has worked at Starbucks since April 2001, is the third-largest individual shareholder of Starbucks, with 280,024 shares as of November 2015 according to Yahoo Finance. Burrows served as a vice president of U.K. Starbucks in 2006 and president of the company's Europe, Middle East and Africa business from 2006 to 2008. He managed Starbucks Coffee U.S. from 2008 to 2011 and took over supervision of Americas and U.S. in 2011. In 2014, Burrows joined Teavana as the company's group president of U.S. and Americas. Burrows has since become Starbucks' group president of Siren Retail as of September 2016. Mellody L Hobson \nMellody Hobson surpassed newly appointed CEO Kevin Johnson by the number of shares in 2016. Hobson served on the Starbucks board of directors since February 2005 and as of September 1, 2016, owns 163,743 shares of the company according to Yahoo Finance. Since 2000 Hobson served as a president of Ariel Investments LLC, a Chicago-based firm and is one the board of directors at Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. and DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc.

      "title": "Howard Schultz Stepping Down As CEO: What It Means For The Future Of Coffee",
      "text": "LinkedIn Summary \nThe recent sell-off in Starbucks shares following the announcement of Schultz's stepping down represents an opportunity for investors. \nSchultz will build out new store formats that provide new growth opportunities for the company. \nThe announcement signals that coffee retailers must adapt to changing consumer dynamics. \nClick to enlarge Throughout recent history the remarkable leadership and innovation of a few iconic corporate leaders have catapulted them into the collective conscious of a culture: Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates all come to mind. Following the vast media coverage of visionary Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) leader Howard Schultz announcing that he will be stepping down from his role as CEO (his name was even trending on Twitter) and continuing as Executive Chairman, it is clear that the visionary Schultz has also transcended the business world alongside Jobs, Musk, and Gates. \nBecause of this, it is easy to see how shares in Starbucks were trading over 3% lower after the announcement. Schultz is synonymous with Starbucks; it was his leadership that allowed Starbucks to multiple its value 170 times in its publicly traded life and his leadership that grew the company over 1,000% since he returned as CEO in 2008. However, his transition from CEO to Executive Chairman does not spell doom for shareholders as it did after his 2000 departure; it signals Starbucks's response to changing consumer dynamics and is akin to Derek Jeter in his prime moving from shortstop to second base, not retiring. \nThere are very few brick and mortar businesses that have the luxury of ducking from Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) attacks, and the coffee industry is not one of those. Of course, Amazon is unlikely to launch any type of coffee delivery platform, but what the coffee industry must combat is declining retail foot traffic that stems from e-commerce competition. To maintain and grow store traffic, coffee retailers must make their stores the destinations, rather than just stops for consumers en route to other stores. \nSurely there will always be the large market of workers and students looking for a jolt of caffeine for these companies, but to grow in the marketplace a coffee shop needs to differentiate its offering. Because If Macy's (NYSE: M ), Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN ), and other major retailers are struggling to drive foot traffic, then the radiated sales that extend to Starbucks as a result of consumers stopping for a beverage will cease to exist. \nThis is as true of independents and Dunkin' Donuts (NASDAQ: DNKN ) as it is of Starbucks. These businesses must all provide value that extends beyond the coffee in the cup, especially since single-cup brewer systems provide a cheaper alternative to time-pressed consumers on the go. For Dunkin' Donuts this could mean providing quicker service at a price competitive with single-cup beverages; for cafes, it could mean live artists or providing a space for studying or relaxing. For Starbucks, this holds a unique importance as they continue to try to charge premium - and now superpremium - prices for their coffee, and it can be tapped for growth through new store formats and expanded use of technology. \nWhen the company premiered its content series Upstanders in September I highlighted this fact, writing: \"the company must provide value to its customers (and millennial workforce) in more ways than through an expensive handcrafted espresso beverage or coffee. Upstanders demonstrates the company's focus on more than profits and offers a platform for customers to gain personal value from the brand.\" The company also tries to create this value with its many social impact initiatives and its 1912 Pike Blog that provides coffee recipes and insights to readers. \nThus now, more than ever, Starbucks must evolve its retail strategy to leverage technology and position stores as an experience, not just a coffee stop. This has been at the center of Starbucks's strategy forever as it has attempted to establish itself as a \"third place,\" but it will evolve even further under Schultz's new leadership position. \nHoward Schultz focusing on \"innovation, design and development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries around the world, [and the] expansion of the Starbucks Reserve® retail store format\" demonstrates that the company is dedicated to creating this new destination by creating a compelling space worth visiting and socializing in. The company recognizes the dynamics changing traditional consumer behaviors and is prepared to reposition its brand in the marketplace. For the coffee industry, this means that Schultz may be attempting to radically reinvent the way Americans consume coffee once again. \nAfter all, it was Schultz's vision that transitioned Starbucks from being a whole bean supplier to a hand-crafted specialty espresso beverage company. Without Schultz it is probable that Pumpkin Spice Lattes, Mocha Lattes, and Cappuccinos would have never been served at Starbucks. As he now attempts to expand the Starbucks Reserve store format he will again reinvent the Starbucks Experience. \nWhat this reinvention will look like has already been hinted at by the company's announcement of adding up to 1,000 Reserve only stores that feature Reserve Coffees and food from the Italian company Princi by the end of 2017 , which Starbucks recently invested in. In last quarter's Earnings Call Schultz revealed that he foresees Reserve bars in 20% of existing stores, and 20 to 30 roasteries in major cities in addition to the 1,000 new Reserve store concepts. \nIn these formats Starbucks will offer exotic coffees from all over the world and encourage experimentation and coffee education as yet another way to provide value through more than just a beverage. Prices in this format will be higher as warranted by the craft and quality of the food and beverages, while the experience will center around interactions with peers and colleagues rather than pick-up-and-leave transactions. \nThe financial opportunity in the company's pipeline of stores is tremendous, with Schultz suggesting that the financial performance of the Reserve Only Stores is two-times greater than the regular store. Dismissing the comparable same store sale increases that can occur in the 20% of stores that get augmented with Reserve bars, the increase in Revenue in the Americas alone looks to be about 20% with the addition of 20 roasteries and 800 new Reserve format stores: \nThis model takes the reasonable assumption that the Roasteries can generate double the foot-traffic of regular stores and 3.5-times the ticket size of a normal store, which is a comfortable assumption given that the ticket size is currently four times greater in the Seattle Roastery than it is in traditional formats . The Reserve Store concept is a bit more difficult to forecast, but the model assumes 20% higher foot traffic and ticket sizes that are two times greater than the traditional store. Under these parameters, with same-store sales set as flat, revenue for the Americas operating segment increases by over 20%. These stores will likely require large cash investments up-front due to their unique design (and larger store footprints for the roasteries) but will yield greater margins over the long-term due to the ability to charge \"superpremium\" prices. \nBy adding bars and augmenting the entire store experience Starbucks can continue to create an experience for consumers that is worth pursuing independent of any other shopping plans. But it is not just Schultz's leadership in his new role that should excite shareholders; new CEO Kevin Johnson's experience and expertise signal that Starbucks will expand its leveraging of technology. \nStarbucks has been a pioneer in the food industry in utilizing digital to drive sales, acting almost as a technology company that serves coffee. The company has achieved this with one of the most robust loyalty programs (analyzed here and here ), a mobile payment system that accounted for 25% of transactions last quarter, and a mobile order and pay system that account for 6% of transactions. \nThe firm also expanded its technological reach by transitioning from in-store CD sales to embracing Spotify as a platform to engage with customers and through its content offerings referenced above. To manage all of these technological platforms, as well as whatever may be in the pipeline, it makes sense to appoint Kevin Johnson as the next CEO because of his over 30 years of experience in the technology industry, serving at both Microsoft and Juniper Networks. \nWhile Schultz is attempting to create an entirely new version of the Starbucks experience, Johnson and others will be busy connecting with customers through new technologies. The growth prospects of this are outstanding as expanded utilization of technology and new store formats each stand to provide a unique offering that can capture new consumer demand in spite of otherwise slow retail traffic. Competitors need be wary of Starbucks's digital strategy as it signals that the coffee industry must position itself in the omnichannel just as Macy's and Nordstrom must. \nOne last potential cause for shareholder worry is that many have speculated that Schultz is simply getting his affairs in order and arranging for a smooth leadership transition as he prepares a run for President of the United States in 2020, but in all interviews Schultz is adamant in saying that his heart and soul are with Starbucks. \nSo if Howard Schultz has any aims of running for President, it certainly won't be until after he's attempted to reinvent the way we consume coffee one last time. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SBUX over the next 72 hours.   Additional disclosure: I have served as a part-time barista at a licensed Starbucks store.   Tagged: Financial Advisors , Industry News , Services , Specialty Eateries",

Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Photo: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images \nOn a cold January day in 1961, Fred Schultz, a diaper delivery serviceman, fell on a sheet of ice and broke his hip and his ankle. Fred’s son, Howard, was seven years old and vividly remembers the accident. “That image of my father, slumped on the family couch, his leg in a cast unable to work or earn money, and ground down by the world is still burned into my mind,” the Starbucks CEO once said. At the time of the accident, the Schultz family was living in a Brooklyn housing project. They had no health insurance, no worker’s comp, no severance, and no way to make ends meet. Young Howard vowed that if he was ever in a position to take care of people, he would strive to make a difference in their lives. \nThe story serves as the foundation for nearly every initiative Starbucks put in place under Schultz’ leadership: health benefits for part-time workers, tuition assistance, veterans hiring, and an employee stock purchase program. “Starbucks has become a living legacy of my dad,” he said. \nAlthough Schultz, a self-made billionaire, has announced that he will step away as chief executive of Starbucks beginning April 3, 2017, I have no doubt we will hear about Schultz’ ‘origin story’ time and time again in whatever role Schultz pursues. Schultz is proud of his roots because, as he once said, “The more uninspiring your origins, the more likely you are to use your imagination and invent worlds where everything seems possible.” \nHoward Schultz often tells the story of his father to explain his company’s mission and values. His father’s story frames the “why” behind the company’s initiatives. Schultz’s vision was to build a company that treats people with dignity and respect, the treatment his father was never shown. As I was making the transition from a full-time journalism career to working on my first book, Schultz graciously offered his time and insights. I’ll never forget the light bulb moment. About twenty minutes into our conversation I said, \n“Howard, you’ve talked about inspirational leadership, employee engagement, and customer service. I haven’t heard you mention coffee.” \n“Coffee is what we sell as a product, but it’s not the business we’re in. We’re in the people business,” Schultz responded. “I’m passionate about human connection.” “When you're surrounded by people who share a passionate commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible,” Schultz told me. \nIn my conversation with Schultz, I learned that he studied communication and public-speaking as a student at Northern Michigan University. It was there that he came to appreciate the role that communication plays in rallying a company’s employees, partners and customers around a common purpose. The second ‘signature story’ that Schultz often tells is about his first trip to Milan, Italy, where he conceived of the vision behind Starbucks. \nHere is how Schultz recalled the experience in an interview with Oprah Winfrey: \n“People think I’m the founder of Starbucks. I was an employee when Starbucks only had four stores. I was sent to Italy on a trip for Starbucks and came back with this feeling that the business Starbucks was in was the wrong business. What I wanted to bring back was the daily ritual and the sense of community and the idea that we could build this third place between home and work in America. It was an epiphany. I was out of my mind. I walked in and saw this symphony of activity, and the romance and the theater of coffee. And coffee being at the center of conversation, creating a sense of community. That is what spoke to me.” \nThat story spoke to Schultz and he has never grown tired of telling it, nor has he tired of telling the story of growing up in a housing project under difficult circumstances. \nOver the years I’ve learned five significant leadership lessons from Howard Schultz: \n• Inspiring leaders are as not as passionate about the product their companies make as they are about how the products or services improve the lives of their employees and customers. \n• Inspiring leaders never grow tired of sharing stories that shaped their character. \n• Inspiring leaders treat employees benevolently. \n• Inspiring leaders obsess over every aspect of the customer experience. \n• Inspiring leaders remind themselves—and their employees—of what business they’re really in. \nAbove all, Howard Schultz ignites our inner fire by embracing and sharing his story of triumph over adversity. By doing so he teaches all of us—leaders, managers, entrepreneurs, and students—to dream big dreams and not to be afraid of chasing moonshots. ",

Subscribe \nStarbucks is getting a new boss -- and the reasons why are both reassuring and intriguing. \nLet's start with what the Seattle-based coffee retailer announced Thursday. Long-time boss Howard Schultz is narrowing his role as of early 2017, keeping his chairman's title but handing over the role of chief executive to the company's No. 2 officer, Kevin Johnson . A huge surprise? Not really. A important transition point anyway? Absolutely. \nI spent time earlier this year with both men, in the course of reporting this FORBES cover story . Schultz is the self-made entrepreneur, who has been a huge part of the Starbucks story almost since its founding. He's brimming with ideas. Johnson is the big-company man, who earlier spent 16 years as a senior executive at Microsoft. He keeps track of the overall strategy and makes sure things get done. Kevin Johnson (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) \nDuring my visits to Starbucks headquarters, it was clear that Schultz and Johnson had settled quite naturally into the classic roles of \"Mr. Outside\" and \"Mr. Inside,\" respectively, with Schultz at the top. But there were signs, too, that Starbucks has become so vast and multi-faceted that Johnson's steady hand is becoming ever more crucial. \nIn a 39-minute conference call with Wall Street analysts late yesterday, the two men reaffirmed that they share the same values, get along well, etc., etc. Once that had been established, Schultz made the case that by shedding the CEO title, he can focus more intently on the world-wide expansion of Starbucks's upscale Roastery initiative, which he believes has huge potential. \nCombing through the two executives' remarks, I found three clearly stated reasons why they believe the CEO title transfer will be good for Starbucks' customers, employees and investors. I'm also seeing a basis for adding two other hidden possibilities to the list. These factors are as follows: \nBuilding out The Roastery concept becomes Schultz's No. 1 priority. This is Starbucks' push into ultra-premium coffees, along with thrilling, sprawling cafe/roasteries in which to serve them. The first Roastery opened in December 2014 in Seattle; it attracts booming business. Eventually there will be 20 full-scale Roasteries around the world, Schultz said. Look for 1,000 premium stores that incorporate much of the Roastery ambiance (though without roasting coffee beans on site.) Think of the Roastery as a \"learning laboratory\" for new Starbucks products and services, Schultz added. ",

Subscribe Starbucks newly-named CEO Kevin Johnson - Stephen Brashear/Getty Images \nFollowing a rock star is always challenging. As Kevin Johnson onboards into Howard Schultz’s shoes as CEO of Starbucks he must avoid the harpoon misfires Nardelli, Scully and McDonald made at Home Depot, Apple and Procter & Gamble of not respecting the previous CEO, changing too much or not changing enough fast enough. He needs to manage carefully how he converges into the job and then evolves the organization. \nRobert Nardelli doubled sales and profits as CEO of Home Depot and got fired. True, the stock price had declined. But what undid him was a failure to respect founders Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank and the culture. \nContrast that with Meg Whitman who took over eBay from Pierre Omidyar. At every step of the way growing revenues from $4 million to $8 billion under her watch she credited Omidyar. When asked about her success, she repeatedly lead with “First, Pierre had a really good idea.” \nJohn Scully nearly destroyed Apple by changing almost everything Steve Jobs had built from the passion for design and the willingness to jump way out ahead of consumers to the fundamental culture of the company. Apple never fully recovered until Jobs’ return. \nContrast that with how Steve Ballmer built on what Bill Gates had created at Microsoft, keeping the things that had made the company what it was. \nOn the other hand Bob McDonald didn’t change enough fast enough when he took over as Procter & Gamble CEO from A.G. Lafley. He was a 30-year veteran who had helped build P&G to what it was and went from being part of the fabric to being part of the problem. \nContrast that with the two-step combination of David Glass and Lee Scott who took over a large, profitable and growing regional retailer from some guy named Sam Walton and took it national and then international. \nJohnson’s 100-Day Action Plan \nJohnson, like most leaders following a rock star should think in terms of standing on the shoulders of giants and 1) honor his predecessor, 2) keep what’s working and 3) build on that strong base to move forward. \nSchultz and Johnson may have taken a page out of Ajay Banga’s transition into CEO of MasterCard with a similarly phased transition. Johnson progressed from board member to President and COO last year. He was just named as Schultz’ successor with a start date in April. Schultz will move from CEO to Executive Chairman in part to smooth the transition. \nJohnson has the rare executive onboarding gift of time to think through and implement a full new leader’s 100-day action plan. Shame on him if he squanders the opportunity and steps on any of the obvious landmines. He should get a head start, manage his message and then build his new team. \nGet A Head Start \nHe’s already getting a head start with his phased transition. He’s been converging into the organization and team for years. Between now and Day One in April he needs to flesh out his plan, complete his preparations and invest in strengthening relationships with his board, allies and team. \nManage The Message \nEverything communicates. People will read things into everything Johnson and Schultz say and do, and everything they don’t say and don’t do. So far, both seem to be right on message. But they can’t blink at any step of the way. \nBuild The Team \nBuilding the team components include setting direction, strengthening the culture, sustaining momentum and delivering results. The only thing Johnson can do on his own is fail. His success is inextricably linked to the success of the team as a whole – including Schultz who needs to manage carefully the new division of responsibilities between CEO and Chairman . \nBy the end of his first 100-days, Johnson needs to have new strategic, operating and organizational processes in place to stand on the shoulders of the giants that preceded him and take the organization to new heights. \nClick here for an overall summary of and links to my articles on Forbes, The New Leader’s 100-Day Action Plan book, and the 100-Day Plan for Interviews tool.

The move is almost certain to fan speculation about a potential run for political office. \nStarbucks said Thursday afternoon that Schultz will give up his CEO title and become executive chairman on April 3, 2017. Schultz said Thursday that he will focus on developing and expanding Starbucks Reserve Roasteries , a new strategic initiative for the coffee giant. \nS chultz, 63, will cede the CEO role to Kevin Johnson, the company's president and chief operating officer. \n\" Starbucks consistently outperforms the retail industry because our stores, our offerings and the experiences our partners create make us a destination,\" Schultz said in a statement Thursday afternoon. \"As I focus on Starbucks' next wave of retail innovation, I am delighted that Kevin Johnson — our current president, COO, a seven-year board member and my partner in running every facet of Starbucks business over the last two years — has agreed to assume the duties of Starbucks chief executive officer. This move ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nIn a call with analysts, investors and journalists Thursday afternoon, Schultz attempted to make his next step perfectly clear. \"I'm not leaving the company. I'm here every single day,\" he said. \n\" I consider it a privilege to work side-by-side with Howard, our world-class board of directors, and a very talented leadership team,\" soon-to-be CEO Johnson said. \"Together, we will reaffirm our leadership in all things coffee, enhance the partner experience and exceed the expectations of our customers and shareholders. We believe in using our scale for good and having positive social impact in the communities we serve around the world.” Kevin Johnson (left), will take the reins as Starbucks CEO on April 3, 2017.

After taking over in 1987 he steered the company through its 1992 IPO and for years afterward, before giving up the job on April 6, 2000. At the time, he said he was vacating the role in order to focus on the company's global strategy. He took back the reins on January 8, 2008. \nSchultz first joined Starbucks as director of operations and marketing in 1982, when the company had just four stores (it now has more than 25,000). After falling in love with Italian coffeehouses during a 1983 trip to Italy, Schultz left Starbucks to start Il Giornale, his own line of coffeehouses. But he couldn't stay away from the Seattle-based coffee chain for long: in 1987, he returned, buying the company and becoming its CEO. \nSince those early days, Schultz has grown the company into an $85 billion powerhouse, expanding into tea (Teavana), offering hot food, and becoming one of the food industry's pioneers in mobile ordering . Simultaneously, Schultz has spoken openly about balancing profit and benevolence, and over the years launched a number of socially-just initiatives for his employees. He's set up Starbucks cafes on military bases with the aim of hiring veterans and active-duty spouses; in 2014, he set up a program that gave baristas and other employees a chance to earn an online college degree from Arizona State University, with Starbucks footing the tuition bill; in July, Starbucks said that it will expand healthcare coverage for eligible full and part time employees by way of a private exchange. \n\"We're not just here to raise the stock price,\" he told FORBES in a March 2016 cover story . \"What can we do to use our strength for social good?\" Of course, rhetorical questions like these stoke speculation that he may one day run for public office -- even though he and those close to him vehemently deny that he has such designs. \n\"Howard knows himself well enough to realize that a role in national politics isn't right for him,\" Starbucks board member Mellody Hobson told FORBES in March. \nTwo days after the 2016 presidential election, Schultz reiterated this position. \n\"I have a day job,\" he told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.\"I’m deeply rooted in promise of America, and the aspirations of the country. I’m concerned about the future of the country. And if I can do anything as a private citizen, as I am now, to advance that cause, that's what I am trying to do.\" \nStarbucks stock, which closed Thursday's regular trading session with a modest 0.9% gain, dropped more than 3% in after-hours trading on the news. That means a nearly $100 million dip in Schultz's net worth, to $3 billion from $3.1 billion as of Thursday's market close. \nThursday's after-hours dip aside, Schultz has overseen significant growth in Starbucks shares: from its 1992 IPO through April 6, 2000, when his first spin as CEO ended, shares returned 1,298%. From January 8, 2008 -- the day he took back the corner office duties -- through Thursday, the stock's total return was another 551%. During the the in-between period, the shares gained 96%. ",

Subscribe The Donald Trump Shipping Stock Boom \nSince the opening of the first Starbucks store in Seattle in 1971, the chain has come a long way, making a brand name for itself synonymous with premium coffee. Presently, Starbucks has over 24,000 company-owned stores worldwide, including 3,581 internationally (primarily in Europe and China). Its sales have grown at an impressive CAGR of 12.4% in the past 5 years to over $20 billion in FY 2016. \nThe biggest advantage Starbucks has is that its product is addictive. How many of us can’t function without a mug of coffee the first thing in the morning? The answer to that question would likely give you an idea about the potential Starbucks holds to continue growing at a tremendous pace, despite competition and the downtrend seen in comparable sales for the last few quarters. \nMoreover, the declining working conditions of the labor force have fueled the sales of caffeinated beverages over the last seven years. An estimated 6 out of 10 Americans aged 25-39, and 4.8 out of 10 Americans, aged 18-25, consume at least one cup of coffee a day. According to the International Coffee Organization, the global demand for coffee is expected to rise 1.2% from Oct’16 to Oct’17, with its popularity growing in the traditionally tea-drinking countries of China, India, and Japan. \nHistorically, the Americas have been the largest market for Starbucks, contributing $14.8 billion or 69.4% of total company sales in FY 2016. America has already witnessed a 1.5% y-o-y increase in coffee consumption, in the year so far. \nGoing forward, the company’s dependency on the U.S. may be about to change in favor of China. As we have mentioned in our previous articles, Starbucks is banking big on China for its future growth. Currently, the China/Asia-Pacific segment contributes $3 billion or 13.8% of total revenue. But as the Chinese population grows to over 1.4 billion (forecast according to the Economist Intelligence Unit) in 2030, and its low income bracket falls to only 11% of the total population, we can expect 89% of the population to be able to afford a regular cup of coffee from Starbucks, as opposed to approximately 60% right now. In line with this, Starbucks has set itself a goal of opening and operating about 5,000 stores in China by 2021, thus, providing tremendous growth in the top-line. ",

      "text": "Break out the peppermint hot chocolate and gingerbread lattes — it’s officially the holiday season, and that means red cups at Starbucks , and serious potential to drink a lot of extra calories.\nThe holidays are no time for diets or calorie-counting, but it’s possible to avoid weight gain while still enjoying the season. A Skinny Peppermint Mocha seems like the go-to Starbucks beverage if you’re trying to both embrace winter and maintain your weight, but a “grande” version of the drink — translated to medium, or 16 ounces — contains 160 calories and 13 grams of sugar. Doesn’t sound so “skinny,” huh?\nChristmas-loving chocoholics, don’t fret. A grande Skinny Peppermint Mocha typically gets four pumps of both skinny mocha sauce AND sugar-free peppermint flavor, but ask for only half of each. (Trust us, two of each is more than enough for a 16-ounce coffee.)\nRead: Starbucks Barista Secret: PSL Low Calorie Recipe Hacks Let You Drink Pumpkin Spiced Lattes Without Guilt\nAdditionally, the drink is automatically made with nonfat milk , which has a lot of sugar. Try asking for a non-dairy alternative like soy, coconut, or almond milk, which probably tastes best and has protein.\nThese practices can be applied to basically any Starbucks holiday beverage or flavored latte. Caramel brulée, chestnut praline, Christmas cookie, gingerbread, and toffee nut lattes can all be made with fewer pumps of sauce and a healthier milk choice — and so can regular Peppermint Mochas. These beverages all come with whipped cream as well, so make sure to say ‘no whip.’\nIf you’re trying to embrace a jolt of jolly caffeine and stay healthy, then stay away from the Eggnog Latte, even it it’s made with nonfat milk. Without whipped cream, a grande beverage boasts 450 calories, 52 grams of sugar, and 240 mg of sodium.",

Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company's CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks' fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a \"master merchant\" who has been able to determine and even stimulate \"what the Starbucks customer wants and needs\" and asked if that \"merchant gene\" would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like \"cold brew\" coffee. Schultz called it the \"next wave of retail innovation.\" \n\"But Kevin and the team are in charge,\" Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks' announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, \"race together\" on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he'd do again \"in a heartbeat.\" \n\"It was one of my proudest moments,\" he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company's global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson's technology background will help ensure Starbucks' digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "× Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz To Step Down \n(CNN) — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant. \nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks (SBUX) sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will be appointed executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, design and developing Starbucks locations. \nSchultz is being replaced by former Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) senior exec Kevin Johnson, who will become the new CEO. \nIn a statement, Schultz said the move “ideally positions Starbucks to continue profitably growing our core business around the world into the future.” \nSchultz famously returned to Starbucks in 2008 to help guide the coffee giant through the recession and restore growth at the company.

      "text": "Starbucks CEO stepping down Charisse Jones / USA TODAY , WWL 8:04 PM. CST December 01, 2016 SEATTLE, WA - MARCH 23: Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks about the Christmas cup controversy during the Starbucks Annual Shareholders Meeting on March 23, 2016 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo: Stephen Brashear, 2016 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nHoward Schultz, who helped turn Starbucks into an iconic global brand as well known for its activism as its coffee blends, will step down from the role of CEO in April. \nSchultz will become the company’s executive chairman, concentrating on ramping up Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, a new premium experience that the company is betting on to boost growth worldwide, as well as the company’s well-known forays into community activism. Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and COO will become the CEO, retaining the title of president. \n“In all my years at Starbucks I have never been more energized or exhilarated about the opportunities that lie ahead,’’ Schultz said in a conference call Thursday afternoon. “I’m not leaving the company. I’m here every single day, and I’m going to contribute to what I consider a significant growth opportunity. ... But Kevin and the team are in charge.’’ \nIt’s the second time since Schultz bought the Starbucks Coffee Company in the late 1980s that he has stepped down from the role of CEO. He resigned in 2000, only to return to the helm eight years later. \nBut “the differences between then and now couldn’t be greater,’’ he said, noting that when he returned to the top job in 2008, Starbucks and other companies were riding out the dramatic financial downturn that was the Great Recession. \"The management team at that time ... just did not have the capability or experience to really navigate through that difficult period.\" In recent years, he says, the company has assembled “the strongest leadership team in our history.\" \nJohnson, who began his career as a systems engineer for IBM, joined the Starbucks board in 2009 and began working at the company in 2015. He previously spent 16 years at Microsoft working on global sales and marketing, then five years in Silicon Valley as CEO of Juniper Networks, a Sunnyvale, Calf.-company that develops networking products. \nIt is Johnson’s deep background in technology that Schultz said will be pivotal for Starbucks’ future growth. Technology can be used to bolster the customer experience, while Schultz focuses on the more premium offerings that will make a visit to Starbucks stand out from other eateries or retailers. \n\"We’ll be opening globally in years to come roasteries, reserve stores and reserve bars that will be customer destination venues,’’ Schultz says. By the end of 2019, the company plans to have unveiled more than 20 roasteries, and it plans to open more than 1,000 reserve stores, a new premium coffee space that will highlight new brewing techniques, and artisanal food offerings. Schultz said that those locations are expected to \"deliver twice the unit economics of a typical Starbucks store.'' \nSchultz, who will continue to be chairman of the board, will also continue to spearhead the social causes that have sometimes made him and Starbucks a lightning rod. In 2013 he asked customers not bring firearms into stores. And in 2015, as the nation was grappling with a wave of police shootings of unarmed black men and boys, Starbucks employees were told to write “Race Together” on cups, with the company saying that it wanted to help spark a discussion about race. \n“We want to use our scale for good,’’ Schultz said, noting a few of its many initiatives, including hiring over 10,000 veterans and their spouses, and making a dent in the youth unemployment rate by giving thousands fo young people. \"We think companies need to do more for the people they serve and the people they employ.’’ \nJohnson acknowledged that Schultz is a major act to follow. \"Howard is among the world’s most iconic leaders and entrepreneurs,’’ Johnson said. But, the company's leaders work \"well together and have built a foundation of trust, transparency and teamwork.’’ \nContributing: Elizabeth Weise ",

The drink, referred to by some as \"Christmas in a cup\" or \"drinking apple pie\" is made with warm apple juice, carmelized apple, brown sugar and butter. \nNo word yet when the baked apple latte will hit Starbucks stores in the United States, but until then, customers can enjoy dozens of holiday beverages like the caramel brulee latte, chestnut praline latte, peppermint mocha, gingerbread late and the eggnog latte. @StarbucksJapan added \"Hot Baked Apple\" to their holiday drinks line-up! The other flavors are a Gingerbread Latte & a Snow Pecan Nut Latte! pic.twitter.com/ffxybQPFTT — Japan Crate (@JapanCrate) November 21, 2016 A native of Columbus, Ohio, Raven graduated from Kent State University in 2014 with a degree in TV/ radio.

      "text": "By Sruthi Ramakrishnan, Reuters December 2, 2016 • Reprints \nStarbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz's decision to step down is unlikely to disrupt growth at the world's biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. \nStarbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nThe company's shares were down 2.6 % in premarket trading as investors worried that the legendary CEO's exit would spell trouble for the company. \nThe last time Schultz stepped down as CEO—in 2000—the company's shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company's annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n\"Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz's previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nJohnson's experience of working with Schultz for nearly two years as well as his technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc, sets him up for the job, analysts said. \nSchultz said on Thursday that he had personally asked Johnson to take the CEO job, highlighting Johnson's technology chops at a time when the company is trying to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin' Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. \nThe mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful—a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks' latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks' quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of least 7 % since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin' and McDonald's Corp. \n\"While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,\" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note. \nSchultz's plans to \"premiumize\" the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive, Herzog added. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world. \nThese efforts come as Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle—Starbucks' birthplace—to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. About the Author",

      "text": "Starbucks Just Turned Your Favorite Holiday Cookie into a Work-Appropriate Drink starbucks/Instagram by: Olivia Bahou \nThe Christmas Eve and Hanukkah countdown stands at just over three weeks and Starbucks is blessing us with a last-minute addition to the holiday drink menu. On Friday, the beverage giant introduced the Snickerdoodle Hot Chocolate, turning one of our favorite holiday cookies into a drink that we can sip at our desks. \nAccording to Starbucks , “the beverage is made with steamy milk, white chocolate sauce, and cinnamon dolce syrup, topped with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon sugar.” We like the way this cookie crumbles. Courtesy of Starbucks \nThe cinnamon drink ( pictured above, far left ) is available starting Dec. 2 and joins a star-studded lineup of hot chocolate drinks that includes peppermint, salted caramel, and white chocolate varieties. Plus, customers can add on a cake pop for just $1 after ordering any hot cocoa through Dec. 25. \nVIDEO: Holiday Entertaining with Emily Henderson \n\nIf liquid caffeine is more your style, keep scrolling to see Starbucks’s lineup of holiday coffee beverages —espresso included.

      "text": "Starbucks CEO steps down to focus on high-end coffee, shares fall Thu Dec 1, 2016 6:53pm EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan \n(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O: Quote ) co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nSchultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. \nStarbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. \n\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. \n\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. \nMany of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. \n\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp (MCD.N: Quote ) CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. \nThe announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. Continued... ",

Hottovy told Reuters. \nHottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for. \nJohnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks' board since 2009. \nHe also has a strong technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O: Quote ) and Juniper Networks Inc (JNPR.N: Quote ), which sets him up to lead Starbucks at a time when the company is looking to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology.

      "text": "Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, steps down. × Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz to step down Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, steps down. \nNEW YORK — Howard Schultz, the visionary leader of Starbucks, will be stepping down next year as CEO of the iconic coffee giant. \nSchultz’s surprise decision to step aside as the leader of Starbucks sent the stock sinking 3% in after-hours trading on Thursday. \nStarbucks said Schultz isn’t going away completely. Effective April 3, he will become executive chairman, where he will focus on innovation, the design of Starbucks locations and the company’s social impact initiatives. Current chief operating officer Kevin Johnson, a tech industry veteran, will replace Schultz as CEO. \n“This is a good thing. I’m not leaving the company,” Schultz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow by phone on Thursday. \nEven though Schultz hadn’t telegraphed the move, the CEO said he had been planning the move for at least a year. \nAsked if he’s going to Washington, Schultz laughed and said, “No, I’m not going to Washington.” \nInstead, Schultz emphasized a desire to focus on the company’s social impact initiatives. \n“Given the state of things in the country, there is a need to help those left behind,” Schultz told CNN. \nSeparately, in a conference call, Schultz said Johnson brings “unparalleled understanding of market dynamics” and he deserves a “tremendous amount of credit” for the company’s recent record results. \nSchultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of retail operations and he helped turn the company into a retail powerhouse and an iconic American brand. He stepped down as CEO in April 2000 to concentrate on executing the company’s global strategy. \nBut Starbucks struggled without him at the helm and seemed to have lost its way. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 and helped guide the coffee giant through the Great Recession and get it back on track. Today, Starbucks is valued at $84 billion and it has more than 24,000 retail stores in 70 countries. ",

      "text": "Outgoing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz publicly backed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president this year. And although she lost to President-elect Donald Trump and a few angry Trump fans launched a #TrumpCup protest at Starbucks, Schultz doesn’t think the brand has a problem with Trump supporters.\nIn an interview with CNBC on Friday, just one day after Schultz announced he would step down as CEO in 2017, the coffee giant guru was asked if his brand was at all at odds with those that supported Trump’s candidacy.\nThe Starbucks sbux chief essentially argued that coffees and teas are bipartisan.\n“I don’t think on any level that the brand or what we represent is at odds with the president elect or his supporters,” Schultz told CNBC . “90 million customers a week are going through Starbucks stores and I assume many of them voted for Donald Trump.”\nThe comments from Schultz are important as Starbucks has been subjected to one of many post-election boycotts that have targeted well-known consume brands. A #BoycottStarbucks hashtag floated around social media channels for some time now and the #TrumpCup campaign percolated after a viral video showed a white male Trump supporter yelling at a barista, claiming he was subjected to anti-white discrimination .\nStarbucks has been at the epicenter of the election for some time now—mostly because Schultz has been very vocal. Early this year he lamented the tone of the election, calling it “a circus of yelling bombastic attacks.” He publicly backed Clinton in September, predicted she would win in October, and said he was “stunned” by Trump’s win a day after the election.\nSchultz on Friday told CNBC that he was hopeful President-elect Trump would be successful. But he also stressed that he personally, as well as Schultz’s successor Kevin Johnson and the Starbucks board, was hopeful that the Trump administration would address social issues that had been overlooked by past Republican administrations.\nWhile Schultz didn’t specify what social issues were most important to him, he has been vocal about some hot-button topics, including gay marriage, race and diversity , access to health care, and gun control. Most of his stances on those issues have been arguably very progressive.\nOne thing that was left unsaid in the wake of the news that Schultz would step down as CEO next year: would he ever run for public office?\nThe 63-year-old executive said as recent as last month that he had no interest in becoming a politician. And as of now, the plan for Schultz is to steer Starbucks push into more premium retail experiences, inspired by the success of the company’s Roastery in Seattle.",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) In this file photo a customer enjoys a coffee at Starbucks. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) AP Photo \nNEW YORK — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a global brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSchultz, 63, is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes since returning as its CEO in 2008. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nShares of Starbucks slid 3.6 percent to $56.44 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call to discuss the announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz said the company has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and would be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks announced the change, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nSchultz said during the call that he has been working closely with Johnson, who joined the Starbucks board in 2009. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \n",

Schultz will become executive chairman on that date to focus on innovation and social impact activities, among other things. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings — a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.

      "text": "Starbucks’ CEO transition unlikely to stymie growth: analysts Starbucks’ CEO transition unlikely to stymie growth: analysts Starbucks announced that Chief Executive Howard Schultz is stepping down and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become chief executive By: Reuters | Published:December 2, 2016 11:29 pm File Photo: March 23, 2016, Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer of Starbucks Corp., holds up one of the coffee company’s prepaid Visa debit cards, at the company’s annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. (Source: AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) \nStarbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz’s decision to step down is unlikely to hamper growth at the world’s biggest coffee chain as his successor Kevin Johnson is well suited to take the helm, analysts said. Starbucks Corp said on Thursday that Schultz would step down as CEO on April 3 to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Johnson, a long-time technology executive. \nWatch what else is in the news \nThe company’s shares were down 2.5 percent at $57.02 on Friday as investors worried that the exit of one of Wall Street’s most regarded CEOs would spell trouble for the company. Analysts, however, downplayed these concerns. “Howard can’t be in that position forever,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters. \nHottovy said the timing of the handoff made sense because the company had a strong management team and Johnson had more retail experience than the market was giving him credit for. Johnson worked with Schultz for nearly two years and has been on Starbucks’ board since 2009. \nHe also has a strong technology background, including stints at Microsoft Corp and Juniper Networks Inc, which sets him up to lead Starbucks at a time when the company is looking to project itself as a pioneer in mobile payments technology. \n“Johnson appears to have been an important behind-the-scenes contributor to Starbucks’ post-recession turnaround, and his background in technology should position him well,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a research note. To be sure, the last time Schultz stepped down as CEO – in 2000 – the company’s shares had plunged. \nSchultz returned to the top job in 2008. Since then the company’s annual sales have more than doubled and its stock has risen six-fold. \n“Unlike the period surrounding Mr. Schultz’s previous departure, we believe the company is transitioning to a new CEO during a period of strength, with a solid macro-economic backdrop, a strong leadership team, and a robust pipeline of innovation in technology, food, beverages,” RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer wrote in a note. \nStarbucks was the first to push into mobile ordering and payments through its app, allowing customers to avoid standing in long lines and forcing rivals like Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc and Panera Bread Co to follow suit. The mobile payments strategy has proved hugely successful – a quarter of all transactions in Starbucks’ latest quarter was through mobile phones. \nStarbucks’ quarterly revenue has risen at a pace of at least 7 percent since 2009, much faster than that of Dunkin’ and McDonald’s Corp. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said in a note that Schultz’s plans to “premiumize” the Starbucks brand should allow the broader store network to continue to thrive. \nThe outgoing CEO said on Thursday that in his new role he would focus on building the ultra-premium Starbucks Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world, which analysts said was a worthwhile endeavor. Starbucks is trying to stave off competition from super-premium coffee rivals such as Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia. \nThe company opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in 2014 in Seattle – Starbucks’ birthplace – to roast and sell limited-supply Reserve coffees. It plans to open three more in Shanghai, New York and Tokyo. Best of Express ",

The Seattle-based company announced Thursday that Kevin Johnson will become chief executive as of April 3.

Starbucks Corp., down $1.30 to $57.21 The coffee chain said Howard Schultz will step down as CEO in April, but will remain chairman. Smith & Wesson Holding Corp., down $2.88 to $21.10 Investors were disappointed with the firearms maker's guidance. Five Below Inc., up $3.94 to $43.82 The discount retailer said its sales are off to a strong start in the holiday season. Charles Schwab Inc., down 85 cents to $38.76 Banks slipped after a strong run over the last three weeks, partly because bond yields weakened. Workday Inc., down $10.20 to $71.40 The human resources software maker gave a weak forecast and said some customers have delayed large deals. Ascena Retail Group Inc., up $1.18 to $7.01 The retailer reported stronger sales than investors expected at its Ann Taylor and Dressbarn businesses.

      "text": "Freed from CEO role, Schultz to focus on Starbucks upscale push Howard Schultz is ready for his next project: Starbucks 2.0. PHOTO: REUTERS Dec 3, 2016 1:37 PM \n[NEW YORK] Howard Schultz is ready for his next project: Starbucks 2.0. \nMr Schultz, who will become executive chairman when he steps down as chief executive officer at Starbucks Corp next year, says he'll focus on his three-pronged bet that the world's largest coffee chain needs to become even more upscale. The program includes a line of premium coffee called Reserve, as many as 1,000 cafes that will showcase the new brand and flagship stores as large as 20,000 square feet called Roasteries. \nThe 63-year-old executive, a billionaire who built a caffeine empire by bringing Italian coffee culture to the American mainstream, will soon be free from the daily grind of running a US$21 billion business. That will allow him to devote his attention to a key growth initiative that's been slow to gain momentum over the past two years. \n\"When you're making an investment and taking a risk like this, there's no better person to spearhead it than Howard,\" said Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc, which tracks the restaurant industry. \"He has a very high chance of succeeding in this type of role and helping the brand evolve.\" \nWith more and more shopping done online, Mr Schultz has said he wants to emulate the brick-and-mortar retail experiences offered by innovators like Nike and Apple. Starbucks opened the first Roastery location two years ago, a 15,000-square-foot emporium in its hometown of Seattle, and is planning others in New York, Shanghai and Tokyo. The menu includes small-lot coffee from around the world that can sell for more than US$20 a pound. \nThe cavernous stores, where customers can watch coffee being roasted on site, are envisioned as high-end flagships for the company, but rollout has been slowed by high construction costs and trouble finding suitable real estate. \nAnalysts are skeptical that a handful of Roasteries can move the needle for the massive company, which operates more than 16,000 cafes worldwide. Instead, they say financial growth is expected to come from the Reserve locations. The new cafes are planned to be similar to the Roasteries but without the actual bean-cooking operation. \nIt's part of a move by Mr Schultz to add different store concepts around the world and reimagine the 45-year-old chain. \n\"He's always had grand visions for where Starbucks can go,\" said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The ability for him to separate himself from the day-to-day running of the company and focus on big ideas is well within his wheelhouse.\" Starbucks said Mr Schultz wasn't available to be interviewed for this article. \nTo be sure, there are risks in going more upscale. Some customers already balk at paying more than US$5 for a coffee drink, and with rising health-care costs and stagnant wage growth causing anxiety among US consumers, the effort could run into headwinds, particularly if there's an economic downturn, Ms Bartashus said. \nStarbucks needs the Reserve cafes to work because there's more and more competition from local and regional chains that are pulling in younger customers. To secure the next generation of consumers, Starbucks has to convince millennials that it's a cool place for coffee - a difficult proposition after four decades that saw the company grow to become a mainstream brand like McDonald's. \nStarbucks is also pushing into the Chinese market, with plans to open hundreds of stores. Growing domestically won't be easy given the rise of competitors such as Blue Bottle, Stumptown and Intelligentsia, independent chains that cater to a premium audience. \nIt's those chains that are pressuring Starbucks, in addition to mainstream competitors like Dunkin' Donuts or Coffee & Bagels, a new chain being developed by JAB Holding Co. The European investment firm backed by Austria's billionaire Reimann family has used acquisitions, including Stumptown and Krispy Kreme, to build its own coffee empire. \nWhen Mr Schultz acquired the then-six-unit chain in the late 1980s, it wasn't typical for Americans to spend hours in a cafe sipping expensive coffee. That changed, and with Starbucks established as a daily ritual for millions of Americans, Mr Schultz is once again focused on changing their habits. \nThe move upscale is in line with where the restaurant has been heading in recent years, and it helps that Starbucks sells a product that most customers consume daily and consider an affordable luxury, said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG Research. \n\"Being a premium brand is where it's at in this industry,\" he said. \"People gravitate to more and more expensive coffee.\" \nBLOOMBERG ",

By Craig GiammonaBloomberg \nHoward Schultz, the billionaire who built a caffeine empire by bringing Italian coffee culture to the American mainstream, is ready for his next project: Starbucks 2.0. \nSchultz, who will become executive chairman when he steps down as chief executive officer at Starbucks Corp. next year, says he'll focus on his three-pronged bet that the world's largest coffee chain needs to become more upscale. The program includes a line of premium coffee called Reserve, as many as 1,000 cafes that will showcase the new brand and flagship stores as large as 20,000 square feet called Roasteries. \nThe 63-year-old executive will soon be free from the daily grind of running a $21-billion business, allowing him to devote his attention to a key initiative that's been slow to gain momentum over the past two years. \n\"When you're making an investment and taking a risk like this, there's no better person to spearhead it than Howard,\" said Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc., which tracks the restaurant industry. \"He has a very high chance of succeeding in this type of role and helping the brand evolve.\" \nWith more shopping done online, Schultz has said he wants to emulate the brick-and-mortar retail experiences offered by innovators like Nike and Apple. Starbucks opened the first Roastery location two years ago, a 15,000-square-foot emporium in its hometown of Seattle, and is planning others in New York, Shanghai and Tokyo. The menu includes small-lot coffee from around the world that can sell for more than $20 a pound. \nThe cavernous stores, where customers can watch coffee being roasted, are envisioned as high-end flagships for the company, but rollout has been slowed by high construction costs and trouble finding suitable real estate. \nAnalysts are skeptical that a handful of Roasteries can move the needle for the massive company, which operates more than 16,000 cafes worldwide. Instead, they say financial growth is expected to come from the Reserve locations. \nThe new cafes are planned to be similar to the Roasteries but without the actual bean-cooking operation. It's part of a move by Schultz to add different store concepts around the world and reimagine the 45-year-old chain. \n\"He's always had grand visions for where Starbucks can go,\" said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The ability for him to separate himself from the day-to-day running of the company and focus on big ideas is well within his wheelhouse.\" \nStarbucks said Schultz wasn't available to be interviewed for this article. \nTo be sure, there are risks in going more upscale. Some customers already balk at paying more than $5 for a coffee drink, and with rising health-care costs and stagnant wage growth causing anxiety among U.S. consumers, the effort could run into headwinds, particularly if there's an economic downturn, Bartashus said. \nWhen Schultz acquired the then-six-unit chain in the late 1980s, it wasn't typical for Americans to spend hours in a cafe sipping expensive coffee. That changed, and with Starbucks established as a daily ritual for millions of Americans, Schultz is once again focused on changing their habits. \nThe move upscale is in line with where the restaurant has been heading in recent years, and it helps that Starbucks sells a product that most customers consume daily and consider an affordable luxury, said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG Research. \n\"Being a premium brand is where it's at in this industry,\" he said. \"People gravitate to more and more expensive coffee.\" About Us",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at the Starbucks Annual Shareholders Meeting on Mar. 23 in Seattle. (Stephen Brashear/Getty Images)\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz, a vocal critic of Donald Trump during the election, said he is not concerned about the effect of the president-elect — or of his supporters — on the massive coffee chain’s business.\n“I’m not spending a lot of time on the cause and the effect of the Trump administration,” Schultz said Friday on CNBC . “Obviously we all want the president-elect to do well, but Starbucks is going to have to do what we do based on the things that we can control.”\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Schultz made it no secret that he supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , formally endorsing her in September. In a letter to Starbucks staff after Election Day, Schultz admitted he was “stunned” when Trump won — and called on Starbucks “partners” to choose to treat others with kindness, compassion and respect.\n“We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,” Schultz wrote then . “I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.”\nAfter the bitter and divisive election came to an end last month, there have been numerous incidents reported at various Starbucks stores involving Trump supporters.\nRecently, video of Florida resident David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks barista went viral . Sanguesa claimed afterward that he had been the victim of “anti-white discrimination” and that the employee refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter. (“Because I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost! Now give me my money back,” Sanguesa can be heard shouting at the barista in the video. “What is your name? I want your name. I want your card. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”)\n[ ‘I voted for Trump! You lost!’: White Starbucks customer accuses barista of ‘discrimination’ ]\nA witness said Sanguesa simply got angry because his coffee order took too long.\nAround the same time, video surfaced of a Starbucks barista at a different location refusing to write “Trump” on someone’s cup . Soon afterward, Los Angeles political consultant Tim Treadstone urged his social-media followers to launch “Operation #TrumpCup” — that is, to visit Starbucks, ask them to write “Trump” on their cups and to take video if any employees refused.\nA man who claimed to be a Trump voter was filmed accusing a female Starbucks employee in Miami of \"discrimination\" on Nov. 16. (Twitter/Jorge de Cárdenas) On CNBC, Schultz directly addressed questions of whether such incidents might indicate Starbucks and its corporate values meant the chain was “at odds” with Trump and his supporters.\n“I don’t think on any level that the brand or what we represent is at odds with the president-elect or his supporters,” Schultz told CNBC. “90 million customers a week are going through Starbucks stores and I assume many of them voted for Donald Trump.”\nHe added that the business needed to separate its prospects “from the Trump administration and the momentum in the stock market” but would also continue to push on “a number of social issues.”\nSchultz did not elaborate on what those issues might be, only saying that they have not been addressed by Republican administrations in the past and that he hoped Trump would address them in his administration.\n“I think that as we go forward we will have an active voice in demonstrating the moral courage to address things that we think are important to the promise of America and the American dream,” Schultz said.\n[ A Starbucks barista refused to write ‘Trump’ on a cup. How his supporters are striking back. ]\nHis comments were in line with Schultz’s long record of getting involved in social or political issues, sometimes at the risk of alienating customers.\nLast year, Starbucks urged baristas to write “Race Together” on the sides of its coffee cups, in an effort to engage customers in difficult conversations about race relations in America. The campaign sparked criticism and even ridicule online but had seemingly little effect at the store level . And each year, whether intentionally or not, Starbucks finds itself in the middle of a heated debate over what, exactly, the color of its holiday coffee cup is supposed to mean .\nStarbucks’ plain-red holiday cup last year attracted the ire of none other than Trump himself, who suggested to his supporters at a rally last November to boycott the coffee chain .\n“Did you read about Starbucks?” Trump asked the crowd in Springfield, Ill., to loud boos. “No more ‘Merry Christmas’ at Starbucks. No more. … Maybe we should boycott Starbucks.”\nStarbucks is no stranger to such cultural debates, as The Washington Post’s Maura Judkis noted :\nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It’s always Starbucks, isn’t it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the “Christ” out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is “Trump” so that she will have to call out “Trump, party of three!”\nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops.\nSchultz will step aside next April to focus on other Starbucks corporate initiatives, the company announced last Thursday . Kevin Johnson, the company’s chief operating officer, will take over as CEO then. Schultz said he plans to stay on as chairman.\nRead more:\n‘We have a culture war to win’: Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy\n‘And I voted for Trump!

      "text": "News, analysis and commentary on income-generating investments. Search Income Investing2 December 2, 2016, 5:48 P.M. ET Starbucks CEO Leaving Could Be Bad for the Bonds, Too By Amey Stone \nShares of Starbucks ( SBUX ) fell 2.2% to $57.21 Friday after CEO Howard Schultz announced Thursday that he would be stepping down as head of the coffee company . Kevin Johnson , the current chief operating officer, will assume the CEO job next April. \nThe bonds didn’t show as much reaction, but were negative nonetheless. The price of the 2.45% coupon senior secured notes maturing in 2026, for example, fell from $95.59 to $94.94, according to Bloomberg. The yield judged up to 3% from just below that level. \nEven though Moody’s analyst William Fahy didn’t change his rating, he did issue a report pointing to Schultz’s departure as “credit negative” because it “creates uncertainty” at the company. He writes further: \nDespite Kevin Johnson’s extensive experience, which includes being a Starbucks board member for the past seven years and his daily involvement as COO for the past two years, the exceptional success, insight and vision of founder Howard Schultz is not easily replaced. This was previously evident when he stepped down as CEO in 2000 and the company’s fortunes subsequently hit a difficult performance period. Since Schultz returned in 2008, Starbucks has become a much larger, more diverse and financially stronger company. While we do not anticipate any changes to Starbuck’s strategic initiatives or targeted financial policies, it is still too early to know whether Johnson can maintain the kind of momentum and vision that Schultz brought to the role. \nMoody’s rates Starbucks A2, a mid-level of investment grade, with a stable outlook — for now at least.

      "text": "The Unofficial Ranking of This Year's Starbucks Red Cups Spoon University 2 days ago Katie Andrade\nRed Cup Season is finally here! In order to combat the drama over the 2015 holiday cups, which many complained were not Christmas-y enough, Starbucks decided to leave this year's design in the hands of their loyal customers.\nLast December, the company encouraged people to send in their holiday cup designs via Instagram. They received over 1,200 submissions within eight days and managed to narrow it down to 13 different designs.\nFor the first time ever, Starbucks will have multiple holiday cups that all share a similar theme and color scheme. Each cup size has a few different designs and are mixed together to create a fun element of surprise for customers.\nSince the cups unveiling in stores on November 10th, it is clear that everyone has their favorites. I even heard one girl ask for a different cup because she didn’t like the design she received (and I’m sure she’s not the first).\nThat is why I decided that for the sake of keeping the red cup drama alive, I would (unofficially) rank the holiday cups from my least favorite to favorite design.\nKeep in mind that this ranking is based on my own preferences and I am aware that many won't agree with me. That's what makes this year's holiday cups so special because it gives everyone the opportunity to find the one that speaks to them.\nThe Unofficial Ranking #13 © 90seop_ on Instagram Instagram photo by ᴘʀᴇᴄɪᴏᴜs ᴍᴇᴍᴏʀʏ ✨ Sorry, seasonal iced coffee lovers, but this one comes last by default because it’s not red. Enough said.\n#12 © lesliechoy on Instagram Instagram photo by distant dreamer I really wish the string of lights was white on this one. The black is just way top harsh making it seem out of place among the other designs.\n#11 © jayyujie on Instagram Instagram photo by Jay Yu Jie This design is nice but it just isn’t Christmas-y enough for my tastes.\n#10 © evelynlingg on Instagram Instagram photo by evelyn. This design is just far too busy for my eyes. I wish it was toned down just a little.\n#9 © illbringthelipstick on Instagram Instagram photo by @illbringthelipstick I wish the design went all the way around the cup because it's so cute and charming.\n#8 © starbuckscanada on Instagram Instagram photo by Starbucks Canada This design reminds me of a better version of the doodles I used to draw all over my middle school notebooks.\n#7 © ab_yun on Instagram Instagram photo by Y U N This design reminds me of something you’d see in a children’s Christmas book and I bet that is why they choose it for their short size.\n#6 © alliyahcha on Instagram Instagram photo by KHLOE 🌎 This design is so beautifully drawn making me wish it went all the way around the cup.\n#5 © 1996___huang on Instagram Instagram photo by ᴬᴺ ᵞᵁᴺ This design proves that less is more. I love how minimalist it is.\n#4 © mjteo on Instagram Instagram photo by Gabriel Teo 🤖 This design should be printed on a Christmas sweater. The Fair Aisle design in combination with all intricate details really makes it special.\n#3 © krzn_ on Instagram Instagram photo by @krzn_ This design has really grown on me. There's just something so whimsical and airy about it. It's definitely the prettiest of the bunch.\n#2 © margauxpepper on Instagram Instagram photo by Margaux Pepper This design is the most unique out of them all. It reminds me of that magical feeling of walking outside the morning after the first snowfall of the season.\n#1 © vania_sancheeze on Instagram Instagram photo by @vania_sancheeze This design just screams Christmas to me. It’s so cheerful and has just enough going on making it hands down my favorite.\nWhile were on the topic of Starbucks, check out these awesome #SpoonTips on how to upgrade your favorite holiday beverage and take this quiz to find out which holiday drink you are.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Howard Schultz Says Goodbye to His Starbucks Empire By , 11:47 A.M. The departing Starbucks C.E.O. Howard Schultz’s narrative about his company is one of excellence and focus, but it’s really one of unrelenting expansion. Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY SPENCER PLATT / GETTY In the summer of 1995, when my parents told my sister and me that we’d be moving to Seattle, I started listening to Nirvana as a kind of preparatory exercise. I didn’t realize until we arrived that I was too late. Kurt Cobain had died a year earlier and with him so had the grunge movement. Seattle was starting its transformation from a gritty port into the bourgeois neo-San Francisco that it would become. And the dominant cultural phenomenon of the summer of 1995 was Starbucks, which had been founded in Seattle, in 1971, but was just starting to expand outside of the region. Starbucks was the Stumptown of the nineties, and Seattleites were proud of it and its C.E.O., Howard Schultz. I spent more of the eighth and ninth grades, after arriving in Seattle, drinking Frappuccinos—the gateway coffee of my generation—than I did listening to “In Utero.” By the time I was in college, of course, Starbucks had lost its cachet. By creating a culture of high-end-coffee consumption in the U.S., Starbucks had encouraged the rise of smaller cafés, which felt cozier and sold better-tasting coffee. Also, as Starbucks had expanded, the coffee had developed a reputation for tasting burnt and too strong (some coffee snobs called it “Charbucks”), and the universality of the coffee shops’ design made them feel like just another chain restaurant. Schultz, who announced his retirement on Thursday, likes to recall a crisis that involved the ill-conceived buildup, in the mid-aughts, of Starbucks stores. Schultz had retired for the first time in 2000, but under his successor Starbucks had expanded too fast, more than tripling the number of stores, to almost seventeen thousand, over eight years. In addition to hurting Starbucks’s reputation—the ubiquity in itself was uncool, and the assembly-line coffee brewing was bad for quality—this had cost too much. In 2008, as the recession made four-dollar lattes seem almost obscene, Schultz returned as C.E.O. and oversaw the decision to close six hundred stores, which would help the company ride out the recession by bringing costs under control. Schultz describes the experience in his 2011 memoir, “Onward”: “These were not just doors we would be closing. We would be disrupting lives, on both sides of the counter.” Starbucks also shut down all its U.S. stores for a period of hours to retrain its whole staff and took other steps to insure higher-quality drinks. All this was tough, Schultz writes, but he had to do it because too many stores were just not good enough. This has since become a defining period in the company’s narrative of itself—evidence of its commitment to excellence, which, in Schultz’s telling, is the reason Starbucks has thrived since his return. Schultz’s interest in excellence persists. In leaving the C.E.O. post, he will be staying at Starbucks but focussing on Starbucks Reserve, the company’s new premium brand. The narrative about excellence has been repeated often in stories about Schultz and his company, which is odd, because it doesn’t take a Stumptown barista to know that the experience of going into a Starbucks is not particularly excellent. Starbucks’s coffee remains bad-tasting, its shops generic, its food not much better than what you’d find in a grocery store’s to-go aisle. Yet Starbucks as a business has thrived. The company reported revenue of more than twenty-one billion dollars in its 2016 fiscal year, more than double what it made the year Schultz came back. (Its stock, after falling to less than four dollars a share in 2008, is now around sixty dollars.) The reason, it turns out, is straightforward: contrary to the narrative at the center of his memoir, Schultz has spent most of his second stint at Starbucks aggressively expanding. In 2008, there were 16,680 Starbucks stores around the world. In 2009, the year of the high-profile closures, there were 16,635. And by 2010 the number had risen, again, to 16,858. Currently, the number of stores stands at more than twenty-four thousand. It’s true that Starbucks closed hundreds of low-performing stores during the recession, but it opened far more during that period, in places that didn’t already have too many Starbucks outlets and where costs could be kept down, and doubled down on that approach when the recession ended. Starbucks has especially proliferated abroad. The company has been opening five hundred stores a year in China and hopes to have five thousand there by 2021. Next year, it even plans to enter Italy, where Schultz originally found inspiration, in the eighties, to open a chain of high-end coffee shops. Schultz attributes his worldwide success to how much people love Starbucks. “There are very few consumer brands in the world—products or experiences—that have created both an undeniable customer attachment to the brand while also seeing universal acceptance,” he recently said. In countries like China, though, Starbucks’s success appears to have less to do with excellence than with the fact that, as in the U.S. in the nineties, coffee culture is new—and Starbucks happens to be the company introducing it. Starbucks is an excellent company in many ways. It is financially successful. The company also offers a progressive benefit system for employees, though it has sometimes been pressured into improving its workplace. Schultz has been appealingly eager to engage with messy political issues that other C.E.O.s avoid, endorsing Hillary Clinton for President and, last year, spearheading an idealistic, if ill-advised, campaign, called Race Together, encouraging baristas to discuss race with their customers. There are plenty of things that are distinctive about Starbucks. But the coffee isn’t one of them. \nVauhini Vara, the former business editor of newyorker.com, is a contributing writer for the site.

      "text": "Save December 2, 2016 \nHoward Schultz of Starbucks is a frothy coffee legend. He even wrote a book about turning round the café chain, entitled How Starbucks Fought For Its Life Without Losing Its Soul . \nNow Starbucks aims to lose Mr Schultz as chief executive — he will remain chairman — without losing its mojo, as when he previously stepped down. \nOn Friday, Starbucks shares responded by dropping 2.4 per cent. The nervousness is natural. The brisk growth inspired by Mr Schultz has slowed just a touch, putting extra pressure on new boss, Kevin Johnson. \nDespite a capitalisation just shy of $83bn, Starbucks has remained a phenomenal growth story. Its revenue has grown at an annual, average rate of 13 per cent over the past five years. It will add another 2,000 outlets to its total of 25,000 next year. \nSales at shops already open have averaged double digits in recent years. Those figures are dipping now but remain firmly positive. Former high flyers such as Chipotle and Whole Foods can only dream of such turnover. \nThe concern for Starbucks is that its premium valuation — it trades at nearly 30 times forward earnings — will slip without Mr Schultz in charge. \nMr Johnson is a credible successor. A board member for the past seven years and its operating chief since last year, he is a long-time technology executive. Starbucks’ mobile phone app has spurred customer traffic. \nIt is also questionable just how removed Mr Schultz will stay from the fray. He remains executive chairman and will focus on Starbucks’ new “high-end concept” (if its ordinary format is too plebeian for you). And he will also stay active on social and political issues. \nMr Schultz’s obsessiveness, more than any other factor, is responsible for the Starbucks phenomenon. The challenge for Mr Johnson is to be equally finicky, and to such good effect that Mr Schultz steps back and lets him get on with it. \nEmail the Lex team at Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

      "text": "Why I'm Bullish On Starbucks Despite Dollar Strength Dec. 3.16 Summary \nStarbucks’s performance could be hurt by a stronger dollar. \nBut this risk is outweighed by its international growth opportunities and scope for improved performance in the domestic market. \nA resilient business model could help Starbucks to perform relatively well in a restaurant recession and attract investors in what could be an uncertain political and economic climate in 2017. The dollar index has reached a high of 102 in the last month . This is its highest level in over a decade and is partly due to the prospect of a more hawkish Federal Reserve operating under a Trump Presidency. His plans to reduce taxes and increase public spending could lead to inflation, which may warrant a higher interest rate. In fact, interest rates are forecast to rise to 2.25% in the next three years , which could strengthen the dollar even further. For companies such as Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) which have major (and rapidly increasing) international exposure, a stronger dollar could mean a squeeze on sales, margins and profitability. While this is a risk for the business over the medium term, I'm still bullish about Starbucks's prospects. I believe that the scale of its growth opportunity in emerging markets, its resilience in the domestic market, improving customer loyalty and greater use of technology will more than offset negative currency translation moving forward. Emerging market potential In its most recent quarter, Starbucks announced the opening of its first stores in emerging market economies such as Cambodia, Kazakhstan and Slovakia. This provides the company with a significant growth opportunity in my view, since rising wealth and disposable incomes mean that consumer goods spending is set to increase by 3.6% across the emerging world in 2016. However, Starbucks' biggest opportunity in the emerging world continues to be in larger emerging economies such as China and India, where consumer goods growth is forecast to be 9.5% and 7% respectively in 2016 . In China, Starbucks' strategy to open 500 new stores per annum over the next four years has the potential to dramatically improve its financial performance. Further, the growth rate in sales of consumer goods is expected to be around 7% over the next four years . This should provide a tailwind to Starbucks' newly opened stores. Similarly, in India Starbucks is in the process of increasing the size of its estate, while also attempting to gain exposure to the lucrative tea market. It has partnered with Tata Beverages in a joint venture which will see its Teavana products sold in over 80 tea shops across India . This is part of a wider push which will see the company attempt to gain a share of the Asia tea market and seek to generate $3 billion per annum in sales in the next five years . With China's tea market being worth $9.5 billion per annum alone , this pivot towards tea in Asia could prove to be a sound strategic move in my view. Domestic opportunities Scope for a rise in the size of Starbucks' estate in the domestic market is clearly lower than in emerging markets. The US is a more saturated market, but still offers the opportunity for Starbucks to improve its pricing power. This could help it to record higher sales and margins moving forward. One way that Starbucks is seeking to boost its pricing power in the US is through an improved customer experience. Starbucks has adopted technology to a greater extent than many of its main rivals, with the use of mobile ordering becoming increasingly popular. In fact, the proportion of Starbucks's sales which were derived from the mobile app increased from 5% to 6% in the most recent quarter. A mobile app not only improves customer convenience, it also helps to differentiate Starbucks from the competition. Dovetailing with this is Starbucks's increasingly popular customer loyalty programme. Numbers enrolled in the programme increased by 18% in Q3 and there are now over 12 million active members in the US and Canada . The loyalty programme should help to boost Starbucks's pricing power moving forward, with it also providing the company with data on shopping habits and the take-up of new products. This could help the company to decide where to locate new stores, as well as provide guidance on which products are working well with different demographics. It could lead to a more efficient business with higher sales and margins in the domestic market. Outlook As well as growth opportunities in the US and in emerging economies, Starbucks offers a relatively resilient and stable business model. Coffee is more akin to a consumer staple than a consumer good, and so is less likely to be impacted by the potential for a restaurant recession than other food and beverage outlets. Further, Starbucks has wide geographical diversity, which reduces its risk profile yet further. Given the likelihood of increased uncertainty in 2017 in both an economic and political sense from higher interest rates and a new administration, Starbucks' robust business could become more popular among increasingly risk averse investors in my view. Certainly, Starbucks' sales and profitability are likely to be affected by a stronger US dollar. With non-US sales accounting for around 20% (and rising) of Starbucks's total sales , the six rises in interest rates which are forecast over the next three years could lead to negative pressure on the company's top and bottom lines. However, in my view, Starbucks has a major growth opportunity in China, India and the emerging world which outweighs the risks of negative currency effects. Further, its opportunity to develop increased pricing power through product differentiation and higher levels of customer loyalty should positively catalyse its domestic growth. And its relatively stable business model and geographical diversity could appeal if uncertainty rises among investors in 2017. As such, I'm bullish on Starbucks in the long run despite the risks posed by a stronger dollar.

      "text": "Pinterest \nAlthough Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz, was a vocal critic of Donald Trump during his campaign, Shultz now insists his company isn’t anti-Trump. \nPresident Elect Donald Trump won the November election, and the American vote proves his popularity. Maybe that’s why Mr. Schultz has ended his public opposition to Trump and admits now that he is “hopeful” and wants the president elect to do well. \nOf course, scandals involving your employees refusing to serve Trump supporters don’t leave much wiggle room for further negative publicity. \n“The dysfunction and the polarization we’ve seen for years hopefully is not going to continue. But what’s been coming out so far is not as encouraging as one would hope,” Schultz told CNBC . \n“I don’t think on any level that the brand or what we represent is at odds with the president-elect or his supporters,” he continued. “Ninety million customers a week are going through Starbucks stores, and I assume many of them voted for Donald Trump.” \n“I’m not spending a lot of time on the cause and the effect of the Trump administration,” Schultz also told CNBC on Friday. “Obviously we all want the president-elect to do well, but Starbucks is going to have to do what we do based on the things that we can control.” \nWalking the razor edge of pleasing liberals without discouraging conservative consumers leaves Schultz abandoning his former dump-on-Trump rhetoric for carefully safeguarded PR scripts. \nHe at least knows now that public opinion isn’t favorable of lambasting Donald Trump. He’s made it very clear that Starbucks shouldn’t be seen as at odds with the President Elect. \nThe Washington Post reports: \nThroughout the presidential campaign, Schultz made it no secret that he supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , formally endorsing her in September. In a letter to Starbucks staff after Election Day, Schultz admitted he was “stunned” when Trump won — and called on Starbucks “partners” to choose to treat others with kindness, compassion and respect. \n“We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,” Schultz wrote then . “I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.” \nSchultz also announced last week that he plans to resign as the company’s CEO to become executive chairman starting in April. \nLet us know what you think of Shultz’s turnaround, and sound off in the comments below!

      "text": "The departing Starbucks C.E.O. Howard Schultz’s narrative about his company is one of excellence and focus, but it’s really one of unrelenting expansion. Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY SPENCER PLATT / GETTY In the summer of 1995, when my parents told my sister and me that we’d be moving to Seattle, I started listening to Nirvana as a kind of preparatory exercise. I didn’t realize until we arrived that I was too late. Kurt Cobain had died a year earlier and with him so had the grunge movement. Seattle was starting its transformation from a gritty port into the bourgeois neo-San Francisco that it would become. And the dominant cultural phenomenon of the summer of 1995 was Starbucks, which had been founded in Seattle, in 1971, but was just starting to expand outside of the region. Starbucks was the Stumptown of the nineties, and Seattleites were proud of it and its C.E.O., Howard Schultz. I spent more of the eighth and ninth grades, after arriving in Seattle, drinking Frappuccinos—the gateway coffee of my generation—than I did listening to “In Utero.” By the time I was in college, of course, Starbucks had lost its cachet. By creating a culture of high-end-coffee consumption in the U.S., Starbucks had encouraged the rise of smaller cafés, which felt cozier and sold better-tasting coffee. Also, as Starbucks had expanded, the coffee had developed a reputation for tasting burnt and too strong (some coffee snobs called it “Charbucks”), and the universality of the coffee shops’ design made them feel like just another chain restaurant.\nSchultz, who announced his retirement on Thursday, likes to recall a crisis that involved the ill-conceived buildup, in the mid-aughts, of Starbucks stores. Schultz had retired for the first time in 2000, but under his successor Starbucks had expanded too fast, more than tripling the number of stores, to almost seventeen thousand, over eight years. In addition to hurting Starbucks’s reputation—the ubiquity in itself was uncool, and the assembly-line coffee brewing was bad for quality—this had cost too much. In 2008, as the recession made four-dollar lattes seem almost obscene, Schultz returned as C.E.O. and oversaw the decision to close six hundred stores, which would help the company ride out the recession by bringing costs under control. Schultz describes the experience in his 2011 memoir, “Onward”: “These were not just doors we would be closing. We would be disrupting lives, on both sides of the counter.” Starbucks also shut down all its U.S. stores for a period of hours to retrain its whole staff and took other steps to insure higher-quality drinks. All this was tough, Schultz writes, but he had to do it because too many stores were just not good enough. This has since become a defining period in the company’s narrative of itself—evidence of its commitment to excellence, which, in Schultz’s telling, is the reason Starbucks has thrived since his return. Schultz’s interest in excellence persists. In leaving the C.E.O. post, he will be staying at Starbucks but focussing on Starbucks Reserve, the company’s new premium brand.\nThe narrative about excellence has been repeated often in stories about Schultz and his company, which is odd, because it doesn’t take a Stumptown barista to know that the experience of going into a Starbucks is not particularly excellent. Starbucks’s coffee remains bad-tasting, its shops generic, its food not much better than what you’d find in a grocery store’s to-go aisle. Yet Starbucks as a business has thrived. The company reported revenue of more than twenty-one billion dollars in its 2016 fiscal year, more than double what it made the year Schultz came back. (Its stock, after falling to less than four dollars a share in 2008, is now around sixty dollars.) The reason, it turns out, is straightforward: contrary to the narrative at the center of his memoir, Schultz has spent most of his second stint at Starbucks aggressively expanding. In 2008, there were 16,680 Starbucks stores around the world. In 2009, the year of the high-profile closures, there were 16,635. And by 2010 the number had risen, again, to 16,858. Currently, the number of stores stands at more than twenty-four thousand. It’s true that Starbucks closed hundreds of low-performing stores during the recession, but it opened far more during that period, in places that didn’t already have too many Starbucks outlets and where costs could be kept down, and doubled down on that approach when the recession ended.\nStarbucks has especially proliferated abroad. The company has been opening five hundred stores a year in China and hopes to have five thousand there by 2021. Next year, it even plans to enter Italy, where Schultz originally found inspiration, in the eighties, to open a chain of high-end coffee shops. Schultz attributes his worldwide success to how much people love Starbucks. “There are very few consumer brands in the world—products or experiences—that have created both an undeniable customer attachment to the brand while also seeing universal acceptance,” he recently said. In countries like China, though, Starbucks’s success appears to have less to do with excellence than with the fact that, as in the U.S. in the nineties, coffee culture is new—and Starbucks happens to be the company introducing it. Starbucks is an excellent company in many ways. It is financially successful. The company also offers a progressive benefit system for employees, though it has sometimes been pressured into improving its workplace. Schultz has been appealingly eager to engage with messy political issues that other C.E.O.s avoid, endorsing Hillary Clinton for President and, last year, spearheading an idealistic, if ill-advised, campaign, called Race Together, encouraging baristas to discuss race with their customers. There are plenty of things that are distinctive about Starbucks. But the coffee isn’t one of them.",

CBS News 4:00 Bus carrying cheerleaders crashes, 8 taken to hospital Reuters America 0:31 America has a new favorite poet MSNBC 7:02 UP NEXT Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, a vocal critic of Donald Trump during the election, said he is not concerned about the effect of the president-elect — or of his supporters — on the massive coffee chain’s business.\n“I’m not spending a lot of time on the cause and the effect of the Trump administration,” Schultz said Friday on CNBC . “Obviously we all want the president-elect to do well, but Starbucks is going to have to do what we do based on the things that we can control.”\nThroughout the presidential campaign, Schultz made it no secret that he supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , formally endorsing her in September. In a letter to Starbucks staff after Election Day, Schultz admitted he was “stunned” when Trump won — and called on Starbucks “partners” to choose to treat others with kindness, compassion and respect.\n“We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,” Schultz wrote then . “I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.”\nSince the bitter and divisive election came to an end last month, there have been numerous incidents reported at various Starbucks stores involving Trump supporters.\nRecently, video of Florida resident David Sanguesa berating a Starbucks barista went viral . Sanguesa claimed afterward that he had been the victim of “anti-white discrimination” and that the employee refused to serve him because he was a Trump supporter. (“Because I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost! Now give me my money back,” Sanguesa can be heard shouting at the barista in the video. “What is your name? I want your name. I want your card. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”)\nA witness said Sanguesa simply got angry because his coffee order took too long.\nAround the same time, video surfaced of a Starbucks barista at a different location refusing to write “Trump” on someone’s cup . Soon afterward, Los Angeles political consultant Tim Treadstone urged his social-media followers to launch “Operation #TrumpCup” — that is, to visit Starbucks, ask them to write “Trump” on their cups and to take video if any employees refused.\n© Stephen Brashear/Getty Images Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at the Starbucks Annual Shareholders Meeting on Mar. 23 in Seattle. On CNBC, Schultz directly addressed questions of whether such incidents might indicate Starbucks and its corporate values meant the chain was “at odds” with Trump and his supporters.\n“I don’t think on any level that the brand or what we represent is at odds with the president-elect or his supporters,” Schultz told CNBC. “Ninety million customers a week are going through Starbucks stores, and I assume many of them voted for Donald Trump.”\nHe added that the business needed to separate its prospects “from the Trump administration and the momentum in the stock market” but would also continue to push on “a number of social issues.”\nSchultz did not elaborate on what those issues might be, only saying that they have not been addressed by Republican administrations in the past and that he hoped Trump would address them in his administration.\n“I think that as we go forward we will have an active voice in demonstrating the moral courage to address things that we think are important to the promise of America and the American Dream,” Schultz said.\nHis comments were in line with Schultz’s long record of getting involved in social or political issues, sometimes at the risk of alienating customers.\nLast year, Starbucks urged baristas to write “Race Together” on the sides of its coffee cups, in an effort to engage customers in difficult conversations about race relations in America. The campaign sparked criticism and even ridicule online but had seemingly little effect at the store level . And each year, whether intentionally or not, Starbucks finds itself in the middle of a heated debate over what, exactly, the color of its holiday coffee cup is supposed to mean .\nStarbucks’ plain-red holiday cup last year attracted the ire of none other than Trump himself, who suggested to his supporters at a rally last November to boycott the coffee chain .\n“Did you read about Starbucks?” Trump asked the crowd in Springfield, Ill., to loud boos. “No more ‘Merry Christmas’ at Starbucks. No more. … Maybe we should boycott Starbucks.”\nStarbucks is no stranger to such cultural debates, as The Washington Post’s Maura Judkis noted :\nThe culture wars come every December, fueled by peppermint mochas and venti soy lattes. The battleground is Starbucks. It’s always Starbucks, isn’t it? No one is complaining that the blue-and-brown holiday cups at Caribou Coffee take the “Christ” out of Christmas. No one is telling the Olive Garden hostess that their name is “Trump” so that she will have to call out “Trump, party of three!”\nReligion. Politics. The Bill of Rights. They all converge here, in front of a glass case full of cake pops.\nSchultz will step aside as CEO next April to focus on other Starbucks corporate initiatives, the company announced last Thursday . Kevin Johnson, the company’s chief operating officer, will take over as CEO then. Schultz plans to stay on as chairman.\nRead more:\n‘We have a culture war to win’: Why Starbucks cups always stir up controversy\n‘And I voted for Trump!

      "text": "Columns »   Starbucks’ New Hot Apple Pie Latte Can Only Be Purchased In Japan Because We Can’t Have Nice Things   \nEver since PSL season ended, there’s been a significant void in my life. Sure, I’ve been trying to fill it with endless skinny peppermint mochas and gingerbread lattes, but there’s just something about combining seasonal spices and produce with hot coffee and warm steamed milk that fills your soul with joy. For coffee lovers in Japan, you’re in luck, because Starbucks just came out with an amazing hot apple pie latte that will keep you as warm inside as your favorite holiday sweater. Unfortunately for the rest of us, we’ll just have to figure out how to live without it. \nImage via Starbucks \nIf you ever wanted to pull a Shoshana, now is definitely the time because, like all of Starbucks’ other limited-edition drinks, this one won’t last long. In case you’re more of a cold beverage drinker, Starbs Japan will also be offering the hot apple pie latte in frappucino form, which looks like it contains actual apple pie pieces in it. Honestly, if I would have known that I could get the pie without all of the questions from relatives about why I’m not married yet, I probably would have given Thanksgiving a pass this year. Maybe it’s a good thing I won’t be able to get my hands on it after all. \nMissing out on this latte definitely sucks, but on the bright side, Starbucks just came out with yet another limited-edition drink for the U.S. to help us get through these dark and dangerous times. Hot chocolate and cookie lovers, head over to your nearest coffee shop for a red cup or twelve, because Starbs has just released a new snickerdoodle hot chocolate, which sounds like everything dreams are made of. Combining white chocolate with cinnamon dolce syrup with a sprinkle of the same cinnamon sugar everyone’s favorite cookie is rolled in has created the most magical drink you didn’t know you needed this holiday season. For extra holiday spirit, pair with a Starbucks toffeedoodle cookie and Instagram the shit out of that red cup – just do yourself a favor and try not to check the nutrition facts, ok?",

      "title": "Here's what happened the last time Howard Schultz stepped down as Starbucks CEO ($SBUX)",
      "text": "Howard Schultz. Stephen Brashear / Stringer / Getty Images \nOn Thursday, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced he is stepping down next year. \nThis isn't the first time Schultz, who first joined Starbucks in 1982, has stepped down from his position as CEO. It also happened 16 years ago — and it was a disaster for the coffee chain. \nIn 2000, Schultz stepped down after a 13-year run as CEO. He assumed the role of chairman, with the mission of focusing on the company's global strategy. \nThen Starbucks had only 2,800 stores and earned roughly $2 billion in annual revenue. There were just 350 Starbucks locations outside the US. \nIn the seven weeks after Schultz stepped down in 2000, shares fell 28%, MarketWatch reported. \nBut the company soon began a steady recovery. Under Schultz's replacement, Orin Smith, Starbucks' business exploded, with store count tripling to 9,000 locations. Starbucks made more than $5 billion in annual total net revenue in fiscal 2004. \nFlickr / kristina dymond \nSmith retired in 2005, and was replaced by Jim Donald. At the time, Schultz said Donald was picked for his stamina and hands-on approach, which Starbucks hoped would be assets as the chain swiftly expanded and built its food business. By 2007, the company had roughly 13,000 locations worldwide. \nSoon, however, it became clear that Starbucks' had opened too many stores too quickly. With increased pressure from brands like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, the chain struggled to continue to attract new customers and grow sales. \n\"I have said for 20 years that our success is not an entitlement and now it's proving to be a reality,\" Schultz wrote in a leaked memo to Donald in February 2007. In the note he said the chain had watered down its brand with changes such as automatic espresso machines and more \"sterile\" store designs. \nHoward Schultz and Jim Donald Bloomberg/AP \nStarbucks stock plummeted 42% in 2007 as the Great Recession took hold. \n\"The damage was slow and quiet, incremental, like a single loose thread that unravels a sweater inch by inch,\" Schultz said of Starbucks' troubles in his book, Onward . \nIn January 2008, Starbucks fired Donald and Schultz returned as CEO. \nSchultz debuted an aggressive turnaround plan with steps that included temporarily closing all US stores to re-train employees on how to make an espresso. Starbucks appointed the company's first chief technology officer and debuted its now legendary Starbucks' rewards card. In early 2009, the company closed 600 under-preforming US stores, 70% of which had been open for three years or less. \nWithin two years of Schultz's return, the company was back on track. Starbucks' stock hit a then all-time-high in mid-2011, beating its previous record set in 2006. The company's stock reached its peak of $ 62.61 in October 2015 . \nThe company's struggles from 2000 to 2008 make Schultz's recent decision to step down as CEO seem like an uneasy proposition for the company. However, Schultz has said his exit as CEO will be very different in 2016 than it was in 2000. \nStarbucks \n\"The differences between then and now couldn't be greater. In 2007, 2008, the country was going through a cataclysmic financial crisis that affected all companies, especially consumer brands, and Starbucks was not immune,\" Schultz said in a call with investors on Thursday. \nSchultz said he believes Starbucks' management team today has capabilities and experience the company lacked in 2000. \n\"On a personal level, I don't think I was as prepared then as I am now, primarily because of my confidence in the strategy, my confidence in the team, and my deep deep respect for Kevin Johnson as a servant leader,\" Schultz said. \nSchultz may now take a more hands-on approach to his role on the board than he did in the past, a period during which he said he \"wasn't engaged\" enough to notice and halt the company's downfall. \n\"I'm not leaving the company. I'm here every single day,\" he said in Thursday's call.",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO Steps Down To Focus On High-End Coffee, Shares Fall World | Reuters | Updated: December 05, 2016 01:14 IST EMAIL COMMENTS Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz speaks during their annual shareholders meeting (Reuters) Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive.Schultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans.Starbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008.\"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior.\"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations.Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure.\"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company.The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune.Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015.Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp.On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\"\"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management.\"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's.Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales.The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics.\"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.(Reporting by Gayathree Ganesan and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; additional writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Oatis) ÂŠ Thomson Reuters 2016 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

      "text": "Tweet Share FILE PHOTO: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington March 18, 2015. REUTERS/David Ryder/Files More By Lisa Baertlein and Gayathree Ganesan (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive to focus on new high-end coffee shops, handing the top job to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, a long-time technology executive. Schultz, who will become executive chairman in April 2017, said he would focus on building ultra-premium Reserve stores and showcase Roastery and Tasting Rooms around the world as well as setting the brand's \"social impact agenda\" that includes sending employees to college and recruiting veterans. Starbucks had signaled the change in July, but its shares fell 3.6 percent to $56.41 in extended trading on Thursday, as investors recalled the company's decline after Schultz handed over the reins in 2000. He returned in 2008. \"Having him step down as CEO raised the anxiety level,\" said Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh, who said that Schultz is the heart and soul of the brand, its entrepreneurial leader and its savior. \"We're in a much better position on every level,\" said Schultz, who returned for his second stint as CEO in the depths of the \"Great Recession,\" when Starbucks' stock was trading below $10. Late last year, it hit an all-time high above $60. Schultz has put Starbucks in the national spotlight, asking customers not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race relations. Many of the campaigns have generated controversy, but analysts have not seen a hit to financial results and the efforts have raised the profile of the coffee company and cemented Schultz's status as a national figure. \"The idea that he's replaceable, I think that's erroneous,\" said Bill Smead, CEO of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, which owns Starbucks shares. He compared the change to the retirement of long-time McDonald's Corp CEO Ray Kroc, who turned a handful of hamburger stands into the world's biggest restaurant company. The announcement on Thursday also came as investors worry about the restaurant industry's stubborn traffic declines. Starbucks has held up better than most, but it has not been immune. Johnson is a former technology executive who became president and chief operating officer at Starbucks in March 2015. Johnson has been on the Starbucks board since 2009 but most of his career was in the technology industry. He was the chief executive of Juniper Networks Inc from September 2008 to January 2014 and prior to that held several senior positions at Microsoft Corp. On a conference call after the announcement, analysts pressed the company on timing and whether, with Schultz stepping aside, senior management still had the \"merchant gene.\" \"Not having retail experience could be a problem over time,\" said Howard Penney, an analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management. \"I'm not leaving the company and I'm here every day,\" said Schultz, whose office is connected to Johnson's. Traffic at established Starbucks cafes fell in the last quarter, which Johnson has attributed to a change in the company's loyalty program, and Starbucks forecast a mid-single-digit rise in 2017 same-store sales. The company dismissed speculation that Schultz could be preparing for a new career in politics. \"He has no plans to run for political office, as he has said many times, and will remain with the company as Starbucks executive chairman, focusing on premium coffee,\" a spokeswoman said.

      "text": "Ever so quietly, Shake Shack ( SHAK ) is quickly becoming the Starbucks ( SBUX ) of mobile ordering hamburgers and shakes.\nThe upstart better burger chain has expanded its new mobile ordering capability to 27 locations out of its total of 56 in the U.S., according to data compiled by TheStreet . Most recently, Shake Shack has debuted the service in several locations in Philadelphia.\nShake Shack's biggest push has come in its home market of New York (also its largest), where mobile ordering is live in nine out of 18 sites. Mobile ordering is still not available in Shake Shack's busiest New York City locations such as Grand Central Terminal, Herald Square and birthplace in Madison Square Park. That's likely in large part due to executives trying to figure out how to solve the operational challenges of servicing the crazy long lines at these high-profile spots while also being inundated with mobile orders.\nBut, there soon may be a test site on how to pull off such a feat.\n\"It [mobile ordering] will be here [Penn Station] soon--you'll see mobile ordering coming to every Shake Shack,\" Shake Shack's senior vice president of operations Zach Koff told TheStreet in an interview (video below) ahead of the opening of the company's new location in busy transit hub Penn Station on Saturday. \"It will be super critical at a place like Penn Station--you could sit on the train and order and then have it ready when you arrive,\" Koff added.",

Shultz will also remain as chairman of the Board. \nShultz's roots with Starbucks reach all the way back to 1981, when he joined the fledgling single coffee shop as its marketing head. Under his leadership, the brand grew from a single small store to a massive multinational corporation. He left for a hiatus in the early 2000s but returned as CEO in 2008. \nNew CEO Kevin Johnson has served as COO since mid 2015, and has overseen many duties of the company in that timeframe. \nStarbucks shares fell $2.36 (-4.03%) to $56.15 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Prior to today's management shake-up, SBUX had already fallen -2.53% year-to-date, versus a +7.7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. \n    ETF Daily News",

He took care of his workforce with college benefits , health care and a daily wellness regimen of tai chai and frappa-chin-ups. \n\n3. He founded a global culture based on expensive beverage addiction, cutting across ethnicity, tribe and religion. He dared to enter unreached and repressive societies as farflung as China , Egypt and Spokane. \n\n4.He stood tall for family values by resisting America’s bikini barista trend, and by covering the topless mermaid on the original Starbucks cup . \n\n5. He helped lazy men everywhere by popularizing the world’s most impersonal fallback option: the Starbucks gift card. Related content",
