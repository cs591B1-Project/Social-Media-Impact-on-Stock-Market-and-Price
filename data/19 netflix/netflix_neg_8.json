This includes Nick Swardson, David Spade, and Rob Schneider along the way and a slew of special guests like Tim Meadows and the fantastic Norm Macdonald . That’s an official title, of course, which Norm proves almost every time he’s on TV. His last time on Conan was weird and fun, forcing the host to lose it many times throughout the interview. \nThursday was more of the same, with Norm outshining Sandler and the rest of the group during a huge chat. Better yet, he did it all by just being the Norm that people know and love. Gracious, funny, kind, and much more. You get a lot of this in the first segment when he and Sandler are discussing their first movie together, Billy Madison. While it’s a lot to describe with words, he makes the entire chat worth it and really sells the story. I can’t really blame the other guys for not bringing top notch comedy after being on the road night after night, but there are a few moments in there. \n\nThe end of the interview really shows the depth of the friendship between these guys, giving all of them a chance to give Conan a little praise for his successes over the years and to look back on Conan’s big move from SNL to Late Night. Macdonald also turns on the emotions a bit to thank Sandler and the rest for being so kind. It’s nice, even if it is preceded by a joke about sucking off David Spade. \nThe interview closes out with Sandler picking up the guitar to sing a tune about saying goodbye to an “Old Chair.” It’s no “Hanukkah Song,” but it’s nice to see Sandler doing something other than these movies we’ve seen over the past few years . \n\n(Via Team Coco )\n",

      "text": "More Amazon is poised to challenge Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) on the global stage with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, The Wall Street Journal reported. Amazon Prime Video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. Prime will likely expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Journal report. This would put the Seattle-based online retail titan's on-demand video service on a level playing field with Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. When contacted by AFP, an Amazon spokeswoman would only confirm that a popular original show titled \"The Grand Tour\" and devoted to cars would launch in more than 200 countries in December. \"We don't have anything else to announce,\" she said. The worldwide, exclusive availability of \"The Grand Tour\" and its mention in a tweet fired off by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos will likely fuel speculation that this a first step toward a full-fledged global Prime Video service that will directly challenge Netflix. How the show would be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service. If Amazon Prime Video expands globally, it will be the most formidable rival to Netflix at a time when the California-based company's ability to win new fans is being closely watched by investors. - Eyes on Netflix (Swiss: NFLX-USD.SW - news ) - Netflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over growth. The company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers. Of that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company was gaining momentum as a global television service. For the current quarter Netflix forecasted a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. The service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers. The earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street. The on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange (LSE: 0OQV.L - news ) is the New Black.\" - Offering originals - Netflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. Online platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit (Stuttgart: A1139A - news ) . Prime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store. Like Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in original programming to win subscribers. Original Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won Emmy Awards, considered prestigious television accolades in the US. Amazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier. Reblog",

      "text": "It commonly happens in stock investing that investors miss the chance of buying winning stocks that they knew would stand out. Before they take the plunge, others get to know the hidden potential and enter into these stocks, pushing them out of reach.\n\nSo, instead of repenting, spotting the off-the-radar potential winners and immediately investing in them could be a smart decision.\n\nOne such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX - Free Report ) . This internet television network providing stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 36.7%.

      "text": "Netflix's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' Trailer Promises Lots of Misfortune, Neil Patrick Harris (Watch) Updated: November 17, 2016 — 1:08 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Oriana Schwindt \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - After a bit of a tease, Netflix has released the full trailer for its forthcoming TV adaptation of Lemony Snicket's \"A Series of Unfortunate Events,\" full of Neil Patrick Harris in various forms of (debatably effective) disguise. Harris is the nefarious Count Olaf, antagonist to the three precocious Baudelaire children placed in his care after their parents are killed. As siblings Violet, Klaus and Sunny attempt to escape the deadly schemes Olaf concocts to try and steal their parents' fortune, they discover more about their parents' wild past. \nParamount TV and Netflix began the adaptation process in 2014, a full decade after a movie franchise starring Jim Carrey as Olaf sputtered in 2004. The first season of Netflix's show will cover four of the 13 novels in Daniel Handler's book series -- two episodes for each book. \nIn addition to Harris, Patrick Warburton plays narrator Lemony Snicket, Malina Weissman is Violet Baudelaire, and Louis Hynes is Klaus Baudelaire; Alfre Woodard, Joan Cusack and Aasif Mandvi take over various featured roles. The series is created by Handler and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld of \"Men in Black\" and \"The Addams Family\" fame. \nThe first season of \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" will premiere, appropriately enough, on Friday, Jan. 13, 2017.

      "text": "Amazon Prime Video is finally going global to give Netflix some serious competition Posted Crunch Report | Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved \nSince its global expansion in January , Netflix has sat alone as the sole video streaming site to be available in (almost) every country in the world. That situation looks like it will change very soon, after Amazon teased a major international expansion of its own, rival service. \nAmazon Prime Video is presently only available in five countries — the U.S., UK, Germany, Austria and Japan, with India ‘coming soon’ — but Amazon dropped a heavy hint that it will expand to cover 200 markets worldwide from December. \nThere’s a slight catch here, though. \nRight now only one show — The Grand Tour, the remake of popular British motor show Top Gear — is confirmed for global audiences. But it seems likely that Amazon will either launch other shows at the same time, or at least bring them to market internationally very quickly to capitalize on the popularity of Top Gear, which was said to have an audience of 350 million worldwide at its peak. \nThat seems to the plan at this point. A Wall Street Journal report citing Amazon sources said the video service is “on the verge of a massive global rollout.” \nThe Grand Tour itself, which Amazon reportedly paid $250 million, became available in current Prime Video markets yesterday, and will go global from December, according to a tweet from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and a YouTube video from the stars of the show. \nAlready, it looks like Amazon is quietly making its shows available in some additional countries this week. Media reported that users in Australia can now access the service on the web — though mobile apps are not available locally yet — and it could be that other countries have also been let in without fanfare. If not now, then in the near future certainly. \nNetflix is rivaled by a number of niche players, such as Mubi (independent films) and iFlix (Southeast Asia), but Amazon will bring some much needed competition to global markets. \nAmazon’s music service might be the next to expand. Last week it launched outside of the U.S. for the first time , arriving in the UK, and — with Amazon battling hard in India , taking Prime into China and eyeing the potential of Southeast Asia — its media services could help give it the edge on local e-commerce rivals. 0",

      "text": "Amazon video going global in Netflix challenge – report The online retail giant's video-on-demand service will likely expand to 200 countries and territories Published 1:50 PM, November 18, 2016 Updated 1:58 PM, November 18, 2016 GOING GLOBAL. The retail giant expands its video service for a global audience, battling it out with Netflix. Image from Amazon. \nSAN FRANCISCO, U.S. – Amazon is poised to challenge Netflix on the global stage with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, Nov 17 . \nAmazon Prime Video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. \nPrime will likely expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Journal report. \nThis would put the Seattle-based online retail titan's on-demand video service on a level playing field with Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. \nWhen contacted by AFP, an Amazon spokeswoman would only confirm that a popular original show titled The Grand Tour and devoted to cars would launch in more than 200 countries in December. (Read: Ex-'Top Gear' hosts currently a voice option on Waze ) \n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" she said. \nThe worldwide, exclusive availability of The Grand Tour and its mention in a tweet fired off by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos will likely fuel speculation that this a first step toward a full-fledged global Prime Video service that will directly challenge Netflix. \nHow the show would be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service. \nIf Amazon Prime Video expands globally, it will be the most formidable rival to Netflix at a time when the California-based company's ability to win new fans is being closely watched by investors. \nEyes on Netflix \nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over growth. \nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter – most of them from outside the United States – and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers. \nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company was gaining momentum as a global television service. \nFor the current quarter, Netflix forecasted a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. \nThe service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including Stranger Things and Narcos , with helping draw customers. \nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street. \nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including House of Cards and Orange is the New Black . \nOffering originals \nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. \nOnline platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion – more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit. \nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store. \nLike Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in original programming to win subscribers. \nOriginal Amazon productions Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle won Emmy Awards, considered prestigious television accolades in the US. \nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38% from a year earlier. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

That situation is looking like it will change very soon, after Amazon teased an international expansion of its own, rival service. Read More",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nCount Olaf will soon be terrorizing the Beaudelaire orphans in Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events, the latest adaptation of Daniel Handler’s beloved book series. This time, Netflix is bringing the books’ beloved characters to the small screen with a cast that features Neil Patrick Harris, Joan Cusack, Patrick Warburton, and more. In preparation for the series’ January debut, the streaming service has unveiled its first full trailer. \nAfter a previous teaser showed us what to expect from the evil Count Olaf (played by Harris), the new preview gives us a better idea of the plight of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes), and Sunny. As you’d expect, they will find themselves dealing with some very, well, unfortunate events. It’s not easy being without parents, but a diabolical guardian makes it all the more awful. \nMore: Netflix loses more content by bidding adieu to Food Network and HGTV shows \nCount Olaf has plenty of tricks up his sleeve in the new series, but he doesn’t appear to bee the most competent villain. The trailer shows the kids managing to thwart him — if just barely — and his many not-so-tricky disguises. He fails pretty miserably in one scene in particular: He tells the Baudelaires that he’ll have their fortune by the time the sand in an hourglass runs out, only to have to amend his statement when it does so more quickly that he expected. \nThe count is just one of the adults in the series who seems a little ridiculous. Throughout the trailer, the Baudelaires come into contact with a string of people who don’t inspire a lot of confidence in their ability to help. These characters are played by skilled actors, though, including K. Todd Freeman, Alfre Woodard, and Don Johnson. \nThe series, which is set for eight episodes, is written by Handler himself, who executive produced alongside Barry Sonnenfeld. Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events hits Netflix on January 13. ",

      "text": "Netflix Eileen Kelly Robb \nThis may or may not be the year of the woman in Hollywood, but at Netflix , it’s been the year of the woman for several years running. “Netflix is the home of kickass women,” said Netflix programming guru Ted Sarandos , speaking before nearly 200 women – and a handful of men – during a panel discussion hosted by Visionary Women tonight at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. 'Seven Seconds': Russell Hornsby, Raul Castillo & Zackary Momoh Cast In Netflix Series \n“We’ve filled our executive suites with women,” he said. “It starts with female executives, who hire female story-tellers, who hire female directors.” As previously reported – and as he mentioned tonight – Netflix’ Jessica Jones will return for season 2 with a team of all women directors. \n“We are working as hard as we can to make sure that television is diverse in front of and behind the camera,” he said. \nSarandos and co-panelist Brian Grazer agreed that the picture is improving for women in the industry, but not as quickly as they’d like. “I love seeing women in power,” the Oscar-winning producer said. Then looking out over the audience, added: “This is probably the most nervous either of us have ever been at any speaking event.” \nMostly, however, the two Hollywood powerhouses amused and informed the audience with stories from their own careers, without condescending to telling a roomful of women what they should do – other than to tell their own stories with their own unique voices. \nBefore the panel, as the two men were preparing for a photo shoot, Sarandos was checking his emails and Grazer quipped: “He’s busy taking over the Walt Disney corporation.” \nVisionary Women is the fast-growing non-profit whose goal is to “harnesses the power of leadership and community to embolden women to achieve their full potential. By creating a forum for connection and dialogue with the world’s greatest thinkers, we’re challenging convention and advancing the status of women in all spheres of society.” ",

      "text": "\nNetflix dropped the official trailer today for the series that premieres January 13. Netflix \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Daniel Handler, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events chronicles the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire (Malina Weissman, Louis Hynes, Presley Smith) after their parents’ death in a fire. A careless oversight initially places the children in the custody of a distant relative named Count Olaf (wickedly played by Neil Patrick Harris ), a mysterious and devious figure who is seeking fortune by way of stealing their inheritance. After his elaborate plans are foiled and his evil intentions are revealed, Count Olaf employs a variety of outlandish disguises to situate himself in the children’s path, causing mayhem for the Baudelaires and their subsequent guardians. As the children manage to evade Count Olaf’s scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they pick up clues along the way about their parents’ past. \nSeries creator Handler also executive produces with Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld. It also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O’Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe), Aasif Maandvi (Uncle Monty) and Don Johnson (Sir). \nCheck out the trailer above and let us know what you think. Filed Under: ",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nAt last, Netflix has unveiled the full trailer for its Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events series, which will run for eight episode in mid-January. Given the tepid response to the 2004 film version starring Jim Carrey , Netflix is once again giving book readers and others hope that where a story fails to work elsewhere (as a movie or as a TV show on the wrong network), Netflix stands ready to swoop in and snatch it up, using its immense budget and lack of oversight to give the creatives free rein. And in this case, it’s coming directly from the creator of the books, Daniel Handler . \nThe trailer also gives us an extended look at Neil Patrick Harris as Olaf, and he seems to be having a ball with the role. The series is clearly geared towards kids, and the budget isn’t as lavish as it might be, but it is a world full of dark splendors and looks like it could be quite a bit of fun — as long as it keeps up the energy shown in the trailer. \nCheck out that full-length trailer below. Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events also stars Patrick Warburton , Malina Weissman , Louis Hynes , Presley Smith , Joan Cusack , and Alfre Woodard , and premieres Friday the 13th of January on Netflix. \nHere’s the official synopsis for Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events : \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death. The eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler, and also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Malina Weissman (Violet Baudelaire) and Louis Hynes (Klaus Baudelaire). The series premieres January 13, 2017 only on Netflix.",

      "text": "More 'Gilmore Girls' Episodes Coming To Netflix? What Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel Says Of A Renewal By Amanda Moore ,   17, 11:47 pm Alexis Bledel and Lauren Graham return to TV for a special presentation of \"Gilmore Girls\" on Netflix.(Photo : Kevin Winter/Getty Images ) \nThe \"Gilmore Girls\" revival hasn't even launched on Netflix, but there are already specuations that more episodes could be produced. Stars Lauren Graham (Lorelie Gilmore) and Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore) discuss the possibility of the show getting a renewal and making additional episodes. Advertisement \nWhen the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival was in development, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino always had the intention that the show would be a short special and not a full-blown series. Thus, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" which will be launched on Netflix on Friday, Nov. 25, will only be made up of four 90-minute episodes -- \"Winter,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer\" and \"Fall.\" \nBut actress Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel feel that the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival won't end with just these four episodes. Speaking with Metro , the stars said that they are open to doing more of \"Gilmore Girls\" if it would be great for the show. \nLauren Graham even offered some ideas for what can happen in future episodes. \"Perhaps we need to go back in time,\" the actress said. Vox notes that the upcoming special is already riddled with flashbacks, which somewhat changes the show's pace and storytelling. Gather your Gilmores. Whether you're a Rory or a Mrs. Kim, we've got invitations to help you set the date at https://t.co/6g5exsMtuG . pic.twitter.com/wmxT1JiaiJ — Gilmore Girls (@GilmoreGirls) November 16, 2016 \n\nUltimately, the choice for more episodes of \"Gilmore Girls\" would be up to Amy Sherman-Palladino. How the show is received on Netflix when it launches could also be a factor in its potential renewal. \nAiring from 2000 to 2007 on the defunct network WB, \"Gilmore Girls\" became a cult favorite and has maintained a strong following of fans even after it ended. The \"Gilmore Girls\" revival on Netflix will take place four months after the death of the Gilmore patriarch, Richard. Edward Hermman played the part in the series and he passed away in 2014. \nHermman's death was one of the motivation for the creator's intention to do the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival. \"Ed's death sucked so much,\" Amy Sherman-Palladino said, according to TV Line . \"I'm still angry about it.\" \nCatch the new episode of \"Gilmore Girls\" on Netflix this Friday, Nov. 25.

And from there, things just seem to get whimsically darker in the Netflix original series. \nIn addition to the trailer, a new official poster for the series has also been released by Netflix: Netflix revealed the official poster for Lemon Sniket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. \nEarlier this month, Netflix unveiled a first look at Harris as Olaf . He's very eager to get a hold of the children's fortunes. \nAlong with Harris, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events stars Patrick Warburton as the eponymous character, Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss, Malina Weissman as Violet Baudelaire and Louis Hynes as Klaus Baudelaire. \nThe series premieres January 13 on Netflix. \nEvan Campbell is a freelance writer who scripts the Daily Fix , streams games on his Twitch channel , and chats about movies and TV series on Twitter .",

      "text": "Apple’s late October event wasn’t solely about the new MacBook Pro and its Touch Bar keyboard, although the new Mac was undoubtedly the star of the show. Before it unveiled the laptop, Apple announced a TV app that will work across Apple devices. Users will be able to access content from a variety of services and resume watching TV shows and movies on all their devices.\nNotably absent from the new TV app are streaming services including Netflix and Amazon. But Apple is already taking a huge step to sweeten the deal: It just cut the App Store fee for video streaming apps.\nDON’T MISS: Your iPhone 8 might not include Apple’s hottest new feature next year\nAccording to Bloomberg , Apple will reduce its cut from 30% to 15%, a move that might convince services like Netflix and others to get on board.\nThe rate will be available to all subscription video services that are integrated with Apple’s new TV app, sources told the news site. Some video partners have already been paying 15% of monthly subscription fees to Apple, rather than the usual 30% fee that Apple takes from other paid App Store apps. Bloomberg notes that other non-video subscription apps also pay 15% to Apple only after a customer completes a year’s subscription.\nWhile there are no guarantees that Netflix will immediately get with the program, Apple’s move should still be good news for other companies considering Apple’s new TV app.\nIt should also benefit end-users. Some streaming services already charge customers who subscribe via Apple devices more than clients who buy subscriptions elsewhere. YouTube Red and Spotify are such streaming services. Subscription for either one costs $12.99 on iOS devices, but $9.99 elsewhere. By lowering its cut, Apple would help these companies lower their asking price for streaming services sold on iPhones and iPads.\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 The exciting iPhone 8 is expected to do what the boring iPhone 7 can’t See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "San Francisco (AFP) - Amazon is poised to challenge Netflix on the global stage with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nAmazon Prime Video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India.\nPrime will likely expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Journal report.\nThis would put the Seattle-based online retail titan's on-demand video service on a level playing field with Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service.\nWhen contacted by AFP, an Amazon spokeswoman would only confirm that a popular original show titled \"The Grand Tour\" and devoted to cars would launch in more than 200 countries in December.\n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" she said.\nThe worldwide, exclusive availability of \"The Grand Tour\" and its mention in a tweet fired off by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos will likely fuel speculation that this a first step toward a full-fledged global Prime Video service that will directly challenge Netflix.\nHow the show would be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service.\nIf Amazon Prime Video expands globally, it will be the most formidable rival to Netflix at a time when the California-based company's ability to win new fans is being closely watched by investors.\n- Eyes on Netflix -\nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over growth.\nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers.\nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company was gaining momentum as a global television service.\nFor the current quarter Netflix forecasted a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US.\nThe service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers.\nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street.\nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n- Offering originals -\nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion.\nOnline platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit.\nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store.\nLike Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in original programming to win subscribers.\nOriginal Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won Emmy Awards, considered prestigious television accolades in the US.\nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier.",

      "text": "\nIn a surprising reveal at CES 2016 keynote, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings announced that Netflix was rolling out globally bring its Internet TV network to more than 130-countries around the world. The streaming service was previously available in parts of the Americas, parts of Europe and South East Asia. Since its global expansion, Netflix has added thousands of users besides allowing millions of others to access its content.\nE-commerce retailer Amazon has had its video streaming service out for a while and has been looking to create original content for the service. The service, Amazon Prime Video has also been slowly expanding and has now hinted at a major global expansion. Amazon Prime Video is presently only available in five countries — the U.S., UK, Germany, Austria and Japan. According to Tech Crunch, the service has hinted it will expand to cover 200 markets worldwide from December.\nLate last year, BBC lost the presenters of one of the most popular motoring shows Top Gear. This was owing to an altercation that took place between one of the hosts and the show’s producers. Following the exit, a bidding war emerged among various networks and even streaming services each looking to create a motoring show. From Amazon to Netflix, Sky to ITV, each sought to acquire the services of the former Top Gear hosts. Amazon won the bidding war and channeled $250 Million towards the creation of a new motoring show aptly called The Grand Tour. The Grand Tour is set to premier today November 18th and the launch by Amazon is meant to capitalize on the popularity of the show.\nThe Grand Tour rolled out on Amazon Prime in the five markets yesterday and is set to go global in December according to a tweet by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The move by Amazon is certainly as Amazon Prime is cheaper than Netflix (about Kshs. 10,000 a year), and offer free unlimited streaming content, prime music (unlimited access to music), prime photos (unlimited storage of photos), prime reading (borrow books and magazines) as well as membership sharing.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n\nRead On Web → Amazon Prime Video to take on Netflix with Expansion to 200 Countries WorldWide \n",

Sela Ward, Skylar Astin, Isaiah Miller, Heléne Yorke, Chris Lowell and Callie Hernandez also star. \nBoth series are hitting the middle of their first seasons, with finales to come in December.

      "text": "Netflix Still Has the Best Movies… Not That You’d Really Not... \nNetflix released the first official trailer for its A Series of Unfortunate Events series on Thursday, and if it’s any indication, we’re going to be feeling a lot of misery in the new year. \nMost compelling about the marketing for the series has been the tone, which Netflix seems to have captured exactly from the books. Lemony Snicket’s young adult series about the tragic events that befall a group of three orphans was incredibly dark but full of absurd humor that could fly over the heads of its target audience. \nIt’s easy to see what kind of atmosphere it’s going for. Just look at what was in the video description for the trailer: \n“Dear Viewer, The world is vast and full of wonders. So on Friday, the 13th of January, please… watch something else.” \nWe’ve seen a few teasers so far, one which introduces the author himself (played by Patrick Warburton) and another that gives us a first look at Neil Patrick Harris’ Count Olaf. \nOver the course of 13 books (because of course), Snicket subjected the Baudelaire orphans to many tragic and, um, unfortunate events. Their parents die in a fire, and they get taken in by Count Olaf, who is comically evil and wants nothing more than to get access to their fortune. He locks them up in an attic, tortures them, and even tries to marry the oldest child, Violet, in an attempt to get it. And that’s all in the first book. \nBe prepared to meet a host of stupid but compelling adult characters and watch them die horribly. \nThe eight-episode miniseries, which also stars Joan Cusack, Alfre Woodard, and Aasif Mandvi, is set to debut, again, in January, on Friday the 13th, on Netflix.

How someone can be so devastated, they turn to lose their lives, but on the other side where someone really does move forward,\" said Shreveport-Bossier-area high school guidance counselor Angelor Johnson. \nThe goal of Thursday night's screening was to spark conversation right here in the ArkLaTex. \n\"Unfortunately we live in a world in which this is happening in our own backyards.\" \nThe Netflix documentary follows the stories of two teens who were sexually assaulted by classmates in separate parties across the country. It also shows how their assaults were plastered on social media and how the victims were publicly shamed. \nJohnson and others hope the screening will encourage others to go watch the movie and continue the conversations about sexual assault awareness for people of all ages. \n\"I know this may not be the fun thing to do, but really start to educate our students, as well as parents and community on how this can be very impactful in our community on every continuum.\" \nAfterward, Project Celebration facilitated a group discussion with local people who work with victims of sexual assault every day. A group of freshman girls said the movie really opened their eyes to what's happening to teens their age. \n\"Even though it's really touchy, I feel like everybody should get to know about it,\" said one teen. \n\"It could happen to you even if you don't accept it,\" said another. \nFor more information on Project Celebration visit www.projectcelebration.com \nCopyright 2016 KSLA .

      "text": "The attack On Friday October 21st, as people tried to watch Netflix or listen to Spotify they both suddenly stopped working. This “internet doomsday” happened because of a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack on Dyn.\nDyn is a huge DNS company that provides IP addresses to URLs, disrupting numerous websites like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon. A DDOS attacks attempt to inundate the internet with traffic caused by a special malware called a botnet.\nDyn actually blamed the internet of things (IoT) such as DVRs and security cameras as a source of the attack. This probably is an iconic event to tech nerds and binge watchers alike. This huge attack affected numerous popular websites. Even though Netflix was making you rip your hair out, we need to be more aware of how insecure our items really are.\nHow to be more secure According to PC Mag, the big DDOS attacks should be a wakeup call for companies and users to secure their IoT devices better. The giant chain of internet connected devices is just a pathway for attackers to access data in order to reach their targets. All these attacks on these devices are things people don’t think about, but there are ways we could avoid this! Securing your devices and connectivity delivery are important to protecting your devices.\nSeveral ways you can reduce this risk include: Create unique passwords Run numerous monitoring functions that look for potentially malicious communication from unknown IP addresses. This helps prevent a bot from repeatedly trying to guess your username and password. If you run your own server, make sure it’s secure and you can maintain it. Cisco suggests strategies like buying excess bandwidth or redundant networks to withstand DDOS attacks. The botnet scans for devices with default username and password credentials. Learning all about DDOS DDOS attacks come from a variety of things, including how IoT devices are authenticated, how data is protected, and how the IoT affects other systems. This botnet goes through the web for IoT devices that are secured by default usernames and passwords. It then uses these devices to attack online targets. If I never learned this in IST 233, I would’ve probably just kept on refreshing Netflix throughout the day hoping for the best. Or had given up, like what my non-IT friends would’ve done. Today, we should be aware that these kind of problems could happen at any time.\nBut the responsibility to protect IoT devices can’t fall solely on the consumer. Professor Dave Molta believes that a huge problem with these IoT devices is manufacturing quality control. Vendors should be creating products that aren’t vulnerable to these security issues. Established devices are produced in larger volumes, so it’s more likely that security vulnerabilities will be detected. Devices created by unknown vendors have higher vulnerability. One way consumers can protect themselves is to use established products rather than one-off technology.\nDon’t be afraid! Ironically, the DDOS attack happened during Cyber Security Awareness Month. It’s important to understand circumstances that lie under securing your home devices or purchasing them from the right kind of manufacturers. If you want to learn a lot more about this you could start by taking the IST 233 class or attend the Information Security Club meetings .\nThe post Why You Should Care About DDOS Attacks appeared first on Information Space .\n",

Thanks for your reaction Don’t forget to share this with your friends! ← Use Arrows Keys → 1 That $37,000 Wedding Gown Isn't the Only Breathtaking Costume on Netflix's The Crown \nNetflix's new series The Crown promises to deliver on royal drama, but perhaps equally enthralling is its breathtaking fashion. The show, about the life of Queen Elizabeth II, is Netflix's most expensive show to date , at a rumored $130 million. Plenty of that went into the wardrobe, with a costume department of more than 50 working to make custom looks — rather than rely on vintage pieces — for the show. From a $37,000 replica of Elizabeth's wedding gown to the royal jewels and even the more everyday dresses, each look is a testament to the painstaking work of that dedicated costume department. Read on to see their work come to fruition with a sneak peek at the show, then join us as we start binge watching now. Related:",

      "text": "0 COMMENTS PRIME TIME : Netflix, which is in more than 190 markets, has made its global expansion a focal point of its growth strategy. Now, the streaming giant will have some major international competition. The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is about to roll out its streaming video service in about 200 countries and territories . Amazon Prime Video is currently only available in a handful of countries like the U.S., U.K. and Germany. One of Amazon’s new stars, Jeremy Clarkson, may have inadvertently spoiled the surprise, when he tweeted that viewers in 200 countries will be able to watch his forthcoming automotive comedy show. Amazon’s heavy spending on video has already been a drag on earnings, along with other investments. The global rollout means those streaming costs will likely go up. Amazon’s hope is that international demand for a true Netflix rival will more than validate its spending. It’s a bet worthy of Jeff Bezos.\nAGENCY MASHUP : Last December, Publicis Groupe began a company-wide restructuring meant to organize agencies by hub, including creative and media units, encourage more integration and – one would hope – simplify things. Now, the company has announced its digital agency restructuring , and it’s anything but simple. Besides mashing together two agencies, it involves an array of confusing leadership appointments, two executives named Alan each holding multiple roles and various agencies and networks with the name Sapient in them. Here’s what you need to know: Publicis has merged SapientNitro and Razorfish to create SapientRazorfish. SapientNitro CEO Alan Wexler and Sapient Consulting CEO Chip Register will become co-CEOs of Publicis.Sapient, the network that houses SapientRazorfish and Digitas. Mr. Wexler will also assume a CEO role at the newly-formed SapientRazorfish. Razorfish CEO Shannon Denton will take on the role of chief strategy officer for SapientRazorfish. And, last but not least, Alan Herrick, CEO of digital agency network Publicis.Sapient, will move into the role of chairman of the network, “focusing on strategy and market development at the Publicis.Sapient and Publicis Groupe level.” Now that’s what I call streamlining!\nMIND YOUR BUSINESSWEEK : Bloomberg’s media unit is somewhat insulated from the sweeping forces in the industry, since the company makes the lion’s share of its revenue from selling terminals. But Bloomberg Businessweek magazine still isn’t immune to struggles in the print ad market . As Huffington Post reports, the company is next year revamping the magazine , which it purchased in 2009, to focus more on business and finance. Editor Ellen Pollock will depart, with Washington bureau chief Megan Murphy replacing her. According to a company memo, the goal is to integrate Businessweek’s editorial operations with the wider Bloomberg newsroom and beef up its digital presence. “The revenue model is still too reliant on declining print advertising rather than digital or multi-platform subscriber revenue,” Bloomberg Media Group CEO Justin Smith and Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait said in the memo. As CMO Today reports, about 30 Bloomberg News journalists were also let go Thursday as the company merged its Bloomberg First Word and markets news teams. Meanwhile, “With All Due Respect,” the Bloomberg show hosted by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, is coming to an end.\nAOL OFFLINE : AOL is laying off close to 500 employees , CMO Today reports. The move, first reported by Recode, amounts to about 5% of staff. The Verizon-owned company says it has added more than 1,500 people in the past year thanks to various acquisitions. But now what’s needed is “consolidation to improve operations and limit the amount of hand-offs in our business processes,” AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong said in a company memo. The layoffs, which will hit units of the company including human resources, marketing, communications and finance, are not linked to Verizon’s agreement earlier this year to acquire Yahoo for $4.83 billion . That deal is expected to close next year, but still remains somewhat uncertain in the wake of Yahoo’s recently-disclosed data breach.\nElsewhere Paul Horner, who makes a living through fake news sites, said that it’s “scary” how fast fake news stories were able to spread on Facebook throughout the election. [ Washington Post ]\nIn a press conference in Germany, President Obama spoke out about the spread of false news stories on social media services like Facebook and television. [ NYT ]\nIn a series of crises over problems like its ad metric miscalculation and the fake news controversy, Facebook executives have responded with unwavering confidence, even as the company faces criticism internally and externally. [ WSJ ]\nThe New York Times said it has had a net increase of 41,000 paid subscriptions to its print and digital news products since Election Day. [ Reuters ]\nBill Simmons’s struggles at HBO show how powerful of a platform ESPN is for its sports talent. Mr. Simmons’s show was canceled after only four months. [ Deadspin ]\nCharles Harder, the lawyer behind Hulk Hogan’s case against Gawker, has gone from unknown entertainment attorney to one of the most feared figures in media [ GQ ]\nOmnicom Chief Executive John Wren said that the U.S. election should help his ad holding giant because the new leadership favors lower corporate tax rates. [ WSJ ]\nSony’s streaming service PlayStation Vue is now available on Apple TV’s latest devices. Sony’s service has already been available on its own PlayStation consoles and other devices like Roku and Google Chromecast. [ Variety ]\nWarner Bros. officially announced it is acquiring gaming-focused digital video network Machinima. The deal values the company at slightly under $100 million.

      "text": "Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. Amazon is set to challenge Netflix worldwide with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service featuring its remake of the BBC's global hit \"Top Gear.\"\nAmazon Prime Video is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service.\nAmazon's take on \"Top Gear,\" called \"The Grand Tour,\" made its Prime debut Thursday in the existing markets including Britain and the United States -- to rapturous reviews from the UK press. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos tweeted that the global rollout of \"The Grand Tour\" would come in December.\nIts colorful main host, Jeremy Clarkson, was dropped from the madcap BBC show after he punched a producer in March. The BBC came back with a rebooted version featuring new presenters including British broadcaster Chris Evans, but he quit after only one series following downbeat reviews of the program, which has 350 million viewers per week in 170 countries. Amazon seized on the opportunity of hiring Clarkson and his two co-presenters to use the motoring show as a flagship product for its global ambitions.\n\"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere,\" Clarkson tweeted. \"Amazon has gone global.\"\nHow the show will be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service.\n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" beyond Bezos' announcement, an Amazon spokeswoman told AFP.\nEyes on Netflix\nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over its own growth. The company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers.\nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company is gaining momentum as a global TV feed. For the current quarter Netflix forecast a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. The service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers.\nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street.\nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\"\nOffering originals\nNetflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion (7 billion euros) -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit.\nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. Original Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won prestigious Emmy Awards in the US. Prime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store, which has moved dramatically beyond its early days as a bookseller.\nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier.",

Image Amazon \nNetflix’s global dominance as the sole video streaming site is now being challenged by a rival service from Amazon, which has heavily hinted that Amazon Prime Video will soon be expanding to cover 200 markets worldwide come December. \nCurrently, Amazon Prime Video is available only in the US, UK, Germany, Austria and Japan, with India soon to follow, reports TechCrunch. \nWhile the only show that has been confirmed to global audiences is The Grand Tour, a remake of popular British motor show Top Gear, it is highly likely that Amazon will be releasing more shows at the same time. If not, Amazon may bring more shows to the international audience in quick succession to get them up to speed with five initial countries that currently enjoy its service. A Wall Street Journal report stated that the video service is “on the verge of a massive global rollout.” ADVERTISEMENT \nAustralian media have reported that audiences could now access Prime Video’s service through the web. However, apps are not yet available locally. \nWith Amazon’s video service now locked for a global expansion, their music service could be up next. It has already started its move in the UK last week. Alfred Bayle",

      "text": "Analytical professional and part-time Netflix enthusiast 19 mins ago What If We Used a Different Voting System? This was the ninth presidential election in my lifetime, and the fourth in which we’re left with “minority rule”, that is, the winner of the election received less than 50% of the popular vote. Bill Clinton won with 43% of the vote in 1992 and with 49% 1996, both times due to Ross Perot pulling substantial third-party support. In George W. Bush’s infamous 2000 win, he had 48% of the popular vote. While this year’s numbers aren’t yet final, current estimates have Trump with about 47% of the vote and that may drop another point or two as California’s absentee ballots are tallied. While many focus on the role of the electoral college in these outcomes, I want to take a closer look at the role of the voting system itself. How might 2016 have unfolded under a different system, like Ranked Choice Voting, which prevents minority rule outcomes? There can be only one Our current voting system is typically referred to as “first past the post” or “winner take all”. The idea is simple enough; each voter gets a single vote which they cast for the candidate of their choice. But while this system appears simple and fair at first glance, over time it inevitably leads to a two party system with sharp polarization. This is true whether you’re electing American presidents or the King of the Jungle . Any candidate outside of the two major parties is a potential “spoiler” as they could disproportionately take votes from one of the two major candidates (see Nader, Ralph). Voters are left to choose between the lesser of two evils , not supporting their ideal candidate for fear that their least favorite candidate might benefit. Ranked Choice Voting Under a Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) system, voters don’t select a single candidate but instead rank all candidates on the ballot from their most to least favorite . When the votes are tallied, if no candidate has a majority then the candidate with the fewest votes is removed and their votes get redistributed among the other candidates based on each voter’s next best choice. This cycle continues until a single candidate has secured a majority. Proponents of RCV highlight that, among other benefits , this system eliminates the “spoiler” effect that third party candidates have under a Winner Take All system. Voters can rate their preferred candidate first without fear that it might aid their least favorite candidate. RCV 2016 This year saw support for third-party candidates at the highest levels in decades and major party candidates with record low favorability ratings . What might have happened if there had been a broader field of candidates to choose from and an election run under RCV rules? Fortunately, the Pew Research Center January 2016 Political Survey * asked some questions that let us investigate things in more detail. Survey respondents were asked to rate 9 presidential candidates on whether they would be a great, good, average, poor or terrible president. We’ll use these ratings as a way to approximate how the respondent would rank the candidates in an RCV election. As an example; say a respondent said that Cruz would be a great president, Sanders would be good, Clinton would be average and Trump would be terrible. That respondents’ ranking would place Cruz first, then Sanders, Clinton and finally Trump. Some methodological notes… In the case of a tie (e.g. a respondent thought that both Clinton and Trump would make an average president), I broke the tie at random. Candidates who were not rated or not known by a respondent were ranked the same as “terrible”. The Pew study was weighted to match the Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey, so while the results are representative of the population, they are not representative of the electorate. I’m the first to admit that this approach not perfect but I believe it should make for a reasonable approximation for how an RCV election held in January 2016 could have unfolded. I wish there were some true third-party candidates included in the survey, but oh well. Besides, Evan McMullin wasn’t even running until August! Results in a January 2016 RCV Election Remember January 2016? Simpler times… well, not really. Pew asked about 7 Republican candidates and 2 Democratic ones. Clinton and Sanders are in the top two spots, but really only because the Republican field is so big. Note that given all options, only about 15% of people have Trump as their top choice. Kasich has the least support, with only 4%, so he is eliminated and his votes get redistributed in the next round. Kasich’s support gets pretty evenly redistributed, though Clinton and Christie are the biggest beneficiaries, likely due to their relatively moderate positions. It’s not enough to change the state of the race though. Christie’s next on the chopping block It’s a little hard to see since his support was so low, but the biggest beneficiary of Christie’s support is Sanders, followed by Clinton and Bush. Rubio’s the next to go, a little surprising given his position in the polls, particularly relative to Bush and Carson. About two thirds of Rubio’s support goes to other Republican candidates, particularly Cruz and Carson. The remainder is taken mostly by Clinton. At this point, Clinton has gained the most support from where she started, up 3.6% points. In contrast, Trump has gained 1.9%; he’s not the “next best choice” for a lot of Kasich, Christie and Rubio supporters. Bush gets eliminated next. Once again, Clinton is the biggest beneficiary with Trump and Sanders virtually tied for second. Clinton now has over 30% of the total vote. Carson is outta here. Cruz and Trump win big with Carson gone, each gaining over 3 points while Clinton and Sanders don’t get half of that. With four candidates left and each of the parties with two candidates, Clinton and Sanders are still leading but Trump has closed the gap. Let’s see what happens when Cruz is given the boot. Not surprisingly, Trump is the big winner of the Cruz departure (insert cruise joke here). Trump jumps ahead of Sanders, having added 18% points from his position in Round 1, more than the 15% he started with. By contrast, Clinton has gained 12% and Sanders 11% from where they started, showing the non-Trump Republicans are about evenly split between the Democratic candidates. Sanders is next to go. Think about how a three-way race between Clinton, Trump and Sanders would have ended under our current system… Clinton and Sanders bitterly split Democratic support and Trump wins with perhaps 40% the popular vote. Both Clinton and Sanders are accused of being “spoilers”. Under RCV, both can be on the ballot at the same time, knowing that they’re likely to be the second choice for each others’ supporters. Finally, a winner emerges. Clinton absorbs the vast majority of Sanders’ support and crushes Trump 59% to 41%, a popular vote margin not seen since Reagan-Mondale. While she was only the first choice for 24% of people, an additional 35% would rather see her win over Trump. Conclusions Again, while this approach is far from perfect, it is interesting to see how much effect our voting system could potential have on our election outcomes. RCV allows a broader, more diverse set of candidates to participate without running the risk of “spoiling” the outcome. It could also discourage negative campaigning, as candidates would be more concerned with being your second or third choice than in knocking their opponent down. Voters in Maine recently passed a referendum to adopt RCV for many state and Congressional elections, after decades of living under governors elected with less than 50% of the vote. The state will serve as an excellent trial of RCV in the US, testing detractors objections that the system is too complicated for voters. If you’d like to help advance the cause of RCV, consider a donation to FairVote.org , a non-partisan charity dedicated to making democracy more representative.",

Hints have started to surface about the global rollout, most notably via a tweet from “The Grand Tour” and former “Top Gear” star Jeremy Clarkson. \nClarkson tweeted in part that that when “The Grand Tour” debuted viewers in 200 countries would be able to watch the show. The catch with that tweet is that currently only five countries have access to the streaming service that carries “The Grand Tour.” \nClarkson noted that the people in those 200 countries would be able to start watching the trio in December while the show debuted on November 18. Clarkson tweeted, “Amazon has gone global. It is going to be available in 200 territories. That’s pretty much everywhere.” Netflix and Amazon Prime Video compete in the US and other countries right now with both offering quality original programming along with older content. \nThe WSJ thinks that the rollout will cost Amazon in the area of $4 – $5 billion in annual cost. One area that we are unclear about is just how large the catalog of movies and shows will be for the global rollout. While Amazon owns the international rights for its original shows such as “Man in the High Castle” and “The Grand Tour” it doesn’t necessarily have the rights for international distribution of everything in the US catalog and the catalog in other countries. Netflix is the big challenger and it is currently in over 190 countries potentially making Amazon’s footprint larger if it expands to 200 countries soon.",

      "text": "After a bit of a tease, Netflix has released the full trailer for its forthcoming TV adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” full of Neil Patrick Harris in various forms of (debatably effective) disguise. Harris is the nefarious Count Olaf, antagonist to the three precocious Baudelaire children placed in his care after their parents are killed. As siblings Violet, Klaus and Sunny attempt to escape the deadly schemes Olaf concocts to try and steal their parents’ fortune, they discover more about their parents’ wild past.\nParamount TV and Netflix began the adaptation process in 2014 , a full decade after a movie franchise starring Jim Carrey as Olaf sputtered in 2004. The first season of Netflix’s show will cover four of the 13 novels in Daniel Handler’s book series — two episodes for each book.\nIn addition to Harris, Patrick Warburton plays narrator Lemony Snicket, Malina Weissman is Violet Baudelaire, and Louis Hynes is Klaus Baudelaire; Alfre Woodard, Joan Cusack and Aasif Mandvi take over various featured roles. T he series is created by Handler and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld of “Men in Black” and “The Addams Family” fame.\nThe first season of “A Series of Unfortunate Events” will premiere, appropriately enough, on Friday, Jan. 13, 2017.\nRelated stories\nTV News Roundup: Rumer Willis Joins 'Empire,' Bieber to Perform for 2016 AMAs\n'Gilmore Girls': Secrets of the Musical in the Netflix Revival (Watch)\nNetflix, Japan's NHK Partner on Historical Drama 'Trial'\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Blog This \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Asia Pacific SVOD Forecasts\" report to their offering. \nThe Asia Pacific region will have 157.78 million SVOD [subscription video on demand] subscribers by 2021, up from 41.68 million in 2015 and 76.12 million expected by end-2016. The total will be nudging 100 million by end-2017, according to the Asia Pacific SVOD Forecasts report. \nRapid smartphone subscription growth means that China will command 47% of the 2021 total SVOD subscribers - up from 38% in 2015. From the 82 million additions between 2016 and 2021, China will supply 34 million, Japan 9 million and India 15 million. \nBy 2021, 17.5% of the region's TV households [across 17 countries] will subscribe to an SVOD platform, up from only 5.1% by end-2015 and 9.1% expected by end-2016. Penetration rates in 2021 will vary from 53.5% in Australia (with four countries above 50%) to 8.0% in Pakistan. \nAlthough Netflix, Amazon, Iflix, HOOQ and Viu will enjoy rapid growth, they will collectively only account for 16% of the region's SVOD subscribers by 2021. \nNetflix is forecast to have 7.59 million subscribers in the region by 2021, up from 3.17 million at end-2016. Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand will together account for nearly three-quarters of the total. Netflix is considered expensive in most other countries. We do not believe that Netflix will launch as a standalone platform in China. \nThe report comprises: \n- Major SVOD players, including subscriber estimates by country (2010 to 2021) for the major platforms. \n- Country-by-country forecasts from 2010 to 2021 \n- Country profiles \nFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6fjx5s/asia_pacific_svod View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161118005297/en/ Published November 18, 2016 Copyright © 2016 SYS-CON Media, Inc. — All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Neil Patrick Harris' transformation into Count Olaf for Netflix's upcoming adaptation of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is impressive to say the least, but it's just one of several disguises the Emmy winner sports in the first official trailer for the series.\nReleased Thursday, the footage from the highly anticipated eight-episode series shows Harris deep in the character of Count Olaf, the evil guardian of the Baudelaire orphans - Violet, Klaus and Sunny - who will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. As the children manage to evade Count Olaf's scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they begin to pick up clues about their parents' past. However, Count Olaf is determined to get what he wants.\n\"Wherever you go, I will hunt you down,\" he tells the children ominously in the trailer.\nBased on the international best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler), the series also stars Patrick Warburton (as Snicket himself), Joan Cusack, Alfre Woodard, Catherine O'Hara, Aasif Mandvi and Don Johnson among others.\nThe eight-episode series is produced by Netflix and hails from exec producers Barry Sonnenfeld and Handler.\nWatch the full trailer below:\nLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events premieres Friday, Jan. 13, 2017, on Netflix.",

      "text": "Netflix Integrated into Comcast’s X1 Platform By SV Staff  Posted: Nov 18, 2016 Netflix is being integrated into millions of Comcast X1 devices across the country this week, according to a joint announcement from Comcast and Netflix. \nWith the new integration, X1 users with Netflix subscriptions will be able to browse and access Netflix movies and TVs shows alongside the live, on demand, DVR, and web programming included with their Xfinity TV subscriptions. Browsing can be done via the X1 Voice Remote, Xfinity On Demand, or the Netflix App. \n“The Netflix integration into the X1 platform means our mutual customers will no longer need to change inputs or juggle remotes,” said Reed Hastings, Netflix co-founder and CEO. “Now they can seamlessly move between the Netflix app and their cable service, enjoying all the TV shows and movies they love without hassle.” \nBy combining the TV libraries of Netflix and Xfinity On Demand, X1 customers will be able to… \n• Launch the Netflix app by saying “Netflix” into the X1 Voice Remote. • Browse Netflix content alongside On Demand movies and shows. • Search for a specific actor by name to see everything they are in across Xfinity and Netflix. • Start from the beginning of long-running shows like The Walking Dead or Scandal with all prior seasons from Netflix and the current season from Xfinity available in one place. \nCurrent X1 and Netflix customers will be prompted to sign in when accessing the Netflix service on X1 for the first time. New Netflix customers will be able to sign up for a new Netflix membership directly on X1, have the service added to their Comcast bill and begin to immediately use Netflix on X1 or across devices. \nComcast said the X1 platform will be in 50 percent of its video customer homes by the end of 2016. \nFor more information visit xfinity.com .

      "text": "There was something about Jim Carrey’s evil approach in A Series Of Unfortunate Events which completely lacks in Neil Patrick Harris Every director has his own style of adapting a book into a film. While Tim Burton leans on a distinctive dark and loony approach, directors like Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron and David Yates have kept the adaptations of Harry Potter magical and that can be watched by a child or an adult.\nUnder the narration of Jude Law, the first film adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events had its individual charm. It was unique and managed to make its own niche without stooping to usual tropes of the action/ fantasy genre.\nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death. The eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler, and also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Malina Weissman (Violet Baudelaire) and Louis Hynes (Klaus Baudelaire).\nThere was something about Jim Carrey’s evil approach which completely lacks in Neil Patrick Harris. But what failed to suit him? Whether it is his well-known image of being a self-claimed awesome womaniser in How I Met Your Mother or if it was Jim Carrey’s long lasting, irreplaceable image — it is hard to tell\nAlthough it was meant for entertainment, somehow ironically Netflix has been sharp and to the point while presenting the trailer of A Series of Unfortunate Events:\nWatch: A Series of Unfortunate Events – Official Trailer – Netflix [HD]\n“Dear Viewer, We regretfully present you with the official trailer, a word which here means a collection of the unhappy happenings surrounding the lives of the three Baudelaire orphans and one despicable Count Olaf. For the sake of your mental well-being and overall enjoyment of your internet browsing experience, we recommend you search “cats playing instruments” immediately and spend the next 2 1/2 minutes watching a tabby in a t-shirt attempt to play a keyboard instead.”\n© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

      "text": "Amazon is set to challenge Netflix worldwide with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service featuring its remake of the BBC's global hit \"Top Gear.\"\nAmazon Prime Video is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Prime would likely expand to some 200 countries and territories in a direct challenge to Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service.\nAmazon's take on \"Top Gear,\" called \"The Grand Tour,\" made its Prime debut Thursday in the existing markets including Britain and the United States -- to rapturous reviews from the UK press.\nAmazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos tweeted that the global rollout of \"The Grand Tour\" would come in December.\nIts colorful main host, Jeremy Clarkson, was dropped from the madcap BBC show after he punched a producer in March.\nThe BBC came back with a rebooted version featuring new presenters including British broadcaster Chris Evans, but he quit after only one series following downbeat reviews of the program, which has 350 million viewers per week in 170 countries.\nAmazon seized on the opportunity of hiring Clarkson and his two co-presenters to use the motoring show as a flagship product for its global ambitions.\n\"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere,\" Clarkson tweeted. \"Amazon has gone global.\"\nHow the show will be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service.\n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" beyond Bezos' announcement, an Amazon spokeswoman told AFP.\n- Eyes on Netflix -Netflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over its own growth.\nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers.\nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company is gaining momentum as a global TV feed.\nFor the current quarter Netflix forecast a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US.\nThe service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers.\nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street.\nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n- Offering originals -Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion (7 billion euros) -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit.\nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion.\nOriginal Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won prestigious Emmy Awards in the US.\nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store, which has moved dramatically beyond its early days as a bookseller.\nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier.",

      "text": "\"Making a Murderer,\" the Netflix series exploring the Steven Avery case, has won four Emmys, including outstanding documentary or nonfiction series. (Photo: Netflix) \n\"We won’t know until Monday what’s exactly in the Agreed Order, but you can rely on the document appearing online moments after it appears in court databases thanks to the legions of internet sleuths following the case ,\" Uproxx reported at the time. \n►Our John Ferak spoke to experts about whether investigators dug deep enough when questioning potential suspects in Halbach's killing. \n\"This is basic Investigation 101,\" said Joseph Giacalone, a retired New York City detective sergeant and an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"You will ask everyone what's their alibi in so many words. That's the whole point of doing these interviews, the exclusion of all others. \n►One of the Netflix execs involved in the \"Making a Murderer,\" part two, dished (a little, anyway) to the Hollywood Reporter . \n\"People will be very excited to get a back-door look at all the work that has been happening since viewers left them,\" Lisa Nishimura told THR. \"Because it's the real world, we have to honor the (legal) process. There are certain things happening with respect to both those cases that we're waiting to take place before we bring it to the world. \n►A columnist at the Scottish news website The National compared the \"MaM\" case to a UK homicide or two, including one in which the defendant had a Dassey-esque IQ of 73. Buy Photo \n(Photo: USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin) \nThat's all well and good, but the really entertaining reading is in the details. \nWriter Shona Craven describes Ken Kratz, who prosecuted Avery, as a \"hammy, panto-villain.\" Craven also declares that \" Fargo\" actor William H. Macy likely would have picked up an Emmy nomination had he played former Dassey defense lawyer Len Kachinsky in a dramatization of the case. \nand follow him on Twitter @PGDougSchneider CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/2fDjf1Q TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "Salida OK’s community of 200 tiny homes to help ease housing crunch \nBy Emily Yahr, The Washington Post \nLet’s cut right to the chase, “Gilmore Girls” fans, and start with the good news: The Netflix revival of the beloved drama has everything you want. Lorelai and Rory return as the mother-daughter best-friend duo who live in the gloriously quirky town of Stars Hollow, Conn. The original creator and executive producers are in charge, ensuring the highly anticipated reboot is chock-full of callbacks, inside jokes and life updates on your favorite supporting characters. \nThe bad news: It’s not perfect. It’s actually far from perfect. The revival has four 90-minute chapters, and it turns out that 42-minute episodes were the perfect amount of time before the famously sparkling dialogue and wacky plotlines start to drag — and characters’ flaws go from endearing to irritating. \nThe best news: Fans won’t care. Because “Gilmore Girls” is back. \nAlthough television is cluttered with nostalgia projects, nothing quite strikes a chord like “Gilmore Girls,” which ran on the WB and the CW from 2000 to 2007. Executive producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino couldn’t reach a financial deal with the studio and left before the seventh and final season, which was considered a huge disappointment, bogged down by nonsensical story lines. It all adds an extra layer of excitement to the revival, because viewers finally get to see the “real” ending. \nAs someone who has re-watched “Gilmore Girls” more times than I care to admit, hitting “play” on the first episode was nerve-racking. The magic of “Gilmore Girls” is buried deep in my psyche, as it is for many other fans, thanks to deeply relatable characters (Rory made it cool to be an introvert who loved to read!), sharp writing and the dream of living in a cozy town. Would the revival meet my sky-high expectations? Or would it confirm my fears that it could never live up to the actual series? \nI’ll be honest — it was a little of both. Before viewing the episodes, Netflix required reporters to sign agreements in which we swore not to reveal any spoilers or surprises or specific plot points or twists or turns or … any significant details whatsoever, especially about various romantic entanglements. \nBut here’s what I can tell you: The first episode is delightfully surreal. As in, is this really happening? Are Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) bantering about coffee and trading pop culture references like no time has passed? The Stars Hollow Gazette gets a shout-out? Wait, town weirdo Kirk (Sean Gunn) has a pet pig? Actually, that seems about right. \nTheme of revival \nViewers get swept back into the all-consuming “Gilmore” world, starting in the wintertime. Each episode takes place in a different season over a year. \nThe theme of the revival is arriving at a crossroads (yes, Lorelai would make a Britney Spears joke here) and what to do when there are no easy answers. When we last saw Rory — the straight-A student with dreams of being a foreign correspondent — she had just graduated from Yale University with a job with a political website covering then-Sen. Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. \nAlthough theoretically that would be quite the launchpad for a successful career, curiously, in the new series,it doesn’t come up at all. Now 32, Rory is struggling to find a permanent foothold in the fiercely competitive journalism world. On a trip home to Stars Hollow, she repeatedly assures her mother that she has a lot of irons in the fire (“I heard. You should become a blacksmith,” Lorelai deadpans), although she’s clearly terrified about her future. \nLorelai, meanwhile, is dealing with a midlife crisis of sorts, spending a fair amount of time in a (mostly bewildered) therapist’s office. She’s not just dealing with her complicated family issues: getting pregnant at 16 and running away from her wealthy, stifling parents. She’s also thinking about the future of the Dragonfly Inn, her dream business that she opened with her best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). Plus, she and grumpy diner owner Luke (Scott Patterson), the fan-favorite choice for her soul mate, aren’t all smooth sailing — even though the trailer features them sharing a kiss. \nThreaded through the stories is the grief over the death of Edward Herrmann, who played Richard, Lorelai’s father; Herrmann died of cancer two years ago. In the revival, his widow, Emily (Kelly Bishop), grapples with life without her husband of 50 years. \nShe’s devastated, but still, she’s Emily Gilmore: Nothing can stop her from making a snarky comment to Lorelai, with whom she has a stormy relationship, or taking Luke down a peg. (Emily: “Luke.” Luke: “Yes?” Emily: “That was just my way of saying goodbye.”) And remember how she used to hire and fire maids every few days? Now, there’s a story line with her non-English-speaking housekeeper, one that seems out of place for a TV show in 2016. \nIn the years since “Gilmore Girls” went off the air, some viewers have pointed out the show’slack of diversity and its racial stereotypes, particularly Mrs. Kim (Emily Kuroda), the very strict Korean mother of Rory’s best friend Lane (Keiko Agena). Although Stars Hollow has evolved in many ways, much of the original tone remains the same — and there’s a hint at how the show feels about politically correct culture. \n“Body shaming! Trigger warnings!” Lorelai sarcastically yells when Luke is upset that she’s eating tacos before a full dinner. “War on Christmas!” \nFlaws magnified second time around \nOne of the downsides of re-watching your favorite show is that the flaws become magnified. Many young women re-watch “Gilmore Girls” and realize they relate more to Lorelai than Rory, a scary reminder of the passage of time — and that Rory could be, well, kind of annoying. \nAll the characters have their negative traits, which are on display in the revival: Selfishness, the rash decisions that hurt others, the casual cruelty disguised as banter. Although it’s all part of making them well-rounded, binge-watching six hours of it in a row reinforces how your much-loved characters make poor choices. \nThis could be why Sherman-Palladino was upset when Netflix refused to release the episodes one week at a time, and instead will drop them all once, which is custom. Indeed, some advice: Ninety-minute “Gilmore Girls” episodes are not for binge-watching, at least not all in one sitting. \nNot only do some of the characters become insufferable, but some expanded scenes are ones that don’t necessarily need expanding. For example, instead of a couple minutes of one of Stars Hollow’s typically terrible stage productions, there’s enough time to stretch it out for much longer. \nThen again, maybe you love Stars Hollow musicals. Maybe you can’t get enough of Taylor Doose (Michael Winters) running the town meetings; or Paris Geller’s (Liza Weil) insults; or Lane’s band, Hep Alien; or references to Tori Spelling and Neil Patrick Harris. \nThat’s the one benefit of a “Gilmore Girls” mini-movie — with extended time and producers’ creative freedom, it’s a veritable buffet of every “Gilmore” experience imaginable. And for this show in particular, that’s all the fans really care about, anyway. \nIF YOU WATCH \n“Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” (four episodes) begins streaming Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

Oh and while we’re at it, this Snicket is American, while back in 2004 he had a distinctly English accent.\nThere’s wardrobe changes going on In the 2004 film Violet had a Victorian look about her – but she’s a bit different in the Netflix version (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) The 2004 movie had a bit of a Victorian gothic look to it, with eldest Baudelaire orphan Violet (Emily Browning) looking like a character from a period horror movie in her long black dress. However new Violet (Malina Weissman) seems to favour a more wholesome pink-frock-and-plimsolls look,while baby Sunny has also ditched the long dresses for something more infant-friendly.\nCount Olaf is even more sinister Jim Carrey (left) upped Count Olaf’s comedic side, whereas Neil Patrick Harris looks set to explore his darker side (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) While Jim Carrey’s Count Olaf had his moments, his performance was more comedic than sinister – while Neil Patrick Harris looks like he’s going to veer more towards the latter, with a sprinkling of the former thrown in. If we were Baudelaires, we’d definitely be a bit scared of him.\nThe plot’s a bit different  \nThe 2004 movie featured an unfortunate event on a train track – but the Netflix version shows more signs of being faithful to the books (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) Actually the plot of the 2004 film was the one that was different, as it included an extra bit when Olaf tries to kill the orphans in a train accident, which definitely doesn’t feature in any of the books that made up the first movie. Plus you get adaptations of all 13 books for your money here, instead of just the first three as you got in 2004. Yay!\nThe rest of the cast has changed too Aunt Josephine, one of the orphans’ guardians, was played by Meryl Streep in 2004 -now she’s played by Alfre Woodard (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) Look out for Aasif Mandvi as Uncle Monty (who was played by Billy Connolly in the movie), K Todd Freeman as Mr Poe (taking over from Timothy Spall, who played him in the movie), Alfre Woodard replacing Meryl Streep as nervy Aunt Josephine, and Joan Cusack stepping in as Justice Strauss where Catherine O’Hara left off. Although O’Hara does turn up later in the series as Dr Georgina Orwell, an optometrist who appears in The Miserable Mill (book four of the series).We’re liking the sound of this.\nLemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events is released on Netflix on January 13 2017. \nMORE: Neil Patrick Harris makes a pretty terrifying Count Olaf for Netflix’s Lemony Snicket \nMORE: Netflix snaps up Lemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events for original TV series ",

      "text": "by Kevin Fitzpatrick November 18, 2016 12:30 PM | ScreenCrush Marvel / Netflix \n\nOnly two or so of Marvel’s Netflix Defenders have costumes we expect to see during major events, to say nothing of some otherwise-memorable looks drafted during their individual series. Now, two Defenders and their closest allies have hit the street in new set photos, looking very much as we remember. \nSuperheroHype debuted another round of set photos from the November production, spotlighting a few familiar faces we’d yet to see. Not only are Trish Walker and Jessica (who thankfully hasn’t changed her look since 2015) back together, but so too does Luke Cage appear to be a free man. Don’t think we didn’t notice the yellow shirt under the yellow-lined hoodie, or that Misty seems to be keeping her classic comic look from the Luke Cage finale. Marvel's The Defenders cast is coming together in new set photos https://t.co/yKKMGgQhwd \n— SuperHeroHype (@SuperHeroHype) November 17, 2016 \n\nElsewhere of Marvel’s Netflix Defenders , we know the eight-part event will feature among the returning cast Elodie Yung , Jessica Henwick , Scott Glenn, Rosario Dawson, Rachael Taylor , Simone Missick, Deborah Ann Woll , Carrie-Anne Moss, Elden Henson and Eka Darville . The team-up series will be helmed by Daredevil showrunners Doug Petrie and Marco Ramirez , and helmed in part by Jessica Jones director S.J. Clarkson . \nIn addition to the return of supporting cast outlined above, Sigourney Weaver has signed on as the main, as-yet-unidentified villain . There’s still plenty of The Defenders filming ahead, but what other famous looks and crossovers should we expect to see?",

      "text": "Luke was originally a woman on “Gilmore Girls” and we have so many questions The Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls is officially being released in ONE WEEK! With the cast and crew of the revival doing some serious press in anticipation of new episodes, we’re learning a lot of behind the scenes details about the original WB show, including the fact that the character of Luke Danes was supposed to be a woman on Gilmore Girls . \nYes. A woman. This is quite a bombshell, seeing how grumpy diner owner Luke went on to become Lorelai Gilmore’s main love interest and the overall GREATEST love interest in the series. \nApparently, the character was supposed to be named Daisy , but wasn’t fully fleshed out enough to require rewrites when the character became Luke. \n\nSeries creator Amy Sherman-Palladino recently revealed to Entertainment Weekly how character came to be the flannel shirt wearing crank we all know and love. \n“Luke was originally a female character,” she explained. “[The network] came to me and said we need another guy, so I literally just took a character and changed the name, didn’t even change any of the dialogue because I’m that lazy.” \n\nWe know what you’re thinking, was Daisy supposed to be Lorelai’s love interest? According to Sherman-Palladino, neither Daisy or Luke was intended to be Lorelai’s love interest . She revealed that the pairing of the characters was due to the on-screen chemistry between Lauren Graham (Lorelai) and Scott Patterson (Luke). \n“We did a few shows and they just had chemistry. It was the episode where they were in the market and Lorelai’s spying on Dean. Luke was there and they had this scene that didn’t mean anything.” \n\nWhile we probably would have loved Daisy as a character, and imagine should would have been a bit like Stars Hollow’s favorite mechanic, Gypsy (Rose Abdoo), we could never picture a Gilmore Girls universe without Luke! Would Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia) still have made it onto the show? Would Daisy and Lorelai have become besties? Would the coffee banter still work? \n\nThis was quite a bombshell to drop on us, ASP! Now we really can’t wait until Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres next week! \nThe post Luke was originally a woman on “Gilmore Girls” and we have so many questions appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Season one of Marvel’s Daredevil on Netflix was chugging along well when the unthinkable happened… a long time comic character Ben Urich ( Vondie Curtis Hall ) was viciously beaten to death by Wilson Fisk ( Vincent D’Onofrio ) around nine episodes in. Urich has been a constant in the Daredevil universe for years… so when he was killed, it told readers all bets were off.\nCharlie Cox who plays Matt Murdock talked at Wizard World Pittsburgh (Thanks to Screengeek ) about the death and what it did for the series and all the Marvel / Netflix series.\nI know that as a show, they don’t try to take storylines that are already written. We want to be our own thing. One of the reasons they killed Ben Urich, which was such a great shock for me, but the reason I think they do it because the people who love the show are great fans and have read the comics and we need them to know this is not a safe place and the drama is going to affect you as well. You don’t know what’s going to happen. If we kill Ben Urich, what does that mean? We could do anything potentially.\nPrevious: Oh My God!

      "text": "By Liam Mathews, After a pair of tone-establishing teasers , the first trailer for Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events is finally here.\nThe trailer for the series based on the young adult novels by author Daniel Handler's alter ego Lemony Snicket gives viewers their first looks at cast members including Joan Cusack , Alfre Woodard and Catherine O'Hara . It also shows some of the hilariously unconvincing disguises that Neil Patrick Harris ' Count Olaf will be using to try to bamboozle people into letting him secure the Baudelaire orphans' fortune for himself.\nIt's a very funny trailer, and the special effects and production design look great. Watch it here.\nA Series of Unfortunate Events follows the misadventures of the Baudelaire siblings as they try evade their wicked new guardian Olaf's attempts to steal their inheritance. The books were previously adapted into movie in 2004 starring Jim Carrey .\nA Series of Unfortunate Events premieres Friday, Jan. 13 on Netflix.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nA Series of Unfortunate Events Neil Patrick Harris Alfre Woodard Joan Cusack Catherine O'Hara Aasif Mandvi\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Los Angeles: Amazon.com Inc is preparing to take its video streaming service worldwide in a challenge to Netflix Inc, the world’s largest paid online TV network.\nAmazon, which currently offers the service in only a handful of countries, announced the plans Thursday in a blog post about “The Grand Tour,” a lavish new reality show featuring the former stars of BBC’s popular “Top Gear.”\n“In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon,” the company wrote on its website. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also mentioned the plans on Twitter.\nAmazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, has spent billions of dollars licensing programming and producing original shows and movies as part of its Prime service. Customers who pay $99 a year for free shipping and other benefits get access to a library of new and older content at no added cost.\nThe expansion of the Seattle-based company’s video service is one of the biggest challenges yet to Netflix, which operates in more than 190 countries after completing its international roll-out in January. It is available everywhere except Syria, North Korea, China and Crimea, the company said at the time. \nSally Fouts, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon’s plans earlier Thursday.\nVideo Strategy\nThe online retailer has funded its video service to increase sales of other products such as shoes, laundry detergent and books. People who watch videos on Amazon are likely to stick around and shop for other products as well.\nTo offer video service around the world, Amazon has to obtain global rights and satisfy local regulators. The company began seeking worldwide rights to shows this year, a sign of its plans to expand, according to people familiar with the matter who weren’t authorised to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.\nIt makes sense for Amazon to push its original programming in other markets, but securing the rights to distribute its entire catalogue of movies and shows worldwide would be expensive, said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc\n“They’re not paying FX to run ‘Justified’ in Scandinavia or Gabon,” Pachter said. “The stuff they own, sure, why not.”\nStreaming video services like YouTube and Netflix are popular in developed countries, especially the West. Foreign markets where fewer people have access to fixed broadband internet pose more of a challenge.\nAmazon earlier this year began selling a stand-alone video service to complement the existing product, which is an add-on to its Prime subscriptions. The video service will be introduced in new countries in time to offer “The Grand Tour.”",

      "text": "Who Said It: Stranger Things or Keeping Up With the Kardashians ?   \nStranger Things -- Netflix's retro-inspired sci-fi series with so much hipster and cool-kid cred -- keeps getting cooler by the day. \nIn the latest development, the show has added Married actor and comic Brett Gelman to its Season 2 lineup, having him play a journalist named Murray Bauman who becomes a conspiracy theorist digging into a cold case, according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nSean Austin and Paul Reiser cast in Stranger Things Season 2 \nGelman, known for his offbeat and piercing approach to comedy as seen on Brett Gelman's Dinner in America and the Matthew Perry-starring Go On , lands the gig in perfect time too, as he recently made headlines for severing ties with Adult Swim for what he deemed as a lack of opportunity for women at the network. \nHe joins a growing list of Stranger Things newcomers including Paul Reiser and The Goonies star Sean Astin , and of course returning characters including the beloved Millie Bobby Brown , who plays Eleven. \nStranger Things Season 2 is scheduled to premiere in 2017.",

      "text": "115.51 USD \nAmazon wants to unseat Netflix, the reigning champ of streaming video. And it's taking Prime Video global to do so. The two TV and movie services have been duking it out over customers and original content for years, but Amazon's new expansion raises the stakes. Earlier this year, Netflix expanded its streaming video around the world and has been burning cash to make it profitable . Amazon, on the other hand, is flush with cash thanks to its other operations, including Amazon Web Services, which generates huge operating margins . That gives Amazon the ability to ramp up -- and will force Netflix to make sure it has a strategic sequel or two in store. \nWhat Do They Want?

(Photo: Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images) Share Tweet \nIf firing up your Netflix app tends to instill in you the desire to pull on a cardigan and send a contribution to Mike Pence’s office, it might be time to balance that out with a new media source. Maybe something that will stir up some less-complacent, more-revolutionary feelings in your soul. Could be what you’re looking for is Bounce TV’s new streaming service, Brown Sugar , which caters to aficionados of ’70s-era blaxploitation films Shaft, Foxy Brown, and Across 110th Street . \n“Brown Sugar is just like Netflix, only blacker,” genre mainstay Pam Grier says in a statement. “These movies are entertaining and fun, but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time.” \nSerious music and film consumers who have yet to dip into this enormous and extremely entertaining well of cinema will likely encounter a lot of familiarity, and not only because they watched a Quentin Tarantino movie earlier in the week. “You can see the influence of these movies in every aspect of rap and hip-hop,” rapper Rick Ross posits in the same press release. “In the music, the lyrics, the fashion, and overall style—the Blaxploitation genre is where it all began.” \nThe $3.99-per-month service provides a decently sized selection of unedited and commercial-free classic content. And don’t worry, this isn’t an either/or decision. Once the credits roll on Black Caesar , you can always return to your beloved Netflix, content in the knowledge that Joe Swanberg’s delightful new indie series will be right there waiting for you. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "By Liam Mathews, After a pair of tone-establishing teasers , the first trailer for Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events is finally here.\nThe trailer for the series based on the young adult novels by author Daniel Handler's alter ego Lemony Snicket gives viewers their first looks at cast members including Joan Cusack , Alfre Woodard and Catherine O'Hara . It also shows some of the hilariously unconvincing disguises that Neil Patrick Harris ' Count Olaf will be using to try to bamboozle people into letting him secure the Baudelaire orphans' fortune for himself.\nIt's a very funny trailer, and the special effects and production design look great. Watch it here.\nA Series of Unfortunate Events follows the misadventures of the Baudelaire siblings as they try evade their wicked new guardian Olaf's attempts to steal their inheritance. The books were previously adapted into movie in 2004 starring Jim Carrey .\nA Series of Unfortunate Events premieres Friday, Jan. 13 on Netflix.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nA Series of Unfortunate Events Neil Patrick Harris Alfre Woodard Joan Cusack Catherine O'Hara Aasif Mandvi\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > Leaving Soon > Scripps Content Leaving Netflix in January 2017 Scripps Content Leaving Netflix in January 2017 Tweet \nFears that all of the Scripps content, that came up for renewal in November, leaving Netflix have only been cut short as it’s been confirmed that their entire catalogue will be leaving Netflix on January 1st, 2017. This includes content from their networks including DIY Network, Cooking Chanel, Food Network, HGTV and the Travel Channel. \nThe deal in place which brings a huge range of the cable networks content to Netflix on a regular release basis is set to completely end when the new year starts, according to BroadcastingCable . It states that the network seeks a better arrangement where they can earn money from both advertising and distribution. Netflix has stated in the past that all of their content, both first party and third party, should be exclusive to the platform. \nAs for what will become of the Scripp shows, it’s thought we’ll see their shows available on either a new streaming service of their own or even move to a streaming platform that demands less exclusivity. \nIn all, 54 series will be leaving Netflix which puts quite a whole in the Netflix documentary section but Netflix hopes to fill that gap in 2017 with its own original documentary series. \nWe’ve broken down every single title that’s set to leave on January 1st below ordered by the network it airs on. We’ll also have a post up a bit later on this month with highlights of shows that you should absolutely watch before they expire. DIY Network",

      "text": "Stranger Things -- Netflix's retro-inspired sci-fi series with so much hipster and cool-kid cred -- keeps getting cooler by the day.\nIn the latest development, the show has added Married actor and comic Brett Gelman to its Season 2 lineup, having him play a journalist named Murray Bauman who becomes a conspiracy theorist digging into a cold case, according to The Hollywood Reporter .\nSean Austin and Paul Reiser cast in Stranger Things Season 2\nGelman, known for his offbeat and piercing approach to comedy as seen on Brett Gelman's Dinner in America and the Matthew Perry -starring Go On , lands the gig in perfect time too, as he recently made headlines for severing ties with Adult Swim for what he deemed as a lack of opportunity for women at the network.\nHe joins a growing list of Stranger Things newcomers including Paul Reiser and The Goonies star Sean Astin , and of course returning characters including the beloved Millie Bobby Brown , who plays Eleven.\nStranger Things Season 2 is scheduled to premiere in 2017.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nStranger Things Brett Gelman",

      "text": "MADISON, Wis. — A Wisconsin prison inmate whose case was featured in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer” will stay behind bars while state attorneys appeal a decision overturning his conviction, a panel of federal appellate judges ruled Thursday.\nBrendan Dassey’s release from prison appeared imminent right up until the three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued its decision. Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday.\n“We are disappointed more than words can say,” Dassey’s attorneys, Steve Drizin and Laura Nirider, said in a statement posted online shortly after the ruling was released. “The fight goes on.”\nDassey, now 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier. He confessed to detectives that he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family’s salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Avery was sentenced to life in prison in a separate proceeding.\nAvery and Dassey contend they were framed by police angry with Avery for filing a lawsuit against the county over his wrongful imprisonment for a sexual assault he didn’t commit. He’s pursuing his own appeal in state court.\nTheir cases gained national attention last year after Netflix aired “Making a Murderer,” a multi-part documentary examining Halbach’s death. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair’s innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the documentary was biased but the series generated calls from the public to free both men.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ruled in August that investigators coerced Dassey, who was 16 years old at the time and suffered from cognitive problems, into confessing and overturned his conviction. Duffin said in the decision that if state attorneys appealed the ruling Dassey would remain in prison pending a resolution.\nThe state Justice Department filed an appeal that is still working its way through the 7th Circuit. But this week Duffin ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday.\nThe DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit on Wednesday seeking to block the release, arguing Duffin’s release order contradicts his original ruling in which he said Dassey would remain in prison pending the appeal’s resolution.",

      "text": "Photo: Gabriel Olsen/FilmMagic/Getty Images \nNetflix's Stranger Things has a new recruit. According to The Hollywood Reporter , actor and comedian Brett Gelman will enter season two of the breakout show as Murray Bauman, a disgraced journalist who turns up in Hawkins, Indiana, to investigate a cold case. He’s also a conspiracy theorist, so Hawkins is either going to be utopia for Mr. Bauman, or it’s going to drive him totally insane. This is just the latest buzzy casting news for Gelman, as he’s set to appear in the Twin Peaks revival on Showtime, and was recently seen in the fantastic Fleabag on Amazon. He was also in the news this week for severing his relationship with Adult Swim. Gelman had starred in shows like Eaglehart and Brett Gelman’s Dinner in America for the programmer, but cited the company’s terrible track record with women as his reason for ending the business relationship. Stay woke , Brett.",

      "text": "\nNetflix is really into their off-beat advertisements lately (see: French Onion Barb Soup ), and a recent commercial for “Netflix Vista” is a perfect representation of the dark tone and humor of Black Mirror. \nThe video first asks, “What do you love most in life?” and “What if the things you love could always be with you?” which sounds all well and good until you realize the vista is an implant/contact combo that lets you watch Netflix all the time–while you’re working out, at the beach, or even holding a dying loved one’s hand. It’s not a bad gizmo, but the short clip is full of people ignoring the world around them and losing out on real-life experiences.\nIt’s evocative of the recording implant in “The Entire History of You,” where we see Toby Kebbell and Jodie Whittaker’s characters’ relationship unravel and implode when the technology magnifies their little suspicions and already-existing problems. Black Mirror fans will also recognize the song, Irma Thomas’ “Anyone Who Knows What Love Is” as the tune Jessica Brown Findlay’s character sings in “Fifteen Million Merits.” If you catch any other easter eggs, let us know in the comments!\nNot gonna lie, a Netflix Vista doesn’t sound too horrible, since those long commutes can get pretty dull.

      "text": "Bené Viera | 11.18.16 | 4:28 pm Share < br />this article: CREDIT: iStock \n& #8220;Just like Netflix, only blacker,” Pam Grier says in the promotional trailer for Brown Sugar. Brown Sugar, a new online streaming service with a focus on black films , is the hub for ‘ 70s blaxploitation joints and oldie classics. So maybe the tagline “the black Netflix” is quite ambitious. But it does offer something Netflix doesn’t. \nAn Atlanta-based network for black viewers, Bounce TV, launched the Brown Sugar website on Thursday with a trailer for the service starring Rick Ross, Pam Grier, and Fred Williamson. Ross is the official ambassador while Grier and Williamson have films featured in the service’s library. The service is available through iTunes and Google Play on phones and tablets for $3.99 per month, with an initial free trial period to test it out. \nNow we can talk about Ross in a freaking ‘fro in this trailer. I don’t know who Ross owed a favor, but it’s pure joy. “Even with the beautiful car and fast women there was something missing in my life,” he says in a brown silk robe. “Then I found Brown Sugar. Now I stream the biggest collection of baddest movies — from Foxy Brown and The Mack to Supa Fly and Shaft . And I take the action everywhere.” \nTo recap, Ross is rocking a cheap ‘fro wig in a blue polyester shirt, then a silk robe, in a mansion, talking with rhythm about watching movies on Brown Sugar wherever he goes. Oh, he has on sunglasses and lots of flashy iced out jewels. “It’s polyester wishes and Cadillac dreams, baby,” Ross says. Who made this happen? Who wrote the commercial? Who came up with the concept? Why is this trailer more exciting than the lineup of movies? We need answers! \nBack to the service. Its library includes films like Foxy Brown , Dolemite , Super Fly , The Mack, Uptown Saturday Night, and Shaft . According to IndieWire, it curates its “extensive library” by themes: War in Harlem, Foxy Mamas, Jive Ass Turkeys, and Good Cop, Bad Cop. IndieWire quotes Grier as saying, “These movies are entertaining and fun, but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African-Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time.” \n‘Tis true. But how many black people can watch blaxploitation films over and over again? In addition to it being “a BLACK Explosion of HOT Chicks, COOL Cats and CULT Classics,” according to the website, I’d love to see them expand their content. Incredible black shows like Girlfriends and movies like Five Heartbeats and Crooklyn could use a home. For now, you can revel in the beauty that is Pam Grier in Foxy Brown . She’s a bad mamma… shut yo’ mouth!",

      "text": "Caroline Westbrook for Metro.co.uk Friday 18 Nov 2016 5:34 pm To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nThe first full trailer for the Netflix adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events is out – and we couldn’t be more excited. \nThe new adaptation of the cult kids’ series – featuring the many misfortunes of the Baudelaire orphans – is heading for the streaming service on January 13, with Neil Patrick Harris set to steal the show as the conniving Count Olaf. \nBut of course it’s not the first time that the Snicket novels – the work of author Daniel Handler – have been brought to the screen, with the first three books in the 13-strong series being turned into a movie, starring Jim Carrey as Olaf, in 2004. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nAnd judging from the trailer,this looks like it could be a very different affair – but just what’s different this time around? \nWell… You get more Snicket for your pains this time around Jude Law’s Snicket (left) was seen in silhouette, whereas Patrick Warburton actually shows his face on camera (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) \nPatrick Warburton actually shows his face as the elusive author in the Netflix adaptation, whereas in the 2004 movie Jude Law was seen in silhouette. Oh and while we’re at it, this Snicket is American, while back in 2004 he had a distinctly English accent. There’s wardrobe changes going on In the 2004 film Violet had a Victorian look about her – but she’s a bit different in the Netflix version (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) \nThe 2004 movie had a bit of a Victorian gothic look to it, with eldest Baudelaire orphan Violet (Emily Browning) looking like a character from a period horror movie in her long black dress. However new Violet (Malina Weissman) seems to favour a more wholesome pink-frock-and-plimsolls look,while baby Sunny has also ditched the long dresses for something more infant-friendly. Count Olaf is even more sinister Jim Carrey (left) upped Count Olaf’s comedic side, whereas Neil Patrick Harris looks set to explore his darker side (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) \nWhile Jim Carrey’s Count Olaf had his moments, his performance was more comedic than sinister – while Neil Patrick Harris looks like he’s going to veer more towards the latter, with a sprinkling of the former thrown in. If we were Baudelaires, we’d definitely be a bit scared of him. The plot’s a bit different \nThe 2004 movie featured an unfortunate event on a train track – but the Netflix version shows more signs of being faithful to the books (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) \nActually the plot of the 2004 film was the one that was different, as it included an extra bit when Olaf tries to kill the orphans in a train accident, which definitely doesn’t feature in any of the books that made up the first movie. Plus you get adaptations of all 13 books for your money here, instead of just the first three as you got in 2004. Yay! The rest of the cast has changed too Aunt Josephine, one of the orphans’ guardians, was played by Meryl Streep in 2004 -now she’s played by Alfre Woodard (Picture: DreamWorks/Netflix) \nLook out for Aasif Mandvi as Uncle Monty (who was played by Billy Connolly in the movie), K Todd Freeman as Mr Poe (taking over from Timothy Spall, who played him in the movie), Alfre Woodard replacing Meryl Streep as nervy Aunt Josephine, and Joan Cusack stepping in as Justice Strauss where Catherine O’Hara left off. Although O’Hara does turn up later in the series as Dr Georgina Orwell, an optometrist who appears in The Miserable Mill (book four of the series).We’re liking the sound of this. \nLemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events is released on Netflix on January 13 2017.

The scary part is that they’re all zoned out, with a trance-like look on their faces, while they watch Netflix without needing a TV, computer or any other device. Adding to the techno-paranoia, the video asks, “What do you love most in life? What if the things you love could always be with you.” The ad then takes an interesting turn at the end when it states, “Your life is a story. Get out and watch it.” We’re not sure if the short film is meant to tells us to stop watching Netflix – because why would they want to do that – or the “Black Mirror” creators are just that great at promoting the series. Check out the video below. \nThis Article is related to: Television and tagged Black Mirror , Netflix More From IndieWire",

Tim Molloy | November 18, 2016 @ 4:14 PM \nNetflix’s sci-fi drama “Black Mirror” offers scarily close-to-home commentary about how technology changes our lives, and now it’s taking on the technology that lets us watch “Black Mirror.” \nA new online ad for the series imagines a world in which everyone can watch Netflix through contact-lens-like devices, activated by an implant in our necks. The fake (so far) technology is called “Netflix Vista.” \nThe ad shows people using Netflix Vista to watch scenes from our favorite episodes of “Black Mirror,” including the one that inspired Netflix Vista. Also Read: 'Black Mirror': 5 Real-Life Inspirations for the Mind-Bending Satire (Photos) \nThe third episode of Season 1, entitled “The Entire History of You,” imagines a near future in which people use implants called “grains” to record every aspect of their lives — and sometimes play them back for everyone, with sometimes disastrous effects. Robert Downey Jr. has optioned the episode to be made into a feature film. (There’s no word on when the Downey adaptation will be available on Netflix Vista.) \nLike every piece of technology in “Black Mirror,” Netflix Vista sounds great… a the beginning. But by the end of the ad we see how “Netflix and chill” has been replaced by “Netflix Vista and give everyone else the cold shoulder.” \nUsing a grain to watch Netflix isn’t that different from using our phones to watch Netflix, of course. Here’s a list of the five real-life inspirations for great “Black Mirror” episodes. \nYou can watch the Netflix Vista ad here: Something special for your bright, bright future. pic.twitter.com/gDpbPGCJpE \n— Black Mirror (@blackmirror) November 18, 2016 All 13 'Black Mirror' Episodes Ranked, From Good to Mind-Blowing (Photos) \nWe've spent a lot of time staring into Netflix's dark, cracked \"Black Mirror.\" Usually we rank things from worst to best, but there are no bad episodes of the show. Here's every episode of \"Black Mirror,\" ranked from good to to mind-blowing. Netflix \n13. Season 3, Episode 6: \"Hated in the Nation\" \nIt's disappointing that Season 3 -- in which \"Black Mirror\" produced some of the best television, well, ever -- ended on such a so-so note, by \"Black Mirror\" standards. This story about a killer hashtag and Terminator bees has shades of \"Sharknado.\" Great acting, though. Netflix \n12. Season 2, Episode 3: \"The Waldo Moment\" \nA lot of people say this episode, about an insulting cartoon bear who inserts himself into politics, heralded the rise of Donald Trump. It's well done, but just not that groundbreaking. Netflix \n11. Season 1, Episode 2: \"Fifteen Million Merits\" \nThis twist on \"American Idol\"-style mobs is, again, well-acted. But is it even a satire to portray people working hard for the illusion of happiness? Isn't that just... being alive? Netflix \n10. Season 2, Episode 2: \"White Bear\" \nFull disclosure: We're very divided on this one. One of us thinks it's a sharp critique of armchair prosecutors, and the other thinks \"Black Mirror\" is least effective when it goes for horror. Netflix \n9. Season 3, Episode 2: \"Playtest\" \nAnother horror episode. It's absolutely captivating, and the questions it raises about memory and identity linger long after the shocks. Netflix \n8. Season 2, Episode 1: \"Be Right Back\" \nWe recommend this episode, and all the ones that follow, with zero reservations. Starring Hayley Atwell and Domhnall Gleeson , \"Be Right Back\" is another aching look at the qualities that make us us. It's one of many \"Black Mirror\" episodes that could have been a Best Picture contender if it were a movie. In fact, it shares some similarities with the 2014 Best Picture nominee \"Her.\" Netflix \n7. Season 2, Episode 4: \"White Christmas\" \nIf you're dreaming of a black Christmas, this showcase for Jon Hamm at his most mad combines two imaginary technologies -- one of which allows you to \"block\" people in real life -- to tell one of the knottiest stories ever told. Sentiment-free, it's the most \"Black Mirror\" episode of \"Black Mirror.\" Netflix \n6. Season 3, Episode 3: \"Shut Up and Dance\" \nNo episode of \"Black Mirror\" will leave you feeling worse about humanity than this one. It's brilliantly plotted and paced, and the ultimate prank is on you. Oh, also? It could happen. Similar things have already happened. Netflix \n5. Episode 3, Season 5: \"Men Against Fire\" \nWelcome to the Top 5. We don't say this lightly: This episodes stands alongside \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" and \"Full Metal Jacket\" as one of the best stories about how war really works. (Fun fact: The speech about most soldiers not firing their weapons might be totally wrong.) Netflix \n4. Season 3, Episode 1 -- \"Nosedive\" \nThis episode, starring Bryce Dallas Howard , is a perfect sendup of our obsession with social media approval. We tweeted how much we loved the episode, waited to see if anyone retweeted or liked our tweet... and then realized the show hit even closer to home than we had realized. Netflix \n3. Season 1, Episode 1: \"National Anthem\" \nThere is no better introduction to the show's cold-realist aesthetic. Netflix \n2. Season 3, Episode 3: \"The Entire History of You\" \nIf you've ever been in a relationship with anyone who's been in another relationship, this one will crush you. The episode so needed to be a movie that Robert Downey Jr. is turning it into a movie. Netflix \n1. Season 3, Episode 4: \"San Junipero\" \nHard sci-fi with heart. This is another episode that, if it were a film, would be a Best Picture contender. It's visually stunning, joyous to watch for anyone with any sense of '80s nostalgia -- and makes you grateful for life and love. It's all the more perfect that the episode features a colorblind romance filmed in Cape Town, South Africa -- the former seat of segregation. Netflix \nIf you're done with \"Black Mirror,\" have you tried Netflix's latest, \"The Crown\"? It's excellent, and we ranked all the characters. Previous Slide Next Slide 1 of 15 \nThere are no bad episodes of “Black Mirror,” but the best will change how you see the world \nWe've spent a lot of time staring into Netflix's dark, cracked \"Black Mirror.\" Usually we rank things from worst to best, but there are no bad episodes of the show. Here's every episode of \"Black Mirror,\" ranked from good to to mind-blowing.",

      "title": "5 Shows to Watch on Netflix This Winter",
      "text": "christmas Share this article \nLooking for something to do during winter break? Here's a list of classic-but-good shows to watch while snuggled up in bed: \n1. The Crown \nThe Crown depicts the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the time of her wedding to Prince Phillip in 1947 to present day. \nWhy I like it: The Crown reminds me a lot of Downton Abbey (which is one of my favorite shows) and what makes it even better is that it's based off actual historical events. (Who doesn't love the queen?) \n2. House of Cards \nHouse of Cards is a politcial drama about a fictional Democrat, Frank Underwood, who is passed over for appointment as Secretary of State, and therefore creates an elaborate plan to achieve more power. \nWhy I like it: Who doesn't like drama? The show made briliant casting choices that make it completely absorbing to watch. \n3. Lost \nLost is a classic show from the early 2000's. The show follows a group of passengers who become marooned on a mysterious island in the South Pacific after their flight from Sydney to Los Angeles crashes. \nWhy I like it: It doesn't follow a typical plane crash story line. There are elements of the supernatural and science fiction that manage to spice things up. \n4. Shameless \nThe series focusses on the atypical family of Frank Gallagher and his six children. Shameless follows the six children, who raise themselves while their father is off drinking. \nWhy I like it: It depicts the very real problem of alcoholism and how it affects Frank's children. And because of this, the show is relatable and evokes strong emotions. \n5. Gossip Girl \nBased on a book series written by Cecily Von Ziegesar, Gossip Girl is narrated by an unknown blogger who depicts the lives of upper-class teenagers living in Manhattan's Upper East Side. \nWhy I like it: WHO DOESN'T LOVE GOSSIP GIRL? You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > News > Weekly Highlights Netflix US November 18th Weekly Highlights Netflix US November 18th \nNew week, new titles. It’s the weekend before Thanksgiving. Inhale and take this moment in because it’s all crazytime from here. Sink into the couch and take advantage by binge, binge, bingeing. Take Me To The River \nThis masterful debut from Matt Sobel is the story of a California teen teen trying to remain above the turmoil bubbling just under the surface at his Nebraskan family reunion. But a strange encounter with his young cousin places him at the center of a long buried dark family secret. We are left guessing just what happened between the two, and so begins a slow build up of tension and dread. You’re left to wonder over and over again ‘just what exactly is going on here?’ all the while knowing something disturbing is slowly unfolding. It ventures into extremely unsettling territory, but the phenomenal ensemble cast rises to the challenge. \nRoman Empire: Reign of Blood Season 1 Netflix Original \nThis six-part miniseries is part documentary, part drama. Narrated by Sean Bean (Game of Thrones) it is the story of the Roman Emperor Commodus, the handsome son of Rome’s greatest philosopher king. He was also the man who brought down an entire empire. This isn’t your usual narrative. It combines talking heads with glossy drama. There’s academia, but also violence and nudity. It’s a very interesting take on the docudrama. Tales By Light \nA collaborative effort between Canon and National Geographic, this Australian documentary series promises to show viewers the world through the eyes of a select group of storytellers. Season one follows five photographers – Art Wolfe, Darren Jew, Richard I’Anson, Peter Eastway, and Krystle Wright – on their journey as visual storytellers in some of the world’s most “extreme and fascinating environments.” It is stunning and gorgeous and a much needed break your brain needs. \nSour Grapes \nAt first glance you may think a film about wine would be a boring affair. But this entertaining, and often times amusing, documentary tells the strange story of Rudy Kurniawan, a young man from Indonesia who in the early 2000s appeared in wine circles and began investing vast sums of money in rare bottles. What follows is an embarrassing scandal that rocked the world of highest-end wine collectors. It’s a bit of a caper, complete with a cast of privileged dupes you aren’t likely to feel much sympathy for. The truth really is stranger than fiction. \nThe 100 Season 3 \nLoosely based on a 2013 book of the same name, this post-apocalyptic series follows a group of teens sent to return to Earth after a devastating nuclear apocalypse. The only known survivors lived on 12 space stations in Earth’s orbit prior to the event. The stations banded together to form a single massive station named “The Ark.” After the Ark’s life-support systems are found to be critically failing, 100 juvenile prisoners are sent to the surface in a last ditch attempt to determine whether Earth is habitable again. The 100 was renewed for a fourth season set to premiere in February 2017 so now is the perfect time to catch up! \nColin Quinn: The New York Story \nColin Quinn really shines in his one-man shows and his latest project is no exception. Directed by fellow New Yorker Jerry Seinfeld, Quinn takes a look at his hometown’s history. He goes back to the roots of New York and traces the individual contributions made to its uniquely abrasive character by the various ethnic groups that settled there. It’s sort of like taking one of those bus tours headed by a loud, cranky ambassador. It’s worth the trip. \nNetflix Titles Mentioned Weekly Highlights Also on What's on Netflix Subscribe to our newsletter",

      "text": "VIDEOS Gilmore Girls Stars Beg You: ‘Don’t Spoil the Last Four Words’ \nThe stars of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival, debuting next Friday, walked the red carpet — really, more of a gray carpet — in L.A.’s Westwood neighborhood on Friday night for the official premiere. The four new episodes (dubbed A Year in the Life ) come nearly a decade after Gilmore Girls ended its original run on The CW in 2007, but the actors all look like they haven’t aged a day. (Must be all that coffee.) Launch Gallery \nIn attendance were series stars Lauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Kelly Bishop (Emily), Scott Patterson (Luke), Liza Weil (Paris), Matt Czuchry (Logan), David Sutcliffe (Christopher), Keiko Agena (Lane), Yanic Truesdale (Michel) and many more familiar faces from the Stars Hollow community. \nClick on the gallery to the right to see the Gilmore Girls stars on the red gray carpet, then come back and hit the comments to tell us what you’re doing to make the next seven days go faster.

      "text": "It sounds like Luke Cage was a bona fide hit for Netflix - trouncing even its Marvel rival Daredevil. Netflix are notoriously evasive when it comes to ratings - but Symphony Advanced Media has been able to estimate how the streaming service has done in 2016 (using data taken from user surveys). According to these stats, in the 32 days following the release of Luke Cage, 6.34% of \"video viewers\" aged 18 to 59 were watching the show in an average minute. A bit confusing, yes, but the long and short of it is, Luke Cage outperformed Daredevil's second season - which could only manage 5.94% using the same metric. Mike Colter's series even outperformed the first week stats for Netflix mega-hits Stranger Things and Making a Murderer. Both of those shows, though, ending up outperforming Luke over the entire 32 days, with 9.81% and 9.1% respectively. And in case you were interested, the most popular Netflix shows overall? Orange Is The New Black and (believe it or not) Fuller House, which is huge in the US. Maybe one day Netflix will 'fess up and we'll get full ratings for all its shows. But until then, these fiddly stats are the best we've got... The next Marvel show to stream on Netflix will be Iron Fist, debuting March 17, 2017. Watch Mike Colter talk the future of Luke Cage with Digital Spy right here: ",

      "text": "binge watch Share this article \nWith Thanksgiving break right around the corner, what better way to unwind than to watch Netflix? If you’re like me then you have probably already gone through most of the shows and movies Netflix has to offer. Even with their ridiculously accurate “recommended for you” section, they don’t always show you all the options. Here’s a list of our favorite hidden gems on Netflix: \nThe Crown (Series): A Netflix original, this movie tells the chronicles of Queen Elizabeth II’s life from the 1940s to modern times. Black Mirror (Series): A lot of people are calling this a modern day “Twilight Zone,” with every episode having a different cast and a unique plot. Grace and Frankie (Series): Two women find themselves divorced and alone after their husbands reveal a long-kept secret affair to them. If you need a laugh, Grace and Frankie never fails to entertain! Bates Motel (Series): After the death of her husband, a mother moves herself and her son to a different town for a fresh start. Mysterious things start happening in their new life, making this psychological horror show a must watch. The Fundamentals of Caring (Movie): A young boy with muscular dystrophy wants nothing more than to see the world’s deepest pit. He and his new caretaker embark on a cross-country journey, and pick up a hitchhiker, played by Selena Gomez, along the way. Watch the trailer here! Narcos (Series): This show tells the story of Pablo Escobar, Colombia’s most infamous drug lord. This is the perfect mix of drama and action. Stranger Things (Series): Delve into the mysterious world of the “upside-down” as a group of young boys search for their friend Will who has gone missing in a small Indiana town. The terrifying forces these boys and Will’s mother (played by Winona Ryder) encounter during their search will leave you shaking. Amélie (Movie): This whimsical movie portrays the life of Amélie, played by the famous Audrey Tatou, who enjoys plotting and scheming in a “Disneyfied” version of one of Paris’ most exciting neighborhoods.

      "text": "Culture Seven Films and Shows to Watch This Weekend on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu Curl up to shows like \"The Crown\" and \"Red Oaks,\" films like \"Matilda\" or documentaries like \"Under the Sun.\" By Stav Ziv On 11/18/16 at 9:39 PM Close Netflix: What's Playing In November \nThe luxurious, four-day Thanksgiving weekend is so close. But first you must endure one more measly two-day weekend and three days in which you'll pretend to work while counting down the hours. As you await your mini-vacation, start the Thanksgiving bingefest early with films like Erin Brockovich , Matilda , Up in the Air and several newly added James Bond movies. There's also Under the Sun fordocumentary fans , and TV shows like The Crown and the second season of Red Oaks . \nHere are some suggestions for streaming this weekend: Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> Erin Brockovich (Amazon, November 1) \nJulia Roberts won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her lead role in Erin Brockovich . She plays a single mother who fights her way into a job at a law firm and then discovers that the water in a town where one of the firm's clients lives is contaminated. The movie follows her research into the case and the lawsuit filed against Pacific Gas and Electric Company. From Russia With Love and several other James Bond films (Hulu/Amazon, November 1) \nSeveral James Bond films—from the eras of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig—are on Amazon and Hulu. Newly added titles like From Russia With Love (Connery), A View to Kill (Moore), The Living Daylights (Dalton) and Die Another Day (Brosnan) join already available ones like Spectre (Craig). Matilda (Amazon, November 1) \nBased on Roald Dahl’s children’s novel of the same name, this 1996 classic directed by Danny DeVito stars Mara Wilson in the title role (and DeVito as her father). The intelligent, kind child is surrounded by a mean, incompetent family and goes to a school with a terrifying headmistress. But she finds solace in her friends and her teacher, Miss Honey, and discovers her literal and figurative power to do good. Up in the Air (Hulu, November 1) \nGeorge Clooney, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman and Vera Farmiga star in this 2009 film, based on the novel by Walter Kirn. It follows Ryan Bingham (Clooney) as he travels around the country to help companies “downsize,” or fire employees en masse. He loves his solitary, on-the-move lifestyle, or at least he thinks he does. The Crown : Season 1 (Netflix, November 4) \nThis Netflix original tells the story of Queen Elizabeth II’s ascent to the throne after the death of her father, King George VI, and the early years of her reign. According to the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes, where the show has an 89 percent rating on the Tomatometer, “powerful performances and lavish cinematography make The Crown a top-notch production worthy of its grand subject.” Under the Sun (Netflix, November 11) \nRussian director Vitaly Mansky and his crew pretended to be filming a state-approved documentary in North Korea, all the while smuggling footage of the orchestration to make a very different movie, one that would give viewers a glimpse into what life is like in the most isolated country in the world. Red Oaks : Season 2 (Amazon, November 11) \nIt’s the 1980s. College student gets a summer job at Red Oaks Country Club. College student returns the next summer, says he’s not going back to NYU in the fall. Jennifer Grey, star of the actual ’80s flick Dirty Dancing , plays boy’s mother.",

      "title": "'Fuller House' Star Developing Family Comedy for Fox (Exclusive)",
      "text": "Fox is looking to one of the stars from Netflix's Fuller House for its next family comedy.\nThe network is teaming with actor-writer Scott Weinger to develop an untitled family comedy, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\nThe project, which landed at Fox with a script commitment, is described as a single-camera comedy about a married couple whose lives are turned upside down when the wife's immigrant father comes to live with them. The father-in-law's larger-than-life personality and his inclination to take big risks clashes with his strait-laced son-in-law.\nWeinger, who plays D.J.'s ex-boyfriend on the Full House revival, will pen the script and executive produce the new project alongside 3 Arts Entertainment's Jonathan Berry.\nThe comedy hails from Warner Bros. Television, which also exec produces Fuller House.\nIn addition to his acting roles, Weinger has a long and impressive roster of TV writing and producing credits that include The Muppets, Galavant, Black-ish, The Neighbors and 90210. Repped by UTA and attorney Bruce Gellman, Weinger is also married to TV writer/showrunner Rina Mimoun (Everwood, Mistresses, Gilmore Girls).\nFamily comedies continue to be in high demand at the broadcast networks this development season.",

      "text": "Meet the cast of The Crown Everything you need to know about the cast and characters of Netflix's drama   Radio Times staff  20AM \nThe Crown is a brand new Netflix original series, which dramatises Queen Elizabeth II's early reign, revealing the personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries behind the great events that shaped the second half of the 20th Century. \nIt's a 10-part series and is Netflix’s most expensive and ambitious project to date. \n“The Crown brings with it a set of responsibilities and fundamentally realigns the power structure in a way that can only be challenging,” says Peter Morgan, the show's creator. Suddenly, Elizabeth is no longer just a wife, a sister, or a daughter. She is the Queen, the head of the family, the head of state, the head of the Church of England, and the head of the Commonwealth of Nations. \n“What’s made it so interesting to write is not this or that historical event,” says Morgan. “It’s been that this is a family, and within that family is the Crown, and the Crown is a bomb that changes the structure of everything.” \nClaire Foy and Matt Smith are playing the royal couple, but there's plenty more of the cast you need to meet... Claire Foy – Queen Elizabeth II \nPrincess Elizabeth expects to have many years of married bliss before ascending to the throne, but no such luck. Her simple life is cut short when her father, King George VI, dies unexpectedly, and at the age of 25, she inherits the Crown and the unimaginable burden that comes with it. \n“Peter Morgan’s Elizabeth is a quite naïve, sheltered person,” says Foy. “She has been brought up very well, to respect people and do the right thing. But she’s grown up from the age of eleven knowing that she was going to be Queen one day. \n“Ultimately, I think she’s a very kind, loving, strong, determined, funny, clever person. Sometimes she’s allowed to show it, and sometimes she’s not.” \nWhere do I recognise her from? \nFoy is no stranger to period dramas – she played Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall and appeared in Upstairs Downstairs. She is also known for Season of the Witch, Going Postal and Wreckers. Matt Smith – Prince Philip \nPhilip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is in many ways the opposite of his wife. He is reluctant to be browbeaten by the British Establishment, and has his own cross to bear surrounding his own family history. Emotionally orphaned as a young boy, Philip’s greatest sense of loss is that of the tight family unit that he worked so hard to create. \n“He is a loyal person, he has a sort of irreverence and curiosity,” says Smith. “He has a thirst for progress, knowledge and modernity. Plus, he’s got a great sense of humour.” \nWhere do I recognise him from? \nDoctor Who, of course! He was the eleventh – and youngest – person to play the Doctor. Smith also appeared in The Ruby In The Smoke and Diary of Call Girl with Billie Piper, had a role in BBC's Party Animals, and popped up in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies in 2016.",

Well now with this \"Netflix Vista\" short just posted by the company, it takes that idea one step further. Including technology reminiscent of Season One's \"The Entire History of You,\" it imagines a world where everyone has implants that allows them to augment reality with video overlays.

      "text": "E-mail \nFor the past year, Netflix has been the only globally available streaming service, but that’s something that could change very soon as sources tell that Amazon in on the verge of a global Prime rollout. That is great news for everyone that want access to the broadest possible library across all providers in a legal way. \nAmazon Prime Video is currently only available in five countries, the US, UK, Germany, Austria, and Japan – and India is coming soon. The addition of Amazon Prime for another 200 markets is something I’m sure both customers and Amazon would like and that might happen this December. A great time to make the move as many people will opt into the Prime membership while ordering their Christmas presents online. \nThere is one catch to the deal and that is that only one show has been confirmed for the global audience yet and that is the Grand Tour which is the remake of the popular motor show Top Gear. While it is the only confirmed title, I’m sure that Amazon will launch its Prime service with more than just one show for the global audience. \nThe Grand Tour itself, which Amazon reportedly paid $250 million, became available in current Prime Video markets yesterday, and will go global from December, according to a tweet from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and a YouTube video from the stars of the show.",

      "text": "Seeing what Netflix do with A Series of Unfortunate Events should be interesting. The series has such potential for visual flair, which we also saw in the first film, that seeing the company get behind that in a longer form could have a huge payoff.\nIt seems we are going to be getting a new look at the series tomorrow too. In a tweet, author of the books Daniel Handler , we get our first looks at Joan Cusack ‘s Justice Strauss and Catherine O’Hara ‘s Dr. Orwell.\nA first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. Later this week, the @Unfortunate trailer. pic.twitter.com/8ynBSs6Y52\n— Daniel Handler (@DanielHandler) November 14, 2016\nNeil Patrick Harris also showed off his Count Olaf, as a captain, and confirmed that we will see the trailer on Thursday.\nI’m giving you sneaks peeks all week counting down to the @Unfortunate trailer release on Thursday. Prepare to swoon: Here’s Captain Sham. pic.twitter.com/SNvyzb1sFW\n— Neil Patrick Harris (@ActuallyNPH) November 14, 2016\nSign me up for all of this. I still have a very soft spot for the film version, and if this even gets close, it will be worth the time investment.\nPrevious: Six-And-A-Half Seconds Of Steve Ditko Next: When Doctor Strange And The Punisher Run The Jewels For Midtown Comics",

      "text": "Posted Fri Nov 18, 2016 at 12:30 PM PST by Steven Cohen \nThe new animated series will start streaming next month. \nNetflix has released a trailer for its newest show, 'Pacific Heat.' The animated series will premiere on December 2. \nPacific Heat is an animated comedy series based on the exploits of a dynamic unit of undercover police investigators working on the glitzy “Gold Coast” of Australia. This glamorous, sophisticated, and sun-drenched paradise masks a hot-bed of crime; everyone from drug smugglers and biker gangs to eco-terrorists and the person who invented frozen yogurt. In order to tackle this seedy underbelly police authorities established “PacificHeat.” This covert squad of highly trained operatives technically does not exist (although they do have their own Facebook page), but when criminals strike, Pacific Heat will be there; unconventional, uncompromising and unafraid to operate outside the law – provided at least one of them is wearing a fluorescent safety vest. PacificHeat was created by the award-winning Working Dog team of Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner and Rob Sitch. \nCheck out the official trailer below! Likewise, the streaming platform is also prepping new seasons of 'Chelsea,' 'Lady Dynamite,' and 'Real Rob ,' a new sci-fi series called ' Travelers ' from writer Brad Wright, the second season of ' Stranger Things ' for 2017, the third season of ' Bloodline ' for 2017, new episodes of the documentary series ' Making a Murderer ,' ' Bill Nye Saves the World ' for 2017, Marvel's ' The Punisher ,' Spike Lee's ' She's Gotta Have It ,' and a feature film adaptation of the manga ' Death Note .' A current Netflix subscription starts at $10 for HD streaming and $12 for Ultra HD streaming.",

      "text": "'The Crown' Updates & Spoilers: Netflix Announces Season 2 Premiere; To Include Princess Diana?   19, 06:00 am \"The Crown,\" a Netflix original series, will release its second season and fans are expecting to see Princess Diana.(Photo : Netflix US & Canada/YouTube) \nNetflix just announced the premiere date for \"The Crown\" Season 2, much to the delight of its fans. Will the new season feature the life of Princess Diana? We have exciting details on the upcoming season's possible plot, cast, and air date. Advertisement \n\"The Crown\" Season 2 will still have Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II and Matt Smith as Prince Philip. However, it is reported that at least two main characters will be replaced in Seasons 3 and 4. For timeline continuity, older actors will then replace them for Season 5 and 6. \n\"The Crown\" Season 2 is also reported to be Netflix's most expensive series to date. It has an estimated production cost of $100 million. The budget is already evident in the upcoming season's extravagant trailer. \nThe entire Season 1 focused on the eight years of Queen Elizabeth II's rise to the British throne. Now, many fans are eagerly expecting for the period drama to give them a glimpse of Princess Diana in Season 2. \nDiana, known to the British as the People's Princess, is an important part in Queen Elizabeth II's life. As a young bride to Prince Charles and then mother to Princes William and Harry, Diana has definitely endeared herself to the masses. Will \"The Crown\" include her in Season 2? Just finished watching The Crown. Season 2 NOW please! \n— Tom Fletcher (@TomFletcher) November 16, 2016 \nThere is indeed a possibility that \"The Crown\" fans will see Princess Di. Peter Morgan, writer and creator of the show, has already plotted all the six seasons of the drama series, Time reports. Also, the show's production team is said to be discussing the possibility. They acknowledge that there's plenty of material about Princess Diana and her relationship with Queen Elizabeth, so exploring that storyline would be great. \nIn an interview with Digital Spy , \"The Crown\" producer Andrew Eaton mentioned that fans would really enjoy Season 2 as they've prepared a lot of \"great stuff\" for this season. He added that the show will mostly focus on British politics and even feature The Beatles. \n\"The Crown\" Season 2 will return on Netflix on Nov. 2017. All the ten episodes of the show will be released. Are you hopeful for a Princess Diana appearance? Who do you think will play the princess? Share your thoughts with us in the comments below!
