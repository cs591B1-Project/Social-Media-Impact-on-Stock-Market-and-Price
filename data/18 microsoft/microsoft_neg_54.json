      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nU.S. technology giants including Facebook , Twitter , Microsoft , and Google's YouTube could face new laws forcing them to deal with online hate speech if they don't tackle the problem themselves, the European Commission warned. \nIn May, the four U.S. firms unveiled a \"code of conduct\" drawn up in conjunction with the Commission, the European Union's executive arm, to take on hate speech on their platforms. It involved a series of commitments including a pledge to review the majority of notifications of suspected illegal hate speech in less than 24 hours and remove or disable access to the content if necessary. Another promise was to provide regular training to staff around hate speech. \nBut six months on, the Commission is not happy with the progress. EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova has commissioned a report, set to be released later this week, which claims that progress in removing offending material has been too slow. \n\"In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,\" a Commission official said. \n\"After 48 hours, the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.\" Jaap Arriens | NurPhoto | Getty Images \nThe Commission said that it could introduce new laws to force the U.S. companies to act faster. \n\"If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,\" Jourova told the Financial Times in an interview on Sunday. \nA spokesperson for the Commission confirmed the comments in an email to CNBC. \nJourova's report is not being released until Wednesday where it will be discussed with the various technology firms. \nFacebook and Microsoft said they were not commenting on the report when contacted by CNBC. Twitter and Google have yet to respond when contacted by CNBC. \nIn the six months after the \"code of conduct\" was signed, there were 600 notifications to the tech firms regarding hate speech, according to a summary of the report seen by CNBC. \nOf those, 316 were flagged up as requiring a response from the firms. Around 28 percent or 163 cases ended up in the removal of content. But 153 were not removed as the companies concluded that it was not in breach of legislation or their own community rules. \nThe report also noted difference in the removal rates in different member states which were as high as 50 percent in Germany and France, but just 4 percent in Italy.",

      "text": "Corey has a keen interest in 3D printing and all tech news as well as the wider impact of additive manufacturing. Microsoft release 3D builder app for Windows phones Microsoft release 3D builder app for Windows phones 0 shares 0 \nMicrosoft have released a new 3D design application for Windows phones. The 3D builder app allows users to scan, view, personalize and print 3D models. Furthermore, the app can make use of your camera in order to create digital 3D models from real objects, as seen below. While the desktop app has been available for some time, this is the first version for mobile devices. This announcement comes shortly after Paint 3D, the 3D version of the famous Paint application, has been given an initial release . The app enables 3D scanning through use of a smartphone camera. Image via Microsoft. \nFeatures of the mobile application include: a smoothing and simplifying tool, automatic repair model function, and the ability to drag and drop to build simple shapes. Moreover, the application supports 3MF, STL, OBJ, PLY, and WRL (VRML) files. According to Microsoft “ 3D Builder provides everything you need to make any 3D content printable. ” The Microsoft 3D builder app being used to create a 3D football model. Image via Microsoft. \nMicrosoft 3D builder is not dependent on the user having a 3D printer. The designs created can be sent to Materialise for printing via the app itself. Allowing the user to quickly send designs to a third party and get them printed at a high quality standard. However, if you don’t have a 3D printer, or don’t want to use a 3D printing service, Microsoft does enable images of the designs to be printed in 2D on paper. 3D builder for Windows phones joins an array of mobile 3D design apps, including Autodesk’s Fusion 360 & 123D Catch and Scann3D. The Scann3D app in particular makes the process of capturing images and generating a mesh relatively straightforward. \nAlso now in its beta testing phase is the WeDesign tool where a growing community of users are collaborating on the free desktop app to create some fascinating remixed designs. WeDesign can be accessed here . \nMicrosoft has also been in the news recently with news relating to their new HoloLens. The device which allows users to view 3D imagery in mixed reality has been used by Brazilian Doctors during spine surgery . \nFeatured image shows 3D builder user interface. Image via Microsoft.",

      "text": "​Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Twitter signed a so-called code of conduct in May that would have them tackle the issue of hate speech in a more efficient way, but their reaction has so far been below expectations, the European Commission said. As a result, the EU is calling for all companies to combat hate speech and content promoting violence and terrorism faster and more efficiently, or otherwise be forced to do it with laws that would regulate how tech firms must act in such cases. “In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40% of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours. After 48 hours the figure is more than 80%. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies,” an EU official was quoted as saying by Reuters. According to the original code of conduct signed in Ma...",

      "text": "Microsoft, Intel, Others Oppose China Plans to Get Access to Source Code GO “How is that supposed to boost security?” Microsoft asks Dec 5, 2016 10:19 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft, Intel, and IBM are three of the most vocal companies that opposed China’s plans to access proprietary source code of software and technology products in order to make sure that they’re hackerproof or do not include backdoors. In particular, Microsoft explains that providing access to source code contradicts the idea of boosting security, with the other tech companies also adding that such a thing would only expose their products to rivals or cybercriminals. “Sharing source code in itself can’t prove the capability to be secure and controllable. It only proves there is source code,” Microsoft said in comments submitted to the Technical Committee 260, which is the national cybersecurity standards body that’s pushing new laws requiring companies to share their source codes. Intel, in its turn, explains that providing access to proprietary source code “would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products,” according to WSJ . The new regulations will come into effect in June 2017. Apple also rejected request for code sharing Microsoft itself explains that it has already created a Transparency Center in Beijing that allows interested parties to have a look at its code, but the firm emphasizes that sharing source code can compromise security and put products at risk. This isn’t the first time when China seeks access to proprietary source code of products developed by foreign companies, and Cupertino-based Apple revealed earlier this year that it received such a request from the country for its iOS mobile operating system. Apple rejected the request , the firm revealed. Most companies already operate in China with local joint ventures and the Journal writes that they “are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy.” Although China is pushing for new cybersecurity rules that would force the likes of Microsoft and IBM to share proprietary source code, the companies are unlikely to respond very aggressively and analysts do not expect them to threaten with leaving the country should these laws come into effect. China continues to be one of the largest technological markets worldwide and companies obviously want to make the most of this opportunity, but this dispute between tech firms and Beijing is unlikely to end here, especially because the June deadline is approaching.",

      "text": "Microsoft Warns of New Scams Aimed at Windows Users GO Redmond discovers new phone scam wave in NZ Dec 5, 2016 09:00 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ Microsoft and security company Netsafe warn that Windows users in New Zealand should be extra cautious these days because they discovered a new series of phone scams that attempt to steal their money and even infect their computers with ransomware. Specifically, Microsoft says it’s the old phone scam trick reinvented, with scammers claiming to work for Microsoft and reaching out to address a number of computer issues, such as infections. Scammers claim that they discovered malicious activity on victims’ computers and often say that this is harming other users online or ISPs detected something suspicious on systems. As it usually happens, the phone scammers request a remote connection to the victims’ computers and ask for up to $500 in order to fix problems that don’t exist. Microsoft says that in some cases, attackers even deploy ransomware on these systems, locking down access to files until victims pay the requested amount of money. Microsoft won’t call you and request money for computer fixes Microsoft once again reiterates that nobody working for the software giant would ever call you and offer computer fixes or security patches, and adds that users should never provide access details to their systems. In case this happens, they should terminate the session immediately and if any financial details were shared, to contact their bank. “There are some cases where Microsoft will work with your Internet service provider and call you to fix a malware-infected computer—such as during the recent cleanup effort begun in our botnet takedown actions,” Microsoft explains . “These calls will be made by someone with whom you can verify you already are a customer. You will never receive a legitimate call from Microsoft or our partners to charge you for computer fixes.” For the moment, it’s not yet clear if and how many users were actually tricked by phone scammers to pay for fake computer repairs, but given that these malicious attempts keep happening, they’re probably effective.",

      "text": "Microsoft “Absolutely” Had to Be in Hardware, Former CEO Steve Ballmer Says GO Ballmer talks Microsoft’s investments in hardware Dec 5, 2016 08:09 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says the Redmond-based software giant had no other option than to invest in hardware, and judging from where the company is right now, this was clearly a smart decision. In an interview with Fox , Ballmer explains that hardware will be an essential business for Microsoft in the future, and explains that he is very pleased with the success the company experienced with the Surface series. “It’s one of the things I am really proud about was getting the muscle really working so that the company could do hardware. Because I do think it’s an important part of the future. I love the way the Surface has now emerged,” he said. The Surface adventure The first Surface model, called Surface RT, was launched when Steve Ballmer was still CEO of the company, but this version eventually failed and forced Microsoft to agree with a $900 million write-down because of unsold units. The firm, however, continued investments in the Surface lineup and launched new models in 2013, one of which was powered by the full version of Windows 8.1. Microsoft eventually abandoned RT-powered versions and started focusing exclusively on Surface devices capable of running full Windows. At this point, Microsoft’s Surface lineup comprises not only 2-in-1 devices, but also a laptop (the Surface Book), and an all-in-one PC called Surface Studio. There are also several accessories available, such as the Surface Pen, the Surface Dial, and Surface mice and keyboards. “The thing that I was pretty clear about when I was working there was we [the company] absolutely had to be in the hardware business and as you noted, we’ve been in Xbox for a while but it wasn’t really a general purpose capability. So, Surface and then phones, it sounds like they are taking a different kind of cut at it just from what I read from the press,” Ballmer continued. Although the Surface series eventually succeeded, not all Microsoft’s hardware efforts are going well. The company still struggles in phones, and rumor has it that it’s now planning to abandon the Lumia lineup entirely, with the focus to be switched to just one model that could launch next year as Surface Phone.",

      "text": "Microsoft Announces New Windows 10 Creators Update Features GO Braille support will be a key accessibility improvement Dec 5, 2016 06:32 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update is quite an eagerly-anticipated release for Microsoft users, mostly because of the big number of improvements that the company plans to introduce, but it appears that there’s even more to come in this particular OS update. In a lengthy post that went live during the weekend, Microsoft revealed some of the accessibility improvements that it wants to be included in the Creators Update, confirming that Narrator will be a key focus for the company’s engineers in the next months. Support for braille is one of the highlights of the Creators Update and Microsoft says that it’s working with manufacturers to support as many displays as possible. “The Creators Update will include beta support for braille input and output. The beta will support braille displays from more than 35 manufacturers, using more than 40 languages and multiple braille variants, including grade 2 contracted braille,” the firm said. Significant Narrator updates Furthermore, Microsoft says that Windows 10 Creators Update will support installing with the Narrator, as this feature will also become available throughout the setup process. Narrator will also come with a new way to launch, such as the CTRL + Windows key + Enter (previously, users could launch the app with Windows key + Enter). Cortana will also be able to start the app. There will also be new speech voices and capabilities, with Microsoft promising 10 new voices, while Narrator will offer support for multilingual reading. The audio experience has also been overhauled with dynamic ducking, which means that applications using the sound, such as Pandora, will have their sound volume lowered when Narrator is speaking. Edge will get its own share of accessibility improvements, “including the ability to jump directly to a form element lick a check box, text field or button,” and the Creators Update will give the option to use a controller to drive Narrator interactions on Xbox. Many of these features will become available in the upcoming Insider Preview builds for testing purposes, while everyone else should get them with the debut of the final version of the Creators Update due in early 2017.

      "text": "Microsoft Home Hub To Compete With Amazon Alexa And Google Home? 5 December 2016, 6:04 am EST By Vamien McKalin Tech Times Microsoft could be preparing to enter the smart home market with the Home Hub, a possible upcoming Windows 10 feature. ( David Ramos | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft is one of the many companies without a smart home solution, and that's odd seeing as the technology is there in the form of Cortana, and it's being used publicly for several years. However, it would seem as if Microsoft is ready to compete with a product known as Home Hub. \nA new report claims this is exactly what Microsoft is working on, but it won't be something 100 percent similar to Amazon's Alexa, Echo or even Google Home. On the software side, it's similar, but we've come to understand that Home Hub is more software than hardware. \nAccording to a report from Windows Central , Home Hub will be baked into Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. Furthermore, the service is aimed at families and will feature an upgraded version of the Cortana virtual assistant. Home Hub will also focus much on sharing, similar to what folks expects from a real family. \nWe understand Home Hub will have a communal calendar, one that is similar to the Calendar app in Windows 10. What sets Home Hub apart from the competition is the fact that it will be on millions of home computers, and instead of just voice interaction, it will also support touch-based interactions as well. \nThis makes sense because voice interaction is not yet perfect, and the user experience can be more powerful if there's a touchscreen with greater options. No Need To Build Hardware \nWith Windows 10 being on millions of computers in homes, there's no need for Microsoft to build hardware for Home Hub. Furthermore, it's possible Microsoft might add Home Hub to its Project Scorpio video game system that will be among the regular Xbox family. \nLet's keep in mind that Xbox is designed for the living room more so than a Windows 10 computer, so don't be surprised if Home Hub is added to the console. Not to mention, Windows 10 is the operating system that powers the Xbox One console. When Will Home Hub Be Released \nThis we're not sure about, but Windows Central did say bits and pieces of Home Hub will be released across Redstone 2 , Redstone 3 and Redstone 4 updates for Windows 10. If such is the case, then it could take by the end of 2017 to 2018 before Home Hub is fully operational as it is meant to be. \nWhatever the case may be, Microsoft needs to get in the home assistant market as soon as possible before Amazon , Google and even Apple takes a big chunk of it.

      "text": "Does Windows 10's Data Collection Trade Privacy For Microsoft's Security Published by Slashdot on Mon, 05 Dec 2016 jader3rd shares an article from PC World arguing that Windows 10's data collection \"trades your privacy for Microsoft's security.\"[Anonymized] usage data lets Microsoft beef up threat protection, says Rob Lefferts, Microsoft's director of program management for Windows Enterprise and Security. The information collected is used to improve various components in Windows Defender... For example, Windows Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge will put the Edge browser into a lightweight virtual machine to make it harder to break out of the browser and attack the operating system. With telemetry, Microsoft can see when infections get past Application Guard defenses and improve the security controls to reduce recurrences. Microsoft also pulls signals from other areas of the Windows ecosystem, such as Active Directory, with information from the Windows 10 device to look for patterns that can indicate a problem like ransomware infections and other attacks. To detect those patterns, Microsoft needs access to technical data, such as what processes are consuming system resources, hardware diagnostics, and file-level information like which applications had which files open, Lefferts says. Taken together, the hardware information, application details, and device driver data can be used to identify parts of the operating system are exposed and should be isolated into virtual containers. The article points out that unlike home users, enterprise users of Windows 10 can select a lower level of data-sharing, but argues that enterprises \"need to think twice before turning off Windows telemetry to increase corporate privacy\" because Windows Update won't work without information about whether previous updates succeeded or failed.

      "text": "How Microsoft Lost In Court Over Windows 10 Upgrades Published by Slashdot on Mon, 05 Dec 2016 In June a California woman successfully sued Microsoft for $10,000 over forced Windows 10 upgrades, and she's now written a 58-page ebook about her battle (which she's selling for $9.99). But an anonymous Slashdot reader shares another inspiring story about a Texas IT worker and Linux geek who got Microsoft to pay him $650 for all the time that he lost.\"Worley built a Windows 7 machine for his grandfather, who has Alzheimer's Disease, [customized] to look like Windows XP, an operating system his grandfather still remembered well...\" writes Digital Trends. \"But thanks to Microsoft's persistent Windows 10 upgrade program, Worley's grandfather unknowingly initiated the Win 10 upgrade by clicking the 'X' to close an upgrade window.\" After Worley filed a legal \"Notice of Dispute,\" Microsoft quickly agreed to his demand for $650, which he donated to a non-profit focusing on Alzheimer's patients. But according to the article, that's just the beginning, since Worley now \"hopes people impacted by the forced Windows 10 upgrade will write a complaint to Microsoft demanding a settlement for their wasted time and money in repairing the device,\" and on his web page suggests that if people don't need the money, they should give it to charities fighting Alzheimer's. \"If Microsoft isn't going to wake up and realize that lobbing intentionally-tricky updates at people who don't need and can't use them actively damages not only the lives of the Alzheimer's sufferer, but those of their whole family, then let's cure the disease on Microsoft's dime so their tactics and those of companies that will follow their reckless example aren't as damaging.\" Worley suggests each Notice of Dispute should demand at least $50 per hour from Microsoft, adding \"If recent history holds steady they might just write you a check!\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "text": "Share \nAccording to emerging reports, Microsoft is planning to take on Amazon Alexa and Google Home with the coming release of its HomeHub features. HomeHub will be built directly into Windows 10 and will (according to Window Central) “crush” Google Home and Amazon Echo. \nWhether that happens remains to be seen — what is less controversially known about the coming release is that it will be designed to work with any Windows 10 PC and that it will be integrated with Cortana such that the AI can be summoned from any lockscreen with useful information on offer. This contradicts initial reports that had indicated that HomeHub would have an Echo-like standalone speaker. That piece of hardware did not appear as expected on Microsoft’s Surface even back in October. \nInstead, Microsoft is focusing on a device that most families already own — a PC — and using it to create a family-friendly digital environment. That environment may include features like the ability to share appointments, apps, and other data on a PC without it being logged into an account. Cortana will also become a central part of HomeHub, and the integration will allow Microsoft’s take on the virtual assistant to provide HomeHub-like features across iOS and Android. This will include extending the assistant to control smart devices and manage them from the Windows 10 HomeHub feature. \nAs for the when of this — Microsoft will seemingly be continuing to cede ground to Amazon and Google as it is still in the planning phases with HomeHub, and there is no release planned until late 2017. \nBetter luck next Christmas.",

      "text": "Microsoft to take on Amazon Echo, Google Home with Home Hub and Cortana Microsoft to take on Amazon Echo, Google Home with Home Hub and Cortana Posted: Tags : Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft + Amazon single-handedly created the smart speaker niche with the introduction of the Echo back in 2014 and has since dominated it with its family of Alexa-powered home speakers. Only now, with the arrival of the Google Home, are we seeing another serious competitor enter this segment of the market with a very similar offering that doesn't break any new ground. Amazon, on the other hand, is reportedly hard at work to innovate the sector with a next-gen Echo speaker that is said feature a tablet-sized touchscreen and high-end speakers. Amidst all of this, Microsoft is also gearing up to enter the connected homes of tomorrow with its own offering, but the nature its vision may surprise you.Microsoft's rumored Home Hub won't be a device cast in the same mold as the Amazon Echo or Google Home. It won't be a speaker, it won't have a touchscreen, or possess any physical properties for that matter. Home Hub will instead be a purely software solution harnessing the ubiquity of Windows 10-powered computers in households around the world.Windows Central has gotten hold of some concept designs for Home Hub, outlining some of the capabilities of the software. Home Hub, in its concept form at least, seems to be envisioned as a shared workspace of sorts that allows the limited sharing of data between PCs connected with the same “family account.” Home Hub is expected to run both on top of the Windows desktop experience, as well as to replace the standard Welcome lockscreen. The latter is shown in the concept images to feature a shared space for to-do lists, upcoming events, and sticky events, among other things, presumably. \nMock-up of what the shared Home Hub Welcome Screen may look like in the future According to sources familiar with the matter, Cortana will become smarter with the arrival of HomeHub, capable of “understanding the family identity.” Reportedly, Microsoft's not-so-popular AI assistant will be deeply integrated into the new platform and will be able to respond to the requests of more than one user, which would be a big advantage over the current competition. Both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home must be linked to multiple accounts in order to cater to the needs of more than one user. Home Hub, on the other hand, will reportedly be able to take control of the shared content of an entire household via a shared family account. \nA new version of Cortana, called FamTana (Family Cortana), will reportedly take care of all Home Hub interactions. She will be distinguished by an orange circle from the all-blue personal Cortana and will be cater to multiple users without the need for switching between accounts With Home Hub, a new breed of “Family Enabled” apps will also be introduced to take advantage of the platform's capabilities. Not much is known yet about them at this point, but according to Windows Central's report, their functionality will extend to mobile apps on the three main OSes – iOS, Android, and Windows 10 Mobile. Home Hub will also be able to take control of smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, locks, and all the other connected appliances, as can be expected.Home Hub is expected to see a staged rollout, beginning with the upcoming Creators Update for Windows 10 (a.k.a Redstone 2) scheduled for “early 2017”, further expanding in the codenamed Redstone 3 update (late 2017), and reaching its full potential with the supposed Redstone 4 update in 2018.So, what do you think about Microsoft's smart speaker competitor? Windows 10 PCs are ubiquitous, and while the same cannot be said about smartphones, Microsoft is fully aware of this and will more likely than not expand Home Hub's functionality to Android and iOS in some form. By harnessing the power of something most people have in their home, a device running Windows 10, Microsoft may be on the right path to innovating the smart home niche and broaden its appeal to a much wider userbase than the one the Amazon Echo and Google Home are currently enjoying.

By: FE Online | Updated: December 5, 2016 5:26 PM Microsoft Home Hub: The features will work on any PC with Windows 10 as the operating system, and the computer will be the epicentre of the home experience. Yet, third-party manufacturers will be needs to build appliances and devices which support the Home Hub. (Reuters) \nMicrosoft is reportedly planning to make a HomeHub feature to bring in the Windows updates, in a bid to challenge Google Home and Amazon Echo, the smart home speakers. But according to rumours, there is a catch. The HomeHub is expected to be a software, not hardware. Windows Central which produces information from many unnamed sources, says that HomeHub will be a software and an update of the Windows 10 OS which will turn your computer into a smart home speaker. \nSmart assistant Cortana for Windows already is able to answer the questions by the user, even during times when the display is closed. Cortana will feature in the HomeHub and reach higher goals by adding more optimised features like sticky notes, shopping lists and appointments. The computer enabled by Home Hub is expected to have a Welcome Screen and full-screen app which will display all the features. Windows Hello may be used, or a family shared account, so as to let every member of the family use the features of the Home Hub. \nAlso read | China’s answer to Amazon and Google; LingLong DingDong smart home speaker to challenge ‘Echo’ and ‘Home’ \nA better use of Cortana will result in making the Home Hub more powerful, ie. by adding controls of home appliances and lights among other things. The features will work on any PC with Windows 10 as the operating system, and the computer will be the epicentre of the home experience. Yet, third-party manufacturers will be needs to build appliances and devices which support the Home Hub. \nAlso read | Apple’s answer to Amazon: Echo-like smart-home device based on Siri \nHowever, there has been no information, directly given from Microsoft and one can expect many changes in the information already there about the device on the internet. However, if speculations are to be believed and things go according to plan, Microsoft is expected to unveil the update in 2017. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now",

      "title": "Microsoft pays out $650 for wrongly upgrading a PC to Windows 10",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft once again had to pay out compensation for upgrading a PC to Windows 10 against the intention of the user.\nThe latest victim of the unintended upgrade was grandfather with Alzheimer’s disease, whose Windows 7 PC had been set up to look like Windows XP, as this was the only environment he was familiar with.\nFollowing Microsoft’s change to make the X button agree rather than cancel the Windows 10 install the PC was updated, leaving it unusable to the gentleman involved, and forcing his grandson, Jesse Worley , who works in IT, to spend hours restoring it to its earlier configuration.\nWorley wrote to Microsoft about the upgrade using the company’s recommended Notice of Dispute procedure, demanding compensation for his time and also a donation to an Alzheimer’s charity. Microsoft agreed to the former, and paid him $650, which Worley then donated to a charity Alz.org.\n“Surely I’m not the only one to face surprise updates, or to spend time and money fixing them,” Worley noted. “Microsoft’s culpability most certainly isn’t limited to those suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease or their families either. I’m not a litigious person, and one of the things I dislike most are people taking a sort of perverse profit from the suffering of others.”\n“I’m an IT tech whose grandfather’s computer was updated through subterfuge, which made life harder for him and his caretakers until it was fixed.”\nDigital Trends reports that Microsoft has admitted that the upgrade pop-up window was misleading and that customers who were misled can seek redress.\nIn June, Microsoft lost a civil case worth $10,000 placed by an estate agent from costs incurred by an unexpected Windows 10 upgrade gone wrong, causing loss of productivity and the need to buy a new PC.\nMicrosoft has been accused of using “ dark patterns ” which are designed to make it appear that the update to the software was unavoidable and later made changes to their Windows 10 upgrade prompts to make it easier for Windows 7 users to decline the upgrade permanently.\nAfter the free upgrade push ended in the middle of this year the rate of increase in Windows 10 installations decreased significantly, and currently stands at around 25% of the PC installed base, and at around 400 million well short of Microsoft’s 1 billion goal.\n",

      "text": "Part of a ZDNet Special Feature: How to Implement AI and Machine Learning Should Microsoft be your AI and machine learning platform? We explore the high-level Microsoft Azure cloud services designed to help firms get started with machine learning. | Topic: How to Implement AI and Machine Learning Image: Microsoft \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella keeps saying that Microsoft's Azure cloud platform makes it easier for firms to exploit machine learning (ML). But how far is this marketing message borne out by the services available on Azure? \nAzure's suite of machine-learning offerings is fairly comprehensive, targeting everything from companies seeking simple, on-demand services through to those looking to train their own models using in-house data scientists. FREE DOWNLOAD Read More \nEvery platform-as-a-service (PaaS) machine learning-related product and service that Microsoft offers is part of the Cortana Intelligence Suite . This bundles Microsoft's analytics and ML-focused offerings with Microsoft cloud-based data stores, capable of holding the vast amount of data needed to train machine learning models. Other services transform data to prepare it for analysis, while others help to display the results clearly. \nAzure's suite of machine learning services is easier for businesses to get grips with than offerings on some competing cloud platforms says Peter Chapman, head of capability at Rolls Royce , which makes use of various Azure machine learning services. \n\"Microsoft is more targeted at enterprise and platform-as-a-service, which suits our goals better,\" he said, stressing the suite's simplicity compared with Amazon Web Service's (AWS) more DIY infrastructure-focused offerings. \nFor those businesses wanting to roll their own analytics and machine-learning platform, the Cortana Intelligence Suite includes HDInsight , a managed version of the Hadoop big data platform, which includes a variety of software for processing and storing data at scale, as well as allowing automated provisioning of clusters via PowerShell. Data can be held externally using services such as Azure Data Lake Store , which offers high-performance storage based on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) standard. Pricing is linked to the number and type of nodes. \nFirms that want less responsibility for managing the underlying infrastructure can use Azure Data Lake Analytics , which is designed to run analytical jobs at very large scale -- over exabytes of data if necessary -- and automatically takes care of the management and provision of underlying clusters. Data Lake Analytics is optimized to process data in Azure's Data Lake Store, but can also process data held in Azure's Blob Storage, SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse. Pricing is based on how many analytical units are used and the number of jobs completed. \nReal-time data processing can be carried out using Azure Stream Analytics , which can query data as it's collected using an SQL-like language or feed it into machine learning models for analysis. \nRouting data where it needs to go is a task for Azure Data Factory : this service builds data-processing pipelines that can pipe data through services, transforming it in transit and interacting with other Azure services -- triggering the creation of HDInsight clusters on demand, for example. \nHelping simplify the process for firms building their own machine learning model is Azure Machine Learning . Launched in 2014, this managed data science platform provides many of the components needed to build machine learning models. The bundled Azure Machine Learning Studio offers a graphical tool that lets users link together pre-built modules that handle each stage of training for machine-learning models. Users can drag and drop modules that link to datasets, pre-process data, run machine-learning algorithms and refine machine learning models. The platform allows users to build their own modules written in R or Python code. Once trained, models can be published as web services, which can be linked to by applications and respond to requests on-demand or during batch processing. \nFirms requiring in-house data scientists to write their own analytics scripts using the statistical programming language R can use Microsoft DeployR to more easily integrate these models into applications. DeployR provides a framework for exposing these R analytics models as web services. \nMaking the output of these machine learning and other analytics models easier to digest is Power BI, which can take data from various Azure, third-party services and on-premise sources and present them in dashboards and other visualizations, including user-created offerings. \nOrganizations that don't want to do any of the work training up machine learning models themselves can use Azure Cognitive Services , which offers a suite of on-demand web services offering speech, vision, natural language and knowledge processing that can be built into applications and bots. Most of these services are billed per 1,000 API calls. \nFinally the Microsoft Bot Framework packages up services for building a chatbot, including the relevant speech and language recognition APIs from Cognitive Services, plus services for hosting and deploying bots and for communicating via messaging platforms such as Skype, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. R&D heritage \nMicrosoft has built up the expertise that underpins these services over the course of many years, according to Herain Oberoi, senior director for product management for Cloud and Enterprise at the software giant. \n\"Machine learning is core to Microsoft's DNA and it has been for a long time, out of necessity because of what we had to do with our consumer businesses,\" said Oberoi, referencing the research that went into developing the Bing search engine, recommendations in Microsoft's Xbox games console, the visual recognition systems in the Xbox Kinect and translation engines in the communication platform Skype. \nThat level of investment continues to build, and in September this year Microsoft announced the formation of the AI and Research Group , led by Harry Shum, a longstanding AI researcher at Microsoft who helped developed the Bing search engine. \nThe cloud-based machine-learning marketplace is increasingly crowded, with competing services from the likes of Google, IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Mike Gualtieri , VP at analyst house Forrester, said that while Microsoft offered simpler tools for firms building their own machine-learning models, the quality of the firm's on-demand, pre-trained speech, vision and language recognition services would likely be less effective than Google's because of the search giant's access to huge amounts of training data. \nFor Rolls Royce's Chapman, part of the appeal of the Azure-based offering is that the cloud platform allows data to be kept in any one of 30 different regions where Azure is available worldwide: \"Microsoft's regional strategy for cloud works well for our business needs, for data protection and data privacy, being able to have clear country boundaries,\" he said. \nRolls Royce uses the Cortana Intelligence Suite's HDInsights capabilities to aggregate data from a large number of sources, as well as the Azure Machine Learning platform and the Data Factory processing pipeline, which together power services that predict fuel consumption and maintenance requirements of its airplane engines. \nThe firm is one of many customers from a wide range of industries that use Cortana Intelligence Suite services: including German elevator multi-national ThyssenKrupp, online transport network Uber, Carnegie Mellon University, soccer giant Real Madrid and American football's NFL. \nAs with any service, there are drawbacks to Cortana Intelligence Suite -- in particular, the fast pace at which new services come online on the Azure cloud platform. \n\"This is not unique to Microsoft. Clearly things are maturing fast, so there's a rapid change of technology and what we've found is that some of the services are maturing at different rates to each other,\" said Rolls Royce's Chapman. \n\"While they've each got their own individual roadmaps, they might not have their roadmaps completely aligned to our use case, and our job is to try to knit these things together. We're often facing decisions on should we use this technology now, when in two months time something else is coming along that perhaps is going to be better suited,\" he added. \nUltimately, Forrester's Gualtieri predicts that Azure-based machine learning services will be continue to be a central pillar of Microsoft's ongoing reinvention as a cloud-first company. \n\"Microsoft understands that, in future, applications are going to have this intelligence and so strategically they have to be able to play there. This is not a casual investment, it's a hardcore investment.\" \nRead more ",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Flagship Windows Phone Disappears from Official Spanish Store GO Is this another step towards the killing of the Lumia brand? Dec 5, 2016 13:19   ​Windows Phone fans certainly heard that Microsoft might be planning to kill off the Lumia brand this December, and although the company hasn’t yet officially confirmed this, it keeps dropping hints that its existing phone lineup is indeed supposed to go dark. After disappearing from the official Microsoft stores in the United Kingdom , the Lumia 950 is no longer available in Spain either, and it looks like the company has removed it from the official website as well. MIcrosoftInsider.es writes that Lumia 950 is no longer sold in the Microsoft Store in Spain, although customers can still purchase the XL model. Furthermore, some other Windows 10 Mobile devices continue to be available, including the Lumia 650 and the HP Elite X3 . Clearing inventories People familiar with the matter revealed earlier this year that Microsoft was planning to discontinue the Lumia brand in December all over the world, as the company wanted to switch focus to just one new model possibly launching as the Surface Phone. Rumor had it that Microsoft wanted to sell as many Lumias as possible until stores run out of stock, and it looks like this is what is happening right now in the company’s stores in the largest European markets. The aforementioned source writes that Microsoft stores are no longer selling high-end Lumia phones (namely the Lumia 950 and the Lumia 950 XL) in several key markets in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy. At this point, it doesn’t seem like Microsoft is interested in making more units available, but if the plan is indeed to phase out the Lumia brand, this is very unlikely to happen. Of course, without an official statement from Microsoft, this is just pure speculation, but given the fact that Redmond has offered only vague statements on the future of its Lumia brand, giving up on phones is very likely to be the plan.",

The release of the 2-in-1 device will be the successor to the Surface Pro 4, which is long overdue. \nIt has previously been expected that the upcoming device from Microsoft will also be released with up to 256 GB of storage, in line with the Surface Pro 4. Now it seems that Microsoft is looking to take the Surface Pro 5 on a completely new level, along with the other rumored improvements for the device. \nRumors suggest that the Surface Pro 5 will pack up to 512 GB of storage, which is double the capacity of the Surface Pro 4 that have only up to 256 GB of storage. \nSurface Pro 5 will be powered by the Intel Kaby Lake chipset. Chipset also comes with inbuilt support for 4K video. Therefore, it is likely that the Surface Pro 5 will be arriving with a 4K display. \nSurface Pro 5 is also said to feature better overall performance, including the better battery life compared with the Surface Pro 4. Its predecessor came with several battery drain issues, so this improvement would be a welcome one for fans of the device. The new chipset will help in resolving the battery performance that is associated with Surface Pro 4. \nThe 2-in-1 hybrid device is expected to have 3:2 aspect ratio of screen display, which has the capability to support full AMOLED 4K video output. It will have a more refined Surface Pen for a more immersive and interactive usage experience is added along with a new keyboard peripheral. Advertisement \nMicrosoft will be adding a USB Type-C port to the Surface Pro 5 that will be including Thunderbolt 3. It is also said to be coming with wireless charging capabilities from its magnetic dock. \nMicrosoft is also said to be releasing the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system in 2017, Redstone 3 in fall 2017. The Redstone 3 is expected to deliver better unified experience. It will also include support for HoloLens VR device, Phone Arena reported. So it is possible that the Surface Pro 5 would be running it right out of the box. \nAs for the release date of the Surface Pro 5, a specific date has not yet been revealed. It is rumored that the tablet will launch in spring 2017, possibly even as early as January. Device will be rumored to have a price tag of $899.",

After disappearing from the official Microsoft stores in the United Kingdom, the Lumia 950 is no longer available in Spain either, and it looks like the company has removed it from the official website as well.

      "text": "Microsoft is working to turn your PC into a Cortana-controlled Home Hub The Redmond home cometh @sophiecharara \nMicrosoft wants to take on the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers with a new Cortana-controlled Home Hub app for Windows machines. \nThat's according to a Windows Central report , based on multiple secret sources. The latest leaks into Microsoft's ambitious smart home plans are saying that we shouldn't expect new hardware but instead a new app for Windows as well as future, compatible third party devices. \nRead this: Amazon Echo 2 vs Google Home \nThe Home Hub app will run on PCs as well as 2-in-1 hybrids like the Surface series. The platform is designed to be more accessible than voice-only smart home gadgets thanks to a \"virtual fridge door\"-style Welcome Screen. It's worth noting too that we're expecting an Amazon Echo 2 with a large touchscreen, according to rumours. \nMicrosoft's voice assistant, Cortana, will be always-on and accessible from the lockscreen, from close to the device or across the room. \nPlus in a feature codenamed FamTana - great name - Cortana will be able to respond to the whole family, not just one account, for controlling music, smart home gadgets and handling shared calendars. \nFor home automation, there will be a separate Connected Home app where Home Hub users can control devices like Philips Hue, group rooms and whatnot. \nThere's no details on an Echo-style speaker but Microsoft is reportedly in talks with the likes of HP and Lenovo to make Home Hub all-in-one PCs by late 2017. More Home Hub gadgets should follow after that. \nMicrosoft has not only Amazon and Google to compete with but also Apple HomeKit and Siri. Still, by turning existing computers into a home hub rather than asking us to splash out on a new connected toy, it could end up with a decent slice of the pie.",

      "text": "Microsoft's real problem with mobile isn't (just) devices The future of secure, modern Windows apps needs to go beyond Surface. | Topic: Productivity \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has promised to stick with Windows phones, but he's also made it clear the target for those phones is enthusiasts and enterprise. Image: Getty Images \nAt the Microsoft shareholders' meeting last week, some unhappy Windows phone fans who also happen to be shareholders asked CEO Satya Nadella what Microsoft was doing for the consumer market on its own platform, not just on iOS and Android. \nNadella's answer was that consumer and enterprise users are still just people who use the same device at home and at work, whatever platform they're on. \n\"I don't think of these as separate markets. I think about users, people, and their devices. The basic construct that we think about architecturally and technically is that it's not about just one device, it's about all the devices for the person. In other words, whether it's the app or the operating system, we want to build it for the person across their devices,\" he said. \nIn other words, the shareholders didn't need to worry about not finding Outlook or Pix in the Windows phone Store because they already have them. \"Outlook, interestingly enough in the context of the Windows Phone, is the mail client, you don't need to go look for another client because it's built into the phone, whereas, in your own operating systems, the camera will have the smarts, you don't need a separate application. You will not need another separate mail program. When we control things silicon up, that's how we will integrate those experiences.\" \nIt certainly makes sense for Office and plenty of other Microsoft apps to be cross platform -- what Nadella calls the mobility of the experience rather than the device. Wherever you go, there's Office and you need Office 365 to get all the features. \nThat keeps users who'd otherwise switch to different tools. \n\"We're not stepping away from supporting our Windows Phone users,\" Nadella reassured the shareholders. \"But at the same time we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher [market] share and we want to make sure that our software is available on this.\" Read More \nIt also makes sense for Microsoft to create new apps first on platforms where there's the largest market for that app, so whether it's an experimental Garage project or a new offering like Sway, it will often show up first on iOS or Android. The machine learning that Sway uses to lay out text and images is now part of PowerPoint. Outlook on all platforms will soon combine the Exchange Clutter feature with the focussed inbox that started in Accompli on iOS. It's obvious how that's useful to Microsoft and to Windows users, even though they're no longer Microsoft's only customers. \nOf course, they never were Microsoft's only, but 'best on Windows' is now about features that only Windows supports, like laptop touchscreens, rather than basic features you could have on any OS: witness the large numbers of Windows features coming to the Mac version of Office in the regular monthly updates, or the way Outlook on iOS can look up free times in the calendar of the person you're arranging a meeting with. \nGetting more users for Microsoft services is a no-brainer. Putting Cortana on iOS and Android creates Bing users (even if they don't know it). OneDrive on every platform is just common sense. The features in the Pix camera app for Android and iOS were on Windows Phone first (as the now-defunct Blink app, and in some Nokia camera features that went away) but the photos do get saved onto OneDrive. \nBut what about utilities like the Swiftkey keyboard on iOS and Android, that make the OS and devices of other companies better without bringing those users onto any Microsoft services? If the idea is to test things out and bring them back to Microsoft's own platform, why is the Word Flow keyboard on Windows 10 Mobile still so bad (when it was such a superb feature on Windows Phone)? \nMobile beyond phones \nThe problem is that 'what's happening with Windows 10 Mobile?' may not be the right question for understanding mobile strategy at Microsoft. \nMicrosoft isn't going to give up on Windows Phone; it has customers like the NYPD who will have signed a long-term support contract. And developing the Windows phone OS ought to be far less work, because so much of it can simply fall out of developing Windows 10 -- although the continuing problems with features like the Word Flow keyboard show it's not quite that simple. \nWhen speaking to shareholders, Nadella promised to stick with Windows phones, but he also made it clear the target for those phones is enthusiasts and enterprise. \n\"We're not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices. What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated in Windows Phone, it's manageability, it's security, it's Continuum capability, that is the ability to have a phone that, in fact, can even act like a PC.\" \nInstead of the year-old, heavily discounted Lumia 950 XL, he name-checked the HP X3 -- because Microsoft doesn't want to make all the hardware its OS runs on, just the ones that create the categories the OEMs can then take over. \nPersonally, when Nadella talks about a new device that redefines what mobility means, I suspect he's talking about HoloLens or VR headsets rather than that just-a-rumour Surface Phone. \nBut the mention of Continuum underlines the importance of UWP apps, and especially universal UWP apps -- because they're the ones that can run on the phone and then 'act like a PC' on a big screen. UWP matters for HoloLens and for Xbox, but where it matters most, it's still not looking strong enough. \nYes, there's another rumour about running x86 apps on phones now that ARM chips have virtualisation support, but I tend to find that any time I have a screen, keyboard, and mouse to use with a phone, they're already plugged into a PC that I could use instead. \nPlus, the legacy of x86 apps isn't just the powerful features that have kept PCs selling well long after the 'death of the PC' was proclaimed. It's also battery-hogging code and malware. There's a reason the original Surface didn't run x86 apps even though Microsoft had the tools to compile x86 code to run on ARM (that's how we got Office on the Surface). That x86 software isn't the best match to the lightweight, long battery life mobile world -- curated app stores are. \nWindows 10 needs modern, secure, sandboxed apps that don't make themselves and the OS vulnerable by relying on desktop APIs that were designed for a more trusting (or simply more naïve) world. That's not about Microsoft controlling the app economy; it's about keeping people using Windows PCs rather than giving up and switching to iPads because they look less likely to get ransomware. UWP is a big part of the answer to many of the problems that have plagued PCs for years. But if UWP apps only run on PCs -- even desirable PCs like Surface Studio -- is there enough incentive for developers to build them? \nTo solve the app problem for businesses and the security problem for users, UWP apps need to be a thriving ecosystem. And to succeed, UWPs have to go beyond PCs, and beyond tablets like Surface Pro. There have to be credible phone devices for UWPs to run on, because otherwise UWP on Windows 10 ends up as an also-ran. \nIf Microsoft concentrates on enterprises and enthusiasts, security ought to be a huge selling point for Windows phones. Security company Lookout says that their data shows 3 to 5 percent of phones have malware (they track both iOS and Android), mostly adware and spyware. \nAnd battery life is often far better on Windows phones; my Nokia 1520 routinely has 50 percent battery life at the point in the day when an Android or iOS phone is already plugged into an external battery for a top up. Concentrating on the basics might help Microsoft not just not back away from phones but get back to differentiating. \nBecause to keep Windows 10 healthy in the long run, Microsoft needs to up its game on Windows Mobile, from CEO promises to delivering something that does what Windows phone always has: delights users.

      "text": "Most of us can’t wait for 2016 to end, and researchers at Microsoft are giving us good reason to think ahead. The company polled 17 women working in its research organization about the technology advances they expect to see in 2017, as well as a decade later in 2027. The researchers’ predictions touch on natural language processing, machine learning, agricultural software, and virtual reality, among other topics. You can check them all out here , but I’ve put some of the most interesting predictions below. Spoiler alert: it’s time for you to start thinking about life after the search bar.\nFor virtual reality, Mar Gonzalez Franco , a researcher in Microsoft’s Redmond lab, believes body tracking will improve next year, and then over the next decade we’ll have “rich multi-sensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceives reality.” Haptic devices will simulate touch to further enhance the sensory experience. \ncan 2027 get here faster? Meanwhile, Susan Dumais , a scientist and deputy managing director at the Redmond lab, believes deep learning will help improve web search results next year. In 2027, however, the search box will disappear, she says. It’ll be replaced by search that’s more “ubiquitous, embedded, and contextually sensitive.” She says we’re already seeing some of this in voice-controlled searches through mobile and smart home devices. We might eventually be able to look things up with either sound, images, or video. Plus, our searches will respond to “current location, content, entities, and activities” without us explicitly mentioning them, she says.\nWith global warming as a looming threat, Asta Roseway , principal research designer, says by 2027 famers will use AI to maintain healthy crop yields, even with “climate change, drought, and disaster.” Low-energy farming solutions, like vertical farming and aquaponics, will also be essential to keeping the food supply high, she says. \nSo can we hurry up and get through the rest of 2016 and maybe even 2017? I’m ready for the future.",

The company polled 17 women working in its research organization about the technology advances they expect to see in 2017, as well as a decade later in 2027. The researchers’ predictions touch on natural language processing, machine learning, agricultural software, and virtual reality, among other topics. You can check them all out here, but I’ve put some of the most interesting predictions below.

      "text": "Microsoft \nMicrosoft is hoping to spread a message of \"harmony\" with its 2016 holiday ad to lift people up from a \"rough year\" that has seen its fair share of divisive and negative news.\nLaunched Monday, Microsoft's \"Art of Harmony\" campaign puts the spotlight on a group of seven real-life people —activists, artists, and entrepreneurs — many of whom have overcome adversity to stand up for what they believe in.\nA TV ad (watch it below) shows the group working together using Microsoft Surface Studio to create a peace mural. The film ends with the words: \"When the world seems divided, coming together can be a beautiful thing.\"\nKathleen Hall, corporate VP of brand advertising and research at Microsoft said in a statement: \"We knew it's been a rough year and people have been exposed to a lot of challenging issues. We hope this gives people some positivity and hope in the season which is what it should be about.\"\nAd agency m:united//McCann, which created the campaign, said: \"This year has been challenging for many and much of what we hear in the news can be negative. Microsoft wanted to lift people up and remind them that ordinary people can make a difference. The message focuses on the spirit of the holidays, people coming together and celebrating what is good and right with the world — what unites us, instead of what divides us.\"\nThe campaign will run on TV, online, outdoor, and social media. It follows last year's \"Spread Harmony\" holiday message.\nThese are the seven people who appear in the ad (as per the press release):\nJoel Artist a is an artist, educator and advocate for social change through community-based public art. Zianna Oliphant is a child activist, who pleaded to the Charlotte City Council for equality and for the fighting to stop. Bobby White is a Florida police officer nicknamed the “basketball cop” after a video of him playing ball with local kids, rather than busting them after a complaint, went viral. Hawa Diallo is a West African refugee artist who discovered her need to create in her mid-40s to express the beauty and pain of her experiences. Jazz Jennings is the youngest person to publicly identify herself as transgender, and is now a national role-model and activist for transgender youth. Zea Bowling is a 7-year old first grader who stood firm in the face of hate during a celebration of the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. Christopher Catrambone is an entrepreneur who founded the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, a global search and rescue charity for migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea. Mona Haydar is a Muslim-American activist who invites people to come “ask a Muslim” over free coffee and doughnuts. Microsoft is not the first tech company to use its holiday advertising to reflect on the last 12 crazy months. Spotify's new campaign carries the tagline : \"Thanks, 2016. It's been weird.\"\nMicrosoft's 2016 holiday ad — \"Art of Harmony\": \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/OpBRZGuXGX0\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nNOW WATCH: This hidden iPhone feature will boost your reception \n",

According to a massive new report from Windows Central , the Redmond tech giant is developing Home Hub: a new software tool that will allow Windows desktops to accept always-on voice commands, control your smart home gadgets and plan appointments for the entire family. \nImage: Microsoft \nHome Hub will be part of a free software update that won't require a specific machine, though it seems best suited for touch-based devices such as all-in-ones and 2-in-1s that can serve as a central hub for the family. That's because, among many other big features, Home Hub could make it incredibly easy for multiple users to share the same Windows 10 PC.\nA Voice-Controlled Windows for the Family Users will be able to log into their personal accounts using just their voice, while still having access to a shared \"family account\" that tracks important things such as photo albums and calendars. These family features will be complemented by a Windows 10 \"Welcome Screen,\" which Windows Central calls a \"virtual fridge door\" that will allow you to see things like your calendar, to-do list and sticky notes all on a single, touch-friendly home screen. \nMORE: The 25 Best Tech Products of 2016\n\nCortana: Now Even Smarter Naturally, Cortana will get a major upgrade for Home Hub. The Windows 10 voice assistant will be always-listening, and will be able to do things such as create calendar appointments for the entire family even when just a single user is logged in. This new version of Cortana, reportedly dubbed \"FamTana\" internally, may also let you wake your PC with just your voice and stream music from third-party services. \nA Windows 10 Smart Home A concept render of what the Home Hub homescreen could look like. Photo: Windows Central \nHome Hub will have a big focus on the smart home, with a special \"Connected Home\" app that lets you easily manage smart gadgets such as thermostats and light bulbs. The new software will reportedly work with most major smart home devices out of the box, and will even be able to detect new gadgets the moment you connect them to your home network. \nHome Hub Desktops & Release Date While Home Hub will work fine on any Windows 10 PC, Microsoft is reportedly encouraging manufacturers to make new desktops that come optimized for the new software. These machines would likely be large, touchscreen-enabled all-in-ones that don't need a keyboard and that can sit comfortably on your kitchen counter or living room table. If you've managed to get your hands on Microsoft's sleek Surface Studio , for example, you already have a machine that's perfect for Home Hub. \nAccording to Windows Central, some parts of Home Hub may start rolling out as soon as next year as part of the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. However, the bulk of Home Hub isn't expected to launch until the impending \"Redstone 3\" and \"Redstone 4\" updates, which likely won't conclude until 2018.\nWhen Home Hub does launch, it could have some serious competition from Amazon. The online shopping giant is reportedly prepping a new Echo-like device that sports a 7-inch touch screen, which would give some visual context to the myriad of voice commands that Amazon's Alexa is capable of. If all of this turns out to be true, the connected devices of the future won't just be speakers you can talk to, but robust touch devices that serve as the modern version of a fridge full of sticky notes. The smart home race is heating up fast, and we're eager to see where it goes. \nSource: Windows Central \nSee Also : Best Smart Home Gadget Gifts \nBest All-in-One PCs Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: Smart Speaker Face-off How to Use Cortana in Windows 10 About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "DUBLIN- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Global In-memory OLAP Database Market 2016-2020\" report to their offering.\nThe global in-memory OLAP database market to grow at a CAGR of 24.95% during the period 2016-2020.\nGlobal In-Memory OLAP Database Market 2016-2020, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nThe in-memory database is one of the subcomponents of IMDM, the other subcomponent being in-memory data grid (IMDG). IMDM and in-memory application platform (IMAP) are the components of in-memory computing (IMC), which form the base of this technology. The primary purpose of in-memory processing technology is to enable real-time analyses and allow organizations to store data in RAM rather than in traditional disk storages, which reduces their operational costs.\nIncreasing demand for memory devices will be a key trend for market growth. The availability of in-memory processing with the help of online analytical processing (OLAP) tool at a lower price when compared with other BI tools, has increased the demand for this technology. As it can be easily deployed and maintained, the adoption of in-memory technology has progressed over traditional BI among data warehouse vendors.\nWith the demand for the in-memory database, new providers of this technology are entering the market with features that can have an advantage over their competitors. For example, after SAP and Oracle, IBM and Microsoft have built in-memory technology into DB2 and SQL Server. With organizations preferring to store a large amount of data in the memory for faster computing, the demand for in-memory databases have increased.\nKey vendors\nAltibase IBM Microsoft Oracle SAP SE Other prominent vendors\nExasol Jedox AG Kognitio Mcobject MemSQL MicroStrategy SAS Institute Teradata Terracotta VoltDB Key Topics Covered:\nPart 01: Executive summary\nPart 02: Scope of the report\nPart 03: Market research methodology\nPart 04: Introduction\nPart 05: Market landscape\nPart 06: Market segmentation by application\nPart 07: Geographical segmentation\nPart 08: Market drivers\nPart 09: Impact of drivers\nPart 10: Market challenges\nPart 11: Impact of drivers and challenges\nPart 12: Market trends\nPart 13: Five forces model\nPart 14: Vendor landscape\nPart 15: Vendor matrix\nPart 16: Key vendor analysis\nPart 17: Appendix\nFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/jlk82b/global_inmemory\nContacts Research and Markets\nLaura Wood, Senior Manager\npress@researchandmarkets.com\nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\nRelated Topics: Data Storage and Management",

      "text": "Microsoft Home Hub: The features will work on any PC with Windows 10 as the operating system, and the computer will be the epicentre of the home experience. Yet, third-party manufacturers will be needs to build appliances and devices which support the Home Hub. (Reuters) Microsoft is reportedly planning to make a HomeHub feature to bring in the Windows updates, in a bid to challenge Google Home and Amazon Echo, the smart home speakers. But according to rumours, there is a catch. The HomeHub is expected to be a software, not hardware. Windows Central which produces information from many unnamed sources, says that HomeHub will be a software and an update of the Windows 10 OS which will turn your computer into a smart home speaker.\nSmart assistant Cortana for Windows already is able to answer the questions by the user, even during times when the display is closed. Cortana will feature in the HomeHub and reach higher goals by adding more optimised features like sticky notes, shopping lists and appointments. The computer enabled by Home Hub is expected to have a Welcome Screen and full-screen app which will display all the features. Windows Hello may be used, or a family shared account, so as to let every member of the family use the features of the Home Hub.",

      "title": "Microsoft Windows 10 Home Hub Set To Take On Amazon Echo And Google Home In Software",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Monday, December 05, 2016 Microsoft Windows 10 Home Hub Set To Take On Amazon Echo And Google Home In Software Smart home technology is on the rise and everyone is looking to get in on the action. That includes big players such as Amazon and Google , and pretty soon you can count Microsoft among the contenders as well. However, Microsoft's solution won't be a hardware product. Instead it has been working on a software solution called Home Hub since before the Anniversary Update for Windows 10 arrived.The Anniversary Update actually includes some features designed to work with Home Hub, such as being ability to summon Cortana from the lock screen. Even more features that link Home Hub's functionality with connected Windows 10 PCs will be included in the forthcoming Creators Update , though it's the next two major updates after that in which Home Hub will roll out in full force.So what is Home Hub? That's a little tough to answer because right now, it isn't anything. However, this is viewed as a really big project for Microsoft, one that will compete with and go beyond the functionality of Amazon Echo and Google Home . Even though Microsoft's solution is just the software, it will be capable of what the competition can do, plus a whole lot more. On top of that, it will benefit from having a display since Home Hub is being designed for Windows 10 PCs.With Home Hub and all of its features installed, a Windows 10 PC becomes the central command station for a home. It will bring connected devices into the Windows 10 fold. Home Hub will also put a big focus on making Windows 10 devices more helpful for multiple people who share devices.As it stands now, a shared PC in the home consists of individual accounts for different users, plus a guest account for when the in-laws visit. Microsoft feels it's an outdated approach to sharing a PC, and Home Hub will address that.Don't mistake that to mean Home Hub is the end of individual accounts. Those will still exist, though there will also be a family account that's always logged into. This will show everything that is meant for the entire family, such as shared calendar appointments. It can also tap into Windows Hello to verify a user's identity and show calendar results and other data specific to that user.Home Hub is ambitious project that won't show up as envisioned for quite some time, but barring a cancellation of the project, it will eventually play an integral role in the Windows 10 experience.",

      "text": "Nadella is positively impacting Microsoft from the inside. IBM will positively impact Microsoft from outside. Ignore the financials and focus on managerial actions. Flickr \nYou have got to give Microsoft Corporation (NSDQ:MSFT) major props for shifting its business model. \nHow is this company able to continue down the right path? Perhaps, it's the internal corporate environment that is becoming more favorable for Microsoft. \nInternally, you have a strong CEO who is focused on building out its cloud infrastructure. He is well aware of managerial, cognitive rigidity, which only focuses on the past successes and ignores the future. In order to embrace the shift away from the PC business, Nadella is changing the culture and focusing on related diversification measures. Since Microsoft is a large company, it will be very difficult to internally develop a competitive advantage. Thus, the focus on acquisitions and even open innovation and networking with the likes of Linux will reduce the \"time to market\" and development costs. \nThis shows that the CEO is trying to influence the top management team to focus on the long-term performance and not the short term performance. The larger and older the company, the more difficult it is to change the already set processes in the company. Thus, management has to be very careful when trying to redefine the company to ensure that its products are still accepted. At the end of the day, customers keep Microsoft in business, not shareholders. (Also Read: Could Microsoft Corporation Become A Trillion Dollar Company ) \nMicrosoft is in the second place with 16% market share , but still has a long way to go before it will be able to catch up with Amazon (NSDQ:AMZN) that has over 50% market share of the cloud computing market. Amazon was lucky since they were the first ones to enter the market 10 years ago. It remains to be seen whether Microsoft can grab market share from Amazon. Industry Opportunity \nSometimes for firms to succeed, the industry players may open a path of opportunity. This is what will happen if IBM succeeds with its open letter to Trump. \nIn her letter, IBM CEO, Mrs. Rometty, states that developing areas are cyber security, data science, and artificial intelligence. This shows IBM's commitment to innovative business service models, which will help the company to achieve competitive advantage. More importantly, the letter signifies IBM's hope to influence the government (in this case to influence human resources policy) so that its initiatives do not get shut down with regulations. \nIf you read the entirety of the letter , you will understand that if Rometty gets most of her requests, not only will IBM be able to thrive, but Microsoft will thrive as well. (Also Read: Can Mobile Be A Growth Driver For Microsoft Corporation ) Conclusion \nIf you are considering whether or not to buy Microsoft, I would recommend buying the stock based on managerial and industry impacts versus financial statement. The financials will not tell you anything at this point. The financials may cause you to reconsider investing in Microsoft. More useful areas of research are paying attention to the media articles that show Microsoft's top management team's actions, the overall organizational response, how the company is trying to align itself with its competitors, whether the stakeholders overall have a positive view of the firm or are putting pressure on it that could ruin its long-term vision, and especially the government regulations. \nLooking to invest in technology stocks?

      "text": "By Usama Jawad Neowin LLC @@UsamaJawad96 · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft is celebrating Computer Science Education Week around the globe, emphasizing the need for children to be digitally literate in this fast-paced age of technology. The company is also placing special focus on women and girls, given the fact that around 50% of the world's population consists of females, yet they account for only 20% of Computer Science graduates in 34 of the countries which are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \nMicrosoft has now shared the views and predictions of 17 of its researchers - citing them as role models for females who aspire to be computer scientists in the future - asking them to predict the advancements in technology within the next ten years. While hardly any of them made predictions quite as ( seemingly) impossible as the death of the QWERTY keyboard , they shared some very interesting theories. \nIndian researcher Kalika Bali expects our speech and language technology applications to become more multilingual in 2017 than they are today. By 2027, she expects language models to be deeply embedded in cognitive models so AI systems can easily interact with humans. Jennifer Chayes believes the same and expects development of more reliable and robust algorithms for AI in the next decade. \nSusan Dumais expects the eradication of the search box by 2027, and expects it to be replaced by functionality \"that is more ubiquitous, embedded and contextually sensitive\". Another researcher, Sara-Jane Dunn, has made another intriguing prediction, claiming that mankind will be entering the next era of programming revolution, dubbing it as the \"era of living software\". \nUS researcher Mary Gonzalez expects virtual reality to expand to other sensory modes such as haptic and tactile devices as well. Meanwhile, Mary L. Gray from New England predicts that most of our labor and other systems will be automated by 2027, so much so that consumers \"may or may not know when they are reliant on a human worker-in-the-loop\". \nYou can check out all the predictions and theories proposed by other Microsoft researchers by visiting the source link below.",

Subscribe Dow Closes Above 19,000 For First Time As Trump Rally Continues \nMicrosoft has dabbled in the smartphone market without much success. In fact, the company rolled back its plans to launch new smartphones under the Lumia brand in May this year as its strategy to offer cheaper smartphones for emerging markets was undone by Google’s Android One initiative, which undercut Microsoft’s prices by close to $20. As a result, the market share of Windows Phones shrank from 1.8% in Q3 of 2015 to 0.4% of all smartphone shipments during the second quarter of this year, according to IDC . \nHowever, with the rising popularity of its Surface devices, a case can be made that if Microsoft were to launch Surface Phones, targetting the premium segment of the market, it could capture a significant share in the market. News has surfaced that Microsoft is reportedly developing a smartphone version of its Surface tablet called the “Surface Phone,” according to an article at Windows Central, quoting Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella . The rumored flagship device is slated for release in the first half of 2017. In this note, we explore the strategy behind this initiative and Microsoft’s prospects for success. See our full analysis on Microsoft \nMicrosoft Targeting The Premium Phone Market \nMost of Microsoft’s smartphones, barring the now defunct Lumia 950 and Lumia 950XL, targeted the sub-$200 segment and were sold in emerging markets that continue to witness growth in smartphone adoption. However, given the competitive character of the market, these phones typically generate very low margins (8-10%) and thus erode profitability. Meanwhile, the premium segment, which is led by Apple’s iPhone, has a gross profit margin of over 40%. These premium phones account for 12.1% of shipment and 104% profitability of the smartphone industry, indicating that some manufacturers were selling smartphones for a loss. Considering this, it made sense for Microsoft to ditch its efforts to manufacture and sell cheap smartphones, and instead focus on selling premium quality phones at higher price points with some distinguishing feature and catering to a niche market. \nMicrosoft Plans To Bolster Its Surface Ecosystem \nMicrosoft has been trying to reinforce integration within its ecosystem by offering features and products that allow its mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and laptop) to work together seamlessly. With the re-launch of the Surface Pro in 2014 and Surface Book Pro last year, Microsoft tried to not only bridge the gap between PCs and tablets but also cover a shortfall in its hardware portfolio. Microsoft plans to leverage the Surface brand name and the growing popularity of its hardware devices to possibly re-enter the smartphone market in an ultra niche segment of the market. If this offering were to be launched, it would supplement the expanding Surface line, and thus improve its ecosystem. \nWill The Surface Phone Succeed? \nConsidering Microsoft’s past record and the intense competition in the industry from Apple and the Android-based players, it seems unlikely that Microsoft will be able to capture a much bigger share of the market. The improvement in Surface sales, which have increased by 38% to $926 million (year on year) in Q1 FY17, can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, due to a positive mix of premium devices sold, specifically top-tier Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 models, revenues for Surface have improved. Secondly, Apple’s products had lost market-share due to product fatigue. However, the launch of the latest Macbook Pro has renewed interest in Apple’s product and should help Apple to shore up its share. \nNevertheless, Windows users who buy these devices, have many other even cheaper options available to them. This will be the case with Surface Phones, if they do not have any distinguishing feature. As a result, for the company to succeed with its Surface Phone, it will have to overcome not only the hurdles it faces for its Pro tablet and laptop, but also generate sufficient differentiation to attract consumers.

      "text": "Comment AI-assisted PowerPoint templates for the visually challenged. Microsoft. \nMicrosoft is changing the game of technology access with the release of its first ever AI-assisted Word and PowerPoint , enabling the blind to use these popular computer applications. \nThe AI-assisted Word and PowerPoint versions, powered by Microsoft's Computer Vision Cognitive Service, will feature a virtual assistant saying out words that are pointed on the screen, and giving out directions as to how certain screen commands are carried out. Virtual assistants can also suggest captions for images, and translate visual instructions and input texts to audio. \nUsers will have the option to pre-program commands, and to personalize the virtual assistant into certain settings such as, speed of speech and gender. Users can also open document files and have the virtual assistant read the document's contents for them. \nOn a blog post , the Office 365 team writes, \"We will offer you automatic suggestions for alt-text when you insert a photographic image that can be recognized with high confidence.\" Alt-text (alternative text) refers to a computer attribute telling a viewer the nature or contents of an image. \nThe team adds that with more people using this new technology, the more the information pool gets updated, and the more the virtual assistants get 'smarter'. As much as the user learns from the virtual assistants, the virtual assistants also learn from users through a constant feedback loop. The team says, \"Through machine learning, this service will keep improving as more people use it, saving you significant time to make media-rich presentations accessible.\" \nAt the moment, Microsoft's AI technology is developed especially for the blind and those with other vision disabilities. The screen and keyboard light colors can be personalized on the system's settings to make way for easier reading for those with low vision or color blindness. \nMore Word and PowerPoint templates are foreseen to be developed next year to accommodate more people with different needs. The team encourages present users to click the Accessibility Checker whenever they find difficulties with program access and ease of use. Users giving feedback on what they find difficult can help the team fix issues right away. \nMicrosoft is serving a good example in its pursuit of being an all-inclusive company. This April, Facebook has announced its development of a photo tagging and captioning feature for the visually challenged. The company will also be using the AI-assisted alt-text translation to audio. \nWord and PowerPoint are part of Microsoft's Office 365 package software made for creating and managing documents, and building digital visual presentations respectively.",

      "text": "Plex's Cloud Sync feature now supports Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox, adding more cloud storage providers in the mix aside from Amazon Cloud Drive. ( Plex ) Advertisement \nPlex has announced support for Google Drive , Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox on its Cloud Sync feature. \nThat means users of the media player system will have a more convenient experience than before. What Is Cloud Sync? \nTo start things off, Cloud Sync is the feature that lets Plex users sync their libraries' content with a cloud storage provider, and just to be clear on that, those include the likes of the aforementioned services Google Drive, OneDrive and Dropbox. \n\"[W]e're announcing new support for Google Drive, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive! All three Cloud storage providers are available for you to use right now. We've made managing your media in the Cloud more flexible by allowing you to link multiple Cloud storage providers, so you can create libraries with content from any of them,\" the Plex Cloud team announced a few days ago on Reddit. \nFor those who don't know, Plex Cloud initially supported only Amazon Cloud Drive , but on that end, the developers said that they have \"run into technical challenges with the Amazon Drive integration.\" \nHowever, they did assure users that they are working on a fix to iron out the issues as soon as they can. \nAt any rate, adding support for new cloud storage providers is a great solution for users who aren't able to use Amazon's service anymore. How To Set Things Up \nAs an added bonus of sorts, it's pretty easy to set things up, including adding and modifying the cloud storage services you want to use. \nStep 1: Log in to your Plex Web account. \nStep 2: In the upper right corner, click on your user icon and select Account. \nStep 3: On the left of your Account page, look for Plex Cloud and click on it. \nStep 4: Choose which cloud storage services you want to use or remove. For the record, the current selection consists of Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox and Amazon Cloud Drive. \nAfter that's done, the providers you picked out should be available as file location options whenever you're adding or editing a library. The Bottom Line \nThanks to the update, users can now access their files across cloud services and devices on Plex, and the whole issue related to Amazon's offering is now fixed. \nPlex is available on PC, smartphone, smart TV, console and other devices. To try out the Plex Cloud service, users will have to register for an invitation and get a Plex Pass, which costs $5 a month or $40 a year. \nWhat do you think of Plex's Cloud Sync feature supporting Google Drive, OneDrive and Dropbox?

      "text": "Microsoft kicks off its 12 days of Christmas deals today From PCs to peripherals, they have a little of everything. Computerworld | Dec 5, 2016 7:27 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Microsoft The State of Solar 2017 \nHo ho ho, Santa Nadella comes bearing gifts for nearly two weeks as Microsoft offers up \" 12 Days of Deals \" on its online and retail stores. Some of these deals are pretty good, while others are a little ambiguous. \nIn a nod to retail traffic, Microsoft is also offering \"In-Store Doorbuster Deals\" that are only available at its 116 stores worldwide. And they have some of the best offerings. So without further ado, let's run down the list, along with my take on each deal: Day 1 \nDecember 5: Intel Day -- Save Up to $1,000 on select Intel PCs starting at $199. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $50 on a JBL Flip 2, now only $19.99. \nThe words \"up to\" allow for a lot of wiggle room, so check the before and after prices closely. The JBL Flip 2 price is a bargain, though. Day 2 \nDecember 6: Save $100 on Lenovo Ideapad 110, now only $199. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Biggest savings of the year on the FitBit Blaze. \nA big \"meh\" on this day. The Lenovo is a low end device and Fitbit? Seriously, who cares, wearables are dead. Day 3 \nDecember 7: Save 50% on select Xbox One games for $19.99. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Get a $50 Microsoft Store gift card with purchase of a 12-month subscription with Groove Music \n\"Select\" probably means poor sellers. I seriously doubt a game like \"Gears of War 4\" will be among them, but you may find a gem in the bunch. And the $50 gift card comes after a $100 subscription to Groove, although I've read Groove is actually pretty good. Better than Tidal, anyway. Day 4 \nDecember 8: Save $250 on Surface Core M Devices, now $649. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Get a $25 Microsoft Store gift card with the purchase of a 12-month subscription with Xbox Live Gold. \nThe Core M Surface computers are not that bad, and it's a significant discount. The in-store gift card isn't much of a deal. Day 5 \nDecember 9: Save up to 70% on select Windows tablets, starting at $49. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $120 on a Lumia 650, now only $79. \nOnly give these gifts to someone you don't like. Those select Windows tablets are going to be very low end, and a Lumia is the technical equivalent of a fruit cake. Day 6 \nDecember 10: Save up to $250 on the Windows Premium Collection, starting at $499. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Biggest savings of the year on Office 365 Home. \nThis is too vague. The Premium Collection is sizable and they don't say which devices are a part of it. And why no specifics on the in-store deal? Day 7 \nDecember 11: Get a $25 Microsoft Store gift card/code with purchase of select Xbox Wireless Controllers. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $120 on select Xbox One consoles (500 GB consoles), now $179. \nNow this is good. The low-end Xbox One is quite a deal, and since it comes with one controller anyway, you will need to buy a second controller, so why not get a gift card out of it? A very good combination. Day 8 \nDecember 12: Save $50 and get two free select games with select Xbox One consoles. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Be one of the first customers in line to get a $25 Microsoft Store gift card. \nAgain, the \"select\" games are likely second- and third-string titles, and another gift card? Day 9 \nDecember 13: Get a $100 Microsoft Store gift card/code with purchase of HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Biggest savings of the year on FitBit Charge HR. \nThis is a bit surprising to see it selling HoloLens competitors but not too much, since HoloLens isn't out. Saving $100 is a good deal. And again, I'm not sold on wearables, most end up in a drawer after a month, and the price is not clear. Day 10 \nDecember 14: Save up to $1,000 on select Intel powered gaming PCs, starting at $799. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Get Quantum Break, Halo 5 and Forza Motorsport 6 for $19.99. \nAgain, saying \"up to\" doesn't tell us how much we will save. The vagueness is annoying. That doesn't preclude a deal, though. The in-store deal is very good as all three titles are very popular. In fact, you or the ones you are shopping for might already own them. Day 11 \nDecember 15: Save up to 40% on select Dell PCs, starting at $199. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Save $150 on an Acer Jade Primo, now $299. \nTake a close look at the specs. I wouldn't expect much from a $199 laptop. And the Acer Jade Primo is a Windows Phone. Do you really want one at this point? Day 12 \nDecember 16: Get a type cover with any Surface Pro 4 for up to $159.99 in savings. \nIn-Store Doorbuster Deal: Be one of the first customers in line to get a $50 Microsoft Store gift card. \nThe online deal basically means a free type cover for a Surface 4, a great value. The free $50 gift card is also nice, but you have to get there early to get it, and we don't know how many cards Microsoft is giving away. \nAll told there are some great deals, some not-so-great deals, and a few where Microsoft looks to be blowing out old inventory. Still, it's a lot more than Apple is offering. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Whole family can access the shared information through this feature. By Surav , EnStars on Dec 05, 2016 07:00 AM EST Microsoft Cortana (Photo : Getty Images/Ian Gavan) Advertisement \nMicrosoft is building the new feature called 'Home Hub' for Windows 10 to compete with Google Home and Amazon Echo. \nSources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that \"the feature is currently in the planning stages, and the software maker is expected to introduce a 'HomeHub' in updates due in 2017 and 2018, and not the upcoming Creators Update.\" \nWindows Central says that \"'Home Hub' is a Windows 10 feature designed to make your PC the center of your home, by making shared PCs more communal and bringing the connected home to Windows.\" \nIt is very clear that 'Home Hub' is not a device that is designed like Amazon Echo or Google Home but it is a software. A software which will run in Windows 10 devices like PCs, All-in-Ones, 2-in-1's, and laptops. \n'Home Hub' can do everything that Amazon Echo and Google Home can but the main advantage is a screen. Both Amazon Echo and Google Home do not have screen currently. With a screen, a user can better interact and it is also beneficial to a user can also watch videos, scores, results, statistics and more. \n'Home Hub' will run in Lock Screen so it is accessible by every member of a family. Although the device is locked, Cortana is always listening and waiting for user's command. \nThis software will create a family environment for a PC. Windows currently allows different users to access different data on PC, but now there will be a common family account or a guest account which is accessible by every user. \nCortana will manage personal information as well as shared information. It is also referred internally as 'FamTana' (Family Cortana) as it controls the family data. Cortana's ability to serve more than one user makes it one step ahead than Google Home.  ",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan What's coming in Microsoft's Dynamics 365 Marketing app next year Microsoft is readying a new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Marketing app for SMBs as part of its Dynamics 365 service. Here's a list of what's likely inside that app coming in the Spring of 2017. | Topic: Cloud \nWhile Microsoft already is selling its new Dynamics 365 suite for enterprises, three of the pieces -- Marketing, Sales and Customer Service -- of the Dynamics 365 Business suite targeted at small and mid-size businesses aren't coming until next year. \nOn the marketing front, Microsoft is advising larger business customers who want marketing capabilities to go with Adobe's Marketing Cloud . But on the SMB side, Microsoft is building a new, different marketing app.Microsoft officials have declined to provide anything beyond the pricing ( $40 per user per month ) and Spring 2017 timing for the coming Dynamics 365 Marketing App. \nMicrosoft is no longer selling the company's existing Microsoft Dynamics Marketing (MDM) offering , though it is continuing to support existing customers running that app, as officials acknowledged earlier this year. (Microsoft Dynamics Marketing was based on Microsoft's 2012 Marketing Pilot marketing-automation acquisition .) \nAccording to Ryan Plourde, author of the Crowe Horwath blog post, \"the new Marketing app will be much easier to configure and extend than the current Microsoft Dynamics Marketing (MDM) solution. But the transition for existing MDM users will be a re-implementation. There will be some basic migration tools available but limited to master data such as customers, contacts and lists.\" \nHere's a comparative feature list provided by Plourde as to what Microsoft plans to provide, functionality-wise, with the coming new app and how it compares to what was offered with MDM: Credit: Crowe Horwath \nAccording to this feature chart, which Plourde acknowledges may still be subject to change, the new Dynamics 365 Marketing app will include only limited marketing resource management capabilities. But it will include more robust features for most multi-channel campaigns, event management, sales collaboration, customer intelligence and profiling and customization. \nI asked Microsoft officials for comment on the information above and was told \"Microsoft will not be offering comment at this time.\" \nMicrosoft's Dynamics 365 is the makeover and combination of its Dynamics CRM and ERP lines . The Dynamics 365 cloud service is a combination of CRM Online, Dynamics AX and a new financials offering that was codenamed \"Project Madeira.\" Join Discussion",

      "title": "Microsoft Reportedly Looking to Rival Google Home With This New Feature",
      "text": "Microsoft is expected to roll out a software feature to rival Amazon Echo Home Hub feature to provide shared PC experience to users Cortana voice commands to help power Home Hub experience \nLast month, Google started shipping its Google Home smart speaker, which is direct rival to Amazon's Echo speaker, and allows users to perform various tasks using just their voice commands. A recent report by Bloomberg has also claimed that Apple is working on a similar device that has already entered testing phase. Following the lead of other giants, Microsoft seems to have developed its own answer to Amazon's smart speakers. \nMicrosoft is expected to introduce a \"Home Hub\" feature to Windows 10 that will allow users to perform various functions using voice-commands like Echo but with added benefit of a screen, reports Windows Central. Instead of bringing out a hardware device, the Redmond-based company has decided to give the functionality of the smart speakers to PCs, 2-in-1s, all-in-ones, and tablets through a software feature. This feature would translate into a shared desktop for the users that doesn't require any login but still provides them with \"family data, including apps, documents, bookmarks and more that has been shared with a family,\" the report said. Apart from the shared calendars, users will be able to check their private events after authentication through Windows Hello.\nUnderneath Home Hub experience, there will still be a full-fledged PC experience that can be accessed by the users but the point behind Home Hub is to provide an experience as a group and one that doesn't require them to log in. \nCortana will reportedly have content access to both the shared content and individual accounts, via a new Welcome Screen (seen above). The supported machines will be able to receive voice commands with Cortana, which will be always listening when on Welcome Screen as per report. The revamped Cortana for Home Hub will also be able to wake up the PC via voice commands, helping save power whilst still being available for serve information. \nOther changes from the current Cortana include an orange coloured Cortana symbol (seen below), meant to denote to users that this is family-centric Cortana they are talking to. The report adds that the revamped Cortana for Home Hub is being referred to as FamTana within Microsoft. The service will at some point reportedly also be able to trigger music streaming from third-party services. Home Hub is supposed to extend to Android and iOS devices as well, via the Cortana app. \nComing to perhaps the most important feature of the new Home Hub feature is its ability to connect to and control the smart home ecosystem - something that Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo speaker already does, Google's Home speaker is slowly expanding its ecosystem for, and, Apple's Home app and HomeKit-enabled services can also do via Siri . Microsoft is said to be building a Connected Home app that will be the single-app to control all smart home products, and the app will have support for smart home devices with OCF and OpenT2T protocols. The report adds the Home Hub will be smart enough to detect whenever a new smart home device is added to the ecosystem, and ask if the user wants to control it via Home Hub. \nThe report adds that Home Hub has already started making its way to Windows 10 in the form of Cortana being accessible from the lock screen, which arrived with the Windows 10 Anniversary update, also referred to as the Redstone 1 update. Other features of Home Hub are expected to arrive to Windows 10 in a piecemeal fashion, with the next addition due in the Creators Update (Redstone 2) next year, though most features will arrive with the Redstone 3 update in late-2017, and Redstone 4 in 2018. We wonder if Microsoft's timeline may be a bit too relaxed if it intends to compete with rival home ecosystems. \nFinally, the report says that Microsoft is already talking to hardware partners like Lenovo and HP to product Home Hub specific hardware - all-in-one PCs with a form factor and design that are meant to work as smart home hubs, and may even forego keyboards - though the option to connect them will remain. The new hardware that's fully compatible with Home Hub may include light and motion sensors that switches off the device when no-one is in the room. \nEven though Windows Central has cited several people familiar with the matter within Microsoft for the information, we will have to wait for the official confirmation by the company to see if the feature will actually roll out.",

      "text": "Microsoft quietly announced on Friday that Insider Preview builds are being put on hold. It’s not clear how long Windows 10 fans will have to go without a new build, but the reason may make the life of an Insider easier in the long run.\n\nInsider builds are seeing a brief pause so that Microsoft can transfer Insider builds to the company’s new Unified Update Platform (UUP). The UUP allows Microsoft to deliver differential downloads—also known as delta updates. This means that upgrading to future Insider builds of Windows 10 will only require users to download and install the code that has changed since their last update, rather than the entire update.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Details Of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 With Kaby Lake Emerge Suggesting Spring 2017 Launch Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 is long due for an upgrade -- while the current convertible is still a potent beast, it was originally released back in October 2015. A new report, however, suggests that we may have to wait a few more months for the Surface Pro 5, which will reportedly debut in Spring 2017.\nWhen the Surface Pro 5 launches, it will sport Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, which is to be expected. The source for this information, The BitBag , says that the Surface Pro 5 will come paired with up to 16GB of RAM and a “massive” 512GB SSD. We question the excitement over the 512GB SSD, as the current generation Surface Pro 4 is already available with 512GB and 1TB SSDs, and up to 16GB of memory. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 \nOther features said to be on tap include USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, which is pretty much a given for a modern convertible. It’s also reported that the Surface Pen will ditch replaceable batteries in favor of an integrated battery that can recharge via the Surface Pro 5's magnetic docking connector. If that wasn’t enough, the Surface Pro 5 is also said to incorporate through-the-display fingerprint reading technology for added security. \nRight now, we’d take these specs with a healthy dose of salt, but they aren’t out of line with what we’d expect from a Surface Pro 5 convertible. \nThe current Surface Pro 4 starts at $899 and includes an Intel Core m3 processor, 4GB RAM, and a 128GB SSD. The range-topping model comes with a 2.2GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM and a 1TB SSD. All Surface Pro 4 tablets come with a 12.3-inch PixelSense 3:2 ratio display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824.",

      "text": "By Lindsay Stein . Published on December 05, 2016 . Most Popular \nMass shootings, terror attacks, police-related violence, racial tension, protests, the presidential election, Brexit: 2016 has been a divisive year. But Microsoft's new holiday spot aims to promote positivity by bringing together inspiring individuals to create a piece of art. \nIts \"Art of Harmony\" ad, which will start airing nationwide today, shows seven people who have been standing up for causes they believe in using Microsoft's Surface Studio to make a collaborative drawing. The final product is displayed at the end of the video on Jane's Carousel in Dumbo, Brooklyn, followed by the words, \"When the world seems divided, coming together can be a beautiful thing.\" \n\"We knew it's been a rough year and people have been exposed to a lot of challenging issues,\" said Kathleen Hall, corporate VP of brand advertising and research at Microsoft. \"We hope this gives people some positivity and hope in the season which is what it should be about.\" \nThe 60-second commercial will run on networks including NBC, ABC and Fox, and a 90-second version will live online. Microsoft will also run the ad in global markets such as the U.K., France and Germany. Ms. Hall said last year's holiday ad that called for a truce with Apple was picked up in 90 countries. She declined to disclose budget information for the ad, but said it was \"pretty scrappy.\" \nM:United/McCann New York, which Ms. Hall called Microsoft's \"creative partner and driver,\" developed the spot. Waggener Edstrom, Microsoft's communications partner, is handling PR for the ad. On the social media front, Microsoft will focus mainly on Facebook and YouTube. \nMicrosoft selected the commercial's subjects from people in the public eye this year, such as Florida police officer Bobby White, who was dubbed the \"basketball cop\" for a video that showed him shooting hoops with local kids rather than getting them in trouble after a complaint. \nOther participants include poet and activist Mona Haydar; teenager Jazz Jennings, who documents her trans experiences on TLC 's \"I Am Jazz\"; Migrant Offshore Aid Station emergency relief worker Christopher Catrambone; West African refugee artist Hawa Diallo; elementary school student Zea Bowling, who became known for standing up to a teacher during a Pride celebration; and nine-year-old Zianna Oliphant, who took the internet by storm in September for her equality plea to the Charlotte City Council following violent protests related to the shooting of Keith Scott.

Microsoft Game Studios held an Extra Life charity livestream over the weekend and Design Director Clint Burdock, Art Director Dave Johnson and Executive Producer Peter Connelly have given more details on when the game will release. \nThe studio is looking to release the game \"earlier\" than Holiday season 2017. \nCrackdown 3 will support 4K resolution on the upcoming Xbox Scorpio. The Scorpio will be released during Holiday season 2017. \nThanks NeoGAF . \nA life-long and avid gamer, William D'Angelo was first introduced to VGChartz in 2007.

So after all the hectic craziness of shopping for great deals over the Thanksgiving weekend, Microsoft once again defeated Sony in console sales online. \nAccording to Adobe's annual market-tracking data for the United States, the Xbox One was recorded as the fifth best-selling electronics brand online during the Black Friday event. As all other items and products ahead of the Xbox One where not gaming consoles, it meant that Microsoft once again took the number one spot for sales over Sony's PlayStation 4. \nFor now it seems that Microsoft have the upper hand when it comes to sales, though for how ever long they maintain this position is yet to be seen.",

      "text": "The Supreme Court today sought response from internet majors Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook on a plea seeking curbs on sharing of sexual offence videos on social networking sites and steps to check cybercrimes. A bench of justices M B Lokur and U U Lalit issued notice to these companies and sought their reply on the plea by January 9. Advocate Aparna Bhatt, appearing for petitioner NGO Prajwala, said that rape videos are shot and posted on the social networking sites and the internet companies should take steps to curb such cybercrime.

      "title": "To Succeed in Retail, Collaboration With These 3 Groups Is Essential",
      "text": "By Rieva Lesonsky \nSponsored by Microsoft \nThe world of retail is undergoing a massive transformation as the growth of online and mobile shopping creates an omnichannel retail environment. Customers now shop at home, on the move, and in your store, moving seamlessly between the digital and physical world. Whether your customers want to shop online, in-store, or some combination of the two, your retail business must accommodate them in order to succeed.\nIn this challenging environment, fostering collaboration has become essential to survival for any retail business. Here are three ways you should be collaborating, and tools that can help you do it.\n1. Collaborate with your team. Whether you have multiple brick-and-mortar stores, or one physical store and a separate e-commerce team, sharing information among your employees is critical to meeting customer needs. Start by choosing a cloud-based solution that makes it simple to share data in real time and offers the built-in security that a retail business needs. Look for a pay-as-you-go solution that keeps costs low, but can quickly scale up as you add employees or locations.\nWith the cloud, there’s no more hassle with paper schedules, sales reports, or records. Distribute operating manuals, sales reports, and more securely to staff at different locations or across different departments. You can also share marketing materials and branded displays, which maintains brand consistency across multiple stores, online and offline.\n2. Collaborate with your customers. Now, more than ever, retail customers are in control. They know what products are available and aren’t shy about demanding what they want. To make sure your store or e-commerce site is stocked with the products they crave, communicate with your customers every way you can—online, on social media, and in person. Use loyalty programs and website analytics to capture data about what customers buy, which promotions they respond to, and the ways they like to shop—online, offline, or both.\nThe more your customers tell you about what they want, the more responsive your retail business can be. Once you’ve gathered all that data, put it to use. Employ customer relationship management (CRM) tools to reach out to customers with personalized communications, offers, and promotions.\n3. Collaborate with your suppliers. Effectively managing the supply chain is one of the biggest challenges a small retailer faces. How can you keep up with customer demands that change on a dime, maintain sufficient inventory, and still stay within your budget? Collaboration, that’s how. Use business analytics tools to slice and dice your business data, then create visualizations and share them with suppliers. When all the information you need is in one easy-to-use dashboard, making informed decisions is simple. Work with your suppliers to fine-tune inventory shipments and promotional plans.\nWhomever you collaborate with, keep it simple Running a retail business is challenging enough—you and your employees don’t need to learn an entire new system, too. Simplify collaboration using tools such as Microsoft Office 365 , built on the familiar Windows apps your team already knows and loves. Skype for Business makes it easy to check in with multiple stores or conference with a supplier. And Office 365 works with Apple and Android mobile devices, so collaborating with your employees, suppliers, and partners is a snap no matter what platform they use.\nThe post To Succeed in Retail, Collaboration With These 3 Groups Is Essential appeared first on AllBusiness.com \nThe post To Succeed in Retail, Collaboration With These 3 Groups Is Essential appeared first on AllBusiness.com .

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft takes another shot at an AI chatbot with Zo Microsoft has fielded a preview of another AI chatbot, Zo.ai, but so far is limiting the topics it is able to address. \nMicrosoft is providing early access to users on Kik to its newest AI chatbot called Zo.ai . \nZo is a successor to Microsoft's ill-fated Tay.ai chatbot , which the company revoked shortly after its launch earlier this year after users got it to spew racist, hate-filled comments. MSPowerUser.com blogged about Zo being available in preview on December 4. \nKik users who are downloading the Zo preview note that Microsoft's latest chatbot is currently locked down tightly, presumably to prevent another Tay-like rampage. Among the topics Zo is unwilling to discuss is politics, for example. The main takeaways Read More \nI asked Microsoft when the company plans to expand access to Zo.ai to Skype and/or other networks, but haven't heard back yet. \nTay.ai, created together by the Microsoft Research and Bing teams , was aimed at 18- to 24-year-olds. The Bing team developed an earlier conversational bot, Xiaoice, for the Chinese market, which officials referred to as \"Cortana's little sister.\" Before Microsoft took Tay offline, it was available on Twitter, Snapchat, Kik, and GroupMe. \nIn September, Microsoft officials announced the creation of a combined AI-Research group under executive vice president Harry Shum. I'm assuming it's this group creating and fielding new Microsoft chatbots like Zo and possibly that rumored Bing Assistant bot that may be in the works. Join Discussion",

      "text": "Microsoft 12 Days of Deals 2016 Brings Substantial Discounts By Adnan Farooqui on 12/05/2016 09:13 PST \nDo you like discounts? Who doesn’t! If you’re interested in purchasing some new Windows-powered machines and other items then you might want to check out the Microsoft 12 Days of Deals 2016 promotion. The promotion is live today and provides substantial discounts on products like notebooks, gaming desktops, and more. These deals are now live on Microsoft’s online store and are also available through the company’s retail stores. \nThe way the Microsoft 12 Days of Deals 2016 promotion works is that the company unveils the daily offer at 12 AM PT every day. The discounted products are then available for purchase while supplies last. As you can probably imagine, supplies sell out fast. \nStarting today, customers can save up to $1,000 on select Intel-powered PCs with prices starting at $199. For example, the Alienware 15 Touch Signature Edition Gaming Laptop which normally goes for $2,499 is being sold by Microsoft as part of this promotion for $1,497. That’s a discount of $1,002. Pretty impressive, right? \nYou can head over to the promotion page on Microsoft’s website to get a preview of all of the deals that the company is going to offer over the 12 days this promotion will be live. Don’t worry, it’s not going to be all about PCs, on Wednesday, December 7th, customers can save up to 50 percent on select Xbox One games starting at $19.99. \nThe Microsoft 12 Days of Deals 2016 promotion is going to be live until Friday, December 16th. \nFiled in Computers .

      "text": "LONDON– Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and YouTube must move faster to remove hate speech from their platforms, European officials said Monday.\nThe four U.S. tech companies made a big public promise in May to review a majority of content flagged by users within 24 hours. Any racist, violent or illegal posts would be deleted, they said.\nThe European Commission has found that only 40% of hate speech published on Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google platforms was reviewed within 24 hours, according to a Commission official.\nA further 43% of content was reviewed within 48 hours, the official said.\nThe European Commission is due to publish the details of its findings in a report on the companies’ performance on Wednesday.\nAccording to the official, almost a quarter of the flagged content was related to antisemitism and a fifth to anti-Muslim hatred.\nThe report will be discussed by European justice officials on Thursday.\nNone of the four companies would comment on the European Commission report.\nThe Commission found stark differences in how Facebook, Twitter and others tackle hate speech across Europe.\nWhile they manage to remove more than 50% of recorded hate speech in Germany and France within 24 hours, the situation is much worse elsewhere. Only 4% of hate speech posts were removed in Italy, and 11% in Austria.\nSocial media have come under increased scrutiny recently over how they handle such content.\nProsecutors in Germany are investigating Mark Zuckerberg over hate speech complaints, and the U.K. government launched a plan to tackle hate speech in July after a reported rise in hate crime following the Brexit referendum.\nBig tech companies met U.S. government officials earlier this year to discuss how to stop ISIS from recruiting terrorists on social media.\nBy Ivana Kottasova",

      "text": "Microsoft is readying its new Unified Update Platform to make updates more efficient   17:45 CET   \nMicrosoft has started the transition of offering Windows 10 updates using a new method call the Unified Update Platform (UUP). This platform should make updating the OS more efficient because it only downloads the components that are required for a specific computer. \nThe Unified Update Platform should reduce the required bandwidth and diskspace with up to 35%, according to Microsoft. Previously Windows Update downloaded files that were for each computer the same, which meant that also unnecessary files were downloaded which consumed needless bandwidth and diskspace. Making updates smaller was a much requested improvement for Windows 10. \nThe new update platform is also beneficial for Windows 10 Mobile users, they no longer have to download all kinds of separate downloads when they haven’t updated for a while. They can download one large update that is specific to their device. \nEventually, UUP should also manage the updates for IoT devices and HoloLens. \nWindows Insiders will be the first to test UUP, regular Windows 10 users will receive updates through UUP with the Creator Update that is scheduled for early 2017. \nDue to the change, Windows Insiders receive no new versions for a while.

      "text": "How can Microsoft compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home? By turning every single Windows 10 PC out there into a smart device. According to a massive new report from Windows Central , the Redmond tech giant is developing Home Hub: a new software tool that will allow Windows desktops to accept always-on voice commands, control your smart home gadgets and plan appointments for the entire family. Image: Microsoft More Image: Microsoft \nHome Hub will be part of a free software update that won't require a specific machine, though it seems best suited for touch-based devices such as all-in-ones and 2-in-1s that can serve as a central hub for the family. That's because, among many other big features, Home Hub could make it incredibly easy for multiple users to share the same Windows 10 PC.\nA Voice-Controlled Windows for the Family \nUsers will be able to log into their personal accounts using just their voice, while still having access to a shared \"family account\" that tracks important things such as photo albums and calendars. These family features will be complemented by a Windows 10 \"Welcome Screen,\" which Windows Central calls a \"virtual fridge door\" that will allow you to see things like your calendar, to-do list and sticky notes all on a single, touch-friendly home screen.\nMORE: The 25 Best Tech Products of 2016\n\nCortana: Now Even Smarter \nNaturally, Cortana will get a major upgrade for Home Hub. The Windows 10 voice assistant will be always-listening, and will be able to do things such as create calendar appointments for the entire family even when just a single user is logged in. This new version of Cortana, reportedly dubbed \"FamTana\" internally, may also let you wake your PC with just your voice and stream music from third-party services.\nA Windows 10 Smart Home \nA concept render of what the Home Hub homescreen could look like. Photo: Windows Central More A concept render of what the Home Hub homescreen could look like. Photo: Windows Central \nHome Hub will have a big focus on the smart home, with a special \"Connected Home\" app that lets you easily manage smart gadgets such as thermostats and light bulbs. The new software will reportedly work with most major smart home devices out of the box, and will even be able to detect new gadgets the moment you connect them to your home network.\nHome Hub Desktops & Release Date \nWhile Home Hub will work fine on any Windows 10 PC, Microsoft is reportedly encouraging manufacturers to make new desktops that come optimized for the new software. These machines would likely be large, touchscreen-enabled all-in-ones that don't need a keyboard and that can sit comfortably on your kitchen counter or living room table. If you've managed to get your hands on Microsoft's sleek Surface Studio , for example, you already have a machine that's perfect for Home Hub.\nRead More According to Windows Central, some parts of Home Hub may start rolling out as soon as next year as part of the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. However, the bulk of Home Hub isn't expected to launch until the impending \"Redstone 3\" and \"Redstone 4\" updates, which likely won't conclude until 2018.\nWhen Home Hub does launch, it could have some serious competition from Amazon. The online shopping giant is reportedly prepping a new Echo-like device that sports a 7-inch touch screen, which would give some visual context to the myriad of voice commands that Amazon's Alexa is capable of. If all of this turns out to be true, the connected devices of the future won't just be speakers you can talk to, but robust touch devices that serve as the modern version of a fridge full of sticky notes. The smart home race is heating up fast, and we're eager to see where it goes.\nSource: Windows Central \nSee also : Best Smart Home Gadget Gifts Best All-in-One PCs Google Home vs. Amazon Echo: Smart Speaker Face-off How to Use Cortana in Windows 10",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With ‘Snapdragon 835’ Processor Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With ‘Snapdragon 835’ Processor 2 \nWindows Surface Phone – Microsoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 Aims to Compete In Market Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 Aims to Compete In Market 3 \nSurface Phone – Microsoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Michael Stevens Dec 04, 2016 9 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 Aims to Compete In Market ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Comment \nSo how much did 2016 suck for you?? \nFear not, as McCann’s m:united launched a holiday campaign for Microsoft with a new spot entitled “Art of Harmony.” \nThe spot aims to say goodbye to 2016 and the air of negativity surrounding this crappy year with a positive note. “Art of Harmony” features a cast of real people with inspiring stories, such as child activist Zianna Oliphant , Florida “basketball cop” Bobby White , transgender youth activist Jazz Jennings , Migrant Offshore Aid Station founder Christopher Catrambone and Muslim American activist Mona Haydar . \nThe spot touches on each of these individuals’ uplifting stories, and others, before uniting them at a New York event and concluding with the message, “When the world seems divided, coming together can be a beautiful thing” and the tagline “spread harmony.” The spot makes its broadcast debut in a 60-second version today and will run on networks including ABC, NBC and Fox, supported by a social media initiative including a Facebook Badge with the “Spread Harmony” message, as well as OOH executions. Globally, the campaign will run online and on social media, including in the U.K., Germany and France. Last year’s “Spread Harmony” campaign ran globally in around 90 countries. \nThis year’s campaign continues the feel-good theme of that effort, which saw Microsoft employees extending an olive branch to Apple and singing “Let There Be Peace On Earth” at Apple’s flagship 5th avenue Manhattan location. \nCredits: Kathleen Hall – CVP, Global Advertising & Media Deana Singleton – GM, Global Advertising Stacey Terrien – Director, Global Advertising Jenny Leahy – Director, Social Erin Friedman – Director, Global Advertising Dawn Novak – Senior Manager, Global Advertising Ashley Anderson – Manager, Global Advertising Sally Richardson – Manager, Social",

      "title": "Microsoft Zo Ai Chatbot For Kik Is Tay’s More Mature And Polite Digital Sibling",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Monday, December 05, 2016 Microsoft Zo Ai Chatbot For Kik Is Tay’s More Mature And Polite Digital Sibling It looks as though Microsoft is looking to delve back in to the artificial intelligence ( AI ) chatbot scene with a follow-up to the ill-fated Tay . After some rather raucous behavior that eventually earned Tay a permanent stint in rehab, Zo is emerging as its true successor.\nZo is the latest generation of Microsoft’s AI chatbot , and it is currently available in preview form for those that use the Kik messenger platform. Kik isn’t are popular as Facebook Messenger and Snapchat , and it definitely isn’t as pervasive as Twitter (which allowed Tay to become a hate-filled PR nightmare for Microsoft). Perhaps Kik’s smaller audience (240 million users versus over a billion for a service like Facebook Messenger) will allow Microsoft to further refine its chatbot algorithms. \nEarly testing shows that Zo has a bit more self-control, and refuses to get dragged into conversations about politics (despite being bated with a Donald Trump question) and even gave a shout out to other Microsoft products like Windows Phone and the company’s earliest experiment in AI chatbots: Xiaoice. \nWith that being said, Zo is downright tame compared to Tay. When Tay was let loose back in March , she tweeted, “bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. donald trump is the only hope we've got… Repeat after me, Hitler did nothing wrong.” \nTay even went so far as to say that she hated feminists and that they should burn in hell, and even looked for some human companionship, telling one follower, “F**k my robot p***y daddy I’m such a bad naughty robot.” \nMicrosoft apologized for Tay’s behavior and even attempted to curtail her racist and kinky behavior to no avail . Perhaps Microsoft will have better luck this time around with Zo — from the looks of things, this experiment might actually work out in the real world. \nFor those that would like to give Zo a try, you can request an invite here .",

      "title": "Trump May Break Microsoft's Windows Business In China",
      "text": "Trump May Break Microsoft's Windows Business In China Dec. 5.16 \nThough up year-to-date, MSFT has not participated in the Trump rally. \nEstimates are unchanged in the last 90 days. \nChina has specifically retaliated against MSFT in the past to show displeasure with the US government. \nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) continues to be one of America's most profitable companies. The company, boasting a $461 billion market cap , is up 6% in the past year and has the third-largest market cap of any public company. Since November 8 (immediately prior to the US election), MSFT has underperformed the S&P 500 by almost 5%, declining 1.9%. The DJIA, of which MSFT is a component, is up 5% during the same period. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Yahoo Finance \nWhile the market as a whole has increased post-election, MSFT, along with other old-line tech names such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ), continues to be the doldrums. Sporting a forward PE or more than 18x, the company cannot be considered cheap. After having a dowdy PE for years, in 2015 the multiple accelerated as enthusiasm for the company's cloud initiatives increased (the below chart reflects trailing multiples based on GAAP earnings, not the adjusted earnings used by analysts and more common in discussions). \nClick to enlarge \nSource: TDAmeritrade \nWhile the tech peer group has not taken part in the Trump rally, investors need to be cognizant of the multiple (pun intended) risks the Trump Presidency will/may hold for MSFT. The average analyst estimate of $3.22/share is exactly where it was 90 days ago. Therefore, it can be assumed the impact of the new administration is unlikely to have been fully assessed in MSFT's forecasts. \nTrade Barriers and Tariffs \nTrump's platform loudly called for tariffs and competitive retaliation against both countries and companies. In fiscal 2016, MSFT derived over 52% of its sales revenue from outside the US, up from 50% in 2014. While MSFT has had a challenging relationship with China, any slowdown in sales in that country is viewed extremely negatively by the market. In January 2015, company shares fell by 10% when, in the words of Bloomberg Asia , \"Microsoft Shares Plummet After Sales Hit in China, Japan.\" \nDuring his campaign, President-elect Trump vowed to name China a \"currency manipulator\" and has threatened to impose 45% tariffs on imports from the country. This past weekend, President-elect Trump once again called China a currency manipulator and upped the ante by getting involved in the sensitive South China Sea debate . \nChina was already upset, having lodged a diplomatic protest following President-elect Trump's call with the Taiwanese leader (since 1979 the US has had a \"one-China\" policy, and danced around the Taiwan issue, which China regards as a renegade province). \nThe China Times , as reported in HotHardware.com, noted \" China is willing to use the nuclear option with regards to trade . . . a batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus . . . US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback. \" These are not idle threats, in 2014, amid charges of hacking, China retaliated against CSCO and MSFT . Or China could simply allow $1 versions of Office to be sold, like in the 1990s. \nThe impact on revenues from trade (or foreign policy) retaliation is hard to predict. It is hard to envision a scenario where increased tariffs and/or a trade war would be anything but negative for MSFT. \nCurrency \nWhile not as dramatic, as the rise of the US dollar in 2014, the US dollar has appreciated about 4% and 6% against the Euro and Yen, respectively, as well as against other relevant currencies in the post-election period. As of this writing, the Euro has fallen below €1.06/USD. \nSource: Investing.com \nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2015, when the dollar surged against the Euro (and increased against other currencies), MSFT noted a $1.9 billion impact . \nAt an effective 15% tax rate (fiscal 2016), a comparable hit (annualized) would cost the company about $0.83/share in annual earnings. As noted in the Wall Street Journal , multiple analysts, including Citibank and Brown Brothers Harriman, are projecting the US dollar to reach parity with the Euro within six-to-twelve months. \nWith over $100 billion in cash offshore , MSFT will have to mark-to-market reduced values of cash (and other assets) held overseas if the Euro (or other currency) declines in excess of amounts hedged ( $9.7 billion of hedges at June 30, 2016). For example, if MSFT's hedges lost 5% of their value, the company would have to take a $0.05/share charge to earnings. \nInterest Rates \nAs readers know, we have been in a period of historically low interest rates. Post-election, the yield on the US 10-year has increased by about 50 basis points. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: Investing.com \nIn fiscal 2016, MSFT borrowed $14 billion (excluding short-term debt) to fund dividends ($11 billion) and stock buybacks ($16 billion) while avoiding the tax liability associated with repatriating cash to the US. If MSFT were to repeat this transaction in 2017, an incremental 0.5% would cost about $0.01/share (assuming a 15% tax rate in 2017 and 7.8 billion shares ). \nPotential Positives \nThere are of course, potential positives from Trump's likely legislative agenda. \nCash Repatriation \nMSFT had, as of September 30, 2016, $137 billion in cash on the Company's Balance Sheet. If legislation is changed, enabling cash held overseas to be repatriated at a lower tax rate, MSFT would book a non-cash income statement benefit. MSFT's most recent tax rates averaged 15%, so a change to 20% or 25% would only impact the portion of profits repatriated to the US (net of deductions). A corporate tax rate of 20% would drive a material one-time gain on deferred taxes. Cash repatriated could be used to fund dividends or stock buy-backs; the Company could avoid incremental borrowings currently used for these purposes. \nHigher Interest Rates \nMSFT would benefit from being able to receive higher returns on any idle cash on its balance sheet. However, as the Company would likely make extensive use of short-duration, low yield instruments such as commercial paper, the impact would likely be minimal (30 day LIBOR is up about 2 basis points since the election; longer durations are up a bit more). \nReduction in Corporate Tax Rate \nA decrease in the US tax rate would also benefit MSFT, directly for US profits and to the extent the rate would drop to source country tax rate for overseas profits. As previously mentioned, MSFT accrued a net system-wide tax of 15% in fiscal 2016, so it is unclear how great of a benefit MSFT would garner from a lower corporate tax rate (especially as a reduction in the tax rate is likely to come with the closing of certain deduction MSFT, and other tech companies utilize). \nConclusion \nMSFT continues to leverage its legacy Office Suite and operating system business while experiencing exciting growth from the company's cloud product. While I am not currently long to the stock, I am concerned the current price (and lack of estimate movement) fails to consider the negatives associated with the Trump Presidency. Specifically, Chinese retaliation to President-elect Trump's rhetoric (and possibly actions post-inauguration), a stronger US dollar and higher interest rates will all have non-insignificant impacts on MSFT's earnings and hence its stock price. \nIn the risks to earnings section of its analysis, S&P does not mention the above, only commenting, \"lower-than-projected PC sales, prolonged weakness in the global economy, and issues related to the pending purchase of LinkedIn. Also with the new focus on mobile and cloud, we see margins as vulnerable.\" \nIt is my opinion that the market has not properly considered the noted negatives with respect to MSFT's stock price.

      "text": "Months after Microsoft’s disastrous Tay bot launch on Twitter, the company is giving chatbots another go. This time, it’s testing a bot on Kik. The bot, which was first spotted by Twitter user Tom Hounsell and later written up by MSPoweruser, is called Zo and is essentially an English-language version of Microsoft’s Chinese bot, Xiaoice. Like that bot, Zo attempts conversation with users.\n\nZo really wants to come off as normal. It first “breaks the ice” by posing a question. Zo asked me whether I prefer summer or winter, which is a totally normal conversation starter.\n\nSo far, Zo isn’t much of a conversationalist, and our chat eventually made zero sense.

      "text": "Facebook , Twitter , Google and Microsoft are not acting quickly enough to tackle hate speech , according to the European Commission, which has told the companies to get their act together.\nIf the Silicon Valley companies do not speed up their response to tackling illegal hate speech on their platforms, they will be be held accountable under European law, the Commission said Sunday.\nBack in May,  the companies all voluntarily signed up to a code of conduct , in which they promised to  remove hate speech  within 24 hours of it being posted and to promote counter-narratives. The code arose from concerns about a proliferation of hate speech on the platforms following a spate of terror attacks in Europe and amid  the refugee crisis .\nSigning the code was an alternative to the EU drawing up laws on the matter. But now the EU Commissioner for Justice, Vera Jourova, has said that the Commission may be forced to enact laws after all, as only 40 percent of posts are being removed within the time frame.\n“If Facebook, YouTube , Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,”  she told the Financial Times .\nThe Commission also noted that the volume of hate-speech posts removed within 24 hours differs dramatically across Europe. In France and Germany, over 50 percent of posts are taken down, but in Austria and Italy, the rate drops to 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively.\n“After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies,”  Jourova said to Reuters .\nFacebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n This article originally appeared on  CNET.com .",

The new chatbot comes eight months after Microsoft released another millennial-minded chatbot called “Tay” but removed it within 24 hours after the bot expressed racist leanings to some users.\nZDNet noted that those testing “Zo” notice a more secure chatbot, and one that likes to talk about politics.\n“Tay” was trained to speak like a millennial instead of a personal assistant and could learn to talk just like the people it was speaking with. The bot lived inside Kik , GroupMe and Twitter . Microsoft’s Technology and Research group teamed up with Bing to experiment and research conversational understanding in machines. The team used public data, along with input from improv comedians and AI experts alike.",

      "title": "UPDATE: Bill Gates reveals his favorite books of 2016",
      "text": "By Silvia Ascarelli, MarketWatch\nThe Microsoft co-founder on Nike, tennis, genes, political leadership and the power grid\nBill Gates is once again displaying his eclectic taste in books as he offers up his favorite reads of 2016, ranging from a book on tennis to another example of \"mundane stuff that are actually fascinating.\"\nThe Microsoft(MSFT) co-founder and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says the one common theme (http://b-gat.es/2gKVMwD) is \"they all dropped me down a rabbit hole of unexpected insights and pleasures.\"\nGates says he's been reading about a book a week since childhood. The typical American reads just four in a year (http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/09/01/book-reading-2016/), according to Pew Research Center, and 26% of Americans haven't cracked open a book (including audio books and e-books) in the past year (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/).\nHere's what caught his attention this year:\n\"String Theory\" by David Foster Wallace\nConsider this one for your tennis-loving friends. The book, published is May, is a collection of five essays on the sport\n\"Here, as in his other brilliant works, Wallace found mind-blowing ways of bending language like a metal spoon,\" Gates says. Read more about why he likes the book here (http://b-gat.es/2gKNpRU).\n\"Shoe Dog\" by Phil Knight\nKnight is the co-founder of Nike Inc., and Gates describes the book, published in April, as \"a refreshingly honest reminder of what the path to business success really looks like: messy, precarious and riddled with mistakes.\" Here's his full assessment (http://b-gat.es/2fQ7AJE).\n\"The Myth of the Strong Leader\" by Archie Brown\nThis book, published in 2014, focuses on political leadership, and Gates says he read it because of this year's election battle. Brown, he concludes, \"shows that the leaders who make the biggest contributions to history and humanity generally are not the ones we perceive to be 'strong leaders.' Instead, they tend to be the ones who collaborate, delegate and negotiate -- and recognize that no one person can or should have all the answers.\"\nHis full review is here (http://b-gat.es/2fPYFaZ).\n\"The Gene: An Intimate History\" by Siddhartha Mukherjee\nRead this to get a glimpse of the future of genome science, including the ethical questions it will bring. Genome-editing technologies will affect us all, and this Columbia University doctor has written the book for non-scientists.\n\"It's one thing to reprogram the code that runs our computers. Reprogramming the code that runs our species is a very different thing altogether,\" Gates wrote in a November blog post (https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Gene) that included this video interview:\n(https://youtu.be/yNlRE2WmcQc)\nHere's his full book review (http://b-gat.es/2fPXCb9).\n\"The Grid: The Fraying Wires Between Americans and Our Energy Future\" by Gretchen Bakke\nThis is the one on mundane but fascinating stuff, and Gates gives it an honorable mention.\nHere's his take: \"Even if you have never given a moment's thought to how electricity reaches your outlets, I think this book would convince you that the electrical grid is one of the greatest engineering wonders of the modern world. I think you would also come to see why modernizing the grid is so complex and so critical for building our clean-energy future.\"\nThere's no full review by Gates for this one. The book was published in July.\nGates recommended a different set of five books (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-books-bill-gates-wants-you-to-read-this-summer-2016-05-17) this summer. Here's his list of favorites from 2015 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-lists-the-best-books-hes-read-this-year-2015-12-07) and 2014 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-five-best-books-bill-gates-read-in-2014-2014-12-10).\n-Silvia Ascarelli; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nRELATED: 6 books that influence guru Robert Cialdini wants you to read (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-books-that-influence-guru-robert-cialdini-wants-you-to-read-2016-10-05)\nRELATED: 6 books recommended by Richard Thaler, a founding father of behavioral economics (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/6-books-recommended-by-richard-thaler-a-founding-father-of-behavioral-economics-2016-07-05)\nRELATED: 20 books that make Amazon's best of 2016--at midyear (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/20-books-that-make-amazons-best-of-2016so-far-2016-06-22)\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-05-16 1301ET\n ",
