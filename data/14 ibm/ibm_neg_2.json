      "text": "Submit Young Atlantic Canadians shouldn’t have to leave home to find jobs: IBM exec \nThe thousands of young people graduating from Atlantic Canada’s colleges and universities every year shouldn’t have to look for work outside the region’s borders now that technology has made it so much easier for the world to come to them, says Dino Trevisani, president of IBM Canada. © The Canadian Press, file \nAn IBM logo is displayed in Berlin, Vt., on July 16, 2013. \nWhile it’s true the region continues to lose young people to out-migration, IBM’s decision to create a series of entrepreneurial hubs with the help of provincial governments, colleges and universities has helped stem the tide of lost talent, Trevisani said in a speech Monday to a group of academics, business leaders and politicians gathered at the Halifax Central Library. \n“You have 20,000 graduates coming out of colleges and universities every year, and that’s music to our ears when we hear about that kind of talent,” he said. \n“What better environment to work in than to look out at the bay and participate in the culture, the history and the beauty of this environment — not to mention the lobster. That’s what people are looking for. They’re looking for that lifestyle.” \nTrevisani cited many examples of work being done in a variety of centres acorss the country including what he called the top-notch work being done in St. John’s, at the Centre for Health Informatics and Analytics, which was developed in partnership with Memorial University of Newfoundland. \nTrevisani, who is originally from Hamilton, Ont., said IBM’s Client Innovation Centre in Halifax, which opened in 2013, serves as a good example of how the best talent doesn’t always gravitate to the big cities. \nWhen the centre opened, it had 70 employees and three local clients. A little over three years later, the centre employs 500 people serving more than 30 clients from around the world. \n“That centre is the best performing delivery centre for IBM in the world,” he said. “That’s where our market is. It’s the world. And we want to serve that market from right here with our talented people.” \nHe said the workers in Halifax are young, well-educated, loyal to the company and well paid. \n“They want to stay here and be part of the community,” the senior executive said. “I’m sitting in Toronto saying, ‘They don’t need to come here.’ We can create jobs and opportunities for them there.” \nTrevisani also pointed to the company’s cyber security research and customer support centre in Fredericton, which was established in 2011 after IBM acquired Q1 Labs. Its QRadar security intelligence platform was developed in Fredericton, in partnership with the University of New Brunswick. \nThe acquisition prompted IBM to form its security division, which has grown into a $2-billion business employing 7,500 researchers, developers and security experts in 36 locations worldwide. \n“QRadar is the hottest cyber security product in the world — and it’s built in Fredericton,” said Trevisani. \nThe Fredericton office started with 40 employees. It now has 400. \nTrevisani’s 28-year career at IBM has included stints in finance, business management, sales and marketing and global executive assignments. He holds MBAs from both Queen’s University’s School of Business in Kingston, Ont., and Cornell University’s Johnson School of Management in Ithaca, N.Y. \nHe told the crowd his parents left Italy and arrived at the Port of Halifax to start a new life in Canada in 1952. His mother picked fruit and later worked as a cook, and his father worked at the Stelco steel mills in Hamilton. \n“I wish I could have stayed in Hamilton and had a career there,” he said. \nWhen he was hired in early 2015 to oversee IBM Canada’s 14,000 employees, he said he noticed that far too many Canadians have to uproot themselves to succeed in high-tech. \n“My ambition, when I came here, was to change that,” he said. “That’s been my inspiration.” \nHe said most Canadian universities are doing their part to help, and most provincial governments have stepped up to do the same. \nAs for IBM, he said the company is committed to building entrepreneurial networks by making technology available to universities and colleges, giving students potential access to global markets. \n“That way, they never have to leave Canada. ... That’s my vision and that’s my aspiration.” ",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock If there has been on Dow Jones Industrial Average stock that has managed to disappoint in recent years, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) probably first comes to mind. According to Merrill Lynch, that negativity may be about to end. What is interesting was that IBM shares were actually down marginally on Wednesday despite that post-election surprise rally.\nIBM was raised to Buy from Neutral on Thursday by Merrill Lynch, and Big Blue’s price target was raised to $185 from $170. Is it possible that the post-election trend might end up working for IBM too? Before thinking IBM is a new regime winner, the words “Trump” and “Republican” were not mentioned a single time in the entire report.\nAccording to Merrill Lynch’s Wamsi Mohan, IBM could have several drivers of earnings growth in 2017. Mohan sees earnings growth to resume in 2017 after moderating mergers and acquisitions, and from the mainframe cycle in 2017, and Mohan even sees organic growth in 2018. There is also optionality from artificial intelligence and flat free cash flow.\nThere are other issues to consider as well. One is IBM’s 3.6% dividend yield. A surprise note is that IBM now remains grossly under-owned by major investors (even if it is a key Berkshire Hathaway stock). As far as how under-owned Big Blue is, Merrill Lynch believes that IBM now has only a 0.30 relative weighting in the S&P 500.\nMore reasons to expect good news from IBM were seen as follows:\nSavings from restructuring efforts and lower restructuring charges will create tailwinds to 2017. The pace of investments is likely to not increase, driving benefits from increased utilization. SaaS revenues will start to drive a higher percentage of growth. The constant currency organic growth is expected to decline at a slower pace and can potentially cross over to positive in 2018. The mainframe cycle in 2017 can drive a recovery in transactional revenues. A recent CIO survey suggests that IBM is gaining mindshare in business intelligence, analytics and Watson. IBM shares trade at discounted valuations on earnings versus peers. There are at least some concerns noted that could derail the IBM story. Mohan sees downside risks to the firm’s price objective that could come from the following potentialities:\nA weaker IT spending environment Increased FX (currency) headwinds Risk with transformation to more strategic initiatives An increased pace of deterioration in the core business Merrill Lynch’s investment rationale points out even more of the bias behind the call:\nWe view IBM as a defensive investment given its high exposure to recurring sales, cost cutting levers, solid balance sheet, potential share gains, and relatively stable margins. We believe IBM will embark on further cost cutting, and enhance its services and software offerings through acquisitions. Longer term, we expect IBM to take share in IT spending with its Cloud and AI initiatives. We believe 2016 should be a bottom for earnings and FCF, and positively view its improving fundamentals.\nIBM closed down 0.23% at $154.81 on Wednesday but shares were up 2.3% at $158.40 shortly after the opening bell. IBM had a consensus analyst target price of $156.38 prior to the call, as well as a 52-week trading range of $116.90 to $165.00.\nThomson Reuters now shows that IBM’s post-call consensus analyst price target is $157.10, but the median price target there is $160.00. The consensus price target was $156.48 a month ago, $154.98 just two months ago and $153.90 about three months ago. Over the course of that same time, the median price has remained $160.00.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "IBM Upgrade a 'Very Bullish Call': More Squawk From Jim Cramer TheStreet's Jim Cramer says IBM ending negative revisions can power the company forward. Giovanni Bruno Nov10,201610:20AMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) --Shares of IBM ( IBM ) were climbing in early morning trading on Thursday, after getting an upgrade to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch today. \n\"What an upgrade, this is a very bullish call,\" TheStreet's Jim Cramer said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this morning. \nSubstantial investments in M&A and restructuring are poised to come to fruition, powering IBM forward, Merrill Lynch's Wamsi Mohan said in a report. \"IBM has multiple levers to drive earnings growth in 2017,\" Mohan said. \n\"They're saying the number cuts are done,\" Cramer noted. \"The amazing thing is negative revisions.\" \nIBM has stabilized its earnings, resulting in unlikely significant negative revisions. \nNegative revisions seemed to have become synonymous with IBM, \"maybe that's over,\" Cramer stated. \nMoreover, Cramer believes that should IBM get back and stay on track it could become a key player in the tech space. \n\"IBM, not really regarded as a tech anymore, which I think is a mistake. I think it is a tech company. Its cognitive, maybe not as much social or mobile as people want, but it does have analytics,\" Cramer noted. \n\"IBM can be a bit of a new bell cow here, if they really get it right,\" he said. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) --Shares of IBM ( IBM ) were climbing in early morning trading on Thursday, after getting an upgrade to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch today.\n\"What an upgrade, this is a very bullish call,\" TheStreet's Jim Cramer said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this morning.\nSubstantial investments in M&A and restructuring are poised to come to fruition, powering IBM forward, Merrill Lynch's Wamsi Mohan said in a report. \"IBM has multiple levers to drive earnings growth in 2017,\" Mohan said.\n\"They're saying the number cuts are done,\" Cramer noted. \"The amazing thing is negative revisions.\"\nIBM has stabilized its earnings, resulting in unlikely significant negative revisions.\nNegative revisions seemed to have become synonymous with IBM, \"maybe that's over,\" Cramer stated.\nMoreover, Cramer believes that should IBM get back and stay on track it could become a key player in the tech space.\n\"IBM, not really regarded as a tech anymore, which I think is a mistake. I think it is a tech company. Its cognitive, maybe not as much social or mobile as people want, but it does have analytics,\" Cramer noted.\n\"IBM can be a bit of a new bell cow here, if they really get it right,\" he said.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan IBM's Watson AI could soon be in devices from PCs to robots, thanks to Project Intu IBM says its newly-unveiled Project Intu promises to make it simpler to bring Watson to the physical world. \nIBM's Project Intu is an experimental framework to help developers equip devices with Watson's AI features. Image: IBM \nIBM has released tools for developers to plug its Watson artificial intelligence into any device or thing, from robots to walls. \nIts latest effort to get Watson in the hands of developers is Project Intu, an experimental framework to help developers equip devices more easily with Watson's conversation, language and visual-recognition services. \nIBM wants developers to use Intu to add so-called cognitive capabilities to machines, such as getting them to understand questions and gestures, or for example, monitor the weather and the time of day. \nThe company has released software developer kits for Intu on GitHub and its Intu gateway, offering the tools to build Watson features for any platform, including Raspberry Pi, Windows, Linux and macOS. Developers will need to have an account with IBM's Bluemix cloud to experiment with the tools. \n\"Intu is an architecture that enables Watson services in devices that perceive by vision, audition, olfaction, sonar, infrared energy, temperature, and vibration. Intu-enabled devices express themselves and interact with their environments, other devices, and people through speakers, actuators, gestures, scent emitters, lights, navigation, and more,\" IBM explains on its GitHub page. \nThe project is in search of all manner of developers, whether they're hacking together Raspberry Pi with various sensors to create robots, or businesses exploring bots for customer service. \nIBM says Intu is a more advanced development platform than Node-RED , an IBM-developed flow editor that enables drag-and-drop programming for IoT devices. \n\"Project Intu has the ability to react to ever-changing situations and acting out the best response, whereas traditional orchestrations, think Node-Red, are optimal for command-to-action scenarios,\" IBM Watson exec Shantenu Agarwal said . \n\"When it comes to scale of both the actions and the use of the services, Project Intu's extensibility enables you to quickly add new behaviors with minimum coding rather than having to manage an ever-growing logic tree.\" Join Discussion",

      "title": "Video: Ustream Offers Full VOD Capabilities as Part of IBM Cloud Video",
      "text": "Tweet \nTim Siglin: Hi my name is Tim Siglin. I'm a contributing editor for Streaming Media Magazine and streamingmedia.com. We're here at the beginnings of the 2016 Streaming Media West show in Huntington Beach. I've got with me Alden Fertig from Ustream, which is now part of IBM Video Cloud. Alden, tell me what's gone on with the company since the acquisition. \nAlden Fertig: Sure. It was announced at the beginning of this year. Ustream was acquired by IBM. We formed part of the IBM Cloud Video unit. The IBM Cloud Video unit is powering experiences for premium content distribution as well as also powering experiences for enterprise, live, and on-demand video. \nTim Siglin: Does that tie you in with, say, IBM Global Services on the professional services side, where they may bring your expertise in to help them launch enterprise types of products? How does that work? \nAlden Fertig: Yes, there are many complementary technologies that are part of IBM. Aspera is one of the very well-known ones. They're a leader in high-speed file transfer, and a lot of that is video, of course. IBM cloud object storage is also here. Again, big data is oftentimes video. It's some of the biggest sources of data on the internet. So, we're collaborating with different parts of IBM. \nThe final one that everyone's most excited about is IBM Watson. We're using the cognitive insights of IBM Watson to do things like extract metadata from videos. That might be speech-to-text to do automated captioning, or it could be things like image recognition to do contextual advertising. \nTim Siglin: Ustream itself has primarily been live-focused as opposed to asset-based or on-demand. What does Ustream bring to the total video cloud that IBM maybe didn't have prior to that? \nAlden Fertig: Great question. When Ustream started, we were pretty much solely focused on live streaming. Over the years we've expanded, though. Now, we're live streaming and full on-demand video capabilities, as well. What we've been able to contribute to the IBM Cloud Video overall ecosystem is yes, that live streaming expertise, as well as we're bundling with our offering cloud-based transcoding and a multi CDN offering. A lot of this is all coming together so that we're able to use it for live streaming, but we're also able to use it for on-demand, and we're able to use it for enterprise use cases as well as media entertainment use cases. \nTim Siglin: In reality, you bring a holistic approach to the ecosystem as opposed to just live? \nAlden Fertig: Yeah. One of the things a lot of times people are, \"Oh, so it's going to be all enterprise 'cause it's IBM now.\" IBM plays in a lot of spaces. It's not just a company that sells enterprise solutions. Again, you look at, say, Aspera, and it's being used by all the major movie studios. Those aren't your typical thought of enterprise, but IBM has quite a bit of footprint in media entertainment. We're continuing to develop that front, as well as offer enterprise video-focused solutions. \nTim Siglin: What do you hope to learn at the show, and what are some of the trends that you think you'll see across the show here? \nAlden Fertig: I come here every year. One of the things I love to learn about is, what are the latest trends with codecs and formats? Everyone's always keeping a close eye on that because we need to make sure that we can deliver to every screen efficiently. It's always a changing landscape. It's one of the things I love about online video in general. \nAnother trend--maybe a few years ago, video was just hard to actually get it from one place to another. Now, everyone takes it for granted. There are lots of vendors here, there's lots of solutions. Now, it's about how can I really optimize the ROI on that video? \nMaybe if I'm doing a subscription VOD model, it's how can I prevent my subscribers from churning? If I'm doing an advertising-based model, it's how can I maximize my advertising dollars? If I'm doing enterprise video, it's about how can I make sure that my employees are really watching those videos and I'm getting the most out of my investment? \nTim Siglin: Very good. Again, this is Almost Live here at Streammedia.com. We really appreciate your time and bringing us up to speed on what Ustream is doing, now that it's part of IBM Video Cloud. \nAlden Fertig: Thanks for having me. I'm really glad to be part of the show. Page 1",

      "text": "Why IBM Is Betting Big on Blockchain newsfeedback@fool.com (Timothy Green) 27 min ago Image source: IBM. \nWhile bitcoin and other digital currencies have so far failed to live up to their promise, the underlying blockchain technology has the potential to transform countless industries. A distributed, decentralized database that records transactions in a way that can't be altered, blockchain is being touted as a way to remove inefficiencies, saving time and money. IBM goes all-in on blockchain \nThere is perhaps no company making a bigger blockchain push than International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) . Finance is one area where blockchain has found early adopters, so it should be no surprise that IBM is leading the charge. The company counts as clients more than 90 of the top 100 banks worldwide. Any significant technological change in the banking industry not being spearheaded by IBM risks the company losing that valuable customer base. \nIBM has announced a flurry of partnerships and initiatives related to blockchain in recent weeks. The company is working with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ to use blockchain for contracts between business partners. IBM is teaming with China UnionPay to develop a blockchain-based system for sharing loyalty points between multiple banks. A partnership with SBI Securities to test blockchain technology for a new bond trading system was announced in late October. \nAccording to an IBM study, 15% of banks surveyed plan to have blockchains in commercial production by 2017, and 91% of banks are investing in blockchain for deposit-taking. The World Economic Forum estimates that 80% of banks are actively working on blockchain projects. This rapid adoption has forced IBM to be aggressive in order to maintain its position as a major supplier of IT to the banking industry. \nFinance isn't the only opportunity IBM sees with blockchain. CEO Virginia Rometty recently penned an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal , laying out the case that blockchain could be just as transformative as the internet. If that ends up being the case, IBM's intense focus on the technology could pay dividends down the road. \nOne example put forth by Rometty of where blockchain can increase efficiency is the process of buying a house: \nConsider the process of buying a house, a complex transaction involving banks, attorneys, title companies, insurers, regulators, tax agencies and inspectors. They all maintain separate records, and it's costly to verify and record each step. That's why the average closing takes roughly 50 days. Blockchain offers a solution: a trusted, immutable digital ledger, visible to all participants, that shows every element of the transaction. \nAnother example is a project involving Visa and DocuSign that would allow car buyers to configure a lease and drive away with a new car immediately, without the time-consuming process of filling out mountains of paperwork. La'Zooz, a start-up in Israel, is using blockchain in a ride-sharing app that allows drivers and customers to connect directly, without the need for a middleman ride-sharing company. \nMaking supply chains more efficient is another area where blockchain could potentially shine. IBM estimates that blockchain could generate more than $100 billion of efficiencies annually if applied to global supply chains -- a staggering number. Both Toyota and the U.S. Postal Service are currently looking into using blockchain for exactly that purpose. \nIBM's core aim is to solve problems for its clients. Blockchain has the potential to solve myriad problems in a variety of industries, making the technology a natural fit for Big Blue. At this point, given how new the technology is, it's impossible to say whether it will live up to its potential. But if blockchain delivers on its promises, IBM could be at the center of a major technological revolution. \n10 stocks we like better than IBM \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Markets Today Pump the Breaks on IBM, Lebenthal Asset Management CEO Says Lebenthal Asset Management CEO Jim Lebenthal is waiting to see further positive results from IBM, despite its upgrade to 'buy' at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch today. Giovanni Bruno Nov10,20161:00PMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) --Shares of IBM ( IBM ) were climbing in early afternoon trading on Thursday, after getting an upgrade to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" with a $185 price target at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch . \n\"We believe that earnings have stabilized and large negative revisions are unlikely,\" the bank said in a note. \n\"I don't think you're going to lose money buying IBM,\" Lebenthal Asset Management CEO Jim Lebenthal said on CNBC 's \"Fast Money Halftime Report\" today. \"But, I think you're still ways away from making money.\" \nAfter having read the analyst's report, Lebenthal noted the expected positive turn the analyst projects in 2017, but isn't buying it yet. \n\"In my opinion why not wait to see that turn, because we've been waiting three years to see that turn in revenue,\" he stated. \nThere isn't a steadfast way of knowing whether or not IBM's struggling businesses have stopped bleeding enough in order to allow its more lucrative businesses (Watson, cloud computing) to take over, he noted. \n\"Just wait,\" Lebenthal concluded. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. \nThe team rates IBM as a Buy with a ratings score of B. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance and notable return on equity. The team feels its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat weak growth in earnings per share. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "By TC Currie \nIBM announced recently that they are making it easier for developers to jump into machine learning . At the World of Watson conference, the IBM Cloud-based Watson Data Platform with Machine Learning was launched. At the core of it all was the concept of the interconnectivity of data made possible through APIs. \nIBM Lead Architect for Streams Product, Mike Spicer , summarized the advantages during an AMA session. Watson, he said, “brings in historical data, builds a picture of what’s happening in the real world, and applies models to predict outcome in real time. All within 10 milliseconds.” \nDavid Kenny General Manager, IBM Watson, called Watson, a “cognitive assistant” and clarified that it is not Artificial Intelligence, but an Intelligence Assistant. Because, he said, Watson analyzes data but does not draw conclusions. Man and machine, not machine replacing man. Humans are still needed to make decisions. \nSpeeds are startling. Watson can suck data into the cloud at 10 gigabytes per second. The Watson UI allows collaboration between data professionals, but the company claims that it is so easy to use that non-engineers can use Watson to visualize and share insights. And Watson’s value grows over time; as teams teach Watson, that learning becomes available to the entire company. \nWatson’s machine learning, stressed IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, will remain proprietary for each business. “Your data goes to school,” she said, “learns what it needs to, then goes back home to your business.” \nLaura Bennett , Development Manager for Watson Application Starter Kits, demonstrated the new Developers Starter Kits , a collection of REST APIs, SDKs, and samples that use cognitive computing to solve complex problems.The SDKs have been expanded and users can now code in variety of languages, including SQL, Python, R, Java, and Scala, Node.js, i/OS or Android. In addition, more than 20 ecosystem partner APIs are available to extend the platform services including Twilio, Box, IoT, Insights for Twitter, Weather Insights, Cloudant DB, and Facebook Messenger. \nStarter kits are robust, including not only the expected documentation and samples, but models pre-trained for common use cases, notebooks, utilities, bundled APIs, and code templates available on GitHub. \nFor example, the News Intelligence Kit uses AlchemyLanguage, a collection of APIs that analyze text through natural language processing, AlchemyDataNews, a query that scours the world’s news sources and blogs like a database, and Tone Analyer, a tool that gauges the reaction of commenters. This Kit allows users to process Web and social media to not only understand important topics but how people feel about those topics. You can launch the app or check out the code on GitHub here .

      "title": "SAP HANA to Get Some Great New Power with IBM Development",
      "text": "Contributing Writer \nMany companies put SAP HANA to work in driving some operations, but IBM ( News - Alert ) is ready to put still more power into that platform by offering some new infrastructure choices to help drive it along. The new choices could mean big new options afoot, and may give IBM a further leg up in this market front. \nThe new infrastructure options will allow companies to deploy as many as eight production databases on just one server thanks to IBM Power's virtualization options. With that many production databases in play, reports note, it will be easier for companies to put platform virtualization to use and launch more SAP ( News - Alert ) HANA workloads. That in turn should yield greater flexibility for businesses using it, allowing said businesses to bring out tools like cloud models and improved workload balancing. \nSince SAP HANA offers enterprise application users a better ability to run transactions real-time, also including analytics tools to help ensure the best results, there's a clear interest in bringing SAP HANA tools on board. With IBM Power involved, meanwhile, a good thing is made even better by allowing multiple SAP systems to work together—this allows for new scenarios involving coordinated failover and fallback options—as well as offering direct cost savings though smaller footprints and faster time-to-market. With workloads consolidated, that allows several different systems to run from one server, particularly test, production and development all at once. \nPlus, with Power Systems in place, users get access to things like high-availability components that allow for uptime levels approaching five-nines—99.997 percent at last report—as well as rapid scalability of systems and the ability to move live applications from one server to another. \nIBM Systems vice president Kathy Bennett commented “Our clients are consistently searching for ways to reduce their overall IT footprint and associated costs without sacrificing capability or performance. With IBM Power Systems we're enabling companies with the means to use virtualization to match their deployment to their business, and bring processing and data closer together to reduce latency and speed decision making.” \nIBM has brought out a terrific move here for anyone considering SAP HANA at all, or is currently using it. It's made a very good thing much better with new options and new capabilities, and in an environment where there's a competitor around every corner and two in every dark alley, IBM has improved the chances of an IBM Power / SAP HANA combination showing up and staying in most every office around. \nWith that level of capability afoot now, and more likely to follow before too much longer, the end result should prove to be a welcome one not only for IBM, but also for its users. Extra power for no extra charge seldom proves unwelcome, and a clear value is commonly appreciated by its buyers.",

      "text": "PCPCC’s Barbara Starfield Award presented to Dr. Paul Grundy – Chief Medical Officer at IBM November 10, 2016 | Written by: Sean Hogan \nCategorized: Healthcare Industry Insights Last night, in our nation’s capital, we gathered with leaders from the major medical associations for the annual meeting and awards dinner for the Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative ( PCPCC ). IBM’s own Paul H. Grundy , MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer, and Global Director of Healthcare Transformation was recognized as a recipient of the prestigious PCPCC’s Barbara Starfield Award, bestowed on individuals for their extraordinary contributions to health system transformation. Dr. Doug Henley , CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians presented the award. He thanked Paul for his loud, energetic voice and for bringing hope. He described how Paul – with great tenacity – pulled together the Payers, the Employers, the Physicians from all the different stakeholders and told them “We have to bring these groups together and we have to do this”. He summed up his comments on Paul with this quote: “A man is not great because he does great things, he does great things because he is great”. Established in 2012, the PCPCC Barbara Starfield Award commemorates the work of Dr. Starfield. Recognized world-wide as an expert in primary care she was an advocate of the critical role that primary care plays in driving health system transformation. During her distinguished career at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, her defining work with patterns of morbidity formed the basis of the ACG® System . Biennially, the award recognizes the best use of the ACG® System. What is ACG? The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups® (ACG®) System measures the morbidity burden of patient populations based on multiple factors such as disease patterns, age and gender. It also relies on the diagnostic and/or pharmaceutical code information found in insurance claims or other electronic medical records. The improved accuracy allows to identify patients at high risk, forecast healthcare utilization and set equitable payment rates. Based on his lifetime work related to the ACG® system, Paul Grundy is this year’s Starfield Award laureate. About Dr. Paul Grundy In Paul’s words, back in 2005, IBM began to question the very foundation of healthcare and reached the conclusion that when compared to other industrialized countries, U.S. healthcare failed to deliver comprehensive primary care. On this basis, Dr. Grundy founded the Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative (PCPCC) in 2006 to facilitate improvements in patient-physician relations and create a more effective and efficient model of healthcare delivery. The PCPCC has created an open forum where healthcare stakeholders freely communicate and work together to improve the future of the American medical system. Known as the “godfather” of the patient-centered medical home, Paul has developed model language for inclusion in health reform proposals to include the PCMH concept. Furthermore, as IBM’s Chief Medical Officer and Director of Healthcare Transformation, part of Dr. Grundy’s work is directed towards developing and executing strategies that support IBM’s transformation initiatives in the healthcare industry.",

      "text": "Netflix, Lockheed, IBM Upgraded; Qualcomm Downgraded; Taser PT Hiked Netflix was upgraded to a buy with a price target of 151 by Loop Capital. (Netflix) \nNetflix ( NFLX ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT ) and IBM ( IBM ) were upgraded to buy Thursday, while Taser International ( TASR ) had its price target raised, and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) was downgraded. Netflix \nThe streaming video giant was upgraded to buy with a price target of 151 by Loop Capital. Netflix's stock is near its record high, but concerns over costs and plans for 1,000 hours of original content are prompting a new question: Should investors still view the company as a tech disrupter shaking up Big Media , or has its seduction by Hollywood left it unable to still act like a nimble tech startup? \nNetflix initially rose higher but reversed to close down 5.5% at 115.42 in the stock market today as investors dumped many big-cap techs. \nRELATED: \nApple, FANG Stocks Aren't Joining Trump Rally Lockheed Martin \nThe Pentagon contractor was upgraded to a buy from hold with a price target of 275 by Deutsche Bank. The Defense Department finalized a $6.1 billion contract with Lockheed Martin last week for the ninth batch of F-35 stealth fighters, though both sides remain in a dispute about pricing. \nLockheed Martin stock rose 1.5% at 257.22, after rallying 6% Wednesday on expectations that a Trump administration would boost military spending. IBM \nBig Blue was upgraded to a buy with a price target of 185 by Bank of America. The artificial intelligence of IBM's Watson will be used to make millions of General Motors ( GM ) cars smarter through a new partnership between the automaker and tech giant, the companies said Wednesday. \nIBM rallied 3.5% to finish at 160.22. Qualcomm \nQualcomm was downgraded to equal weight from overweight with a price target of 65 by Morgan Stanley. Qualcomm reported Q3 earnings last week that beat on the top and bottom lines. Its Q4 outlook was largely below views. The outlook may give some indication of the fallout from Samsung's Note 7 fiasco, as well as the strength of demand for the Apple iPhone 7. \nQualcomm last week announced plans to buy NXP Semiconductors ( NXPI ) for $39 billion. \nQualcomm stock briefly rose but has reversed to end down 2.3% to 66.31. Taser \nTaser had its price target raised to 35 from 33 by Craig Hallum. Taser reported third-quarter earnings late Wednesday that beat estimates. The company, which provides stun-weaponry, body cameras and online information storage systems, has over the years landed sales deals with a variety of law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad. \nShares jumped 13% to close at 26.82, retaking the 50-day line.

      "text": "Do It Day 2016: How Coca-Cola, Amnesty International, IBM, xAd and more proved marketing can change the world in 24 hours TR By The Drum Reporters - 10 November 2016 16:48pm Do It Day saw The Drum take over some of the world's most iconic ad inventory \nToday, a collection of the world's leading brands and brightest creative minds joined forces with The Drum in London and New York to prove that marketing can change the world. \nOver the course of 24 hours, real-world problems ranging from the refugee crisis to littering and finding young people job opportunities were tackled by agencies and brands including NSPCC, Dennis Publishing and the Ad Council. \nSo here's what this industry achieved when it pooled its resources and talents for one day... Coca-Cola \nCoca-Cola’s team was tasked with devising a behaviour-changing push to encourage people to litter less and recycle more. With help from environmental campaigning group the Hubbub Foundation, the creatives involved brought the brief to life with a stunt on London’s Southbank. \nA taster of what will become a wider campaign for the brand in 2017, the Do It Day drive comprised a social experiment dubbed ‘Talking Rubbish’ which quite literally gave litter a voice of its own. A discarded coffee cup and an aluminium can containing hidden speakers was mic'd up to two actors who startled unsuspecting pedestrians. Witty and edgy comments from the litter underlined the mission of both the cheeky cup and attention-seeking can to get people to pick them up and put them in the bin. \nOn the day Coca-Cola filmed the public’s reaction to the experiment and created a humorous teaser spot giving a taste of how the 2017 campaign will look. O2 Business Marketing and Greengrass Consulting \nGreengrass and O2 brought to life the #walkthetalk social media campaign asking men to give their support to gender equality. \nBacked by a 40 second STV-created ad, the social stunt tasked men with removing their socks and shoes and sharing a picture of their feet using the hashtag, which was inspired by the treatment of Theresa May during the general election in the media. \nThroughout the day the team contacted a variety of people over Twitter and email explaining the campaign with coverage anchored to the newly launched #walkthetalk website. \nSTV's film, which ran on the TV network this afternoon, tasked men in the industry with explaining why they want to get involved in the conversation. \nThroughout the day, the campaign received almost 100 pictures from men across the UK. NSPCC \nNSPCC used Do It Day to kickstart the #KidsWithGrownUpProblems campaign, conceived by the winning team at Plan It Day, which it is hoping to launch next year if strategising over the coming months goes to plan. \nThe NSPCC team hired 'Johnny Singleton', a motivational speaker, to give advice on stress management. To make sure people attended, the team used the morning to create flyers and push the event out on social media. \nIn the afternoon, attendees gathered and Johnny enthusiastically took to the stage. He began talking about anxiety, stress and depression before giving advice on some of his coping mechanisms. \nThe twist? ‘Johnny’ was 13 years old and revealed that one of the most important outlets to deal with these ‘grown up problems’ is Childline, which is run by NSPCC. \nA film crew was on hand to capture the reaction of the audience and will potentially use the content to form part of the wider campaign. IBM \nThe challenge set by the IBM team at Plan It Day and put into action at Do It Day was to raise awareness and promote adoption of its missing people app – an internal project a group within the tech company has been developing. \nUsing IBM supercomputer Watson’s cognitive capabilities, it has the power to assist police forces in their searches by analysing as much relevant data as possible in the shortest possible time. \nIBM software account manager Wendy Larcade, who is heading up the app, explained: “We are now at prototype stage and have something we can demonstrate to police forces. And here today we have these great people who have actually taken our app and come up with loads of great ideas about how to take it to market.” \nBy the end of Do It Day the app had a name (‘Searchlight’), a logo and brand assets, marketing material which included posters and pop-up banners that can be taken to police events and conferences, a Twitter targeting campaign aimed at key stakeholders and a slick video presentation. \n“After all their work today we have built a full year’s marketing plan,” said Larcade. Amnesty International \nAmnesty International spent Do It Day amplifying its #iwelcome initiative. \nTaking a different path from the proposed Plan It Day idea, the day started with Amnesty sharing its #iwelcome message, complete with custom-made artwork, on the iconic Piccadilly Circus screens before mounting a social media push. \nTaking inspiration from the ‘Ice Bucket Challenge’, the call to action asked people to post a selfie pointing to their hearts – as all hearts beat the same – along with the #iwelcome message, the overall aim being to drive signatures to the #iwelcome pledge. \n“When you work in the charity sector, it's amazing to get input and inspiration from people who work in different sectors,” said Amnesty International global creative manager Kristin Hulass Sunde. \n“[This] could really help transform people’s lives and we’ll be running initiatives over the next two years, this is just the start.” \nGreat to see all your #IWelcome selfies - keep them coming, and keep signing & sharing our refugee pledge action: https://t.co/39GLtMbbGI pic.twitter.com/gXSisluUEI \n— AmnestyInternational (@AmnestyOnline) November 10, 2016 \nLike the amplified campaign, the winning US team idea, #OneMoreThing continued to build in New York City. \nThe team of Grecian Malavé, account executive at The Partners and Charlie Wade, US business development manager of Asos, were encouraged that their idea yielded such great results when the brief was spread to the One Minute briefs community. Post-Do It Day, the hope is that the idea can cross over into other areas or stakeholders related to refugees and their treatment. \n“The sheer quantity of people who responded — and responded in the manner of what we were thinking shows how good [the concept] is, shows how easy it is to grasp, as well,” notes Wade. \nAt the end of Do It Day, the dynamic US duo had developed ideas around three core values: empathy, humanization of the refugee story and utilization of their talents. Each address key issues facing the whole of the refugee population. Combined, and with more time and resource, their approach felt like strong starting point for future action. Digital Futures \nTo meet its goal of getting 100 marketing businesses to pledge to take on an apprentice, Digital Futures chartered and branded a double-decker bus, packed it with over 40 eager potential apprentices and took them on a tour of some of London’s hottest creative agencies today. \nStarting at Edelman and driving on to AnalogFolk, Iris and Kantar, those on board were treated to showcases from some of the agencies’ top talents and a speed dating-style session at AnalogFolk designed to demystify the types of roles that exist within marketing firms. \nBy 3pm, Digital Futures’ road-trip, amplified by a social media push and press ads using the hashtag #meetyourfuture, had secured almost 60 pledges. “By this time next week we’ll have smashed our target,” said the organisation’s founder Jonathan Lindon. \nAnd in the spirit of the day’s theme of achieving remarkable feats in unreasonable timeframes, Digital Futures also created a radio ad in a matter of hours with the help of Jungle Studios. Voiced by real apprentices, it was broadcast at 4pm on Share Radio, and you can hear it below. Airbnb \n​While some challenger brands scrambled around on Do it Day trying to push through prototypes and creative, Airbnb took a more measured approach. \nIt wants its idea to allow hosts to support local businesses to become a part of its service and so took the opportunity to speak to hosts and interviewees to envisage what that might look like. It wasn’t about coming up with an app or developing a service in 24 hours, rather it was about coming up with the killer insight needed to ensure guests have local knowledge about areas they’re staying in the palm of their hands. Dennis Publishing \nAfter planting 10,000 trees in the Heart of England forest at Do It Day last year, this time Dennis Publishing rolled out its #hugatree campaign, taking walking talking trees around the streets of London. It also erected a nine-foot tree in its headquarters, pushed ads on the much coveted space in Piccadilly Circus and collated the public’s pictures into a virtual forest online. \nThe idea behind the #hugatree campaign is to encourage awareness of the valuable UK forestry in order to prevent its decline, a topic close to the heart of Dennis Publishing’s late founder Felix Dennis, who founded the Heart of England Forest charity in 2011. \nToday the publisher took to the streets to encourage city folk to show their love for trees, and share pictures on social media. For each picture shared, Dennis promised to plant a tree in exchange. It created fun political snaps of 'Donald Trunk', 'Forest Johnson', 'Barack Oak-bama' and 'Tree-sa May' hugging trees to promote the campaign on social. The planting at the Heart of England Forest will take place in February 2017 at the newly devised Plant It Day. Business in the Community \nAt this year's Do it Day, Business in the Community (BITC) created its 'High Street High School' initiative intended to help turn around Britain's declining high streets. \nFollowing on from the winning idea at Plan it Day, BITC gave a team of creatives from digital design company Aerian a brief to help create the 'High Street High School', an idea inspired by BITC's efforts to address the issues of jobs, decreasing footfall and empty premises, all of which have contributed to the waning health of Britain's high streets in recent years. \nJane Pritchard, enterprise and culture director at Business in the Community (BITC), said: \"We've taken the concept of the High Street High School and developed a website and curriculum here today. \n\"That curriculum has been populated by case studies from the towns we've already worked with so we now have the digital collateral to engage with more business and increase the reach of what we're trying to do.\" \nOn Do it Day, the team took all of the case study data and findings from BITC's work across the UK and created the curriculum and website, which will be used when the High Schools open next year. Eating Better Alliance \nThe Eating Better Alliance set the beefy brief of persuading men to eat less meat using a social media led campaign. During The Drum’s Do It Day, the brand initiated its veggie crusade by putting to the public the intriguing question: “Are you VegCurious?” \nSix out of 10 men eat more than the government’s recommended 70g of red and processed meat a day. To reduce consumption, VegCurious [definition: exhibiting an above average curiosity and inquisitiveness about vegetables] was a tagline conceived to help young men eat less meat by proposing vegetables as a more than worthy replacement. \nAdvancing the Plan It Day brief, personalised creative featuring mascot VegCurious Reg engaged with brands and individuals on social media to encourage discourse. \nThis was amplified with ad space donated by Clear Channel on the Piccadilly Circus, the Guardian and Scottish broadcaster STV’s network. \nAdditionally, chef Bruno Loubet spearheaded the efforts by sharing some of his favourite veggie dishes, directing viewers to a specially built website with recipes and lifestyle aids. ClientEarth \nClientEarth, a charity of activist lawyers, wanted to cut through the smog of disinformation to mobilise Londoners to help minimise 10,000 early deaths caused by air pollution in the city each year. \nKicking off its public awareness drive, ClientEarth’s advertising fundraiser drive deliberately targeted both the most polluted city in the UK (London) and in Scotland (Glasgow) using free digital space donated by Clear Channel. \nPrint media also played a vital role, with creative conceived during Plan It Day featuring in the Evening Standard and the Guardian as the charity sought donations to fund its battle against the government to enforce clean air legislation. \nDeviating from briefs issued on Plan It Day, the brand took inspiration from the wellspring of creative input on the day and taking the opportunity to shoot an awareness-raising ad. \nSimon Alcock, ClientEarth communications and public affairs manager, told The Drum: “We’ve really enjoyed working with the creative industries, people with different skills, I hope they come back to Do It Day, you can only change the world when you come together and demand it.” The Drum Network: Create Britain \nThe Drum Network launched Create Britain on Do It Day, to encourage creative investors and talent alike to continue looking towards the UK as a creative, thriving hub in which to invest in. \nCreate Britain is a digital interactive map on which agencies can claim their pin, by submitting a short video on what they believe makes British creativity so brilliant. \nOn Do It Day, the team split to focus on two crucial paths for Create Britain. One team focused on encouraging agencies to claim their pin to drive them to the site. This involved a social campaign and reaching out to agency networks to spread the word. \nThe other group focused on engaging with potential clients to drive them to the Create Britain website to see what the UK’s creative industry has to offer. As part of the legacy of the campaign, an inspirational video series will be created which will feature collaborations between great British creatives, for example in fashion, music and art. There will also be monthly interviews which will explore the possibilities of collaboration which will then link to agency pins for investors to look at. Dixons Carphone with Undercurrent \nImagine a world where connectivity isn't taken for granted, and where getting access to the internet could mean the difference between life and death. \nThat's the message Dixons Carphone was trying to address via its initiative to bring connectivity to remote townships in South Africa, partnering with BluPoint, a solar-powered pop-up intranet platform which brings connectivity to remote areas. \nAlong with experiential agency Undercurrent, the challenge the trio took to Plan It Day was to create a campaign to promote information sharing between the UK and South Africa. \nThe winning strategy took the two-pronged approach of creating a 90-second ad filmed exclusively in 360 video, accompanied by a social media marketing campaign to amplify the film's message. \nWith some filming taking place on location in South Africa prior to Do It Day, the rest of the video was produced on the day, with one half of the team charged with filming around London over the course of the morning to highlight the contrast between connectivity in the UK and South Africa. \nMeanwhile, the group's planners set about ensuring a tight approach to the media plan to activate the film with a social media campaign featuring the hashtag #AfriCAN. The team also had a tight timeframe in which to write and record the ad's voice-over script. \n\"Here in the UK, internet is seen as a utility after electricity, gas and water, but there's a huge proportion of the world who aren't connected,\" said Damien Clarke, Undercurrent founder and chief executive. \"We were trying to put together a piece of work that shows the juxtaposition of how people consume internet and content in the UK versus Africa.\" Bulletproof and Vital (Do It Day Fringe event) \nWiping out child poverty in India is no mean feat, but that’s exactly what brand and packaging design agency Bulletproof along with charity Vital aimed to kickstart on Do It Day. \nWorking as part of The Drum’s Do It Day Fringe event, the pair wanted to raise awareness of the urgent issue in the country as well as bring on corporate sponsors to help fund education, health services, counselling and shelters for children living in slums. Having already refreshed the Vital website to give it a more cohesive and professional tone of voice, which is due to launch at the end of the month. \nBulletproof worked with Vital on the day to share tips and help them stream line their social media channels. They also announced a new corporate sponsor document to better explain this small, but important charity that is run singlehandedly by founder Yvonne Nueman, and recruit bigger sponsors to sustain its work long-term. xAd \nThe xAd team wanted to utilise its ad tech to identify brands that could redirect their waste food to the homeless. \nUsing Do It Day to pilot its ad technology, the company accumulated food across London which it used to feed around 200 homeless people. \nThe pilot gave the brand time to test the real-world benefits its in-store tech can provide (capable of measuring consumer footfall and calculating extra food and more). \nDaniel Warner, supply and data director at xAd, explained that xAd shared The Drum's belief in the application of marketing to improve the world. \nBy creating partnerships with notable food outlets and charities, the company fully realised the philanthropic potential of its technology. \nWith a soon to be announced wider application of the scheme, xAd hopes to drive efficiency for food redistribution charities in an era where food outlets strive to help the needy and reduce waste. \nxAd \nAt Do It Day New York xAd challenged its team to co-create a location-based platform called Embrella that would anonymously connect domestic abuse victims with local women in their area who are willing to help. \nThe aim of the campaign was to encourage members of the public to ‘take a stand against domestic violence’. The execution saw participants encourage passersby in Times Square, New York to pose with a pink umbrella and then take the pledge to support the campaign on camera. \nThe resulting content was then to be shared on the scheme’s various social profiles, with the team able to achieve over 150 shares within an hour of campaigning. \nJulie Sharma, charity ambassador, xAd, told the Drum that participation helped it achieve its business goal of ‘helping people to a better place’, adding that the unique setting allowed participants to implement steps towards these goals in an environment that encourages them to see concept-planning through to the point of execution. Ad Council \nAt Do It Day, the Ad Council- which is celebrating its 75th birthday next year - tasked its team to create a campaign or initiative that will raise awareness of the nonprofit among young professionals who are just now getting their start in advertising so it can continue to create impactful campaigns for the next 75 years. \nThe team came up with a socially-driven campaign called “#HereForGood.” Starting on January 1 of next year, the team plans to share an iconic Ad Council campaign on social media once a week using the hashtag ‘#HereForGood’ until the nonprofit’s 75th birthday on February 18. The team plans to partner with social influencers and potentially celebrities to help spread the message. In addition, the team plans to help the Ad Council throw a networking birthday bash that will give young professionals the chance to mingle with some of the most influential people in the advertising industry. The Doe Fund \nThe Doe Fund’s Ready Willing & Able program, which helps formerly homeless and incarcerated men rebuild their lives through transitional work, started in New York City 25 years ago and has been replicated in cities including Philadelphia since its founding. The nonprofit is hoping to expand the program to other cities across the US, and at Do It Day, it tasked its team to create something that will not only grab the attention of mayors across the country but also help them realize the positive impact that Ready Willing & Able could have on their city. \nThe team ended up creating a simple series of graphics that illustrate how Florida could potentially benefit from Ready Willing & Able. Basing their projections off of troves of data from New York’s Ready Willing & Able program, the graphics use measures like budgetary savings, crime reduction and poverty rate to show that Florida could reduce their annual spend on criminal justice by $400m if the program were to be implemented. The Doe Fund hopes to eventually make similar graphics for all 50 states and unite them under an overarching campaign called ‘State of Tomorrow.’",

This device utilizes a Plug-and-Play concept, and can be integrated into intra-satellite networks, supporting SpaceWire and Gigabit Ethernet I/O. A space-qualified, 100-pin package also was developed, allowing space-qualified (class K) transponders to be delivered within a six-month time frame. The novel, optical, radiation-tolerant transponder was implemented as a standalone board, containing the transponder ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) and optical module, with an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) friendly parallel interface. It features improved radiation tolerance; high-data-rate, low-power consumption; and advanced functionality. The transponder utilizes a patented current mode logic library of radiation-hardened-by-architecture cells. The transponder was developed, fabricated, and radhard tested up to 1 MRad. It was fabricated using 90-nm CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) 9 SF process from IBM, and incorporates full BIT circuitry, allowing a loop back test. The low-speed parallel LVCMOS (lowvoltage complementary metal oxide semiconductor) bus is compatible with Actel FPGA. The output LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling) interface operates up to 1.5 Gb/s. Built-in CDR (clock-data recovery) circuitry provides robust synchronization and incorporates two alarm signals such as synch loss and signal loss. The ultra-linear peak detector scheme allows on-line control of the amplitude of the input signal. Power consumption is less than 300 mW. The developed transponder with a 1.25 Gb/s serial data rate incorporates a 10-to-1 serializer with an internal clock multiplication unit and a 10-1 deserializer with internal clock and data recovery block, which can operate with 8B10B encoded signals. Three loop-back test modes are provided to facilitate the built-in-test functionality. The design is based on a proprietary library of differential current switching logic cells implemented in the standard 90-nm CMOS 9SF technology from IBM. The proprietary low-power LVDS physical interface is fully compatible with the SpaceWire standard, and can be directly connected to the SFP MSA (small form factor pluggable Multiple Source Agreement) optical transponder. The low-speed parallel interfaces are fully compatible with the standard 1.8 V CMOS input/output devices. The utilized proprietary annular CMOS layout structures provide TID tolerance above 1.2 MRad. The complete chip consumes less than 150 mW of power from a single 1.8-V positive supply source.",

      "text": "Tencent wins big data race with OpenPOWER November 10, 2016 | Written by: Ken King \nCategorized: OpenPOWER | Power Systems | Servers - Power \nTo most people, the words “Daytona” and “Indy” evoke the need for speed. These are global events that feature drivers and teams from around the world, where legends are made on the track. But what if I told you that the latest Indy and Daytona record holder had no wheels, no drivers, and didn’t move for the whole race? \nSounds unbelievable, but I’m not talking about a competition to determine the fastest race car, I am referring to the recent announcement that Tencent, one of the largest internet service providers with more than one billion users worldwide, recently set four new records in the Daytona and Indy categories of the GraySort and MinuteSort benchmark competition . Bringing Big Data to the Race Track \nSince 1987, the Sort Benchmark competition has been considered the gold standard for measuring the speed, scalability and efficiency of general-purpose distributed computing systems. Specifically, GraySort establishes a benchmark for sorting at least 100 TB of data, while MinuteSort sets the standard for how much data can be sorted in one minute. \nAs a world leader in the provision of integrated internet services that allow people to communicate, share experiences, consume information and seek entertainment, Tencent is enriching the lives of hundreds of millions of internet users and playing a central role in China’s innovation-driven development. Their work with OpenPOWER in establishing a new Sort Benchmark world record puts us at the starting line of a collaborative effort to continuously improve real-time data handling performance for our many customers around the globe. \n“In the future, the ability to manage big data will be the foundation of successful Internet businesses,” said Zeus Jiang, Vice President of Tencent Cloud and General manager of Tencent’s Data Platform Department. “Tencent Cloud can provide precise high performance computing to enterprises using minimal time and resources. We will continue to improve the backend technology for our cloud service by optimizing architecture, software and hardware to help global enterprises solve complex business challenges by leveraging hyper-scale computing platforms.” Beating 2015’s best overall winner by over five times while using 85 percent fewer nodes! \nLike any successful racing team, they knew that their “race car” had to be built with collaborative innovation from organizations all over the world, so they turned to IBM and the OpenPOWER Foundation . Built on a server platform that is not only incredibly fast but also open for development, their engineers were able to optimize their cluster of systems to take advantage of a variety of speed and efficiency breakthroughs delivered by the rapidly expanding OpenPOWER ecosystem. \nUsing OpenPOWER-based systems for the first time, Tencent Cloud and Tencent’s Data Platform Department, set the Daytona GraySort record with 44.8 TB per minute and the Daytona MinuteSort record with 37 TB per minute. In the Indy GraySort category, Tencent set a new record of 60.7 TB per minute and a new Indy MinuteSort record of 55 TB per minute. These new results improve last year’s competition-best overall results by two to five times. \nTencent Cloud used 512 IBM OpenPOWER servers and Mellanox’s 100Gb interconnect technology . The POWER8 processor was built from the ground up for big data, a critical attribute in this benchmarking contest and in the new era of hyperscale computing. The flexibility of OpenPOWER-based technology allowed Tencent’s highly skilled engineers to obtain maximum performance while also cutting down on power consumption. This clearly demonstrates the superior capabilities of the collaboratively built, unique innovation and servers from the OpenPOWER Foundation community which enabled performance far above that of commodity x86-based processors and servers. \nLearn more about the technology behind this new win at the IBM HPC on Power homepage and see the power of collaborative innovation in action.

      "text": "It is essentially the data bus of IBM’s Power processor line: the Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface. It became necessary as the accelerator industry expanded way beyond just making the CPU faster. Over a decade ago, the graphics processor industry, led at the time by Nvidia, opened up a route for parallel processing in ordinary x86 boxes, with functionality way beyond the shading of triangles in 3D space.\nSuddenly — or more accurately, from an historical vantage point, once again — hardware could be programmed to assist software, making it orders of magnitude faster. Now with the once inexorable path of Moore’s Law having collided with a solid wall erected by the laws of physics, the path forward for CPU makers such as IBM and Intel is to leverage the workload acceleration capability of FPGA chips.\nThey can’t accelerate everything, but FPGAs can be programmed to expedite a surprisingly large number of common workloads. Intel bet its future on the technology last year, spending $16.7 billion to acquire Altera .\nFor IBM to compete, it has to open up its intellectual property base even further, to build software ecosystem-like activity around the very core of its hardware. But as IBM has learned more than once , calling something “open” and sending out invitations doesn’t mean people show up to the party.\nRaise your hand if you remember Micro Channel Architecture.\n“CAPI needs to be open, because it’s a spec dealing with actual electrical signals and bus protocols that will be baked into hardware for several product generations,” explained Marko Insights principal analyst Kurt Marko, in a message to Data Center Knowledge. “As a physical hardware spec, details can’t be abstracted away in a virtual layer or API, but must be precisely followed by products expecting to work with other CAPI-compliant devices.”\nIf an FPGA industry is to grow and thrive, it needs a set of standards its members can apply themselves to, as opposed to having those specs dictated to them from a megaphone. It’s the need for a level playing field that brought competitors HPE and Dell EMC, AMD and Nvidia, together with Mellanox and Xilinx to form the OpenCAPI Consortium . The institution was announced last October 14, and Thursday, the IEEE announced it was being enrolled as its latest federation program member.\nThat membership gives the group the clearance it needs to advance OpenCAPI as an international standard, through the Industry Standards and Technology Organization.\n“OpenCAPI will offer its first bus architecture specification,” read a statement Thursday from the IEEE, “that will provide an open, architecture agnostic, high performance pathway between the microprocessor and different types of technology — advanced memory, accelerators, networking and storage — to more tightly integrate their functions within servers. This data-centric approach to server design, which puts the compute power closer to the data, removes inefficiencies in traditional system architectures to help eliminate system bottlenecks and significantly improve server performance.”\nMarko helped correct a common misprint about OpenCAPI’s data rate: With 8 lanes of serial data at 25 GHz, the data rate is 25 gigabytes per second, not gigabits . In his communication with us, he acknowledged that IBM’s original CAPI started out proprietary. But in the modern hardware market, he stated, “most hardware specs are open to contributions from any stakeholder, since the inventor realizes that the best way to industry acceptance is through cooperation. Few vendors outside Apple (see Lightning) can force a hardware interface through on sheer market dominance.\n“Historically, many proposals were submitted to the IEEE,” continued Marko. “But lately, ad hoc industry consortia like the USB-IF and the PCI-SIG have proven to be more nimble and responsive to technological change. I see IBM trying to do something similar with CAPI. If other silicon vendors adopt it and you see, for example, ARM server SoCs with CAPI interfaces, then you’ll know it’s working.”",

      "text": "siliconangle.com ^ | Nov 9, 2016 | Mike Wheatley \nPosted on 11/11/2016 8:24:04 AM PST by Ernest_at_the_Beach \nIBM Corp. is beefing up its cognitive computing efforts with the launch of a new system-agnostic platform called Project Intu thats designed to enable what it calls embodied cognition in a range of devices. \nIn IBMs parlance, cognitive computing refers to machine learning. The idea behind Project Intu is that developers will be able to use the platform to embed the various machine learning functions offered by IBMs Watson service into various applications and devices, and make them work across a wide spectrum of form factors. \nSo, for example, developers will be able to use Project Intus capabilities to embed machine learning capabilities into pretty much any kind of device, from avatars to drones to robots and just about any other kind of Internet of Things device. As a result, these devices will be able to interact more naturally with users via a range of emotions and behaviors, leading to more meaningful and immersive experiences for users, IBM said. \nOne of the best examples of where Project Intu might be able to help out developers is in the area of conversation, language and visual recognition. Here, developers can integrate Watsons abilities with a devices capabilities to effectively act out interactions with users. So, rather than the developer having to program each device or avatars individual movements, Project Intu does it for them, combining movements that are appropriate for the specific task the device or avatar is performing, such as greeting a visitor at a hotel, or helping out a customer in a retail store. \nIBM is taking cognitive technology beyond a physical technology interface like a smartphone or a robot toward an even more natural form of human and machine interaction, said Rob High, an IBM Fellow, and vice president and chief technology officer of Watson. Project Intu allows users to build embodied systems that reason, learn and interact with humans to create a presence with the people that use them  these cognitive-enabled avatars and devices could transform industries like retail, elder care, and industrial and social robotics. KEYWORDS: hitech Help keep FR independent, ad-free and not covered with pop-ups.

      "text": "  2 OF 3 Trump’s Job Loss Claims Could Roil Waters for IBM and Its Tech Peers   How the Trump presidency could rattle IBM International Business Machines ( IBM ) and other US companies that have been outsourcing jobs to low-cost countries face an uncertain future as Donald Trump takes office on January 20, 2017. Just as he stated during his final campaign weekend, the now President-elect added IBM to the list of companies he has singled out as depriving the country of employment. Trump specifically claimed that in Minnesota, IBM retrenched 500 workers and moved their jobs to India ( INDA ) ( EPI ) and “various other countries.” IBM quickly dismissed Trump’s claims, but the message of job losses due to globalization clearly resonated with Trump’s campaign audiences. In the 1990s, IBM employed more than 18,000 people at its campus complex in Rochester, Minnesota. However, employment at the facility has dwindled as IBM began to outsource jobs to Mexico and other countries to save costs and improve earnings. Potential threat to Tesla’s acquisition in Germany Although Trump singled out IBM among American technology companies giving away jobs at the expense of American citizens, his aggressive employment policies have rattled Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) as well. Apple outsources the production of its iPhones to China where labor is cheap, allowing the company to enjoy higher margins on sales. Tesla’s ( TSLA ) acquisition of Grohmann Engineering, which is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs in Germany, could also face pressure if Trump proves to be too protectionist. Outside the technology space, Trump has attacked Ford (F), among other companies, for creating an employment shortage in the country by transferring jobs to Mexico and other countries. Creating local jobs to develop overseas markets If Trump keeps his promise to keep US jobs in the country, American tech companies could see a sharp decline in their revenues and profits, as most of these companies are increasingly generating large portions of their revenues abroad. They also offer jobs to locals as a way to develop those overseas markets .

      "text": "View All Posts \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at all-time highs just two days after the election, and one of the stocks leading the way was International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ). After dipping to $151 in early trading on Wednesday, IBM stock went on to gain more than 6% through Thursday’s close. I’m sure that surprised more than a few investors after IBM’s earnings a little over three weeks ago. Source: Open Grid Scheduler Via Flickr \nThe company reported third-quarter results on Oct. 17, surprising the Street with better-than-expected numbers on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue of $19.23 billion bested estimates of $19 billion, and while adjusted earnings of $3.29 a share topped expectations for $3.23 a share, they were down from $3.34 a year ago. Why IBM Stock Can Keep Up \nThe quarter represented the smallest earnings-per-share decline in four years, which should have been celebrated by the market. Still, management didn’t hike guidance, maintaining previous forecasts for 2016 EPS estimates of $13.50, and the shares fell 2.5% that day as a result. \nIt’s no secret that Big Blue has been underperformed under current management, and once again it seems they couldn’t please Wall Street with its cloud business, even as it grows at a brisk pace. The report seemed to give the shorts their opening. In fact, I’ve found they feed off IBM stock every earnings report with the regularity of a crocodile at the Serengeti river migration. \nBut despite the ongoing frustrations with management, who have the means to jump start the cloud business in a more meaningful way, I continue to see amazing value in International Business Machines. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 \nIn fact, I called IBM stock out as a screaming buy after earnings and look where it is now. After trading between $150 and $154 for the latter part of October, the shares took off with the market in the days leading up to and following the election. They’re International Business Machines is just 3% from its 52-week high. \nClick to Enlarge \nI also like that IBM stock is back above the 200-day moving average (the blue line), which had been acting as resistance since a pullback in September. \nGoing forward, one of IBM’s main focal points will be the Internet of Things, which is a market that’s expected to triple over the next four years. \nInternational Business Machines is establishing itself as a leader, and it’s also making a huge bet on Watson (the artificial intelligence platform) to be more than just a pretty good Jeopardy player and to become a major force in “cognitive computing” as well as the cloud space. \nIt all comes back to management, and I think the company now understands it needs to step on the pedal in remaking this tech giant. I believe they can do it, and while we hang on for the IBM stock ride we get to collect a nice 3.5% dividend. \nCurious what Wall Street insider Charles Payne really thinks?

      "title": "IBM OPENPower Servers Win Tencent Challenge",
      "text": "IBM OPENPower Servers Win Tencent Challenge The IBM servers set new world records on big data benchmarks. More Articles » \nVender benchmarks have long been thought a waste of time — largely because of the inherent bias a vendor has in testing its own stuff. When only one outcome is acceptable, it should be no surprise that the vendor’s product always wins a vendor’s competitive test. I often wonder why they bother. \nHowever, customer benchmarks are generally valid — largely because a customer is going to fund the result, and a biased benchmark will result in a bad decision. That will likely result in the poor sap who did the benchmark being reassigned, probably to unemployment. \nThis is why the Tencent benchmark of IBM OpenPOWER servers was important. Not only did it showcase what appears to be a significant OpenPOWER advantage, but because it is from a customer and not IBM , this advantage should be reliable. \nLet’s talk about why this Tencent benchmark bodes wells for IBM. Cloud Loads Are Unique \nOne of the fascinating things we don’t talk about in the current market is that servers, like all technology, have been evolving primarily for on-promise workloads. While there certainly have been hosting companies for a long time, they never reached the kind of scale and influence that cloud providers now have. Cloud providers not only now consume massive numbers of servers, their needs are actually very different because they make even the largest and most dense traditional deployment look tiny by comparison. \nAnd this isn’t the only difference. The level of flexibility that cloud providers must have is unprecedented. They have to be able to move workloads of all sizes, from individual loads that might typically run on workstations and PCs, to massive analytics projects that could overwhelm most mid-market and some enterprise data centers. \nFinally, they have to achieve massive economies of scale because, unlike on-premise deployments, cloud customers can generally move their projects from vendor to vendor far more quickly and easily. This creates a near laser-like focus on cost because price is king. If cost gets out of line, the cloud provider will either lose the customer as they try to maintain margin or drop into the red as they try to keep the customer. Neither path is acceptable. General Purpose Servers Can’t Do It \nA couple of cloud providers concluded that their flexibility requirements would largely drive them towards generic servers that they could define themselves. A couple of the largest providers went that direction. This made sense as long as loads were mostly individual. Once enterprises started to place massive analytics loads on these same services, it became clear to some of the providers that a generic approach to servers, while still valid for many of their high volume small loads, didn’t scale up cost effectively. \nAs large loads scaled, a need for more specialized servers emerged. This opened the door for IBM OpenPOWER to apply their unique technology and for partners like Mellanox to develop solutions that were capable of outperforming their generic counterparts on targeted loads. \nMuch like you need different equipment and tools for different jobs, so too does the modern cloud provider need different kinds of servers to cost effectively handle their massive load diversity. This shouldn’t have been a surprise, and it suggests we will be getting more, not less, diversity within cloud providers going forward. \nOften, as a market requirement matures, the products needed to address that requirement have to evolve and diversify. The cloud is no different. \nWhile a generic approach initially both made sense and was viable, as this market has matured, it has become clear that more specialized tools were needed — particularly at scale. IBM’s OpenPOWER has stepped into that opportunity and, based on these benchmarks, appears to have found a unique opportunity. The big story is the emergence of both the need and the related solutions for technology diversity in the cloud. \nPhoto courtesy of Shutterstock .",

      "text": "IBM, Mellanox, Tencent Team Breaks Sorting Speed Records \nEach year, global companies and academic institutions participate in the contest to evaluate the capability of their software and hardware system architectures. Speed, especially in NASCAR and IT events, makes news. On Nov. 10, server-maker IBM, high-performance networking provider Mellanox and China-based Tencent Cloud made their own IT speed news when a cloud solution they put together was named winner of the Sort Benchmark annual global computing competition for 2016. Tencent Cloud and the Big Data Collaboration team spent less than 99 seconds (98.8 seconds) finishing sorting 100 terabytes of data in the Indy GraySort category, improving upon 2015's best result--329 seconds--by a factor of 3.3. Each year, global companies and academic institutions participate in the contest, conducted by non-profit Sortbenchmark.org , to evaluate the capability of their software and hardware system architectures, as well as their research results. Tencent Cloud participated in two of the four competition categories, GraySort and MinuteSort, to benchmark the architecture capabilities and computing efficiencies of large distributed computing systems and real time data analytics. The GraySort and MinuteSort benchmarks are each measured in two subcategories: Indy (special purpose sort) and Daytona (general purpose sort). Dominant in Each Category Tencent Cloud Data Intelligence--the distributed computing platform of Tencent Cloud--won each category in both the GraySort and MinuteSort benchmarks, establishing four new records with its performance, outperforming 2015's best speeds by two to five times.\"In the future, the ability to manage big data will be the foundation of successful internet businesses,\" said Zeus Jiang, Vice President of Tencent Cloud and General Manager of Tencent's Data Platform Department. \"Tencent Cloud can provide precise high-performance computing to enterprises using minimal time and resources. We will continue to improve the back-end technology for our cloud service by optimizing architecture, software and hardware to help global enterprises solve complex business challenges by leveraging hyper-scale computing platforms.\" As a non-profit organization, Sortbenchmark.org uses the basic sort computing method to evaluate distributed system software architectural capabilities such as storage, task scheduling, node communication and data exchange. It also evaluates hardware architectural capabilities, including server selection and match, network architecture optimization, and the ability to build Internet Data Centers. Solution Used IBM POWER Servers, Mellanox 100Gb Connectivity The ultimate test is on the comprehensive capabilities of large-scale computing of a company or an organization. In this sort contest, Tencent Cloud used 512 IBM OpenPOWER servers and Mellanox' 100Gb interconnect technology, improving the performance of Tencent Cloud big data products with the infrastructure. \"Tencent is helping IBM and our OpenPOWER partners push performance boundaries for a cognitive era defined by big data and advanced analytics,\" said Tom Rosamilia, Senior Vice President of IBM Systems. \"The computing record achieved by Tencent Cloud on OpenPOWER is an important milestone for the industry.\" Real time-analytics and big data environments are extremely demanding and the network is critical in linking together the extra high performance IBM POWER based servers and Tencent Cloud's massive amounts of data, said Amir Prescher, SeniorVice President, Business Development, at Mellanox Technologies. \"Tencent Cloud developed an optimized hardware/software platform to achieve new computing records, showing that Mellanox's 100Gb/s Ethernet technology can deliver total infrastructure efficiency and improves application performance, making them ideal for Big Data applications,\" Prescher said. 2016 Sort Benchmark Contest Results (improvement) Daytona GraySort: 44.8 TB/min (old record: 15.9 TB/min; 2.8X greater performance) Indy GraySort: 60.7 TB/min (old record: 18.2 TB/min; 3.3X greater performance) Daytona MinuteSort: 37 TB/min (old record: 7.7 TB/min; 4.8X greater performance) Indy MinuteSort: 55 TB/min (old record: 11 TB/min; 5X greater performance) \nChris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK.

      "text": "The Dow gained substantially during a week dominated by the U.S. presidential election. Initially, investors were buoyed by news that the FBI was sticking to its earlier recommendation on Hillary Clinton’s personal emails. Initially, investors reacted unfavorably to Donald Trump’s surprise victory. However, markets ultimately came to terms with this verdict and gained following expectations of a more favorable business environment.\nLast Week’s Performance \nThe Dow decreased 0.2% on Friday as investors fretted over the results of the presidential elections. Such concerns compelled them to remain on the sidelines or park investments in risk-averse assets such as gold and short-term duration bonds. Director James Comey told lawmakers on Sunday that no charges would be brought against Hillary Clinton after the new email review.\nThe latest opinion polls on Sunday, before news broke of the FBI announcement, gave Clinton a meager four to five-point lead over Republican candidate Donald Trump. The U.S. economy added 161,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.9% from 5%.\nThe index declined 1.5% over last week. While uncertainty over the upcoming presidential election dragged the major indexes lower, the Federal Reserve’s indication that it may hike rates in December weighed on investors’ sentiment. Facebook, Inc.’s ( FB - Free Report ) warning that it’s potential for ad revenues will start slowing soon also adversely impacted investors’ confidence.\nThe Dow   This   Week \nThe index advanced 2.1% on Monday after the FBI said that it would not press criminal charges against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Financial markets in general believed that a Clinton win was the better outcome in the presidential election, as it presents more stability for markets than a Trump presidency. The Dow reclaimed the key 18,000 level, posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since March.\nThe FBI said that no new evidence was found to warrant charges against Clinton, a sign of relief among investors who see the chances of a Trump presidency failing. While a number of polls and prognosticators indicated Clinton was ahead of Trump, one indicator bucked the trend. Per the S&P 500, Trump had an 86% chance of winning the election.\nThe index gained 0.4% on Tuesday as investors eagerly awaited the results of a closely fought presidential election. Investors were betting on a victory for Hillary Clinton, as it represents more stability for markets than a Trump presidency. Trump’s stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration are less certain.\nAccording to the final Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, Clinton had a whopping 90% chance of making it to the White House. The Real Clear Politics Average of national polls also showed Clinton leading Trump by 2.2%, a much slimmer margin. Meanwhile, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal gave a point lead to Clinton over Trump. The Washington Post/ABC tracking poll had also awarded Clinton with a five-point lead.\nThe index advanced 0.4% on Wednesday as investors embraced the election of Republican Donald Trump as the president of the United States. Stocks made a dramatic turnaround from deep overnight losses as investors snapped up infrastructure, healthcare and financial stocks, while they dumped safe-haven assets including bonds.\nTrump’s willingness to spend more on America’s roads and bridges boosted construction stocks, while his promise to repeal Obamacare and free up cash currently held overseas for tax reasons helped biotech stocks gain traction. A forthcoming bonanza of deregulation and tax cuts had a positive impact on financials.\nThe index gained 1.2% on Thursday as investors scooped up shares of large banks. The U.S. banking sector soared to levels not seen since the midst of 2008 financial crisis. A possible move towards lighter regulation and increase in fiscal spending helped banks gain traction. \nPharmaceutical stocks also gained on the prospect that a Trump administration will be less restrictive on drug pricing than Clinton. However, some of the world’s largest tech companies tanked as investors continue to adjust for Trump’s upset victory in the presidential election.\nComponents Moving the Index \nChevron Corporation ( CVX - Free Report ) , the second-largest U.S. oil producer, yielded first gas from Alder field – a gas condensate field in the Central North Sea. The Alder project is an initiative by Chevron North Sea Limited and leading integrated energy player ConocoPhillips ( COP - Free Report ) . Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Chevron's subsidiary – Chevron North Sea – is the operator of the field with a 73.7% interest in the project. The remaining 26.3% is held by ConocoPhillips.\nThe field is forecast to have a capacity of 110 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 14,000 barrels per day of liquid condensate. All the production from this field – located about 100 miles off of Scotland – will be sent to the ConocoPhillips operated Britannia platform via a 17 mile pipeline. (Read: Chevron Corporation ( CVX - Free Report ) Produces First Gas from Alder )\nIntel Corporation ( INTC - Free Report ) has reportedly purchased Voke, a privately held virtual reality (VR) startup that offers personalized and immersive viewing experiences of live events. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Intel has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nVoke’s TrueVR is a real-time, end-to-end technology platform that offers high quality 360 VR experience in full stereoscopic 3D video captured with a special stereoscopic camera. This technology is a step ahead of virtual reality that puts users in a virtual space.\nThe platform is compatible with a range of devices such as PCs, smartphones, tablets and VR headsets and is offered through various distribution channels and apps. Voke is likely to be absorbed into Intel Sports Group. (Read:  Intel ( INTC - Free Report ) Eyes Immersive Sports with Voke Acquisition )\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM - Free Report ) announced that it is about to stop offering fee-based retirement accounts to its clients. This is in compliance with the U.S. Labor Departments’ new fiduciary rule, to come into effect from April next year.\nPer the new rule, all financial advisors are required to act as fiduciaries to their clients while giving investment advice, and managing their client’s retirement accounts.\nIt aims to bridge the gap between brokers and Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). Earlier, only RIAs acted as fiduciaries to their clients. Brokers only acted as middlemen, providing education to their clients regarding their investments, but not advice. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. \nVisa Inc. ’s ( V - Free Report ) wholly-owned subsidiary CyberSource, recently joined forces with Joint Electronic Teller Services Limited (\"JETCO\") to establish the most comprehensive payment gateway services for residents in Hong Kong. Visa has a Zacks Rank #3.\nAlongside individual customers, businesses and merchants of Hong Kong would largely benefit from this partnership as it ensures more convenience, ease and better choice in payment solutions. The financial institutions in Hong Kong and Macau that intend to expand their merchant acquiring businesses for online merchants would also gain from the alliance as it extends the latest popular payment options such as Visa Checkout and in-app purchase. (Read: Visa ( V - Free Report ) Unit Joins Forces with JETCO to Boost eCommerce )\nIBM Corporation ( IBM - Free Report ) has partnered with Topcoder, a global software development community to make its Watson and IBM Cloud services available to more than one million of technology and design experts included in the Topcoder community. IBM has a Zacks Rank #3.\nTopcoder conducts online competitive programming competitions called “single round matches” or SRMs fortnightly as well as weekly graphic design and development competitions.\nWith the partnership, participants of Topcoder-run hackathons and coding competitions can use Watson services such as Sentiment Analysis, Conversation and Speech Application Program Interfaces (API) to develop powerful artificial intelligence and cognitive computing tools.

It is being widely expected that Trump’s presidency will be more business friendly. Regulations are likely to be loosened and new avenues of growth are likely to open up.\nOn the other hand, it is likely that certain companies, especially those in the manufacturing sector with overseas operations could bear the brunt of new policies. New policy announcements and expectations surrounding the same will determine market movements in the days ahead.\nNow See Our Private Investment Ideas \nWhile the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

      "text": "DevOps 101: The Essentials of Creating Diverse Applications –IBM \nBizDevOps, also known as DevOps 2.0, is an approach to software development that encourages developers, operations staff and business teams to work together so the organization can develop software more quickly, be more responsive to user demand and ultimately maximize revenue.   The Benefits of a DevOps Approach \nBringing development and IT ops together can help you address many app deployment challenges. Our expert guide highlights the benefits of a DevOps approach. Explore how you can successfully integrate your teams to improve collaboration, streamline testing, and more.   \nIn the past, development teams, operations teams and business management teams operated in silos. The development team created code, the operations team managed the code after it was released and the management team reviewed data for the business’ key performance indicators ( KPIs ) and set requirements for future development projects. A BizDevOps approach knocks down the silo walls and fundamentally changes the way software is developed. In this approach, not only does the business team set requirements, they also work directly with developers to set priorities for agile software development sprints and backlogs. They become partners with the business-side and work with managers to solve problems and achieve business goals. \nOne of the technologies driving the BizDevOps movement is real-time analytics . Using application performance monitoring tools, as well as analytics tools, companies are now able to get data about application performance and end-user behavior instantly and quantify how well it supports the business’ KPIs. It had not been possible to track this level of granular information before; now the business objectives can drive and guide application development and deployment down to the smallest feature. \nThe immediacy of the data is also allowing changes in applications to be made quickly and releases to be made more frequently. In some cases, this approach will lead to increased automation, especially in testing and quality assurance ( QA ). The need for speed is also likely to automate some areas of routine code development as well, providing developers with time to experiment with innovative ways to support business objectives in an increasingly agile manner. The speed and flexibility that BizDevOps allows – and even encourages -- BizDevOps teams the ability to identify mistakes quickly and fix them right away, a concept known as “fail fast.” \nIn some organizations, a BizDevOps team may also include security and/or compliance management team members as well as representatives from testing and quality assurance teams. To avoid an ungainly name like BizDevSecComQaOps, however, the label digital BizDevOps or sometimes just BizOps is used to represent the concept of having an organization’s business team work directly with members of the organization’s IT department. It is important to note, however, that BizOps can also have a narrower, non-technical meaning and simply stand for “business operations” or “business opportunity.” This was last updated in November 2016 Continue Reading About BizDevOps (Business, Development and Operations)",

      "text": "Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. IBM Cognitive Bank. IBM \nCustomer service in banking is hard. Take a look at any bank’s Facebook or Twitter account and complaints heavily outnumber compliments. Westpac, one of Australia’s largest banks is a good example. Every day, Westpac faces a barrage of complaints on Facebook and Twitter . \nWestpac is trying to address the problem by changing incentives for branch staff to be based on customer feedback. The trouble with this is that it relies on customers taking the time to go online and make a complaint or send a compliment. Most will simply just complain to their friends and family or just avoid using branches as much as possible. \nThe inherent problem with these types of jobs is that they require staff to be aware of a great deal of information about the bank’s regulations and processes and to be able to fit that to each customer’s unique circumstances and requirements. Add to that each individual’s motivation to actually be customer focused rather than optimising their own, or the banks’ needs, and you get the hit-or-miss quality of service that you will encounter at any given branch. Judging by feedback on social media (and personal experience), the banks are falling short of keeping all staff properly trained and consistently delivering customers with a great experience. \nThis is where a service like IBM’s Watson could make a radical difference in the quality and accuracy of customer service. Watson is an implementation of what IBM calls cognitive computing. This is a collection of technologies that include speech, video and text recognition coupled with analytics, machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques. \nWatson can take all of a bank’s rules and regulations and data about customer’s requirements and behaviours and provide an intelligent interface for customers to get things done with the confidence that Watson understood what the customer wanted and also understood what the bank could provide to satisfy those requirements. \nThe ideal situation would be that bank tellers could be guided by a service like Watson with the ability to provide a human face to the interaction with a customer. However, for most customers, being able to carry out transactions online, or through an app, without having to go into a branch would be even better. IBM Watson could certainly drive that type of interaction, free of human involvement. \nNot surprisingly however, banks worldwide are not investing in innovations like cognitive computing. Innovation is often lumped in the general IT budget and often forms a tiny part of that spend. By viewing it in the same category as buying computers or complying with regulatory requirements, the overall value and benefit is much harder to see. \nIn the US, Citigroup has been the most active bank to explore the use of Watson to improve customer interactions with the bank. \nANZ, one of the more innovative of Australia’s banks has been collaborating with IBM to use Watson to power a financial advice service. \nThe fact that other banks are not investing in this technology is another example of how the major banks, in Australia at least, are under little pressure to innovate or improve because there is so little real competition, combined with a business that makes large amounts of money irrespective of customers’ views. Where there is an effective cartel operating, changing behaviours relies on governments and their agencies. However, as in the case of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s investigation of banks withdrawing services to bitcoin companies over the past few years, the ACCC takes a literal view of collusion, even in the face of all banks operating in concert to achieve the same outcome. As long as they didn’t all block services at the same time, it seems that this was sufficient to show that the banks were not acting in collusion. \nSome banks are responding to the need to innovate and to deal with the ongoing perception/reality of poor customer service. In the meantime however, customers faced with poor service can simply try the approach of going to another branch in the hope that someone different will be better. Larger city branches are usually better than smaller suburban or rural ones but getting great service may simply be a matter of luck. \nOptimal selection of branches to increase the chance of good service would be an ideal research question to ask Watson.",

      "text": "svenska IBM Blockchain Helps FinTechs and Banks Address KYC Challenge Singapore FinTech Startup KYCK! to use IBM Blockchain and Bluemix to enhance the customer onboarding process in financial institutions News provided by Nov 14, 2016, 00:01   SINGAPORE , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client. Through the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding. The IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. KYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities. \"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan , Co-Founder of KYCK!. \"The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry,\" said Alan Lim , Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage, ASEAN. Blockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things. The IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix. With a total of eight Bluemix Garages globally, the Singapore Bluemix Garage is one of the latest to be added to the IBM global network, which includes locations in London , New York , Nice , Melbourne , San Francisco , Tokyo and Toronto .

      "text": "Tweet Share SINGAPORE, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client. IBM Corporation logo. More Through the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding. The IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. KYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities. \"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan, Co-Founder of KYCK!. \"The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry,\" said Alan Lim, Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage, ASEAN. Read More Blockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things. The IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix.

      "title": "MuleSoft and IBM i (AS400): A Winning Combination (But How Do I Call a PGM?) Integration",
      "text": "We can access the IBM DB2 for i data using the MuleSoft Database Connector, but as we know after 20-40 years of program-centric design, our data and processes are entwined within our programs (PGM).\nThere are at least a half-dozen methods to call a PGM on the IBM i from another tier, and they are all welcome. I would like to highlight the Young i Professionals' XMLSERVICE solution, as it offers a MuleSoft Team an intuitive XML in XML out of implementation with no PGM re-coding or the requirement of a web server.\nRequired Reading These resources will help you understand the rest of the article.\nWhat is XMLSERVICE?\nUnleash Your IBM i With XMLSERVICE\nXMLSERVICE Offers New Life for RPG Programs\nHow to connect to the IBM i using Mule Building IBM i Data API with MuleSoft Anypoint How to ease your security worries Securely connect Mule to IBM i / AS400 Note: The original goal of XMLSERVICE was flexibility over performance. Call anything IBM i, anywhere, any language. However, the project became more popular than expected, so currently, a higher speed JSON and/or XML version using a different technology for XMLSERVICE(2) is planned, and as an integration solution provider, this is what you want to read.\nMuleSoft Implementation Note: The following is an illustration, not a Mule best practice guide. It is to show you how easy it is to call a PGM via XMLSERVICE DB2 stored procedure, but in the the real world, you would look to use Maven, spring bean, templates, dataweave, exception strategies, placeholders, and even your very own DevKit Connector (watch this space!).\nThis illustration will use the XMLSERVICES demo as an example, so we aim to call an RPG program called ZZCALL via the PLUG512K stored procedure ( see here the subheading XMLSERVICE APIs).\nThis MuleSoft project can be found on GitHub here .\nStep 1 Create a new Mule Project named xmlservices.\nStep 2: Add a Subflow to the default Mule Configuration File.\nStep 3: Add a Message Properties Transformer, a Database Connector, a Set Payload Transformer, and a Logger Component to our subflow.\nStep 4 Let's deal with the Message Properties Transformer. Create a PLUG512K stored procedure and input parameters and values.\nSet Scope to invocation. Add three Flow Variables to represent the three input parameters to the stored procedure. See the Interface description here . The inputForSP_IPC value is set to #['NA']. This input parameter is ignored due to the subsequent inputForSP_CTL setting, as we are making a public connection ( see the subheading Connection public or private ). Not setting the parameter leads to the following run-time error:\n[SQL0470] Null values not allowed for parameter 1 in procedure PLUG512K in XMLSERVICE. (java.sql.SQLException). (org.mule.api.MessagingException)\nThe inputForSP_CTL value is set to #['*here'] ( again, see the subheading Connection public or private ).\nThe inputForSP_CI value is set to the example XML script under XMLSERVICE PGMs, SRVPGMs, APIs. Details about the contents and reserved words can be found here .\n<?xml version='1.0'?><script><pgm name='ZZCALL' lib='XMLSERVICE'><parm io='both'><datatype='1A'var='INCHARA'>a</data></parm><parm io='both'><datatype='1A'var='INCHARB'>b</data></parm><parm io='both'><datatype='7p4'var='INDEC1'>11.1111</data></parm><parm io='both'><datatype='12p2'var='INDEC2'>222.22</data></parm><parm io='both'><ds><datatype='1A'var='INDS1.DSCHARA'>x</data><datatype='1A'var='INDS1.DSCHARB'>y</data><datatype='7p4'var='INDS1.DSDEC1'>66.6666</data><datatype='12p2'var='INDS1.DSDEC2'> .77</data></ds></parm><return><datatype='10i0'>0</data></return></pgm></script>\nMake sure you edit the XML to point to the library where your version of ZZCALL program resides.\nStep 5: Database Connector Part 1 Create the Connector configuration by way of a Generic Database Configuration using the AS400JDBCDriver from the JTOpen project .\njdbc:as400://IPADDRESSORHOSTNAME;user=USERNAME;password=USERPASSWORD com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCDriver\nAdd the database URL which contains the endpoint (IP address and host name) and login credentials. If you have concerns around security, please see Securely Connect Mule to IBM i/AS400 .\nRemember to test the connection!\nYou will most likely get an error detailing that the driver can not be found.\nTherefore, download the IBM i DB2 JDBC driver jt400.jar from jt400.sourceforge.net and add it to project build path.\nIf you are having problems, see this MuleSoft Support Article .\nMake sure to set up Connection Pooling with the Min Pool Size set to 1.\nIf you fail to set Min Pool Size, you will get \"java.sql.SQLException: The connection does not exist.\" when materializing the CLOB. You preferably would use a Spring bean to configure a data source to give you more control over connection threads, specifically around the way the stale connections are invalidated and removed from the pool. See Dmitriy Kuznetsov's (who else!) Using Database Connector to Connect to as/400 .\nStep 6: Database Connector Part 2 Stored Procedure Operation Parametized.\n{ call XMLSERVICE.PLUG512K(:IPC,:CTL,:CI,:CO) }\nIf the stored procedure can not be found at run time you will get the following cryptic SQL exception:\nA problem occurred while trying to acquire a cached PreparedStatement in a background thread. (java.sql.SQLException).\nDownload IBM Data Studio and have a play first with the various stored procedures. As you can see here, I did not even download XMLSERVICE as a version; it comes with the one that had already been installed on my test IBM i.\nStep 7: Set Payload Transformer Lastly, we need to materialize the returned character large object ( CLOB ), which is an address of the string we want. Under debug, you will see that the returned object is com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCClobLocator , which has some interesting methods such as length() and getSubString(long, int).\n#[payload.CO.getSubString(1,payload.CO.length())]\nStep 8: Logger Dump the payload to the log.\nStep 9 Use MUnit to create a quick Test Harness so that we can trigger our subflow under debug.\nStep 10 Debug to see the fruits of your labor!\nConclusion Simple! The purpose of this article was to alert the MuleSoft community that there is an easy way to call your IBM i PGM and unlock, leverage, and protect your IBM i investment.\nAcknowledgements Dmitriy Kuznetsov of Infoview Systems .

      "text": "November 14, 2016 12:01am Comments Share: Singapore FinTech Startup KYCK! to use IBM Blockchain and Bluemix to enhance the customer onboarding process in financial institutions \nSINGAPORE , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client. \nThrough the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment. \nWorking with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding. \nThe IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. \nKYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities. \n\"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan , Co-Founder of KYCK!. \n\"The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry,\" said Alan Lim , Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage, ASEAN. \nBlockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things. \nThe IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix. With a total of eight Bluemix Garages globally, the Singapore Bluemix Garage is one of the latest to be added to the IBM global network, which includes locations in London , New York , Nice , Melbourne , San Francisco , Tokyo and Toronto . \nAbout IBM \nFor more information about IBM Blockchain, visit www.ibm.com/blockchain . \nFor more information about IBM Bluemix Garage for Blockchain, visit https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/garage.html . \nFor more information on IBM Cloud, visit https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \nAbout KYCK! \nFor more information about KYCK!, visit http://kyck.sg/ . \nMedia Contact:",

Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge.

This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. \nKYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities. \n\"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan , Co-Founder of KYCK!. \n\"The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry,\" said Alan Lim , Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage, ASEAN. \nBlockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things. \nThe IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix. With a total of eight Bluemix Garages globally, the Singapore Bluemix Garage is one of the latest to be added to the IBM global network, which includes locations in London , New York , Nice , Melbourne , San Francisco , Tokyo and Toronto . \nAbout IBM \nFor more information about IBM Blockchain, visit www.ibm.com/blockchain . \nFor more information about IBM Bluemix Garage for Blockchain, visit https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/garage.html . \nFor more information on IBM Cloud, visit https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \nAbout KYCK! \nFor more information about KYCK!, visit http://kyck.sg/ . \nMedia Contact:",

      "text": "svenska IBM and NVIDIA Team Up on World's Fastest Deep Learning Enterprise Solution New IBM PowerAI Software Toolkit Paired with NVIDIA NVLink and GPUDL Libraries Optimized for IBM Power Architecture Helps Enable 2X Performance Breakthroughs on AlexNet with Caffe News provided by Nov 14, 2016, 05:00 ET Share this article SALT LAKE CITY , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool optimized for the latest IBM and NVIDIA technologies to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace. Deep learning is a fast growing machine learning method that extracts information by crunching through millions of pieces of data to detect and rank the most important aspects from the data. Publicly supported among leading consumer web and mobile application companies, deep learning is quickly being adopted by more traditional business enterprises. IBM and NVIDIA Team Up to Advance Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning -- IBM and NVIDIA today deepened their collaboration on technologies to advance artificial intelligence and deep learning with the announcement of PowerAI. The new software toolkit is optimized for IBM's recently announced Power S822LC for HPC servers that leverage NVIDIA's NVLink technology. Deep learning and other artificial intelligence capabilities are being used across a wide range of industry sectors; in banking to advance fraud detection through facial recognition; in automotive for self-driving automobiles and in retail for fully automated call centers with computers that can better understand speech and answer questions. A new deep learning software toolkit available today called IBM PowerAI runs on the recently announced IBM server built for artificial intelligence that features NVIDIA® NVLink™ interconnect technology optimized for IBM's Power architecture. The hardware-software solution provides more than 2X performance over comparable servers with 4 GPUs running AlexNet with Caffe. 1 The same 4-GPU Power-based configuration running Alexnet with BVLC Caffe can also outperform 8 M40 GPU-based x86 configurations 2 , making it the world's fastest commercially available enterprise systems platform on two versions of a key deep learning framework. Caffe is a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and is recognized within the technology industry as one of the most popular deep learning community applications. Caffe is one of five deep learning software frameworks available in the IBM PowerAI toolkit. The toolkit leverages NVIDIA GPUDL libraries including cuDNN, cuBLAS and NCCL as part of NVIDIA SDKs to deliver multi-GPU acceleration on IBM servers. IBM PowerAI is designed to run on IBM's highest performing server in its OpenPOWER LC lineup, the IBM Power S822LC for High Performance Computing (HPC), which features NVIDIA NVLink technology optimized for the Power architecture and NVIDIA's latest GPU technology. The new solution supports emerging computing methods of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. IBM PowerAI also provides a continued path for Watson, IBM's cognitive solutions platform, to extend its artificial intelligence expertise in the enterprise by using several deep learning methods to train Watson. \"PowerAI democratizes deep learning and other advanced analytic technologies by giving enterprise data scientists and research scientists alike an easy to deploy platform to rapidly advance their journey on AI,\" said Ken King , General Manager, OpenPOWER. \"Coupled with our high performance computing servers built for AI, IBM provides what we believe is the best platform for enterprises building AI-based software, whether it's chatbots for customer engagement, or real-time analysis of social media data.\" \"Our innovation with IBM on NVIDIA NVLink has created new opportunities for POWER in the deep learning and analytics market,\" said Ian Buck , VP and GM of Accelerated Computing Group. \"NVIDIA's GPUDL libraries in PowerAI will provide world class high-performance tools to power GPU-accelerated deep learning applications.\" IBM PowerAI is available immediately at no charge to customers of IBM's Power S822LC for HPC server. PowerAI is designed to run on a single S822LC server and also to scale to large scale supercomputing clusters consisting of dozens, hundreds or thousands of servers. The NVLink Advantage PowerAI is a set of binary distributions of popular deep learning frameworks including Caffe, Torch and Theano. Additional distributions include the IBM and NVIDIA versions of the Caffe deep learning frameworks, IBM-Caffe and NVCaffe. IBM has optimized each of the distributions to take advantage of the recently announced IBM POWER8 chip with the NVIDIA NVLink interface featured on the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server. The POWER8 with NVIDIA NVLink chip is a technology-leading processor design that is the result of open collaboration between OpenPOWER Foundation members IBM and NVIDIA. The new chip enables tight integration between IBM's POWER8 CPU server architecture and the new Pascal architecture NVIDIA's Tesla P100 GPU accelerators. The CPUs and GPUs integrated into the Power S822LC for HPC are connected to each other via the high-speed NVIDIA NVLink interconnect. This industry-unique interface between the CPUs and GPUs, and also between the GPUs, removes potential bottlenecks created by the PCIe interface found in most Intel x86-based servers. The PowerAI toolkit of deep learning applications takes advantage of this new NVLink-based server architecture to optimize performance of the leading artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning applications. Growing Momentum for the Power S822LC for High Performance Computing The hardware pairing for PowerAI, the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server, was launched in early September. There was immediate interest in the server, equipped with raw performance advantages, among leading research institutions, cloud service providers and business enterprises. This led to very strong demand in the third quarter, contributing to Power's 2x year to year growth in Linux systems revenues. Initial client uses for the new IBM Power S822LC for HPC servers include: Human Brain Project – In support of the Human Brain Project, a research project funded by the European Commission to advance understanding of the human brain, IBM, and NVIDIA deployed a pilot system at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre as part of the Pre-Commercial Procurement process. Called JURON, the new supercomputer leverages Power S822LC for HPC systems. Cloud provider Nimbix – HPC cloud platform provider, Nimbix expanded its cloud supercomputing offerings this month, putting IBM Power S822LC for HPC systems with PowerAI in the hands of developers and data scientists to achieve enhanced performance. City of Yachay, Ecuador – Ecuador's \"City of Knowledge,\" Yachay, is a planned city designed to push the nation's economy away from commodities and towards knowledge-based innovation. Last week the city announced it is using a cluster of Power S822LC servers to build the country's first supercomputer for the purpose of creating new forms of energy, predicting climates, and pioneering food genomics. SC3 Electronics – A leading cloud supercomputing center in Turkey , SC3 Electronics announced last month at the OpenPOWER Summit Europe that it is creating the largest HPC cluster in the Middle East and North Africa region based on Power S822LC for HPC servers.

      "text": "At the annual SC16 supercomputing conference this morning, IBM Corp. and Nvidia Corp. revealed the next step in their plan to capitalize on the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence.\nThe companies are showcasing a jointly developed toolkit dubbed PowerAI that contains custom versions of Torch, Theano and Caffe, three of the most popular open-source deep learning frameworks in the industry. The distributions have been optimized to run on the much-touted S822LC for HPC server that IBM unveiled in September. According to Big Blue, the machine is specifically geared towards running artificial intelligence and scientific workloads that rely on GPUs to carry out their calculations.\nTo support this requirement, the S822LC for HPC combines two of IBM’s homegrown POWER8 processors with four speedy accelerators from Nvidia’s Tesla P100 series, which is described as the fastest of its kind on the market. The chips connected by an interconnect known as NVLink that the semiconductor maker developed to speed up the flow of between its GPUs and third party CPUs. According to the company, the technology provides up to 12 times faster transfer times than the PCIe interfaces normally used for the task.\nThe result is that the S822LC for HPC can run artificial intelligence workloads more efficiency than competing GPU-optimized servers such as HPE’s recently unveiled Apollo 6500 . And it works even faster when paired with today’s newly introduced PowerAI toolkit. In an internal test carried out by IBM, the machine provided twice as much performance as the regular configuration of the S822LC while running the AlexNet image recognition system on Caffe.\nPowerAI is available for free to organizations that deploy S822LC for HPC. Early adopters include cloud provider Nimbix and the Human Brain Project, a research initiative funded European Commission to advance the study of neuroscience. IBM will likely add support for more artifical intelligence frameworks to the toolkit over time as adoption of the server widens and customer requirements become more diverse. The first technology on the roadmap will likely be Google’s TensorFlow engine , which is rapidly gaining ground on traditional alternatives such as Caffe.\nImage via Pixabay ",

      "text": "Markets Today IBM And NVIDIA Team Up On World's Fastest Deep Learning Enterprise Solution New IBM PowerAI Software Toolkit Paired with NVIDIA NVLink and GPUDL Libraries Optimized for IBM Power Architecture Helps Enable 2X Performance Breakthroughs on AlexNet with Caffe PR Newswire Nov14,20165:00AMEST SALT LAKE CITY , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool optimized for the latest IBM and NVIDIA technologies to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace. Deep learning is a fast growing machine learning method that extracts information by crunching through millions of pieces of data to detect and rank the most important aspects from the data. Publicly supported among leading consumer web and mobile application companies, deep learning is quickly being adopted by more traditional business enterprises. Deep learning and other artificial intelligence capabilities are being used across a wide range of industry sectors; in banking to advance fraud detection through facial recognition; in automotive for self-driving automobiles and in retail for fully automated call centers with computers that can better understand speech and answer questions. A new deep learning software toolkit available today called IBM PowerAI runs on the recently announced IBM server built for artificial intelligence that features NVIDIA® NVLink™ interconnect technology optimized for IBM's Power architecture. The hardware-software solution provides more than 2X performance over comparable servers with 4 GPUs running AlexNet with Caffe. 1 The same 4-GPU Power-based configuration running Alexnet with BVLC Caffe can also outperform 8 M40 GPU-based x86 configurations 2 , making it the world's fastest commercially available enterprise systems platform on two versions of a key deep learning framework. Caffe is a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and is recognized within the technology industry as one of the most popular deep learning community applications. Caffe is one of five deep learning software frameworks available in the IBM PowerAI toolkit. The toolkit leverages NVIDIA GPUDL libraries including cuDNN, cuBLAS and NCCL as part of NVIDIA SDKs to deliver multi-GPU acceleration on IBM servers.

      "text": "Markets Today IBM Blockchain Helps FinTechs And Banks Address KYC Challenge Singapore FinTech Startup KYCK! to use IBM Blockchain and Bluemix to enhance the customer onboarding process in financial institutions PR Newswire Nov14,201612:01AMEST SINGAPORE , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client. Through the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding. The IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering.

IBM and Nvidia said that the S822LC system can run AlexNet with Caffe faster than x86 servers with multiple configurations. \nCaffe is a deep learning framework created by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC). Caffe is widely used, but IBM's PowerAI tookit supports another four deep learning software packages. \nIBM and Nvidia see HPC as a growth market as more enterprises adopt deep learning for big data and analytics workloads. Both companies are members of the OpenPOWER Foundation, which aims to spread the POWER architecture in the data center. \nBig Blue's POWER8 processor is integrated with Nvidia's Tesla P100 Pascal GPU accelerators in the S822LC systems . IBM said the new servers are being used to study the human brain, crunch data and supercomputing. Join Discussion",

Credit: IBM Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 2:05 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nJust over five years ago, IBM's Watson supercomputer crushed opponents in the televised quiz show Jeopardy. It was hard to foresee then, but artificial intelligence is now permeating our daily lives. \nSince then, IBM has expanded the Watson brand to a cognitive computing package with hardware and software used to diagnose diseases, explore for oil and gas, run scientific computing models, and allow cars to drive autonomously. The company has now announced new AI hardware and software packages. \nThe original Watson used advanced algorithms and natural language interfaces to find and narrate answers. Then, Watson was one supercomputer, but now AI systems are deployed at a grander scale. Mega data centers run by Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other companies use AI on thousands of servers to recognize images and speech and analyze loads of data. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nWatson is just one of IBM's efforts; the company has more initiatives to bring AI to other companies. It's releasing more powerful hardware to make deep-learning systems faster while analyzing data or finding answers to complex questions. IBM is pairing those superfast systems with new software tools. \nThe new IBM hardware, and software tools called PowerAI, are used to train software to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition. The more a computer learns, the more accurate the results. Training requires a lot of computing horsepower. The new training hardware is now available. \nUltimately, the hardware and software could be the key cog in making Watson technologies easily available to companies through the cloud or on premises. For now, the company is not talking about whether they will be a part of Watson. \nThe first set of hardware is the Power8 server with the Nvidia Tesla GPUs, said Sumit Gupta, IBM's vice president of high-performance computing and analytics. \nThe hardware is the fastest deep-learning system available, Gupta said. The Power8 CPUs and Tesla P100 GPUs are among the fastest chips available, and both are linked via the NVLink interconnect, which outperforms PCI-Express 3.0. Nvidia's GPUs power many deep-learning systems in companies like Google, Facebook, and Baidu. \n\"Performance is very important as deep learning training jobs run for days,\" Gupta said. It's also important to speed up key technologies like storage and networking, he said. \nThe Power8 hardware is available via the Nimbix cloud , which provides bare metal access to hardware and an Infiniband backend. \nIBM is also planning hardware and software for inferencing, which requires lighter processing on the edge or end device. The inferencing engine takes results from a trained model, adds additional data or input, and provides improvised results. Drones, robots, and autonomous cars use inferencing engines for navigation, image recognition, or data analysis. \nInferencing chips are also used in data centers to boost deep learning models. Google has created its own chip called TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), and other companies like KnuEdge, Wave Computing, and GraphCore are creating inferencing chips. \nIBM is working on a different model for its inferencing hardware and software, Gupta said. He did not provide any further details. \nThe software is the glue that puts IBM's AI hardware and software in a cohesive package. IBM has forked a version of the open-source Caffe deep-learning framework to function on its Power hardware. IBM is also supporting other frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, and OpenBLAS. \nThe frameworks are sandboxes in which users can create and tweak parameters of a computer model that learns to solve a particular problem. Caffe is widely used for image recognition. RELATED TOPICS ",

      "text": " IBM\nSingapore FinTech Startup KYCK! to use IBM Blockchain and Bluemix to enhance the customer onboarding process in financial institutions\nSINGAPORE , Nov. 14, Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client.\nThrough the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment.\nWorking with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding.\nThe IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering.\nKYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities.\n\"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan , Co-Founder of KYCK!.\n\"The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry,\" said Alan Lim , Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage, ASEAN.\nBlockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things.\nThe IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix. With a total of eight Bluemix Garages globally, the Singapore Bluemix Garage is one of the latest to be added to the IBM global network, which includes locations in London , New York , Nice , Melbourne , San Francisco , Tokyo and Toronto .\nAbout IBM\nFor more information about IBM Blockchain, visit www.ibm.com/blockchain .\nFor more information about IBM Bluemix Garage for Blockchain, visit https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/garage.html .\nFor more information on IBM Cloud, visit https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\nAbout KYCK!\nFor more information about KYCK!, visit http://kyck.sg/ .\nMedia Contact:\nIBM Communications\nHannah Slocum\nPhone: +1 978 877 0105\nEmail: hslocum@us.ibm.com\nKYCK!\nAshley Loo\nEmail: ashley.loo@kyck.sg\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-blockchain-helps-fintechs-and-banks-address-kyc-challenge-300361725.html\n ",

Credit: IBM   14, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Artificial Intelligence \nJust over five years ago, IBM's Watson supercomputer crushed opponents in the televised quiz show Jeopardy. It was hard to foresee then, but artificial intelligence is now permeating our daily lives. \nSince then, IBM has expanded the Watson brand to a cognitive computing package with hardware and software used to diagnose diseases, explore for oil and gas, run scientific computing models, and allow cars to drive autonomously. The company has now announced new AI hardware and software packages. \nThe original Watson used advanced algorithms and natural language interfaces to find and narrate answers. Then, Watson was one supercomputer, but now AI systems are deployed at a grander scale. Mega data centers run by Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other companies use AI on thousands of servers to recognize images and speech and analyze loads of data. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nWatson is just one of IBM's efforts; the company has more initiatives to bring AI to other companies. It's releasing more powerful hardware to make deep-learning systems faster while analyzing data or finding answers to complex questions. IBM is pairing those superfast systems with new software tools. \nThe new IBM hardware, and software tools called PowerAI, are used to train software to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition. The more a computer learns, the more accurate the results. Training requires a lot of computing horsepower. The new training hardware is now available. \nUltimately, the hardware and software could be the key cog in making Watson technologies easily available to companies through the cloud or on premises. For now, the company is not talking about whether they will be a part of Watson. \nThe first set of hardware is the Power8 server with the Nvidia Tesla GPUs, said Sumit Gupta, IBM's vice president of high-performance computing and analytics. \nThe hardware is the fastest deep-learning system available, Gupta said. The Power8 CPUs and Tesla P100 GPUs are among the fastest chips available, and both are linked via the NVLink interconnect, which outperforms PCI-Express 3.0. Nvidia's GPUs power many deep-learning systems in companies like Google, Facebook, and Baidu. \n\"Performance is very important as deep learning training jobs run for days,\" Gupta said. It's also important to speed up key technologies like storage and networking, he said. \nThe Power8 hardware is available via the Nimbix cloud , which provides bare metal access to hardware and an Infiniband backend. \nIBM is also planning hardware and software for inferencing, which requires lighter processing on the edge or end device. The inferencing engine takes results from a trained model, adds additional data or input, and provides improvised results. Drones, robots, and autonomous cars use inferencing engines for navigation, image recognition, or data analysis. \nInferencing chips are also used in data centers to boost deep learning models. Google has created its own chip called TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), and other companies like KnuEdge, Wave Computing, and GraphCore are creating inferencing chips. \nIBM is working on a different model for its inferencing hardware and software, Gupta said. He did not provide any further details. \nThe software is the glue that puts IBM's AI hardware and software in a cohesive package. IBM has forked a version of the open-source Caffe deep-learning framework to function on its Power hardware. IBM is also supporting other frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, and OpenBLAS. \nThe frameworks are sandboxes in which users can create and tweak parameters of a computer model that learns to solve a particular problem. Caffe is widely used for image recognition. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": " IBM\nNew IBM PowerAI Software Toolkit Paired with NVIDIA NVLink and GPUDL Libraries Optimized for IBM Power Architecture Helps Enable 2X Performance Breakthroughs on AlexNet with Caffe\nSALT LAKE CITY , Nov. 14, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool optimized for the latest IBM and NVIDIA technologies to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace.\nDeep learning is a fast growing machine learning method that extracts information by crunching through millions of pieces of data to detect and rank the most important aspects from the data. Publicly supported among leading consumer web and mobile application companies, deep learning is quickly being adopted by more traditional business enterprises.\nDeep learning and other artificial intelligence capabilities are being used across a wide range of industry sectors; in banking to advance fraud detection through facial recognition; in automotive for self-driving automobiles and in retail for fully automated call centers with computers that can better understand speech and answer questions.\nA new deep learning software toolkit available today called IBM PowerAI runs on the recently announced IBM server built for artificial intelligence that features NVIDIA® NVLink™ interconnect technology optimized for IBM's Power architecture. The hardware-software solution provides more than 2X performance over comparable servers with 4 GPUs running AlexNet with Caffe. 1 The same 4-GPU Power-based configuration running Alexnet with BVLC Caffe can also outperform 8 M40 GPU-based x86 configurations 2 , making it the world's fastest commercially available enterprise systems platform on two versions of a key deep learning framework.\nCaffe is a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and is recognized within the technology industry as one of the most popular deep learning community applications. Caffe is one of five deep learning software frameworks available in the IBM PowerAI toolkit. The toolkit leverages NVIDIA GPUDL libraries including cuDNN, cuBLAS and NCCL as part of NVIDIA SDKs to deliver multi-GPU acceleration on IBM servers.\nIBM PowerAI is designed to run on IBM's highest performing server in its OpenPOWER LC lineup, the IBM Power S822LC for High Performance Computing (HPC), which features NVIDIA NVLink technology optimized for the Power architecture and NVIDIA's latest GPU technology. The new solution supports emerging computing methods of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning. IBM PowerAI also provides a continued path for Watson, IBM's cognitive solutions platform, to extend its artificial intelligence expertise in the enterprise by using several deep learning methods to train Watson.\n\"PowerAI democratizes deep learning and other advanced analytic technologies by giving enterprise data scientists and research scientists alike an easy to deploy platform to rapidly advance their journey on AI,\" said Ken King , General Manager, OpenPOWER. \"Coupled with our high performance computing servers built for AI, IBM provides what we believe is the best platform for enterprises building AI-based software, whether it's chatbots for customer engagement, or real-time analysis of social media data.\"\n\"Our innovation with IBM on NVIDIA NVLink has created new opportunities for POWER in the deep learning and analytics market,\" said Ian Buck , VP and GM of Accelerated Computing Group. \"NVIDIA's GPUDL libraries in PowerAI will provide world class high-performance tools to power GPU-accelerated deep learning applications.\"\nIBM PowerAI is available immediately at no charge to customers of IBM's Power S822LC for HPC server. PowerAI is designed to run on a single S822LC server and also to scale to large scale supercomputing clusters consisting of dozens, hundreds or thousands of servers.\nThe NVLink Advantage\nPowerAI is a set of binary distributions of popular deep learning frameworks including Caffe, Torch and Theano. Additional distributions include the IBM and NVIDIA versions of the Caffe deep learning frameworks, IBM-Caffe and NVCaffe. IBM has optimized each of the distributions to take advantage of the recently announced IBM POWER8 chip with the NVIDIA NVLink interface featured on the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server.\nThe POWER8 with NVIDIA NVLink chip is a technology-leading processor design that is the result of open collaboration between OpenPOWER Foundation members IBM and NVIDIA. The new chip enables tight integration between IBM's POWER8 CPU server architecture and the new Pascal architecture NVIDIA's Tesla P100 GPU accelerators. The CPUs and GPUs integrated into the Power S822LC for HPC are connected to each other via the high-speed NVIDIA NVLink interconnect. This industry-unique interface between the CPUs and GPUs, and also between the GPUs, removes potential bottlenecks created by the PCIe interface found in most Intel x86-based servers. The PowerAI toolkit of deep learning applications takes advantage of this new NVLink-based server architecture to optimize performance of the leading artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning applications.\nGrowing Momentum for the Power S822LC for High Performance Computing\nThe hardware pairing for PowerAI, the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server, was launched in early September. There was immediate interest in the server, equipped with raw performance advantages, among leading research institutions, cloud service providers and business enterprises. This led to very strong demand in the third quarter, contributing to Power's 2x year to year growth in Linux systems revenues.\nInitial client uses for the new IBM Power S822LC for HPC servers include:\nHuman Brain Project – In support of the Human Brain Project, a research project funded by the European Commission to advance understanding of the human brain, IBM, and NVIDIA deployed a pilot system at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre as part of the Pre-Commercial Procurement process. Called JURON, the new supercomputer leverages Power S822LC for HPC systems. Cloud provider Nimbix – HPC cloud platform provider, Nimbix expanded its cloud supercomputing offerings this month, putting IBM Power S822LC for HPC systems with PowerAI in the hands of developers and data scientists to achieve enhanced performance. City of Yachay, Ecuador – Ecuador's \"City of Knowledge,\" Yachay, is a planned city designed to push the nation's economy away from commodities and towards knowledge-based innovation. Last week the city announced it is using a cluster of Power S822LC servers to build the country's first supercomputer for the purpose of creating new forms of energy, predicting climates, and pioneering food genomics. SC3 Electronics – A leading cloud supercomputing center in Turkey , SC3 Electronics announced last month at the OpenPOWER Summit Europe that it is creating the largest HPC cluster in the Middle East and North Africa region based on Power S822LC for HPC servers.

      "text": " IBM\nSingapore FinTech Startup KYCK! to use IBM Blockchain and Bluemix to enhance the customer onboarding process in financial institutions\nSINGAPORE , Nov. 14, Requirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client.\nThrough the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment.\nWorking with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer's information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding.\nThe IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering.\nKYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities.\n\"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan , Co-Founder of KYCK!.\n\"The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry,\" said Alan Lim , Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage, ASEAN.\nBlockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things.\nThe IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix. With a total of eight Bluemix Garages globally, the Singapore Bluemix Garage is one of the latest to be added to the IBM global network, which includes locations in London , New York , Nice , Melbourne , San Francisco , Tokyo and Toronto .\nAbout IBM\nFor more information about IBM Blockchain, visit www.ibm.com/blockchain .\nFor more information about IBM Bluemix Garage for Blockchain, visit https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/garage.html .\nFor more information on IBM Cloud, visit https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\nAbout KYCK!\nFor more information about KYCK!, visit http://kyck.sg/ .\nMedia Contact:\nIBM Communications\nHannah Slocum\nPhone: +1 978 877 0105\nEmail: hslocum@us.ibm.com\nKYCK!\nAshley Loo\nEmail: ashley.loo@kyck.sg\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO\n releases/ibm-blockchain-helps-fintechs-and-banks-address-kyc-challenge-300361725.html\n ",

      "text": "Related resources \nSALT LAKE CITY, UT - 14 Nov 2016: IBM ( IBM: NYSE ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced collaboration on a new deep learning tool optimized for the latest IBM and NVIDIA technologies to help train computers to think and learn in more human-like ways at a faster pace. \nThe new IBM Power System S822LC for High Performance Computing servers feature a new IBM POWER8 chip designed for demanding workloads including artificial intelligence, deep learning and advanced analytics. (Credit: IBM) Deep learning is a fast growing machine learning method that extracts information by crunching through millions of pieces of data to detect and rank the most important aspects from the data. Publicly supported among leading consumer web and mobile application companies, deep learning is quickly being adopted by more traditional business enterprises. \nDeep learning and other artificial intelligence capabilities are being used across a wide range of industry sectors; in banking to advance fraud detection through facial recognition; in automotive for self-driving automobiles and in retail for fully automated call centers with computers that can better understand speech and answer questions. \nA new deep learning software toolkit available today called IBM PowerAI runs on the recently announced IBM server built for artificial intelligence that features NVIDIA® NVLink™ interconnect technology optimized for IBM’s Power architecture. The hardware-software solution provides more than 2X performance over comparable servers with 4 GPUs running AlexNet with Caffe. [1] The same 4-GPU Power-based configuration running Alexnet with BVLC Caffe can also outperform 8 M40 GPU-based x86 configurations [2] , making it the world's fastest commercially available enterprise systems platform on two versions of a key deep learning framework. Caffe is a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and is recognized within the technology industry as one of the most popular deep learning community applications. Caffe is one of five deep learning software frameworks available in the IBM PowerAI toolkit. The toolkit leverages NVIDIA GPUDL libraries including cuDNN, cuBLAS and NCCL as part of NVIDIA SDKs to deliver multi-GPU acceleration on IBM servers. IBM PowerAI is designed to run on IBM’s highest performing server in its OpenPOWER LC lineup, the IBM Power S822LC for High Performance Computing (HPC), which features NVIDIA NVLink technology optimized for the Power architecture and NVIDIA’s latest GPU technology. The new solution supports emerging computing methods of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning . IBM PowerAI also provides a continued path for Watson, IBM’s cognitive solutions platform, to extend its artificial intelligence expertise in the enterprise by using several deep learning methods to train Watson.\"PowerAI democratizes deep learning and other advanced analytic technologies by giving enterprise data scientists and research scientists alike an easy to deploy platform to rapidly advance their journey on AI,” said Ken King, General Manager, OpenPOWER. \"Coupled with our high performance computing servers built for AI, IBM provides what we believe is the best platform for enterprises building AI-based software, whether it’s chatbots for customer engagement, or real-time analysis of social media data.\" \n“Our innovation with IBM on NVIDIA NVLink has created new opportunities for POWER in the deep learning and analytics market,” said Ian Buck, VP and GM of Accelerated Computing Group. “NVIDIA’s GPUDL libraries in PowerAI will provide world class high-performance tools to power GPU-accelerated deep learning applications.” \nIBM PowerAI is available immediately at no charge to customers of IBM’s Power S822LC for HPC server. PowerAI is designed to run on a single S822LC server and also to scale to large scale supercomputing clusters consisting of dozens, hundreds or thousands of servers. The NVLink Advantage PowerAI is a set of binary distributions of popular deep learning frameworks including Caffe, Torch and Theano. Additional distributions include the IBM and NVIDIA versions of the Caffe deep learning frameworks, IBM-Caffe and NVCaffe. IBM has optimized each of the distributions to take advantage of the recently announced IBM POWER8 chip with the NVIDIA NVLink interface featured on the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server. The POWER8 with NVIDIA NVLink chip is a technology-leading processor design that is the result of open collaboration between OpenPOWER Foundation members IBM and NVIDIA. The new chip enables tight integration between IBM’s POWER8 CPU server architecture and the new Pascal architecture NVIDIA’s Tesla P100 GPU accelerators. The CPUs and GPUs integrated into the Power S822LC for HPC are connected to each other via the high-speed NVIDIA NVLink interconnect. This industry-unique interface between the CPUs and GPUs, and also between the GPUs, removes potential bottlenecks created by the PCIe interface found in most Intel x86-based servers. The PowerAI toolkit of deep learning applications takes advantage of this new NVLink-based server architecture to optimize performance of the leading artificial intelligence, deep learning and machine learning applications. Growing Momentum for the Power S822LC for High Performance Computing The hardware pairing for PowerAI, the IBM Power S822LC for HPC server, was launched in early September. There was immediate interest in the server, equipped with raw performance advantages, among leading research institutions, cloud service providers and business enterprises. This led to very strong demand in the third quarter, contributing to Power's 2x year to year growth in Linux systems revenues. \nInitial client uses for the new IBM Power S822LC for HPC servers include: Human Brain Project – In support of the Human Brain Project, a research project funded by the European Commission to advance understanding of the human brain, IBM, and NVIDIA deployed a pilot system at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre as part of the Pre-Commercial Procurement process. Called JURON, the new supercomputer leverages Power S822LC for HPC systems. Cloud provider Nimbix – HPC cloud platform provider, Nimbix expanded its cloud supercomputing offerings this month, putting IBM Power S822LC for HPC systems with PowerAI in the hands of developers and data scientists to achieve enhanced performance. City of Yachay, Ecuador – Ecuador’s “City of Knowledge,” Yachay, is a planned city designed to push the nation's economy away from commodities and towards knowledge-based innovation. Last week the city announced it is using a cluster of Power S822LC servers to build the country’s first supercomputer for the purpose of creating new forms of energy, predicting climates, and pioneering food genomics. SC3 Electronics – A leading cloud supercomputing center in Turkey, SC3 Electronics announced last month at the OpenPOWER Summit Europe that it is creating the largest HPC cluster in the Middle East and North Africa region based on Power S822LC for HPC servers. \nTo download IBM PowerAI, go to www.ibm.biz/powerai .

      "text": "As Watson matures, IBM plans more AI hardware and software IBM releases faster hardware and software that make it easier to train deep-learning systems More like this \nIBM new S822LC server for high-performance computing has Power8 chips and Nvidia's NVLink interconnect. Credit: IBM Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 14, 2016 RELATED TOPICS Comments \nJust over five years ago, IBM’s Watson supercomputer crushed opponents in the televised quiz show Jeopardy. It was hard to foresee then, but artificial intelligence is now permeating our daily lives. \nSince then, IBM has expanded the Watson brand to a cognitive computing package with hardware and software used to diagnose diseases, explore for oil and gas, run scientific computing models, and allow cars to drive autonomously. The company has now announced new AI hardware and software packages. [ The InfoWorld review roundup: AWS, Microsoft, Databricks, Google, HPE, and IBM machine learning in the cloud . | TensorFlow shines a light on deep learning . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nThe original Watson used advanced algorithms and natural language interfaces to find and narrate answers. Then, Watson was one supercomputer, but now AI systems are deployed at a grander scale. Mega data centers run by Facebook, Google, Amazon, and other companies use AI on thousands of servers to recognize images and speech and analyze loads of data. \nWatson is just one of IBM’s efforts; the company has more initiatives to bring AI to other companies. It’s releasing more powerful hardware to make deep-learning systems faster while analyzing data or finding answers to complex questions. IBM is pairing those superfast systems with new software tools. \nThe new IBM hardware, and software tools called PowerAI, are used to train software to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition. The more a computer learns, the more accurate the results. Training requires a lot of computing horsepower. The new training hardware is now available. \nUltimately, the hardware and software could be the key cog in making Watson technologies easily available to companies through the cloud or on premises. For now, the company is not talking about whether they will be a part of Watson. \nThe first set of hardware is the Power8 server with the Nvidia Tesla GPUs, said Sumit Gupta, IBM’s vice president of high-performance computing and analytics. \nThe hardware is the fastest deep-learning system available, Gupta said. The Power8 CPUs and Tesla P100 GPUs are among the fastest chips available, and both are linked via the NVLink interconnect, which outperforms PCI-Express 3.0. Nvidia’s GPUs power many deep-learning systems in companies like Google, Facebook, and Baidu. \n“Performance is very important as deep learning training jobs run for days,” Gupta said. It’s also important to speed up key technologies like storage and networking, he said. \nThe Power8 hardware is available via the Nimbix cloud , which provides bare metal access to hardware and an Infiniband backend. \nIBM is also planning hardware and software for inferencing, which requires lighter processing on the edge or end device. The inferencing engine takes results from a trained model, adds additional data or input, and provides improvised results. Drones, robots, and autonomous cars use inferencing engines for navigation, image recognition, or data analysis. \nInferencing chips are also used in data centers to boost deep learning models. Google has created its own chip called TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), and other companies like KnuEdge, Wave Computing, and GraphCore are creating inferencing chips. \nIBM is working on a different model for its inferencing hardware and software, Gupta said. He did not provide any further details. \nThe software is the glue that puts IBM’s AI hardware and software in a cohesive package. IBM has forked a version of the open-source Caffe deep-learning framework to function on its Power hardware. IBM is also supporting other frameworks like TensorFlow, Theano, and OpenBLAS. \nThe frameworks are sandboxes in which users can create and tweak parameters of a computer model that learns to solve a particular problem. Caffe is widely used for image recognition. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Cut down IBM japanese keyboard 6112884 « on: Sun, 13 November 2016, 21:07:17 » Hi guys, I was talking to someone on skype and they convinced me to start posting pics of my projects again so here's one for you.I love the IBM Chinese / Japanese keyboards (6112884 for Japanese, 6113442 for Chinese). Mendleson's has like a huge stash of them, they are NIB, IBM, tee mount (green) alps, have NKRO, and are also cheap. How cheap? $25 NIB IBM Alps! Everyone should own one. Soarer even made a controller code for it, which was sweet. Unfortunately they are huge. I decided to fix that.What did I do? I cut the last two \"sections\" off the plate, cut a section out of the bottom case, cut a different section out of the top. I'm very glad I was able to preserve the places for the feet to clip back in as well as the speaker grill. I spent many hours filing the 4 edges down to match together perfectly, or as good as I could get. Then I decided whether to keep the PCB or not. The original PCB had NKRO, but the controller was on the part I cut off. I also really like the lowpoly-type M0110 mod where it's just direct wired, but I still need a place for the controller. hmm.I ended up keeping the PCB. I cut it down to size, desoldered the mux chip driving the columns (which was on the part of the KB that was left) put a teensy there, fixed a few traces to power the teensy, repaired all the traces that were cut, mapped out the matrix, came up with a layout and bam!The KB is sometimes known as the pingsaver keyboard. Since I desoldered mine I can confirm that it's the metal plate that makes the ping. This ping has been preserved in this iteration which is good 'cause I love it.The tee mount alps actuate very high. Most people consider them linear, but I've always thought they were a little tactile. I use it for gaming or my \"left hand only\" ergodox depending on how I'm feeling.Here are a couple of cellphone photos I took, I guess since I have a post now I'll take some interior shots too.I have a few other projects in the works, so hopefully I'll find time to post those tooNext to a CM storm novatouch. The whole thing is about the size of a standard TKLThis picture is actually taken right after I finished the case, so it's not even working in the photo This is the only shot of the internals I could find. Again missing any sort of wiring as it's an early photo.I guess I'll take some photos and upload them later.

      "text": "HTii to advise global DOORS software community from IBM conference  23   LEXINGTON PARK, Md. , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Defense contractor HTii will provide expert advice to the global community of IBM DOORS and DOORS Next Generation software users November 17 via a live video webinar from an international IBM conference in Long Beach, California . The webinar will feature HTii data architect Adam Hammett and a panel of IBM and industry experts answering questions from conference attendees and online participants around the world. It will take place Thursday, November 17 , at 9:00 am Pacific time . Registration is at https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8382745197377329154 . Hammett also will give a separate, solo presentation earlier in the conference on DOORS Next Generation. The events are part of IBM's Continuous Engineering for the Internet of Things Summit 2016 on the historic Queen Mary ocean liner, now a dockside conference center at the Long Beach pier. A wide range of industries use IBM DOORS applications to manage requirements for large, complex projects, such as the development of new software, pharmaceuticals and military weapons. The legacy DOORS application is a standalone product installed on individual computers or servers. The newer DOORS Next Generation is an online version that is part of IBM's Jazz lifecycle project management suite of applications. \"Both are enormously powerful,\" Hammett said, \"but two similar but different products raise questions for many users - which one to use, should they use both, or if they want to switch, how do they migrate from DOORS to DOORS NG?\" The panel and webinar Hammett is appearing on, \"Sharing Successes & Solving Problems,\" will answer as many of these questions as possible during its scheduled three-hour period, he said. \"This is not a presentation or slide show,\" he said. \"It's one long Q&A session.\" His solo presentation November 16 at 1:40-2:15 Pacific time will cover new configuration management options in the latest release of DOORS NG, version 6.x. \"Configuration management in DOORS NG means keeping track of changes made by many technical experts working simultaneously on different versions of the same basic set of requirements,\" he said. Hammett will explore several DOORS NG functions, including global configurations, baselines, change sets and streams, along with best practices for planning and implementing configuration management. Specializing in Rational CLM products, HTii ( www.htii.com ) develops solutions for managing, reporting and analyzing data for complex engineering projects. Contact",

      "text": "IBM to acquire India-based leader in DRM TECH TREND IBM to acquire India-based leader in DRM By Anand Parthasarathy | November 14, 2016 Sanovi is already a respected global name in Disaster Relief technology for enterprises. Post acquisition, it will remain a separate brand and solution \nQ : Will you need collision coverage? James Bond : Yes. Q : They frequently do — with you (dialogue from the James Bond film, “Tomorrow Never Dies” ) Accidents, as James Bond admits, are prone to happen. In business, it is not enough to buy a comprehensive insurance policy. To survive, one must recover fast – often within seconds of disaster striking – if business continuity is to be maintained. \nThe solution is DRM or Disaster Recovery Management, an area where Bangalore-based Sanovi, ( www.sanovi.com ) is a respected name. Founded in 2003, Sanovi is headquartered in India, and operates in the United States, the Middle East, and Asia. \nThe company's flagship solution includes features like, automatic recovery, Large File Replication Support, and other prepackaged tools. Sanovi also licenses its software to managed services partners, and integrates with their help desk to enable the partner to offer comprehensive DR solutions with end-to-end service levels to the end user. Its solutions are crafted in India for a global clientele and in recent years and increasingly become cloud based. \nThis may explain the surprise announcement last week, that Sanovi was being acquired by IBM to bolster its own data recovery services in the hybrid cloud. \nWith Sanovi’s software, IBM will further empower clients to redefine their disaster recovery strategy in the face of unprecedented industry change. The addition of Sanovi’s technology to IBM’s existing portfolio offers a solution that helps simplify and automate the disaster recovery process, helps to manage recovery workflows, and can help to reduce recovery time, operating costs, and disaster recovery drill testing time.\"Our clients are embracing a digitized world where applications need to be ‘always-on,’” says Martin Jetter, Senior Vice President, Global Technology Services, IBM, “As a cloud-native company, Sanovi will strengthen our resiliency portfolio to manage the broad range of applications, data, and IT systems of our clients .\" \nAdds Chandra Sekhar Pulamarasetti, Co-Founder & CEO of Sanovi: “IBM’s technology leadership in hybrid cloud infrastructure and resiliency services makes it a clear choice to bring end-to-end services to our customers and transformational value to IBM’s existing client base. Together, we will provide next-generation resilient solutions for robust hybrid cloud deployments across the globe.” \nIn addition to being available as part of a managed service, IBM plans to make Sanovi DRM available as a stand-alone software license for partners and customers... which means the Sanovi brand will live on -- as a byword in DRM. \nTech Note: What is disaster recovery ? Disaster Recovery is an organizations ability to recover and operate core process/services that enables it to transact business with its customers and partners. Why organizations need DR solutions? Increasing use of critical business process and related IT systems and the impact to business if critical IT systems become unavailable. Also the cost of down time is multifaceted – financial loss, loss of reputation and customer dissatisfaction. Further in several vertical markets, DR is required by regulatory authorities and DR capability must be demonstrated on a regular basis. What are the common reasons cited for not deploying a DR plan for an organization? \"We don’t need DR plan, since...\" • we have not been hit by a disaster, these things don’t happen here • we are replicating our data, that is our DR plan • My team of experts can bring up our infrastructure in case of need • DR is for big companies, my company can postpone the decision Which are the ideal target sectors for these products / services? DR management solutions are most applicable to verticals that have critical IT applications and by regulation need to demonstrate DR capabilities. Banking & finance, manufacturing, e-government, telecom are some of the verticals that are targets for these products/services. \nWhat is the current market for DRM solutions in India? The market for DR in India is growing. Consider some numbers: There are over 150 participants in Reserve Bank of India's Real Time Gross Settlement network; all of them must have a DR for their RTGS application. The government has major initiatives in egovernance, each of these project has critical data that must have a DR solution. ",

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nARMONK, NY and PHILADELPHIA, PA - 14 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced that Automated Financial Systems, Inc. (AFS), a global leader in commercial lending to top-tier financial institutions is utilizing the IBM Cloud to expand its loan processing capacity to support its overall growth and market expansion. AFS, whose clients include two-thirds of the top 25 U.S. banks and bank holding companies, turned to IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems which extends the scalable and security-rich processing capabilities of IBM z Systems in a hybrid cloud environment, to establish a new hosting and recovery plan that supports the 24/7 demands of offerings such as AFSVision, the only real-time, linear lending system that manages the commercial lending lifecycle from loan origination to account servicing and reporting. \nThese newfound efficiencies have allowed AFS to expand existing client portfolios and onboard new clients into production much faster than ever before. IBM’s delivery of a highly flexible operating environment allowed AFS to double its processing capacity, and run times for several critical AFS applications were improved with IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems – some by as much as 100 percent. \n“Our decision to adopt IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems was made with the knowledge that IBM consistently has delivered for clients and evolved alongside them for decades,” said Mike Bogdash, Managing Director at AFS. “The efficiencies that we’ve received from this platform has boosted our processing capabilities and makes it possible for us to implement a client into production much quicker.” \nTo better protect its operations and encourage higher-quality customer service, AFS also has adopted an IBM business continuity and resiliency services plan that provides the financial software company with an alternative site recovery solution in the unlikely event of a disruption. Seventy percent of financial risk managers cited cyber risk as their top concern in a 2015 survey for an event that could affect global financial systems. Financial policy leaders also have emphasized that cyber risk needs to be viewed as a major priority rather than a limited technology issue, with financial services encountering security incidents 300 percent more frequently than other industries. \n“AFS holds a commanding position in its industry while continuing to innovate its IT infrastructure in today’s digitized world,” said Martin Jetter, Senior Vice President, Global Technology Services, IBM . “IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems is designed to amplify mainframe efficiencies and offer new opportunities for AFS to respond to evolving client environments and achieve future growth.” \nAbout Automated Financial Systems, Inc. \nAutomated Financial Systems, Inc.

      "text": "Singapore FinTech Startup KYCK! to use IBM Blockchain and Bluemix to enhance the customer onboarding process in financial institutions Select a topic or year \nSINGAPORE - 14 Nov 2016: \nRequirements that banks and financial institutions comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements is a global challenge. Blockchain holds potential to help address this need to prove the identity of a person or organization, source of funds, business interests, history and also monitor for changes. During the Singapore FinTech Festival, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced a blockchain project with Singapore fintech startup KYCK! to help enable financial services providers to more rapidly on-board their customers in a secure environment. This and other KYC projects like it using IBM Blockchain can hold the promise to help reduce the time and expense required to onboard a new client. \nThrough the application of blockchain technologies on cloud, banks can streamline operations by adopting a one-time process with secure data protection and enhanced identity verification. Using the open-source Hyperledger Project Fabric, immutability, traceability and privacy of the information is provided on a permissioned distributed ledger which is critical in a highly regulated environment. \nWorking with the IBM Bluemix Garage in Singapore to design and test the new solution to be built on the Hyperledger Fabric, KYCK! intends to provide brokerages a platform with video conferencing and encrypted document submission capabilities for the secure on-boarding of new customers. The platform also aims to provide enhanced identification validation through a trusted blockchain based business network that will potentially include banking and governmental entities. Once identity verification is confirmed, KYCK! will enter the customer’s information into current bank-based checks or third-party KYCK! systems before account on-boarding. \nThe IBM Blockchain based solution will be secured by the IBM High-Security Business network (HSBN) delivered via Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform. This enables KYCK! to handle sensitive data with additional levels of security that can help protect against unauthorized access and tampering. \nKYCK! is a startup, co-founded by three Singaporeans to provide users with information pertaining to the Southeast Asia Exchanges and access to brokerage demo accounts with easy on-boarding opportunities. As former sales traders, the co-founders personally experienced the inefficiencies of the customer on-boarding process due to stringent financial compliance requirements. This gave them the idea of starting a business that focuses on improving the client on-boarding process and enhancing the overall customer experience by deploying secured and appropriate technology capabilities. \n\"We were fortunate to have found a partner in IBM with the right capabilities to enable us to apply our financial industry know-how and bring our ideas to life. Working with the IBM Bluemix Garage, we have seen how blockchain can improve operational efficiency, increase transparency and reduce transaction risks. We hope that financial institutions will see an improvement in their current customer on-boarding processes and the overall customer experience,\" said Darryl Tan, Co-Founder of KYCK!. \n“The application of blockchain is showing great promise across a broad range of business applications. It is a technology that establishes accountability and transparency while streamlining business processes. Since we launched an IBM Bluemix Garage focused on blockchain in Singapore this year, we have seen more and more startups and entrepreneurs come through our doors with a curiosity and passion for how they can apply blockchain as a competitive differentiator. We have the privilege of working with the start-up community and the wider ecosystem to realize some of these ideas, and we are excited to see the impact of their work in their community and industry ,” said Alan Lim, Practice Lead, IBM Blockchain & Bluemix Garage , ASEAN. \nBlockchain is one of the more than 150 advanced services and APIs available to developers on Bluemix. Bluemix has rapidly grown to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based on open standards, it features advanced technologies spanning categories of cognitive computing, cloud data analytics, blockchain and Internet of Things. \nThe IBM Bluemix Garages serve as hubs for developers, product managers and designers to come together to rapidly design and develop successful applications on Bluemix. With a total of eight Bluemix Garages globally, the Singapore Bluemix Garage is one of the latest to be added to the IBM global network, which includes locations in London, New York, Nice, Melbourne, San Francisco, Tokyo and Toronto. \n### \nFor more information about IBM Blockchain, visit www.ibm.com/blockchain . \nFor more information about IBM Bluemix Garage for Blockchain, visit https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/garage.html .
