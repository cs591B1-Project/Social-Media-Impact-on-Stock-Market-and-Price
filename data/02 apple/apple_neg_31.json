      "text": "Despite competition for consumer dollars from 4K TVs and drones, Apple ( AAPL ) is expected to be one of the winners this holiday season, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a research report Monday.\n\"Apple remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch (Series 2, ceramic Apple Watch Edition, Apple Watch Nike+) and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar,\" White said. \"If Apple launches its new AirPods for the holidays, we expect this gift to be a very popular stocking stuffer.\"\nApple's wireless earbuds, called AirPods, were expected to launch in late October, but were delayed for some last-minute improvements. Apple's website lists the $159 product as \"coming soon.\"\nThe holiday shopping season officially kicks off this weekend with Thanksgiving evening and Black Friday doorbuster sales.\nHoliday Retail Forecasts Top 7-Year Average The National Retail Federation is projecting overall holiday sales to grow by 3.6% this season to $655.8 billion and above the 3.2% growth seen in 2015, while also higher than the seven-year average increase of 3.4%.\nThe Consumer Technology Association predicts consumer-electronics sales will rise by 3.1% this holiday season, vs. 1.4% growth in the November-December period last year.\nThis holiday season, the CTA expects strong U.S. sales of drones (1.2 million units, up 112% year over year), virtual reality headsets (700,000 units) and 4K ultra-high-definition televisions (4.5 million units).\nThe top tech products on gift wish lists include notebook computers (11%), TVs (8%), smartphones (8%), tablets (7%) and video-game consoles (5%), according to a consumer survey by CTA. There also is interest in smartwatches (3%), VR headsets (2%), home robotic vacuums (2%) and portable GPS (2%), CTA said.\nBest Buy ( BBY ) signaled strong holiday tech sales when it reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results last week. The consumer-electronics retailer was helped in Q3 by the launch of Apple's iPhone 7 and robust sales of 4K TVs and home theater systems.\nTarget Says Apple Sales Over Target Discount retailer Target ( TGT ) also pointed to a merry holiday season ahead with its third-quarter report last week.\nOn a conference call with analysts, Target CEO Brian Cornell said the retailer saw \"a meaningful improvement in sales of Apple products, driven by their introduction of several new product innovations\" last quarter.\nMark Tritton, Target's chief merchandising officer, sees the Apple momentum continuing this quarter.\n\"In electronics this quarter, we're planning for strong demand for Apple's new products,\" he said on the call. \"We're also expecting a lot of guest interest in virtual reality, along with connected home devices like Google Home.\"\nAlphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google Home is a smart speaker that answers spoken questions and plays music on command. It competes with Amazon.com 's ( AMZN ) market-leading Echo devices.\nConsumer Intelligence Research Partners on Monday estimated that Amazon has sold 5.1 million Echo devices in the U.S. since the product debuted in late 2014. In the first nine months of 2016, it sold about 2 million Echo appliances, CIRP said.",

      "text": "Shots Fired: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Pokes Fun At Apple's iPad Pro For Being Too Similar To Surface 22 November 2016, 4:29 am EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Apple - Here's What You May Not Know Now Playing Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, isn't letting Apple's chief executive Tim Cook slip with his infamous \"toaster and refrigerator\" analogy for hybrids. In a recent interview, Nadella poked fun at Apple for essentially eating its own words. ( Stephen Brashear | Getty Images ) Advertisement Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, has jestingly lifted back up Tim Cook's previous words and turned it against him, musing about the growing success of the Surface . For those who can't recall, Cook, Apple's chief executive, during an earnings call way back in 2012, offered a bizarre analogy of the abysmal appeal of hybrid computers, noting that users won't be pleased with the convergence of a \"refrigerator and a toaster,\" in his own words. Tim Cook might have been spitballing four years ago, since it now bills the iPad Pro as a computer instead of a glorified tablet, leaving many people puzzled at the oft-shuffling designations. Additionally, with the iPad Pro now identified as a full computer, Cook's words are pretty much nonsensical, at least, in terms of what Apple seems to believe in. Nadella's Jabs At Apple Cook's previous undermining of the idea of hybrid computers and the increasing success of Microsoft's Surface, the direct rival to Apple's iPad Pro, has rendered Nadella in joking spirits. An interview with the Australian Financial Review sees Nadella pinning the Surface as Microsoft's symbol for risk-taking, in contrast with that of other companies, specifically but indirectly, Apple. \"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,\" Nadella said. \"And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.\" Nadella is of course talking about the Apple iPad Pro, who Apple one day decided to call a computer. Apple And Microsoft's Hybrid Feud Upon touting the iPad Pro as a computer, Microsoft wasn't able to hold back on a sinister and mordant but witty bashing in the form of a 30-seconder, depicting the iPad Pro as unable to respond to the Surface's various questions with regard to its performance. The tug-o-war stretches far back, however. Tim Cook had previously belittled the Surface , calling it a \"deluded\" and \"trying hard\" product. Microsoft has continuously poked fun at Apple's imitation game, running a host of TV commercials, rolling eyes at Apple's iPad Pro and its questionable status of being a computer. CNET has reached out to Apple for a comment, but the company has so far stayed mum about Nadella's jests. In the same interview, Nadella has expressed confidence, explaining to the Australian Financial Review, that one has to carve wiggle room for potential failures because not everything will work. \nDo you agree with Nadella's statements about Apple and the iPad Pro?

      "text": "Apple’s Saccharine Christmas Ad Holds A Message The World Really Needs Right Now By Yoon Sann Wong , 22 Nov 2016 Subscribe to newsletter Like us on Facebook Apple has debuted a heartwarming albeit slightly cliché Christmas ad for the festive season titled ‘Frankie’s Holiday’. It features Frankenstein’s monster ‘Frankie’ who comes down from his isolated mountain cabin to the nearby village to deliver a special gift. While ‘Frankenstein’ is an odd pairing to make with the Christmas season, the move ties in with the ad’s whole idea of accepting things and people who are different. The spot, directed by Park Pictures’ Lance Acord, ends with the line “Open your heart to everyone”, a timely message what with all that’s happened in 2016 and how the world can definitely use with more love and less hate.",

Minimally designed in true Apple fashion, the 450-page hardcover documented Apple’s products since the first Macintosh to the latest iPhone, and costs a hefty US$300. Poking fun at the book’s lack of technology, Stephen Colbert created the spoof on The Late Show , calling it the “latest and most innovative technology from 1440”.

This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015. \n‘If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge’ TAGS",

Displaying a mysterious \"Friday can't come soon enough\" slogan, the header also shows an Apple Watch with the November 25 date featured prominently. Coincidentally, this is the date when Black Friday 2016 is happening, so Apple won't sit on the sidelines like it did in 2015. Now, we'd wager to guess that there will be more than discounted Apple Watches during the sale, but we won't know for sure before the clock strikes twelve on Thursday.",

      "title": "Next-Generation User Interface Technologies For Mobile and Consumer Devices",
      "text": "“The last thing one knows – is what to put first.”– Blaise Pascal In 2007, Apple revolutionized the technology industry with the introduction of the iPhone. While the iPhone had many impressive characteristics, the most differentiating feature was its touch screen user interface, which helped catapult Apple into a leadership position within the smartphone market. Apple had previously transformed the computer industry when it introduced the Macintosh in 1984. The most significant feature of the Macintosh was its innovative computer mouse interface, which enabled intuitive “point and click” use rather than having to type in long obscure DOS commands. Nintendo dominated the gaming market in 2007 and 2008 as a result of the Nintendo Wii. The key feature of the Wii was its Wii Remote controller, which could detect 3-D motions by the user and made games much more interactive. Microsoft subsequently gained significant share in gaming owing in large part to its Kinect gesture recognition technology. As all of these examples indicate, the features that most differentiate electronics products are commonly human–machine interface (HMI) technologies. As form factors continue to shrink in size and become more pervasive (e.g., wearable devices, automobile electronics, smart home), HMI technologies will become increasingly critical. Not surprisingly, there has been growing interest from a variety of major technology companies. For example, Intel Capital created a $100 million fund a few years ago to invest in “perceptual computing” technologies such as 3-D image sensors, touch apps, imaging, gesture, voice, emotion sensing and biometrics. Many of the largest technology companies have already made one or more acquisitions in the HMI space (e.g., Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook). While there have already been a number of important acquisitions in this sector, there may continue to be a robust M&A market in HMI technologies over the next several years. This report provides a brief overview of next-generation user interface technologies that either are currently used in mobile electronics or may be used in the future. These include gesture recognition, eye tracking, speech recognition, touch screen haptics, vision/image processing, virtual reality, augmented reality, and biometric sensor technologies. The report also includes a brief overview of human interface technologies used for security (e.g., fingerprint sensing, voice authentication) and sensor fusion. In addition to providing overviews of each technology, the report also discusses M&A activity in each sector and provides descriptions of a variety of innovative private companies addressing next-generation user interface technologies. Page 11 A Note on Highlighted Companies and M&A Deals The highlighted companies in this report (most of which are private companies or small non-U.S.-based public companies) are not meant to be an all-inclusive list., There are hundreds of start-ups addressing next-generation HMI technology; however, we believe it provides a good sampling of what is out there. We included companies based on the strength of their technology, degree of innovation, and level of public information, but also tried to include a mix of early stage start-ups and more well-known later-stage companies. Importantly, while we may have had calls or meetings with some of the highlighted companies, we have included only publicly available information—Meaning, in many cases, these companies may have extremely interesting next-generation solutions or unannounced design wins, but we included only information that is either on their Web sites or in published articles. Similarly, Pagemill was an advisor for a number of the transactions listed in this report, but we included deal information only if available from public sources. Report Overview The chapters in this document include: Chapter 2 provides an overview of gesture technologies, in which users can control applications through the movement of their hands, fingers, head or body. Chapter 3 discusses eye tracking, in which a person’s gaze can be used to control what is displayed on the screen. Chapter 4 describes touch screens, touch screen haptic technologies, and other emerging display technologies. Chapter 5 covers speech recognition, voice assistant technologies, MEMS microphones and natural language processing. Chapter 6 describes security biometric technologies such as fingerprint sensors, voice authentication, facial recognition and eye recognition. Chapter 7 contains an overview of sensor fusion and middleware solutions that utilize the data from a variety of sensors to enhance the user experience. Chapter 8 provides an overview of biometric sensors (heart rate, brain wave, pulse, blood pressure, air quality, etc.) for health/wellness applications. Chapter 9 discusses a variety of image and vision technologies such as image sensors, image recognition, vision processing and other related topics. Chapter 10 describes virtual and augmented reality technologies and also briefly discusses holographic imaging. Chapter 11 provides some final thoughts. The Appendix summarizes M&A transactions mentioned throughout the document. Page 12“I have a big problem with conductors who gesture a lot.”– James Levine Gesture recognition refers to technologies in which the movement of a person’s hands, fingers, head or body can be used to control electronics. In one common implementation, one or more optical sensors capture images of the user and advanced software interprets the images to determine what action (if any) the user is requesting. For example, a TV viewer might be able to bring a finger to his lips to mute sound or a PC user could scroll by moving her hands up or down. This is generally much more intuitive for users than typing on a keyboard, and can significantly enhance usability. The highest-profile implementations of gesture recognition have been in gaming. As noted in the Introduction chapter, Nintendo’s Wii changed the gaming market with its Wii Remote controllers. Microsoft subsequently rolled out its Kinect technology, which enables users to play games and make selections using only hand and body gestures, without holding any type of controller. Gesture recognition has also been implemented in a number of high-end televisions (e.g., LG and Samsung remote controls) and computers (e.g., Intel’s RealSense). There is also significant interest in implementing gesture recognition in cars, to enable drivers to control certain car features (make selections from the entertainment system, answer a call, etc.) with just a wave of the hand, as that is viewed as much safer than having the driver look down to press buttons on the dashboard. There are a number of methods for implementing gesture recognition. The Wii Remote, for example, included an MEMS accelerometer that could detect user movements. The Wii MotionPlus further improved motion detection by adding a MEMS gyro. However, there is growing interest in implementing gesture recognition vision systems in which optical sensors repeatedly capture images of the user, and complex software algorithms are then used to determine what the user’s gestures are, without the user having to hold any device. As with most of the technologies described in this report, it is relatively easy to develop a simple gesture recognition system that works in ideal conditions, but the challenge is to make it robust under a broad range of circumstances. For example, with vision-based gesture systems, users can be at different distances and angles from the image sensors and have a broad range of different physical characteristics and movements. Additionally, there can be many different types of lighting conditions. Consumers can quickly become frustrated with new technologies when they work only intermittently or when there are latencies, so making these solutions robust is critical but can take many years of development and optimization. As many devices now incorporate conventional CMOS image sensors, optical gesture recognition can potentially be implemented with no additional hardware costs. However, to improve the performance of optical gesture recognition systems, some solutions utilize more specialized optical imaging sensors. Specifically, optical gesture recognition can generally be made more robust when images are represented in 3-D (with a “z” dimension), rather than with conventional 2-D representations. For example, with a 2-D representation it may be difficult to determine if a person’s hand is moving toward or away from the camera. As a result, a number of solutions have been developed that can capture “3-D” images (stereoscopic, time-of-flight, etc.). With stereoscopic solutions, two separate image sensors are used to capture the same image but from slightly different locations (a “right” and “left” image). By comparing the two images, software can estimate the distance of objects in the image. Another approach is referred to as “time-of-flight” (“ToF”). ToF is a type of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology. Light (typically invisible infrared light) is emitted and the reflected light from each object in the image is captured by an array of sensors. By calculating the amount of time it takes for the infrared light to complete a round trip, the distance of each object in the image can be determined, enabling a 3-D representation of the image. This greatly enhances the ability for accurate gesture recognition, but also adds some additional cost (e.g., infrared LEDs, image sensors that capture infrared light) relative to 2-D solutions. ToF was part of the gesture recognition technology developed by Canesta (acquired by Microsoft). While vision-based gesture recognition is most common, a number of other gesture recognition technologies have been developed, based on technologies such as ultrasound and electrical impulses from muscles. Gesture recognition has been implemented by a variety of major technology companies in a broad range of devices. Some examples include: Microsoft accelerated the market for gesture recognition with the original Kinect accessory product and Kinect is a key part of the Xbox One gaming system. Intel has announced its RealSense 3-D cameras which add depth-sensing to help improve the accuracy of gesture recognition and facial movements. A variety of companies have introduced gesture-related remote controls for TVs. Gesture recognition is an increasingly important part of virtual and augmented reality solutions. For example, if a user tries to grab something in a virtual reality game, but the system cannot accurately track his hand, it will result in a poor user experience. Page 14 Select Gesture Recognition M&A Transactions Some notable acquisitions in the gesture recognition space have included the following: Atheer/ONtheGO Platforms – In December 2015, Atheer (an augmented reality smart glasses company) announced an agreement to acquire ONtheGO Platforms. ONtheGo created gesture interfaces using standard cameras in mobile devices. Atheer indicated that the technology will be used to give customers an enhanced ability to use natural gestures with its smart glasses platform. Sony/SoftKinetic – In October 2015, Sony announced that it completed the acquisition of Belgium-based SoftKinetic Systems. SoftKinetic was highlighted in the first edition of this report. It had developed a suite of gesture recognition solutions including 3-D time-of-flight CMOS image sensor chips, module level cameras, and complete stand-alone cameras. In addition, the company developed a substantial amount of middleware to enable easy implementation of gesture recognition. Sony indicated that it will focus on combining SoftKinetic's ToF range image sensor technology expertise with its own technologies with the aim of developing a next generation of range image sensors and solutions. Facebook(Oculus)/Pebbles Interface – In July 2015, Oculus announced that they had acquired Israeli-based Pebbles Interface. Pebbles had spent five years developing optics, sensor systems and algorithms to detect and track hand movement. Oculus is expected to utilize Pebbles’ hand tracking technologies for the Oculus virtual reality solutions (e.g., enabling the system to more accurately track a user’s hand movements, so when a user moves his hands in the real world it can accurately control actions in the virtual world). The value of the transaction was not announced, but the Wall Street Journal reported that one person close to the transaction indicated a value around “$60 million.” Facebook(Oculus)/Nimble VR – In December 2014, Nimble VR reported that it was joining Oculus. Nimble had developed its own 3-D camera (Nimble Sense) primarily for skeletal hand tracking in order to improve the virtual reality experience (tracking the user’s hand movements to improve virtual reality play). Nimble’s demo of Nimble Sense had already used the Oculus virtual reality headset. Fairchild/Xsens – In January 2014, Fairchild Semiconductor completed the acquisition of Xsens for approximately $57.8 million in cash (per Fairchild’s 10-K). Xsens developed 3-D motion tracking products for professional applications based upon miniature MEMS inertial sensor technology. Xsens targeted markets such as robotics, marine industry, unmanned aerial vehicles, 3-D animation, virtual reality, and sports/health science. Xsens was based in The Netherlands. Page 15 Apple/PrimeSense – In November 2013, Apple acquired Israeli-based PrimeSense for reportedly about $345 million (per the 451 Group). PrimeSense initially developed 3-D sensing software and camera systems utilizing off-the-shelf components, and later developed its own 3-D imaging SoC chip as well. The Company was best known for licensing the hardware design and chip used in the original Xbox 360 Kinect motion sensing system. Its “light coding” technology uses near-IR light and off-the-shelf image sensors. When reflected off images, the light is distorted based on the distance and this information is used to determine distance. Google/Flutter – In October 2013, Google acquired Flutter, a private start-up which developed a gesture recognition app that worked with conventional Web cameras (requires only downloading the software). The transaction size was not announced but the 451 Group estimated the valuation at approximately $40 million. Intel/Omek Interactive – In July 2013, Intel acquired Omek Interactive. Omek was an Israeli company – in Hebrew, Omek means “depth”– focused on the gesture recognition sector. The company developed software for creating a gesture recognition interface based on information provided by a 3-D camera. Intel Capital had been an investor. The transaction valuation was estimated to be approximately $50 million (per the 451 Group). Qualcomm/GestureTek and EPOS – In July 2011, Qualcomm announced that it acquired certain assets from GestureTek. Qualcomm noted that the technology would be integrated into future versions of its SnapDragon solutions. Qualcomm also acquired ultrasound technologies for stylus and gesture recognition from Israelibased EPOS Development in September 2012. Microsoft/Canesta and 3DV – Canesta was a private company that developed CMOS 3-D image sensors. Unlike conventional image sensors, Canesta’s “time of flight” technology also measured the arrival time of collected photons, enabling the distance of each pixel of the image to be calculated which could then be used to determine the distance of objects from the sensor (essentially LIDAR on a chip). Honda had been an investor in Canesta, as Canesta had been working on using its technology to determine the distance of nearby cars (per a New York Times article) but later focused on video game applications. In October 2010, it was announced that Microsoft was acquiring Canesta. Separately, in 2009, Microsoft reportedly acquired 3DV Systems for about $35 million (per the 451 Group). 3DV had developed 3-D motion detection cameras. Page 16 Select Private Gesture Recognition Company Overviews There are a variety of private companies focused on gesture recognition. This section highlights a few of them. We included a depth sensing ToF sensor company focused primarily on gesture recognition (pmd), but note that some depth sensing technology companies that primarily address other markets are included in Chapter 9. Gestigon Gestigon has developed advanced hand and finger gesture recognition software for use in a variety of applications. The company believes its technology is much more accurate than other approaches. Its initial target market has been automotive (using gestures to control infotainment, navigation, and climate features within a car) and the company has indicated that it is actively working with several major automotive companies. However, it has more recently begun addressing consumer electronics and other applications. In September 2015, Gestigon announced Carnival, an extension of its product line to address virtual reality and augmented reality markets. Its technology can track hands and provide a life-like representation of a user’s hands within a virtual environment making the virtual reality experience more realistic. At CES 2016, Gestigon announced a project with pmd (discussed later) that combines Samsung’s GearVR, pmd’s depth sensor, and Gestigon’s Carnival AR/VR Interaction Suite to showcase virtual reality. It also collaborated with Inuitive (a vision processor company discussed in Chapter 10) for virtual reality applications. Gestigon completed a Series A capital raise in September 2015. The company was founded in 2011 and is based in Germany with an office in Silicon Valley. MUV Interactive MUV Interactive has developed “The Bird,” which is a small device that a user wears on the finger. Using a combination of inertial sensing and optical sensing, Bird can accurately track finger movement (gesture recognition) which can then be used for a broad range of control applications. For example, Bird works with a TV or projector to transform any surface or image into a “touchscreen” without requiring any actual touching. That is, if an image of a Web site is projected on a wall from an overhead projector connected to a notebook PC, a user with the Bird can scroll up and down, “click” on a link, zoom in and out, move a pointer around on the image, or perform a variety of other tasks by pointing the finger with the Bird on it towards the projected image and moving the finger around. Bird can operate even if the user is across the room from the TV or projected image. Bird can also be used to accurately control drones. It integrates a microphone (to enable voice control), a small capacitive touch surface (for taps and swipes), and a Bluetooth interface. MUV believes the solution has many applications ranging from business presentations, classrooms, drones, smart televisions, and home appliances. The company’s Web site allows pre-orders of Bird indicating that it will begin shipping in Spring 2016. MUV is based in Israel. Page 17 Pmd Technologies focuses on 3-D time of flight depth sensing solutions, with gesture recognition being one of the major applications. The company has developed its own 3-D ToF imaging sensing chip (PhotonICs) but has more recently been collaborating with Infineon on the jointly developed Real3 family which combines pmd's ToF distancemeasurement technology and Infineon's manufacturing capabilities (including a specialized CMOS process optimized for ToF using micro-lens technology). The two companies indicate that the Real3 sensors are used as part of Google’s Project Tango (discussed later in the report). Pmd has also developed a number of complete 3-D depth cameras that integrate either the PhotonICs or Real3 chip and provide a complete reference design for OEMs. Its upcoming CamBoard pico flex solution is targeted at integration into smartphones. Pmd addresses consumer, industrial, and automotive markets and is based in Germany. Chirp has developed advanced gesture recognition solutions. However, in contrast to most gesture solutions that rely on image sensors and video, Chirp’s solutions utilize ultrasonic audio. That is, a transducer creates ultrasonic waves and those waves are reflected by objects. A sensor measures the echoes and based on the ToF of the ultrasonic waves, the Chirp solution can determine the location of nearby objects. By repeatedly taking measurements, gestures can be recognized. Analyzing audio is orders of magnitude easier than analyzing video, thus Chirp believes its solution has many compelling advantages, including dramatically lower computational requirements, significantly less power consumption, and smaller size. For devices that don’t already have embedded image sensors, it is also significantly less expensive. Chirp is targeting consumer electronics, smart homes, industrial automation, and IoT. The technology was originally developed at UC Berkeley and Chirp is located in Berkeley, California. Leap Motion Leap Motion has developed a peripheral device (Leap Motion Controller) that connects to a PC or Mac computer or notebook via a USB cable and enables hand gesture recognition. The device is relatively small (only about 3” long) and sits on the table in front of a computer. The Controller tracks hands movements at up to 200 frames per second using infrared cameras and enables a broad range of gesture related controls. A variety of games and apps have been developed that utilize the Leap Motion Controller and the company has an app page on its Web site. The Leap Motion Controller sells for $79.99 on the company’s Web site. Leap Motion announced a beta version of Leap Motion for virtual reality (e.g., enabling a user to see their hands move in virtual reality). It recently announced that it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with SK Telecom for 5G “AR/VR Service Development.” One of its major investors, Highland Capital, has established a $25 million fund for companies developing technologies based on the Leap Controller. Investors in Leap Motion include Highland Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, and SoSventures International. Page 18 PointGrab PointGrab was highlighted in the 1st edition of this report as an early pioneer in gesture recognition for consumer devices, but has shifted its focus since then to home automation and IoT applications. Its PointSwitch solution is an optical module that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze visual input. Its technology can sense occupancy, ambient light, and occupants’ behavior, which can be used to reduce energy consumption, improve comfort, and lower operational costs. The company indicates that its solutions are being developed in collaboration with leading providers in lighting and building control systems. PointGrab is based in Israel. Extreme Reality Extreme Reality (EXT3-D) has developed 3-D motion analysis software solutions that work with conventional CMOS image sensors. The company’s Extreme Motion technology captures images of people and then creates skeletal models of the people, which are then used to analyze motion. The company believes this core “skeleton positioning technology” enables much more accurate body motion analysis than other conventional body motion tracking solutions and it can be implemented on any system with a basic Webcam. The company’s technology has been incorporated into a number of games. It also announced the technology is incorporated into Warchief and that it has a partnership with TVisual, a leader in China‘s digital signage market for interactive signage. Extreme Reality was founded in 2005 and is based in Israel. Thalmic Labs The bulk of gesture recognition technologies are based on optical systems, but Thalmic Labs has developed a nine-axis motion sensor armband (Myo) that can read the electrical signals from muscle movements in the forearm. The armband incorporates a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. As a result, the armband can identify a broad range of bodily gestures as well as the movement parameters of the arm (direction, speed, and angle). The output of these sensors is converted to digital and processed and the resulting commands are sent via Bluetooth to a smartphone or computer. The company supports a variety of games (e.g., Fruit Ninja) and applications (e.g., controlling a Parrot drone) and opened an online marketplace for the more than 100 existing Myo-based apps. Thalmic is based in Canada and its investors include Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff and ATI co-founder Lee Lau. Page 19“Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder.” - Kinky Friedman Introduction Eye tracking involves determining where a person is looking at or the motion of the eye. This can then be used to control what is displayed on the screen or to help make selections. Eye tracking is not a new concept. For example, in the early 1900s a nonintrusive eye tracker was developed that reflected light off of the subject’s eyes and recorded the results on film. During the 1950s and 1960s, Alfred Yarbus performed a variety of eye tracking experiments and published the first major book on the subject. Most of the early eye tracking solutions were developed for psychological testing, but during the 1980s and 1990s eye tracking had some limited commercial use for marketing studies and to assist handicapped people with computers. More recently, however, there has been growing interest in utilizing eye tracking technology as an interface for electronic devices, including smart phones, computers, and automotive applications. Although there are a variety of different eye tracking technologies, most of the solutions addressing consumer applications utilize the optical method in which light (in many cases infrared light) is reflected by the eye and then captured by an image sensor. The images are then analyzed to determine where the user is looking. Because different parts of the eye (cornea, pupil, sclera, etc.) reflect and absorb light differently, the direction of a person’s gaze can be determined from the images. This can then be used to control the location of the cursor/pointer on a display or to control the display in other ways. For example, a user looking at a map on a display could potentially adjust the map in any direction just by looking at the edge of the map, or zoom in just by staring at a certain spot for a period of time, making it easier to navigate. While many eye tracking solutions have been developed, the challenge in commercializing the technology is making it work consistently across a broad range of users (e.g., different eye types, some with contact lens, some with glasses, etc.) in many different environments (e.g., dark rooms, light rooms, etc.) under a variety of circumstances (users in different positions, viewing angles and distances from the screen). In addition, penetrating the consumer market requires a low cost, small form factor with low power consumption. Historically, many of the eye tracking solutions worked well in ideal conditions but had problems in real world situations. Page 20 While eye tracking solutions vary, they often include: a light source (it is possible to rely on conventional lighting, but many solutions use one or more LED lights, and often infrared LED sources are used as infrared light is not visible to the human eye); an image sensor (in some cases a traditional CMOS image sensor and in other cases an infrared image sensor to improve performance); a processor (in some cases the main processor is relied on to handle the analytical processing, but some solutions have a dedicated chip for this); and software (which analyzes the captured images to determine where the user is looking and provides an interface to various applications). There are a number of applications for which simply gazing at a particular point can cause the application to take action. For example, a mapping program could scroll up, down, left or right if the user stares at certain spots on the edges of the map for a period of time. A game could adjust the scene based on which direction the user is looking. However, one general limitation of eye tracking is that in many cases it still requires using some other method to “click”/select the item that the user is gazing at (i.e., using gaze, a user can move the screen pointer to a specific menu item on the screen, but then must hold his gaze while he presses a key on the keypad or uses his voice to select it). Making selections based solely on gaze is challenging since it can lead to inadvertent selections as the user examines his choices. Blinking has been explored as a way to make selections (stare at a point and then blink for a period of time to select) but that is also challenging to implement since people naturally blink every few seconds. However, there are applications in which gaze can be used to make choices (staring at a spot for a certain length of time), especially if the app is specifically optimized for eye tracking. Eye tracking is still early stage with respect to commercial adoption in high volume consumer devices, but there appears to be growing interest in it for a variety of applications (e.g., games) and one eye tracking company, Tobii, had an IPO in 2015. In addition, it could become more important for virtual/augmented reality applications which historically tracked head movement (i.e., change the view as the user turns his head), but could provide a more realistic experience by also adjusting based on eye movement. There is also interest in optimizing AR and VR displays by providing higher resolution to the area that the user is looking at versus other areas (foveated rendering), which can provide a variety of advantages. Eye tracking can also be used for reducing power consumption (e.g., the screen dims when the user isn’t looking at it). Eye Tracking M&A Below are a few eye tracking acquisitions. Note that there have been a number of eyerelated security biometric deals, but these are covered in the chapter on biometric security. There have been relatively few eye tracking M&A transactions, likely because eye tracking has not yet gained significant traction in high volume products yet. This could change if the technology becomes more commonplace in consumer and virtual reality solutions. Page 21 Alcon/SMI’s Ophthalmic Unit – In November 2012, Alcon announced that it acquired the Ophthalmic division of SMI, a private company based in Berlin (discussed below). SMI addresses a variety of eye tracking markets, but sold off its Ophthalmic unit (which specializes in ocular surgery guidance technology) to Alcon. Facebook/SiteHawk – In March 2012, SiteHawk announced that its team was“joining the Facebook team.” SiteHawk developed eye tracking technology that used conventional Web cameras (rather than any special infrared or other type of specialized hardware). SiteHawk noted that the deal was only for the team and that its existing products were not part of the deal and remain independent of Facebook. TandemLaunch/Mirametrix – In 2011, TandemLaunch (an accelerator/incubator for tech companies) acquired Mirametrix, a private company that developed eye tracking technologies and solutions. The following are brief overviews of some eye tracking companies: Tobii Tobii has developed a number of eye tracking solutions. Its products incorporate near-IR micro-projectors, optical sensors, and image processing software to determine the location a person is looking at. The Company has several business units: Dynovox (which is focused on eye tracking for users that have ALS, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s or other medical issues that prevent natural hand movement); Pro (eye tracking for market research); Tech (for OEMs looking to integrate eye tracking), and EyeX (an eye tracking controller that Tobii sells to consumers and developers). In a September 2015 investor presentation, Tobii indicated that Dynovox and Pro accounted for about 73% and 21% of revenue, respectively. Although consumer applications historically represented only a relatively small portion of sales, the company has announced a number of video games that utilize its eye tracking (Assassin’s Creed Rouge, Flight Simulator, etc.) and that it is targeting a variety of high volume end markets. Tobii also supports power consumption reducing features such as dimming the screen if the user is not looking at it and keeping the screen awake if the user is looking (even if they hadn’t touched a key for several minutes). Tobii also powers biometric facial recognition for Windows 10 (Windows Hello). Tobii has announced its own ASIC (EyeChip) for eye tracking which can make implementation easier for some applications and further optimizes performance. Tobii is based in Norway with offices in the U.S., Germany, Japan and China. company went public on the NASDAQ Stockholm market in April 2015. Page 22",

      "text": "\nApple has attracted derision for its new MacBook Pro laptops, not only because it lacks ports, but also because it features a tiny touch sensitive screen which seemed to cram much too much functionality into too small an area.\nNow a Microsoft patent application has surfaced, applied for well before the MacBook Pro unveil, on July 25, 2016, for a “KEYBOARD WITH INPUT-SENSITIVE DISPLAY DEVICE”.\nThe keyboard is designed primarily to ease text entry for Asian phonic languages where Microsoft notes that the routine method of text entry has an error rate of 20% or worse, making the manual correction of entered text (from a potential of 1600 characters) a tedious part of writing which normally involved stopping what you are doing and moving your hands from the keyboard to the mouse, scrolling from a selection of auto-correct suggestions, making a selection and then having to return the cursor to the text and starting the next character.\nMicrosoft’s invention features an additional screen which may be detachable or form part of the keyboard and which shows suggestions for characters entered and simplifies the process of correction of text entered.\nMicrosoft notes that besides being used to text entry correction it could also be used for other tasks, such as user interface navigation, and for other functions such as drawing on or acting a notification manager.\n\nAs some-one who produces both an OS and hardware such as the excellent range of Microsoft keyboard and mice Microsoft is well positioned to bring such a device to life, though I suppose the need for such as accessory will depend largely on how annoying it actually is to enter Kanji on a Roman keyboard.\nThe full patent can be seen at the USPTO here .\n",

      "text": "Voip-Pal Responds to Apple’s Inter Partes Review Petitions November 22, 2016 05:00 ET | Source: Voip-Pal.Com Inc. BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov. 22, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Voip-Pal.com, Inc. (“Voip-Pal,” the “Company”) (OTCQB:VPLM) is pleased to announce that on November 18, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) declined to institute an Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) filed by Unified Patents Inc. against Voip-Pal’s Routing, Billing and Rating (“RBR”) Patents, Patent No. 8,542,815 (“815”) and Patent No. 9,179,005. \n“We are pleased that the PTAB confirmed that the allegations made by Unified Patents are completely without merit,” said Emil Malak, CEO of Voip-Pal. The decision cannot be appealed by Unified Patents. \nOn November 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its decisions to institute two Inter Partes Reviews (“IPRs”), IPR2016-01201 and IPR2016-1198, filed by Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") against the ‘815 and ‘005 Patents. The PTAB indicated that its decision is preliminary in nature: \"At this preliminary stage, the PTAB has not made a final determination with respect to the patentability of the challenged claims or any underlying factual and legal issues.\" \nBy instituting the IPRs, the PTAB has decided that a full review process is necessary to fully vet the arguments of both parties, and to resolve certain factual and/or legal issues before reaching a final decision. While Voip-Pal is disappointed that the PTAB considered it necessary to conduct this detailed review, it is not surprising given the complexity of certain technical and historical issues. \nIn its response to Apple’s IPR petition, Voip-pal strongly argued that Apple has fundamentally misunderstood key aspects of the primary reference, and has mischaracterized its proposed combination of the primary reference with each of the secondary references. Given the opportunity to now present evidence from its own experts, Voip-Pal expects to prevail in showing that Apple’s fundamental errors undermine the allegations made by Apple. \nAlso, as Voip-Pal noted in its preliminary responses to the PTAB, both of the grounds asserted by Apple in its IPR petitions rely on secondary references that are not prior art to the RBR patents. Voip-Pal fully expects to antedate (i.e. \"swear behind\") these references based on evidence that was not considered by the PTAB. \nFinally, the PTAB's decision indicates that certain arguments made by Voip-Pal will require additional support, which would typically be submitted in the form of expert declarations during the proceedings. In particular, the PTAB indicates that evidence is required to support Voip-Pal's contention that the primary reference discloses a scheme that is incompatible with the methods disclosed by the secondary references, (Voip-Pal has retained experts to provide evidence in support of its contentions). \n“Voip-Pal will vigorously advance its position and will file additional evidence before the PTAB, where we ultimately expect to be successful in showing that Apple’s petitions lack merit,” said Emil Malak, CEO. \nMr. Malak continued, \"We acknowledge the concerns of the many irate Voip-Pal shareholders who see different treatment between the detailed factual analysis that accompanied the decision not to institute the Unified Patents Inter Partes Review (IPR) on Friday and the lack of analysis, by the same panel, for the decision to institute the Apple IPR's dealing with the same patent on Monday. While we recognize the apparent disparity, we want to assure shareholders that the Inter Partes Review is a judicial, not a political process, and we are confident that the technical merit of the patents will prevail in the hearings.\" About Voip-Pal.com Inc.

      "text": "I could start this post with a snarky comment about how often Samsung is “inspired” by Apple’s design choices, but it happens so often that there’s about a 95% chance that whatever joke I would make has not only already been made, but that it’s probably even been written by me somewhere else on the internet. So, let’s just cut to the chase: Samsung is reportedly taking on the Jet Black iPhone 7 with a glossy black model of its S7 flagship just in time for holiday shoppers. Neat.\nDON’T MISS: Samsung has one of the absolute worst Black Friday deals in history\nThe Korea Herald reports that Samsung is poised to add a second shade of black to its Galaxy S7 lineup that will be more glossy than the black model. The report hedges its assertions on the word of anonymous “industry sources,” but as far as rumors go, this one really isn’t all that much of a stretch.\nThe demand for the Jet Black version of the iPhone 7 has been well documented, with initial supplies selling out immediately and shipments pushed out for weeks shortly after launch. Apple inventory tracking site iStockNow shows that Apple Stores are still having trouble keeping Jet Black versions of the iPhone 7 Plus in stock, though supply of the regular iPhone 7 in Jet Black seems to be catching up.\nWith that in mind, and with the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco still very close in Samsung’s rear view mirror, it wouldn’t be shocking to see the company try to capitalize on the glossy black feeding frenzy with an even shinier model of its S7, especially considering that there will be no flagship Note to tout for the 2016 shopping season.\nTrending right now:\nHow to get a NES Classic without spending $300 Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more The 5 best Black Friday sales you can shop right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple Reportedly Abandons Development of Wireless Routers AirPort routers' work has been reportedly abandoned Employees are being shifted to other divisions There is no official announcement from Apple yet \nIn a bid to put all its focus on its bulk revenue generating products, Apple has reportedly abandoned development of its wireless Wi-Fi routers. Employees in the Wi-Fi router team are now being shifted to divisions focused on the iPhone, iPad, and even Apple TV. \nBloomberg reports that this move is due to the insignificant revenue generation from the AirPort router lineup, and the company's strategic push to focus on its money-making products only. The Wi-Fi routers along with different products, which create Apple's 'Others' product category, have constituted for only 5 percent of total sales in the 2016 fiscal. \nThe report cites unnamed people familiar with the matter to claim that the team focused on routers has been spread across other departments over the course of this year. It's worth noting that Apple has not refreshed its routers since 2013 , hinting further that it has no plans of supporting the lineup any further. Currently, Apple sells three wireless routers - the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule. The cost of these routers is Rs. 7,900 ($99 in US), Rs. 15,900 ($199 in US), and Rs. 24,500 ($299 in US) respectively. The AirPort Time Capsule is the most expensive as it doubles as a backup storage hard drive as well for Mac computers. It comes in two storage variants - 2TB for Rs. 24,500 and 3TB for Rs. 32,500. These routers are still listed on the company's official website , and there is no confirmation from Apple regarding its abandoning plans.\nApple has been discontinuing other its small products, such as its standalone monitors. In June, Apple issued a statement saying the current Thunderbolt Display will only be available till stock lasts , but it won't replenish stocks. The company was expected to launch a refreshed 5K display lineup this October, but that didn't happen. Instead, Apple introduced a new partnership with LG for selling new high-resolution 5K screens .",

      "text": "A link to a video, which when watched slows down any iPhone until it crashes, is being used as the latest iPhone crash prank.\nThe video from the Sina Weibo-backed video sharing app Miaopai plays normally in the iPhone’s video player. Once the video is finished it can take up to a minute for the iPhone to lock up, requiring a forced reboot to recover it.\nMost people are unaware anything has happened, continuing to use their smartphone until it either won’t turn back on or locks up in an app, the home screen or with a spinning loading logo on a black screen.\nThe bug, which appears to involve the media handling functions of iOS, affects versions of the operating system as far back as iOS 5 and devices from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 7 . The older the smartphone, the faster the lockup occurs.\nThe lockup is not permanent, but requires a soft reset or forced reboot to recover the functionality of the iPhone.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Video demonstrating the bug with various versions of the iPhone and iOS.\nOn an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus users will need to hold down the power and down volume buttons until they see the Apple logo. On the iPhone 6S , 6S Plus or older Apple smartphones, users need to hold down the power and home buttons until they see the Apple logo.\nOnce the iPhones reboot, everything appears to function as normal.\nApple’s iPhone has a history of strange links and bugs bcrashing the device as a prank. In January, a link sent to an iPhone user and opening in Safari would crash the browser and force the smartphone to reboot. The bug also affected Android devices and computers, although to a lesser extent.\nPerhaps the most prolific crash bug prank for the iPhone used the “effective power” text message that caused the recipients’ smartphone to crash without needing to be opened.\nApple has not replied to a request for comment.\nWi-Fi hack creates ‘no iOS zone’ that cripples iPhones and iPads",

      "text": "If you’re angling to get a new MacBook Pro but aren’t up for spending a minimum of $1799 to pick up a model featuring Apple’s new Touch Bar, Amazon is currently selling Apple’s entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans the Touch Bar) for just $1399. All told, that represents a $100 discount compared to what you’ll find anywhere else.\nDON’T MISS: Samsung says the Galaxy S7 isn’t prone to explosions like the Note 7\nSpec wise, the machine sports a 13.3-inch display, a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, a revamped keyboard design, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB worth of storage. Sure, you may not get Apple’s newfangled Touch Bar, but seeing as how it’s been quite a few years since Apple refreshed its MacBook Pro line in a meaningful way, this particular deal is worth paying attention to if you need a new machine and aren’t keen on breaking the bank this holiday shopping season.\nFor what it’s worth, reviews of Apple’s new MacBook Pro line up have been mostly positive. The Touch Bar aside, reviewers have found the machine to be faster than the specs would otherwise indicate. Additionally, battery life was found to be superb.\nWe should also mention that Apple’s new MacBook Pro models are incredibly light and weigh in at just a hair over 3 pounds. If you’re still toting around an old Apple notebook, you’ll definitely notice an immediate weight difference once you upgrade to one of Apple’s newer models. In effect, Apple managed to roll out a MacBook Pro in a MacBook Air’s body.\nTo this point, Ars writes:\nAt 3.02 pounds, the new Pro is around half a pound lighter than last year’s and roughly the same weight as the 13-inch MacBook Air. I’m jumping from the 13-inch Air to the 13-inch Pro since I can’t quite live with the 12-inch MacBook’s performance or its individual port, so if you’re making that jump the laptop is going to feel exactly the same in your bag. The weight savings is noticeable but not life-changing if you’re coming from an earlier Retina model, but remember that it’s a full 1.5 pounds lighter than a pre-Retina, 13-inch unibody Pro—if you’re coming from one of those older machines, it makes a huge difference.\nMake sure to check the deal out over at Amazon while it’s still hot.\nTrending right now:\nSay goodbye to Apple’s Wi-Fi routers How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 Every movie and TV show being removed from Netflix in November See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "As part of a broader effort to refocus on products that contribute substantially to its bottom line, Apple is reportedly planning. According to a new report from Bloomberg , Apple has disbanded the division responsible the company’s AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule products. In turn, engineers from the recently disbanded division have since been reassigned to other product areas within Apple.\nDON’T MISS: Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more\nThat Apple would say goodbye to its router development efforts shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. After all, Apple hasn’t updated its aforementioned lineup of routers since 2013, itself a strong hint that Apple didn’t see a solid future for said products. Additionally, we’ve already seen Apple begin to streamline its already streamlined product line up as of late, with the company reportedly exiting the external monitor business as well.\nApple’s AirPorts have historically lagged behind those of companies such as D-Link Corp., Netgear Inc. and Belkin International Inc., which have rushed to adopt new standards. Apple, which has charged more for its routers, has focused more on integrating control of its devices into its computer operating system and industrial design. The company’s decision to leave the business may be a boon for other wireless router makers.\nCommenting briefly on the matter, Kirk McElhearn astutely points out Apple killing its router division was arguably long overdue.\n“Frankly, it’s about time,” McElhearn notes. “They’ve been limping along, unable to keep up with new technology. I used to really like Apple’s AirPort hardware, but somewhere in the past few years, it started to suck. They never updated the AirPort Express for 802.11ac, making their hardware useless in any but the smallest setups.”\nFair points all around. Incidentally, Apple’s trio of routers are still available for purchase on Apple’s website.\nTrending right now:\nHow to get a NES Classic without spending $300 Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more The 5 best Black Friday sales you can shop right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "​Apple was one of the companies that laughed at Microsoft’s investments in the Surface lineup from the very beginning, with CEO Tim Cook himself poking fun at the idea of mixing tablets and keyboards. And now, the iPhone maker itself is focusing on 2-in-1 devices with the iPad Pro, which gives Microsoft the opportunity of goofing on its rival for copying a strategy that it didn’t believe it can work. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is the latest high-profile Redmond executive who did that, as the Steve Ballmer successor talked about the success of the Surface in an interview with AFR. “Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,” he said. “Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a ...",

With this move, Apple is trying to shift its focus on consumer products that generate most of the company’s revenues. Citing sources, Bloomberg reports that Apple started shutting down its wireless router team since last year and the development groups have been reassigned to other product areas within the company, such as Apple TV. Currently, Apple TV wirelessly connects to a router allowing users to stream shows, movies and games on the TV. By bringing engineers who understand networking and connectivity, the company could be preparing to set up Apple TV for playing a bigger role in internet-connected homes.

      "text": " 00am Comments Share: BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov. 22, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Voip-Pal.com, Inc. (\"Voip-Pal,\" the \"Company\") (OTCQB: VPLM ) is pleased to announce that on November 18, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") declined to institute an Inter Partes Review (\"IPR\") filed by Unified Patents Inc. against Voip-Pal's Routing, Billing and Rating (\"RBR\") Patents, Patent No. 8,542,815 (\"815\") and Patent No. 9,179,005. \n\"We are pleased that the PTAB confirmed that the allegations made by Unified Patents are completely without merit,\" said Emil Malak, CEO of Voip-Pal. The decision cannot be appealed by Unified Patents. \nOn November 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its decisions to institute two Inter Partes Reviews (\"IPRs\"), IPR2016-01201 and IPR2016-1198, filed by Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") against the ‘815 and ‘005 Patents. The PTAB indicated that its decision is preliminary in nature: \"At this preliminary stage, the PTAB has not made a final determination with respect to the patentability of the challenged claims or any underlying factual and legal issues.\" \nBy instituting the IPRs, the PTAB has decided that a full review process is necessary to fully vet the arguments of both parties, and to resolve certain factual and/or legal issues before reaching a final decision. While Voip-Pal is disappointed that the PTAB considered it necessary to conduct this detailed review, it is not surprising given the complexity of certain technical and historical issues. \nIn its response to Apple's IPR petition, Voip-pal strongly argued that Apple has fundamentally misunderstood key aspects of the primary reference, and has mischaracterized its proposed combination of the primary reference with each of the secondary references. Given the opportunity to now present evidence from its own experts, Voip-Pal expects to prevail in showing that Apple's fundamental errors undermine the allegations made by Apple. \nAlso, as Voip-Pal noted in its preliminary responses to the PTAB, both of the grounds asserted by Apple in its IPR petitions rely on secondary references that are not prior art to the RBR patents. Voip-Pal fully expects to antedate (i.e. \"swear behind\") these references based on evidence that was not considered by the PTAB. \nFinally, the PTAB's decision indicates that certain arguments made by Voip-Pal will require additional support, which would typically be submitted in the form of expert declarations during the proceedings. In particular, the PTAB indicates that evidence is required to support Voip-Pal's contention that the primary reference discloses a scheme that is incompatible with the methods disclosed by the secondary references, (Voip-Pal has retained experts to provide evidence in support of its contentions). \n\"Voip-Pal will vigorously advance its position and will file additional evidence before the PTAB, where we ultimately expect to be successful in showing that Apple's petitions lack merit,\" said Emil Malak, CEO. \nMr. Malak continued, \"We acknowledge the concerns of the many irate Voip-Pal shareholders who see different treatment between the detailed factual analysis that accompanied the decision not to institute the Unified Patents Inter Partes Review (IPR) on Friday and the lack of analysis, by the same panel, for the decision to institute the Apple IPR's dealing with the same patent on Monday. While we recognize the apparent disparity, we want to assure shareholders that the Inter Partes Review is a judicial, not a political process, and we are confident that the technical merit of the patents will prevail in the hearings.\" About Voip-Pal.com Inc.

      "text": "Posted By: News Voip-Pal Responds to Apple’s Inter Partes Review Petitions BELLEVUE, Wash., Nov. 22, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Voip-Pal.com, Inc. (“Voip-Pal,” the “Company”) (OTCQB:VPLM) is pleased to announce that on November 18, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) declined to institute an Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) filed by Unified Patents Inc. against Voip-Pal’s Routing, Billing and Rating (“RBR”) Patents, Patent No. 8,542,815 (“815”) and Patent No. 9,179,005. \n“We are pleased that the PTAB confirmed that the allegations made by Unified Patents are completely without merit,” said Emil Malak, CEO of Voip-Pal. The decision cannot be appealed by Unified Patents. \nOn November 21, 2016, the PTAB issued its decisions to institute two Inter Partes Reviews (“IPRs”), IPR2016-01201 and IPR2016-1198, filed by Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") against the ‘815 and ‘005 Patents. The PTAB indicated that its decision is preliminary in nature: \"At this preliminary stage, the PTAB has not made a final determination with respect to the patentability of the challenged claims or any underlying factual and legal issues.\" \nBy instituting the IPRs, the PTAB has decided that a full review process is necessary to fully vet the arguments of both parties, and to resolve certain factual and/or legal issues before reaching a final decision. While Voip-Pal is disappointed that the PTAB considered it necessary to conduct this detailed review, it is not surprising given the complexity of certain technical and historical issues. \nIn its response to Apple’s IPR petition, Voip-pal strongly argued that Apple has fundamentally misunderstood key aspects of the primary reference, and has mischaracterized its proposed combination of the primary reference with each of the secondary references. Given the opportunity to now present evidence from its own experts, Voip-Pal expects to prevail in showing that Apple’s fundamental errors undermine the allegations made by Apple. \nAlso, as Voip-Pal noted in its preliminary responses to the PTAB, both of the grounds asserted by Apple in its IPR petitions rely on secondary references that are not prior art to the RBR patents. Voip-Pal fully expects to antedate (i.e. \"swear behind\") these references based on evidence that was not considered by the PTAB. \nFinally, the PTAB's decision indicates that certain arguments made by Voip-Pal will require additional support, which would typically be submitted in the form of expert declarations during the proceedings. In particular, the PTAB indicates that evidence is required to support Voip-Pal's contention that the primary reference discloses a scheme that is incompatible with the methods disclosed by the secondary references, (Voip-Pal has retained experts to provide evidence in support of its contentions). \n“Voip-Pal will vigorously advance its position and will file additional evidence before the PTAB, where we ultimately expect to be successful in showing that Apple’s petitions lack merit,” said Emil Malak, CEO. \nMr. Malak continued, \"We acknowledge the concerns of the many irate Voip-Pal shareholders who see different treatment between the detailed factual analysis that accompanied the decision not to institute the Unified Patents Inter Partes Review (IPR) on Friday and the lack of analysis, by the same panel, for the decision to institute the Apple IPR's dealing with the same patent on Monday. While we recognize the apparent disparity, we want to assure shareholders that the Inter Partes Review is a judicial, not a political process, and we are confident that the technical merit of the patents will prevail in the hearings.\" About Voip-Pal.com Inc.

      "text": "× Apple offers free battery replacement for iPhone 6S shutdown problem \nApple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n“A very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. \nIt didn’t provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. \nThe phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. \nSamsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement.

A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease”— when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.

      "title": "Jony Ive’s redesigned Christmas tree is a tree without the Christmassy bits",
      "text": "  \nLast month we heard that Apple design guru Jony Ive and long-time friend and collaborator Marc Newson had agreed to design this year’s festive tree for the lobby of Claridge’s, one of London’s most prestigious hotels. \nIt’s a tradition that started in 2009, with designers such as Burberry’s Christopher Bailey, Dolce & Gabbana, and John Galliano all having offered their personal take on the Christmas tree in years past. \nClaridge’s has just unveiled Ive and Newson’s work for Christmas 2016, and while the entire installation fills the whole lobby, the tree itself is – as we expected – a minimalist effort. And then some. \nSure, it’s an evergreen conifer, but it looks to have been designed by someone who didn’t have time to get to the store to buy some decorations. Because the tree has nothing on it. \nPerhaps Ive was too busy with other tasks such as designing the next version of the MacBook Pro to unapologetically put back in all the ports that Apple recently removed , though with Ive and Newson’s shared taste for simplicity, it’s safe to assume this is exactly how they wanted it. \nAs for the hotel, on its website it says – probably with some relief – that this year’s design is “much more than a Christmas tree.” \nRelated: 8 things we’ve learned about Jony Ive, from Jony Ive \nWorking with acclaimed British set designer Michael Howells, Ive and Newson have come up with a “magical, snow-covered forest [featuring] four-meter-high light boxes that glow with black-and-white photographic images of snow-covered silver birch trees, set on a pure white floor.” \nIn a joint message posted on Claridge’s website, Ive and Newson offered a few words about the inspiration for their design: “There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology. \n“Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.” \nSo what do you think? How does it compare to the pair’s other collaborations, such as the one-off Leica camera or their solid gold earpods ?",

A patent spotted by MSPU shows that Microsoft designed a technology that allowed a keyboard to be fitted with a secondary screen which could have played several roles, including offering text suggestions to improve typing in a way that’s similar to smartphones.

      "text": "Apple's Jony Ive Decorated A Christmas Tree With Minimalistic Vision, And You Probably Won't Want One 22 November 2016, 4:10 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Jony Ive designed the new Christmas tree at Claridge, and you may be sure that it lived up to his reputation. It is minimal and magical, but a number of people are disappointed for its lack of adornments. ( Claridge ) Advertisement \nApple fans probably know who Jony Ive is, but for the uninitiated, he is the top design honcho at Cupertino and is credited for the refined and minimalist look of today's iPhones , iOS devices and Macs . Well, he designed this Christmas tree at one of London's luxury hotels, and when it was unveiled, the world gave a collective sigh of disappointment. Jony Ive Designs Christmas \nCertainly, one expects a minimalist tone to Ive's Christmas tree, taking cue from the design language of Apple's products . But a number of us mere mortals might not appreciate that such minimalism gave us probably the world's least lighted and least festive Christmas tree ever. \n\"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,\" Ive said in a joint statement with co-designer Marc Newson. \"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\" \nDespite being wrapped up in the nobility and simple beauty of those words there remains the fact that the trees standing at Claridge's lobby today are nothing more than just trees. \nCutting a bunch of pines and dumping them at Claridge seems a more straightforward way of describing what has been accomplished. All-Enveloping Magic \nTo be fair, Ive and Newson appeared to be gunning for the atmosphere rather than the visual interpretation of Christmas. So they recreated an entire forest with the help of black-and-white photographs and lighting installations. This last, which included 4-meter light boxes, must have been Ive and Newson's interpretation of the Christmas light. The duo is adamant that they want to capture an all-enveloping magical experience. (Photo : Claridge) Criticism \nThere are those who will probably argue that if one wants to experience the forest, they could just go to a forest and not Claridge. Some observers, who expect to see something festive and Christmassy mercilessly savaged the design by simply saying that it's terrible . Some are more forgiving, noting that it is peaceful and certainly not gaudy. \nThe Claridge Christmas tree is one of the most anticipated Christmas installations in London. The hotel maintains a tradition of employing popular designers to implement their own interpretations of Christmas tree. Last year, Burberry's Christopher Bailey decorated a tree with 100 gold and silver umbrellas.  ",

      "text": "Apple rumored to stop producing wireless routers The Airport Extreme has been one of Apple's most popular routers. (Source: Apple) Users of Apple's WiFi routers hoping for a refresh may be out of luck. by Sam Medley, 2016/11/21 Accessory Apple Business Rumor   First monitors, now routers. Citing unnamed sources, Bloomberg reported today that Apple has disbanded their wireless router development team. This move will effectively kill the Cupertino giant’s AirPort line of WiFi routers. Apple’s AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule routers were once fairly popular among consumers, marketed as devices that would act as a useful component in the Apple ecosystem. The line of routers hasn’t been updated since 2013, however, and the lack of a refresh has resulted in stagnant sales. Lumped under the “Other Products” category for revenue reporting, the routers counted for less than 5% of Apple’s sales in 2016. The AirPort routers are made to seamlessly integrate with other Apple products, allowing features like automatic storage backup over a wireless network or music streaming from an iPhone or iPod to speakers connected to a router. Though AirPort routers are not known for pushing WiFi technology and wireless standards, they are nonetheless well regarded for their simple setup and ease of use. It’s unknown if Apple will stop making AirPort routers at this point. This move, should it be true, would follow Apple’s exit from external monitors announced in October this year. Instead of manufacturing and selling their own monitors, Apple has opted instead to work with third parties like LG.  ",

      "text": "Posted By: Arash Fekri   Technology Page 1 of 2 1 2 » \nApple is expected to launch its most awaited gadget iPad Pro 2, early in 2017. The Cupertino-based tech giant will allegedly launch its biggest iPad, having a display size of 12.9-inch, which also comes packed with exciting features. \nApple will also launch three new iPads in the upcoming year. \nMing-Chi Kuo, who happens to be a very well-known analyst of the industry has laid out a few details about the specifications of the three upcoming iPads. The trio of iPads will be introduced in Apple’s March event. \nThe iPads of Apple’s iPad Pro 2 series will have screen sizes of 9.7 inch, 10.5-inch, and 12.9-inch. \nA few images of the iPads have been shared by Apple Insider. In the images, we get a glimpse of the settings app, which displays the device’s model number MH1C2CD/F. As the number does not conform to Apple’s numbering system, so the images can either be real or fake, as far as the number is concerned. \nAccording to a report by MacOtakara of Japan, the iPad Pro 2 will be almost bezel-free or, to say the least, will support thinner bezels than those that we see in the standard present generation of iPad Pro. The iPad Pro was introduced with a storage capacity of 256GB, so presumably the new iPads might with the same storage ability as well. \nHowever, gossips suggest that they might also be coming in 128GB and 32GB. It is being said that the base model of 32GB will not be best suited for an iPad Pro. \nGiven, how the Rose Gold is offered for all of Apple’s new products, it will not take much time before the color is made available for these latest additions to the Apple family. PC Advisor, in a recent post, informed its readers about the prices for Apple’s new iPad Pro 2. \nThe 12.9-inch device of 32GB might be coming at $799, while the 128GB handset will be priced around $949 and the 256GB model is priced $1099. \nHowever, if Wi-Fi and cellular charges are added to these devices, then the prices will pretty obviously change. The 128GB model will cost $1079, and the 256GB model will feature then, an asking price of $1229. Apart from the display of these iPad Pros being bezel-less, the handsets will reportedly be powered by an A11 chipset and 3GB of RAM. \nApple has been adhering to a strict policy of silence regarding many of its products, one of which includes the iPad Pro 2. Many Apple fans were left disappointed when Apple iPad Pro 2, did not make an appearance at the latest Apple event. \nNot losing hope so easily, the fans are eagerly expecting a big overhaul to the iPad line-up in the coming year. \nThe inclusion of a Touch ID feature in the Apple MacBook may serve as a hint, that a host of thrilling new features may be coming to the Apple iPad Pro 2, as it releases in 2017. To name a few features anticipated to be present in the gadget are Four Speakers, Smart Connector, True Tone Display and a 12MP primary iSight camera equipped with True Tone flash. \nReleasing by the spring of 2017, the Japanese blog MacOtakara predicts that the device will come in three variants having displays of 7.9-inch, 10.1-inch, and 12.9-inch. Keeping with Apple’s trend of dropping the 3.5mm headphone jack, Apple is sticking to its decision in the case of the Apple iPad Pro 2 as well. Page 1 of 2 1 2 »",

      "text": "Microsoft Also Considered a Keyboard with a Screen Like Apple’s Touch Bar GO Patent shows Redmond had this in mind earlier this year Nov 22, 2016 11:00 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Apple launched the new MacBook last month with a Touch Bar that provides users with a unique input method, but it appears that Microsoft itself was this close to bringing in production its very version of a keyboard with a secondary screen. A patent spotted by MSPU shows that Microsoft designed a technology that allowed a keyboard to be fitted with a secondary screen which could have played several roles, including offering text suggestions to improve typing in a way that’s similar to smartphones. Called “ Keyboard with input-sensitive display device ,” this patent was filed on July 25, 2016, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that Microsoft thought of it first. Apple only launched the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro last month, but the company was most likely working on it since the last year, as planning and development usually take quite a lot of time. How text correction could work In the summary section of the patent, Microsoft explains the way its keyboard equipped with a secondary screen could have worked: “Other aspects of the invention involve a method for input correction. The method includes displaying, on a secondary display, a first text unit, such as a character or a word, which corresponds with a second text unit shown on a primary display screen of a computing device. The method further involves receiving user selection of the first text unit and replacing the second text unit with the first text unit. The secondary display may include a touch sensitive display screen and the step of receiving the user selection of the first text unit may include sensing the user touching the touch sensitive display screen.” As you can see in the drawing, however, the keyboard wasn’t necessarily build to be used on laptops, but more on desktop computers, so there’s still a chance to see it in production at some point in the future. Of course, there’s no doubt that if Redmond ever launches such a product, it’s probably just a matter of time until someone accuses Microsoft of copying Apple’s idea, and this doesn’t align with its strategy of “inventing new product categories.” ",

      "text": "print Apple has announced a one-day shopping event this Friday. Yana Paskova/Getty \nApple has announced a one-day shopping event this Friday via a new section on its website, rejoining the Black Friday tradition it dropped last year. \nThe Cupertino company appears to be focusing its Black Friday efforts on ecommerce this year. The dedicated web page says the fastest way to shop the event will be via the Apple Store app and there will be free two-day delivery on almost everything on the day. However, Apple is also extending its retail store opening hours across the holiday period, which includes Black Friday on November 25. \nThe website does not yet include details on the products and discounts available as part of the promotion. \nApple's decision to run the one-day shopping event this year follows its decision to drop the Black Friday retail tradition in 2015 to give staff a break . \n“Being good to your employees will always be good for business,” Apple's senior vice president of retail said in an interview last year when Black Friday discounts on Apple products were only available via third-party retailers . \nApple's brand new web page dedicated to its one-day shopping event this Friday. Apple \nBut this year, it seems, Black Friday is too good a retail opportunity to miss. \nThe web page announcing the event says: \"Friday can’t come soon enough. Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\" \nThe best discounts on Apple products, however, aren't always from the Apple store, DealNews features editor Benjamin Glaser writes . \n\"Everything from iPads to Apple Watches can be a great buy on Black Friday, with two big qualifiers: Buy one generation old, and don't buy from the Apple Store,\" Glaser said, \"Brand new devices don't see as significant discounts, and the Apple Store is always undercut by resellers like Best Buy and Micro Center.\" \nThird-party retailers have already been selling discounted Apple products this year. Target's Black Friday deals , which include discounts on Apple TV models and the Apple Watch Series 1, began almost two weeks ago.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Boss Pokes Fun at Apple’s “Converged Refrigerators and Toasters” GO Nadella proud that Apple copied Microsoft’s Surface 2-in-1 Nov 22, 2016 09:45 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ Apple was one of the companies that laughed at Microsoft’s investments in the Surface lineup from the very beginning, with CEO Tim Cook himself poking fun at the idea of mixing tablets and keyboards. And now, the iPhone maker itself is focusing on 2-in-1 devices with the iPad Pro, which gives Microsoft the opportunity of goofing on its rival for copying a strategy that it didn’t believe it can work. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is the latest high-profile Redmond executive who did that, as the Steve Ballmer successor talked about the success of the Surface in an interview with AFR . “Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned,” he said. “Does anybody need one? And now guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster, but it's actually a two-in-one.” The Surface success Truth be told, the Surface series has become very successful these days, acting as a catalyst for the Redmond software giant to continue investing in products that “invent new categories,” as the firm’s executives said on several occasions. In this context, Tim Cook’s statement that “you can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going be pleasing to the user” doesn’t make much sense and only gives Microsoft the chance to remind everyone that it’s the actual inventor of the 2-in-1 category that even Apple believes in these days. The battle between the two companies doesn’t seem to extend to laptops and desktops, or at least not for the time being. While Microsoft is investing at a fast pace in touch-capable laptops and all-in-one PCs, Apple prefers to stick with a traditional approach, explaining that mice and keyboards need to remain the main input method for everyone working with such devices. Microsoft is very sure that more partners would embrace its latest ideas, so nobody in Redmond would be too surprised to see Apple itself launching an iMac with a touchscreen.",

Beneath a canopy of natural green pine, models of Scottish pine trees are interspersed with both natural and photographed birch and fir trees.\nWhite light fades in and out on a continuous cycle to change the scene from day to night.\nImage: claridge's\nIn a press release, Ive and Newson said, “There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology.\n\"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognising our excitement about the future and things to come.\"\nImage: claridge's\nImage: claridge's\nThis is the seventh year that the hotel has invited an influential guest to reinterpret its Christmas tree design. In years prior , the Claridge's tree has been designed by creative representatives of Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, and Dior.\nBONUS: Starbucks holiday cups are here and America gets some much-needed feels",

      "text": "Apple Considered Building a Foldable iPhone at Some Point GO Patent shows Apple envisioned a clamshell-like iPhone Nov 22, 2016 12:44 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Apple is expected to roll out a major overhaul of the iPhone next year, but the company is expected to retain the existing form factor and go for moderate design changes that wouldn’t make the device entirely different from its predecessors. But a recent patent called “ Flexible display devices ” shows that Apple at least considered building a foldable iPhone, using an approach that reminds of the traditional clamshell design that old phones were based on. As you can see in the drawing here, the foldable iPhone would use several flexible parts, including a display that would allow the device to close shut, just like a typical clamshell phone. The patent claims that such a technology would use hinges made of metal, and Apple explains that they could be built from nickel and titanium, making them not only elastic, but also very durable. The top part of the phone would be used for incorporating features such as the camera, speakers, light sensors, and display controllers, and the device could rely on flexible circuit boards to connect the two parts. The lower section of the iPhone would house other components, such as the CPU and the processors, as well as microphones. The hinge can hold the display in any position Apple explains that in order to avoid stretching the display, it can be tensioned with tensioning structures, while the hinge could employ rotational detents to hold the screen in certain positions, according to users’ preferences. “The hinge may be configured to allow the flexible display to be placed in a front-to-front configuration in which an active side of the display faces itself or a back-to-back configuration. Engagement structures may be used to help the housing grip external objects and to hold the housing portions together. The hinges may be provided with rotational detents to help hold the flexible display in desired positions,” the patent reads. The patent undoubtedly sounds appealing for iPhone fans, but this is by no means a confirmation that Apple wants to build such a device. On the good side, Cupertino seems to be already looking into ways to significantly overhaul the iPhone, so the next few years are likely to bring major changes in terms of design and form factor.",

      "text": "Despite being locked in a consistent race to the peak of smartphone mountain, this year saw Apple surge ahead by default thanks to Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 debacle. And while you might have thought the South Korean giant would wait until the release of its Galaxy S8 in order to resume the fight, it apparently has other ideas. Following on from the bizarre release of the Coral Blue S7 variant, Sammy could be set to copy the iPhone 7's most popular colour - y'know, the shiny Jet Black one - in the hopes of luring users over to the dark side in time for Christmas. Related: Samsung Galaxy S8 release date, rumours, specs, news and price That's according to a fresh report from The Investor, which suggests that the company is planning to launch a glossy black version of the Galaxy S7 within the next month. Of course, what doesn't really make sense about this rumour is that Samsung already offers the handset in the Black Onyx colourway. Although, as we saw with the iPhone, this wouldn't necessarily stop two of the same colour being released - with one obviously aimed at people who gawp at shiny things. With the next generation of Sammy's non-explosive smartphone line set to drop in late February, releasing a fresh device now would appear to be an odd move. Still, it's better than sitting back and taking no action in the market while Apple continues to benefit. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Apple Invents Foldable iPhone That Can Clip Onto Your Clothes Posted by Killian Bell   \niPhone fans have been calling out for a new design, and although we’re expected big changes next year, Apple could have something even more special up its sleeve for the future. The company has patented a folding smartphone that can clip onto your clothes. \nGranted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, Apple’s patent is titled “Flexible display devices,” and it describes a smartphone with a flexible OLED display that can be folded in half — like the flip phones we all carried a decade ago. \nApple proposes the device could be made out of nitinol, a nickel and titanium alloy known for its elasticity, which would allow the phone to fold in the middle when it’s not in use. Its components would be housed in the top and bottom sections of the device. \nApple also suggests more than one design for the device. In addition to a model with a display that folds away, the company describes another option that leaves the display exposed on the outside, allowing it to be used even while the phone is folded up. \nWith the second design, Apple proposes adding a pattern to the phone’s housing that would provide grip and allow it to be clipped onto clothing. \n“The two pieces are attached via a single- or multi-shaft hinge mechanism supporting rotational motion, allowing the two housing portions to move relative one another,” explains AppleInsider. “Connections between upper and lower housing are accomplished through flexible printed circuit boards.” \nIt seems highly unlikely Apple would ever use a design like this now that clamshell phones are a thing of the past. It doesn’t really bring any advantages over the smartphone form factor we’re used to today, other than protecting the display when the phone is not in use. \nDon’t expect this particular patent to lead to much, then, but it’s interesting to see Apple is still working on all kinds of designs for the iPhone behind the scenes. \nApple is expected to use flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8 next year, but instead of allowing the device to fold in half, they will reportedly enable Apple to employ a new “all-glass” design with curved edges — similar to Samsung’s popular Galaxy S7 edge.",

      "text": "  09:00 AM EST Thanksgiving Travel Outlook: Big Apple and Cancun Are Top Destinations for Americans Travel Insurance Provider Allianz Global Assistance Releases the Thanksgiving Results from its 2016 Top 10 Holiday Destinations Report \nRICHMOND, VA--(Marketwired - November 22, 2016) - New York City and Cancun are this year's most popular domestic and international destinations for Thanksgiving travel amongst Americans, according to Allianz Global Assistance's Top 10 Holiday Destinations Report. \nAllianz Global Assistance reviewed more than 1.3 million plans made by Americans for travel during Thanksgiving (between 11/19/2016 - 11/27/2016). According to the report, the most popular destination for Americans is New York City. The top 10 domestic destinations ranked by popularity include: New York City, Los Angeles, Orlando, San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Newark, Las Vegas and Fort Lauderdale. \nInternationally, the American traveler is heading to Cancun for Thanksgiving followed by London, San Juan, Tokyo, Paris, Puerto Vallarta, San Jose Del Cabo, Hong Kong, Aruba and Sydney. \n\"Thanksgiving is a popular time to travel with family,\" said Daniel Durazo, director of communications for Allianz Global Assistance USA. \"While it's great for bonding, the high volume of travelers and uncertain weather conditions can make an unexpected trip delay or cancelation all the more likely and travel insurance all the more important. Allianz's Classic policy provides great benefits where kids 17 years old or younger are covered at no extra cost when traveling with a parent or grandparent.\"* \nAllianz Global Assistance offers travel insurance through most major U.S. airlines, leading travel agents, online travel agencies and directly to consumers. For more information on Allianz Global Assistance and the policies offered for travelers, please visit: http://www.allianztravelinsurance.com or like us on Facebook at Facebook.com/AllianzTravelInsuranceUS . \nMethodology: The data of U.S. travelers' booking intent to purchase flights around Thanksgiving was gathered by analyzing the number of customers that went through the online booking process of airfare and package paths for partners offering Allianz Global Assistance travel insurance to generate itineraries for travel around Thanksgiving (11/19/2016 - 11/27/2016). Below is a snapshot of that data to top U.S. and international cities.

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 13 minutes ago with 3 comments \nWhile many retailers are getting deals ready left and right, ahead of Black Friday, one company was expected to ignore the date entirely: Apple. Last year the company eschewed the special shopping day completely, but this time around it looks like the iPhone-marker will be joining in the commercial festivities. \nApple has been anxiously trying to prop up its falling sales numbers , and the launch of the iPhone 7 models have given the company a good opportunity to push inventory . Now, with Black Friday and the start of the holiday shopping season just around the corner the company is trying to further entice potential customers. \nThe company just put up a special teaser page , announcing a “one day shopping event”, on Black Friday. Showing an Apple watch together with the 25 th of November date, the page is teasing numerous deals coming later this week. \nApple is also reminding customers that it’s offering free two-day delivery for in-stock items ordered by 5:00 p.m. and that there’s an app available for those looking to do their Black Friday shopping on the go. \nUnfortunately, that’s the extent that Apple’s willing to share info for now, with the actual upcoming deals and discounts currently remaining a mystery.

      "title": "Center of attention: Apple cake brings everyone to the table | Variety Menu",
      "text": "Though I'm much more of a savory guy than a sweets guy, I can't resist a spiced, fruit-filled dessert as we transition from fall to winter. Fresh apples are delightful in tarte tatins and pies, but I leave those up to the master of the fruit pie herself, my wife Susi Cahn. I want to amp up my dessert game for the holidays this year, so I'm going for unsulfured dried apples to make an apple stack cake.\nAs an iconic American fruit, apples are prevalent in many of my favorite parts of the country. The Bardenhagen family grows fantastic Honey Crisp and Gala apples in northern Michigan, and we all know that my home state of Washington is a year-long apple fest. They're also cultivated in the farmlands of the mid-Atlantic, the very region highlighted in 2016's \"Big American Cookbook\" (Grand Central Life & Style), which inspired my modernized version of this recipe.\nMountain people are resourceful. With only a handful of ingredients, most of which hold up well in the pantry, this cake has been a sweet staple all along the Appalachian. This was a wedding cake made when a collection of thin cakes were gifted to the bride and assembled for the event -- a tall cake being the mark of a popular bride. It's a tale that may be taller than the cake itself, but fun to think about nonetheless.\nUnfrosted, this cake signifies the beautiful gesture of the homemade. Ginger and cinnamon lace the rich, caramel-like apple filling between molasses-spiced cake layers. Make this ahead for a holiday dessert or for a cozy weekend at home with family and friends. Don't worry about getting flowers for the table. This cake makes for the perfect centerpiece.\nApple Stack Cake\nServes 8 to 10\nFor the dried apple filling:\n1/2 pound (4 to 5 packed cups) unsulfured dried apples\n1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\nFor the cake layers:\n5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n3/4 cup vegetable shortening\n1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar\n1 cup molasses, preferably sorghum\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten(\n1 cup buttermilk\nConfectioners' sugar for icing\nFor the filling:\nIn a large saucepan, combine the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover.\nSimmer, stirring frequently, until the apples are tender and the filling is very thick, about 1 hour, adding more water if necessary. It should look like a thick apple sauce.\nTransfer the mixture to a food processor; pulse 8 to 10 times to make a chunky sauce. Set aside.\nFor the cake layers:\nPreheat the oven to 350 F. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, beat the shortening with the brown sugar and molasses with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the eggs and beat until smooth.\nAdd one-third of the flour mixture and incorporate. Then add half the buttermilk, and alternate until all the flour and buttermilk are mixed in. The dough should be thick.\nDivide the dough into 6 equal pieces, each about 10 ounces or a heaping cup. Wrap four of the pieces in plastic wrap. Pat one piece of the unwrapped dough into each of the prepared cake pans, making it about 1/2 inch thick. Bake until the cake is set, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool 10 minutes.\nRemove one cake from the pan and put it on a cake platter. Spread one-fifth of the apple filling, about 1 cup, evenly over the cake. Add the second cake and repeat.\nRepeat the baking step, preparing the cake pans with grease and flour, unwrapping two pieces of cake dough, pressing them into the pans, baking, and then adding them to the cake with filling. Then repeat again for the last two layers, leaving the top layer bare. Let the cake sit for several hours. Dust with sifted confectioners' sugar before serving.\n(Mario Batali is the chef behind 25 restaurants, including Eataly, Del Posto and his flagship Greenwich Village enoteca, Babbo.)\nShare Comment",

      "title": "Apple Is Teasing a Black Friday Sale for the First Time in Years",
      "text": "\nHoliday shoppers looking for a bargain on Apple gadgets may not have to turn to third-party retailers this Black Friday. On its website, the company is teasing a one-day sales event set to take place Nov. 25, prompting Apple fans to “save the date.”\nApple has not yet revealed which items will be on sale, but the Apple Watch is prominently displayed on the page. Shoppers ordering in-stock items through Apple’s website before 5 p.m. this Friday will also be eligible for free two-day delivery, the company says.\nApple didn’t offer any Black Friday specials last year. In previous years, it bundled iTunes gift cards with certain purchases made on the shopping holiday. The teaser for this year’s event hints at deals that may include discounts on specific gadgets rather than just gift cards. It’s unclear whether the deals will be online only or in-store as well, but the teaser page says to “Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.”\nApple’s Black Friday announcement comes as the company may be looking to boost sales around the holidays. Apple’s latest earnings results marked the third consecutive quarter in which year-over-year revenue had declined. And although Apple sold more iPhones than expected in the previous quarter, iPhone shipments fell by 5%, as CNBC notes .\nRetailers such as Target , Best Buy , and Walmart have already started promoting their Black Friday bargains on Apple products , including deals on Macs, iPhones, iPads, and the Apple Watch.\n",

There’s no information for which items will be discounted and by how much during the one-day sale, nor any indication of when the sale will start. Apple hasn’t offered its own Black Friday sale since 2014, opting to let other retailers handle the discounting of its products last year. Apple is offering free shipping for products ordered online, and items bought between November 10 and December 25 can be returned until January 8. In-store pickup is also available for online orders, and many Apple stores have extended hours listed online for the event.",

      "text": "Like the ruthless character of Negan on \"The Walking Dead,\" Apple has seized everything worthwhile from rivals in the smartphone industry.\nCanaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley on Monday estimated that Apple took 106% of smartphone industry profits in the third quarter. Its share is more than 100% because other vendors lost money in the business, resulting in Apple having more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall.\nApple's smartphone operating profit totaled $10.84 billion in Q3, vs. the industry total of $10.28 billion, Walkley said. Smartphone vendors that lost money in Q3 included Microsoft ( MSFT ), BlackBerry ( BBRY ), Lenovo, LG and HTC, he said. His report excludes a large portion of Chinese smartphone makers that do not provide profit information.\nEarlier this month, BMO Capital Markets estimated that Apple grabbed 104% of smartphone industry profits in Q3.",

      "text": "Apple dumps wireless router development, will exit the market Apple dumps wireless router development, will exit the market By Joel Hruska on November 22, 2016 at 9:23 am Comment \nApple has manufactured its own line of AirPort cards and routers for 17 years, dating back to the introduction of the original AirPort Base Station in 1999. Now, the company is apparently planning to kill its support for the AirPort division, not long after announcing it would also exit the display markets. It’s been more than three years since Apple announced a new base station (its last update, in 2013, added support for the 802.11ac standard), so this move isn’t entirely surprising — but it’s also a further sign that Apple is consolidating its product lines. \nThis new report comes courtesy of Bloomberg, which notes that router revenue is a tiny slice of Apple’s total sales. These products, along with its displays, Apple Watches, and Apple TV are all gathered in “other products,” and that division only accounts for about 5% of Apple’s sales, for a total fiscal 2016 estimated revenue of $11.1 billion. In and of itself, this isn’t likely to have much impact on the company’s bottom line, especially since there are cheaper, faster routers available these days from many other companies, and for less money. \nA potential longer-term issue, however, is the overall stickiness of Apple’s product family. One of the things Apple has historically done extremely well is create an ecosystem of products that tie together. Most manufacturers make only a passing effort to do this, but Apple focuses on it (or at least, focused on it) as a core competency. AirPort routers with Time Capsule offered backup capabilities that technically worked with both Windows and Mac PCs, but were integrated and supported better under OS X than their PC counterparts. At least in theory, you could buy your smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, router, display, and peripherals all from the same company, with an Apple Watch thrown in to boot, were you so inclined. An 802.11ac Apple Airport Extreme, disassembled by iFixit \nIt’s not surprising to see Apple cancelling older product lines that aren’t contributing to the company’s bottom line, but Cook has yet to articulate where or how he’ll replace these products with new hardware (and new revenue opportunities). It’s possible that the advent of cloud computing has Apple putting less emphasis on physical equipment and more on creating an ecosystem of products it can sell people as part of an Apple-centric cloud services standard. Certainly the company’s push into music streaming could be argued to support this trend, though Apple hasn’t really unveiled the kind of pervasive cloud ecosystem that companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have been focused on developing. For now, Apple has simply replaced its former dedicated product lines with third-party hardware sold through its own sites, and we know the company sharply pulled back on its self-driving car investments earlier this year. \nA cynic might conclude that Apple is battening down the hatches. Dongles can help raise margins , and killing underperforming products improves the bottom line, as does cancelling uncertain hardware. With the iPhone 8 rumored to adopt OLED screens and potentially a larger display, Apple seems to be putting more emphasis on making the kinds of moves Wall Street likely wants to see, as opposed to trying to push the envelope with new products. Then again, trying to anticipate fundamentally new technologies is extremely difficult, and one could argue that Jobs’ tremendous success owed much more to being in the right place at the right time than to any particular skill. Either way, Apple is trimming its product lines and investments — whether to gear up for something new or to protect its profits as smartphone growth slows remains to be seen. Tagged In",

      "text": "Reddit \nIt was reported yesterday that Apple is disbanding the division of the company responsible for its wireless networking products: the hard drive-equipped Time Capsule and both AirPort Extreme and AirPort Express routers. The report was given additional credence by recent discounts and the fact that the products haven’t been updated in more than three years. \nOn one level, the decision seems like a no-brainer for Apple. The company is in the premium product basis. Back in the days when Wi-Fi was a new thing, it made sense for Apple to boost adoption rates by offering its own products; now it’s ubiquitous, there’s no reason for the company to be in what is today a very mundane product category. \nBut if the news is confirmed, it will sadden me a little – and worry me slightly as well … \nSadden me because the Time Capsule in particular is a great one-stop solution for fully-automated Time Machine backups over Wi-Fi. A wise friend once said that any backup regime which requires user interaction – even something as simple as plugging in an external drive – is doomed to failure. A Time Capsule ensures hourly backups anytime the Mac is at home. I’ve pointed many friends to one as a fit-and-forget backup system. \nWhile any NAS product can do the same job, the Time Capsule is significantly more consumer-friendly than the average Network Attached Storage device. \nAs to why it worries me slightly, let’s look at the four possibilities I can see when Apple discontinues its routers. \nFirst, it could simply shrug and say everyone has Wi-Fi these days, so there’s no need for it to be in that business any more. Most cable and ADSL modems are wireless-enabled out of the box, so there’s no real reason for a typical consumer to buy anything else. For those using AirPort routers to add AirPlay functionality to wired speakers, it could perhaps offer a Chromecast-style dongle . \nSecond, it could do what it’s done with monitors, and move out of the business itself but form a partnership to recommend one or more third-party products – including a replacement for the Time Capsule. \nThird, it could add AirPort functionality to the Apple TV. That already contains most of the hardware required of a router, and most people already situate it close to their cable modem. Add a few antennas and it could fairly trivially replace an AirPort router. Perhaps the facility to connect an external hard drive could be added, or a new Apple TV product with significantly higher storage introduced. \nBut it’s a fourth possibility that worries me: that Apple could be trying to wean us all away from local backups altogether, and instead push us toward iCloud storage. \nApple has of course already done this for iOS devices. iCloud Backup is its recommended solution for backing-up both iPhones and iPads, with iTunes backups downgraded to an alternative. But the iCloud Drive changes introduced with macOS Sierra suggest that Apple also sees cloud storage as the future for Macs too. \nAs you may recall, I’m not exactly a fan of the current implementation – and more than two-thirds of you seem to share that view . But even when Apple resolves the problems, it’s still a much poorer solution than local backup for the vast majority of us who don’t spend our entire lives connected to always-on high-speed broadband. \nCould you imagine buying a new Mac, for example, and doing a restore from iCloud Drive instead of hooking up a local drive? It would take forever. \nYet Apple would seemingly argue today that we shouldn’t be doing this anyway. Why restore our entire machine when the documents are (or would be, if Apple got its way) all sitting on iCloud Drive waiting for us to download them as and when we need them? Apple’s view, it seems to me, is that local storage is old tech; the cloud is king now. \nSo I do worry that it may not just be wireless networking boxes that Apple discontinues, but – over a longer period – the whole concept of local backup too. A future version of Time Machine may go looking for those deleted and older documents on iCloud, not on a local drive. \nFor Apple – a company increasingly looking to sell services in order to generate recurring income between hardware spikes – the potential revenue it could generate from selling us the necessary iCloud storage tiers must look awfully appealing. \nWhat’s your view? Am I just being paranoid? Or does this represent one step along the way to an iCloud-first future for Mac backups – followed eventually by iCloud-only ones? As ever, please take our poll and share your thoughts in the comments. Guides",

DirecTV Now Part of Apple's Single Sign-On for iOS and Apple TV The new service arrives in December by Bryan M. Wolfe November 22, 2016 \nA big name has become part of Apple’s upcoming single sign-on feature for iOS and tvOS. DirecTV, with 20 million subscribers , becomes the largest provider to date to support the feature, which goes live before the end of the year. \nFirst introduced in September, single sign-on allows you to enter cable or satellite credentials in one place and access all of the available apps in your subscription package. The first developer beta for single sign-on launched earlier this month. At the time, it included four supported TV providers, Dish Network, Sling TV, GVTC Communications, and Hotwire. \nTying all of this together is the upcoming TV app for iOS and tvOS . The new app, which also launches in December, helps to unify the TV watching experience, allowing users to see all the shows and movies you’re watching, find upcoming episodes, and get personalized recommendations on what to watch next.",

      "text": "Apple teases a one-day Black Friday sale, a reversal from last year’s decision to sit out Posted   \nApple has changed its stance on Black Friday. The company, which is now teasing its upcoming one-day deals via a new web page , will again participate in the holiday shopping event after having famously sat out last year , then touting its decision as part of its mission to be “good to…employees.” The new site doesn’t detail what deals will be available, but does promote the company’s Apple Store App and free, two-day delivery while also encouraging consumers to check their local store’s extended hours. \nRetail store hours will differ by location, but many will offer expanded opening and closing times throughout the holidays in order to handle the increased foot traffic. \nMeanwhile, Apple’s focus on e-commerce sales is evidenced on the new Black Friday teaser page, which says that sales that take place during this one-day event will include free shipping, if orders are placed before 5 PM. The site doesn’t clarify if that’s 5 PM EST or PST, so it’s assumed that means 5 PM local time. Two-hour delivery is also available in select markets, thanks to Apple’s earlier partnership with Postmates. \nThe new page also points to a handful of curated gift collections, including music gifts, photography gifts, toys and games, and Apple gifts – the latter which is simply a listing of its top devices like iPhone, iPad, Macbook, Apple Watch, Apple TV and various accessories. \nApple’s decision to host a Black Friday event is noteworthy because the company last year had famously refused to participate in the holiday shopping frenzy – a move that signaled that the retailer didn’t really need the influx of sales that the event brings. After all, Apple generates billions in quarterly profits. However, as recent earnings have indicated, Apple’s smartphone business has been starting to slow, and it’s still too early to see how consumers will react to the newly-launched Macbook computers, in terms of real-world purchases. \nLast year, Apple’s SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts explained Apple’s decision to exit the shopping holiday because “being good to your employees will always be good for business.” Its new stance doesn’t necessarily mean those values of treating employees well have fallen by the wayside, but rather that Apple may have simply not liked what it saw in terms of the financial impact that came from sitting the event out.",

The older the smartphone, the faster the lockup occurs. \nThe lockup is not permanent, but requires a soft reset or forced reboot to recover the functionality of the iPhone. keyboard shortcuts: V vote up article J next comment K previous comment",

      "text": "By Sherisse Pham \nCUPERTINO, Calif. (CNN) — Apple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason.\nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries.\n“A very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. It didn’t provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark.\nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem.\n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group.\nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause.\nApple’s battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said.\nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down.\nThe company fixed the problem with an operating system update.\nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease” — when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor.\nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.\nThe-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "  After Last Year's Absence, Apple Could Be Prepping Black Friday Deals for 2016 Black Friday is Nov. 25 by Bryan M. Wolfe November 22, 2016 \nApple isn’t a company known for offering product discounts. That could change on Black Friday, Nov. 25. \nIn a Tuesday email to customers, Apple calls Friday “our one-day shopping event.” If true, this would be a big change from Black Friday 2015. \nLast year, Apple didn’t offer a single deal on the biggest shopping day of the year. At the time, Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts said her company was skipping Black Friday promotions to be “good to … employees” and not force them to work long hours. \nIt wasn’t always this way. \nIn 2014, Apple offered Product (RED) iTunes gift cards with select purchases, including $50 cards for iPhones and iPads, and $100 cards with Mac purchases. These promotions didn’t match what the company offered a year earlier. \nA year before , instead of iTunes cards, Cupertino provided Apple Store gift cards on select Black Friday purchases. This included a $150 gift card on any MacBook purchase and a $75 gift card on the purchase of the then-new iPad Air. \nIt will be interesting to see what Apple has planned for this year. You’ll know soon enough. Apple has published a special Black Friday page that will be updated as deals are announced. \nWe’ll be highlighting Black Friday and Cyber Monday iOS-related deals in the coming days. \nWhich Apple products would you like to see discounted this holiday season?

      "text": "Apple Admits Some iPhone 6S Batteries Are Busted, Will Fix For Free Image courtesy of TechStage okay our bad apple iphone iphone 6s \nThe entire purpose of a smartphone is to be able to go online, message, or call anyone from just about anywhere, so if the battery ceases working you’ve got little more than an expensive fashion accessory. That’s why Apple has agreed to repair some iPhone 6S devices that have a bad habit of suddenly turning themselves off. \nThe issue, Apple says , only affects a small number of iPhone 6S devices that were manufactured in September and October of 2015. \nThe battery isn’t dangerous; it’s not about to overheat or explode or anything. Instead it just… doesn’t work. The phone shuts down, because it’s not getting any power. So if your phone has been shutting off randomly, this may be why. \nTo get this one fixed, you’ll need to take it directly to Apple — not your wireless carrier. You can visit an Apple Store, an Apple “authorized service provider,” or contact Apple tech support online . \nIf your phone’s serial number indicates it’s one of the problem batch, then Apple will fix it for no cost. And if you already paid someone somewhere to replace your battery in the last year, you can ask Apple to reimburse you for that cost. \nYou’ll need to back up your data before you get your phone repaired, Apple cautions. And although the battery replacement itself is free, if there’s anything else wrong with your phone that they’ll have to fix first in order to do the battery replacement (like a cracked screen, for example), then you’ll be on the hook for that part. \nThis is just not a good fall for Apple’s phones, it seems. The immediate predecessor to the 6S model, the 6 and 6 Plus, are also now subject to a repair program for a design flaw . In that case the flaw, called “touch disease” in the techie and consumer world but never by Apple, results in the touch screen becoming unresponsive and, therefore, in the phone becoming totally useless. Apple’s charging $149 for that fix and blaming customers’ behavior for the issue. ",

      "text": "Image courtesy of Greg Wagoner \nNovember 21, 2016 10:46 am EST By Laura Northrup @lnorthrup in for a landing airport base station airport apple routers wifi WiFi routers product lines \nOnce upon a time, at the dawn of the WiFi age, Apple’s AirPort Base Station was a not-ugly plug-and-play option for computer users looking to untether from ethernet cables. In spite of having got off to such a great start, Apple’s router business has sagged since — and now it’s being put out to pasture. \nWhen the AirPort suite of wireless cards and routers hit the market in the late ’90s, the idea that you could be online without a wire was new enough that people at the 1999 MacWorld expo at least pretended to be impressed when Steve Jobs was able to stay online while passing a brightly colored iBook through a hula hoop. \nToday, WiFi is everywhere, and your internet service provider probably provides a router to you that’s part of your modem. What was a pretty small part of Apple’s business has become even smaller. Apple hasn’t made any changes to its line of routers since 2013, when the AirPort line was already behind lower-priced competitors. \nBloomberg Technology explains that Apple reports router sales under an “other products” category that account for about 5% of the company’s total sales. Another product reported in that category is the Apple Watch. \nApple also recently gave up another product line that was overpriced, behind the competition, and not really of interest to customers: its line of external monitors, the newest of which was the Thunderbolt display. \nBloomberg’s source says that the router division was being slowly shut down over the last year or so, with its engineers reassigned to growing products like the Apple TV.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Missed in the flow of Apple ( AAPL ) notes good and bad was one from Morgan Stanley ’s Katy Huberty , who issued a note to clients on the hardware sector overall, stating that her recent meetings with suppliers in Asia reinforce the notion Apple will “ further fragment ” the iPhone in 2017, with a benefit from the higher-priced models, she thinks.\nThe upgrades, which could include wireless charging, are a meaningful upgrade for the device:\nNext year, Apple will adopt flexible AMOLED displays with glass cover on both front and back of the device, move to a new 10nm application processor, and add wireless charging that potentially extends the beam forming technology introduced in the W1 chip this year. As a result, we see two drivers of accelerated upgrades: 1) meaningful form factor change will address pent-up demand in China and 2) improved battery life from AMOLED/App Processor and new charging technology addresses the most important factor driving smartphone upgrades. Fifty percent of smartphone users say battery life is their biggest complaint and reason for upgrades. This compares to 23% of users that listed screen size as the largest upgrade factor back in 2014 before iPhone 6 launched. While still early, Apple is asking for 20-30% capacity additions ahead of iPhone 8 launch, consistent with Apple’s 25% planned capex increase this year. This compares to consensus forecasts for ~10% growth, implying potential upside of 20-25M units and $0.50-1.00 EPS in FY18. \nIt’s early yet, writes Huberty, “to build an accurate bill of materials,” but her overarching theme is:\nThe implication of three (or four) iPhone 8 SKUs – two LCD (current display technology) and one or two OLED screen sizes – as compared to two product lines today is that Apple can further segment pricing and pass through higher component costs to the customer.” That’s good for “gross margin risk,” she writes. \nAmong other things she found was that demand for server computers is expected to continue to rise next year:\nComponent suppliers into most of the US hyperscale data center providers highlight mid 30% revenue growth this year and expectations that those growth rates are unlikely to slow meaningfully next year.\nThe only thing that can slow it down is people pausing until Intel (INTC) releases its “ Purley ” server processor in “mid-2017.”\nApple shares today are up 15 cents at $111.88.",

      "text": "– A + Apple to open third Parisian store on Dec. 3 By Roger Fingas \nTuesday, November 22, 2016, 07:34 am PT (10:34 am ET) \nApple will open a new Parisian store on Dec. 3, the company has announced, marking its third in the heart of the city.\n\n\nImage Credit: Melinda Davan-Soulas on Twitter \n\nThe outlet will be based at Marché Saint-Germain , deep into downtown Paris and not far from major landmarks like the Pantheon and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The grand opening will be at 10 a.m. local time. Typically, hours will run until 8 p.m. —the exception being Sundays, when the shop will operate between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m.\n\nThe Paris area is already well-populated with Apple stores, and indeed Marché Saint-Germain is within walking distance of the Carrousel du Louvre location. Several are distant from the city core however, so a third downtown location could help serve heavy traffic in a city of over 2.2 million residents and large crowds of tourists.\n\nThe shop should follow the fashion-oriented aesthetics of other recent Apple stores, including touches like wooden shelves, an oversized video display, and possibly a tree grove, depending on how much interior space is available.",

      "text": "Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr \nFor the year, the Apple stock price is up 6.6%, and investors have pocketed dividends that yield 2.1% at current prices. If you bought shares before its 2013 stock split (as I did), you’re in luck. \nStill, there are plenty of complaints: The computers are no longer cutting-edge, some say; they canceled the next low-cost phone; the people want their headphone jacks back. Some technicians see Apple stock being cut in half over the next two years. \nTo all this, the company’s management seems to have a simple four-word response: Don’t worry, be happy. Apple believes it knows where it’s going, it sees ample opportunity for profit growth, and all systems are go for launching into its new “spaceship” campus in about two years. The Apple Stock Bull Case \nApple insists its new MacBook laptop is a runaway hit . Senior vice president for marketing Phil Schiller says there are more orders for the MacBook Pro than any other MacBook model, ever . The 10 Best S&P 500 Blue-Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy Now \nThe version without a Touch Bar, a new interface mechanism that sits above the keyboard, got terrible reviews , but early hands-on reviews of units with the new interface are promising . \nThe latest earnings report shows that Apple has also made a successful turn toward cloud-based services. After spending billions of dollars on new data centers, the company is now drawing 13% of revenue from things like Apple Music, App Store sales and iCloud subscriptions. That’s more money than comes in from the Macintosh or the iPad, and it’s not seasonal, as product revenue is. It’s also enormously profitable. \nThe success of services in paying for Apple Cloud should also help it pick up business service customers, independent of its alliance with International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ), which is now worth barely one-fourth what Apple stock is and could become the big takeover story of 2017. The AAPL Bear Case \nDespite this there remain plenty of Apple bears, and the stock continues to trade at just 13 times earnings, well below market multiples. Apple seems to have canceled the iPhone 7SE , its budget phone, in favor of refurbishing old phones and reselling them . \nDespite the success of the MacBook Pro, Apple appears to be de-emphasizing the whole concept of PCs in favor of new mobile devices. But if that’s so, where are the new iPads? \nEven the service story comes with a potentially negative twist. Counterfeit and even malicious apps are turning up in the App Store following a streamlined app approval process. People who bought into Apple stock because of its “walled garden” strategy are becoming angry, and Apple’s claim that it now has an “automated, streamlined process” isn’t helping.",

      "text": "– A + Pundits believe Apple's Jony Ive no longer involved in iPhone, Mac product design By Mike Wuerthele \nTuesday, November 22, 2016, 07:51 am PT (10:51 am ET) \nAccording to numerous reports said to be out of Apple headquarters, the company's Chief Design Officer Jony Ive hasn't contributing much to Apple's consumer goods design as of late, and has been more interested in architecture and similar projects for the last few years.\n\n\n\n\nBased on comments that he had heard over time, Apple journalist Jason Snell speculated that Jony Ive is focused on Apple's \"Spaceship\" campus and store design with retail head Angela Ahrendts.\n\n\"I've heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he's been largely focused on architecture,\" said Snell on John Gruber's \"The Talk Show\" podcast . \"And that maybe the other top-level executive who's been working the most with Ive is Angela Ahrendts.\"\n\nSnell believes that Ive \"has assumed a Jobs-like role\" within Apple and can mandate product direction that may not be in the company's best interest, like a gold Apple watch or an Apple-branded car.\n\nGruber and Snell postulate that Apple's car project, recently rumored to be dramatically scaled back , was originally started at Ive's bidding, and the rumored collapse is the herald of Ive's future departure from the company. Potentially reinforcing that belief, Snell believes rumors floating about that the recent coffee-table \"Designed by Apple in California\" tome was \"decreed\" by Ive, is his swan-song, and acts as a portfolio of the designer's work.\n\nGruber thinks that Ive \"may only be spiritual leadership at this point.\"\n\nThe recently released \"Designed by Apple in California\" book was developed over eight years, and documents materials and techniques used in assembly and construction of all the products in 400 pictures.\n\n\"The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,\" said Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer. \"This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.\"",

      "text": "– A + Circulating five-second video causes Apple iPhones to freeze By Roger Fingas \n  08:05 am PT (11:05 am ET) \niPhone owners are cautioned to be careful about tapping unsolicited links as a new five-second MP4 video, currently being shared online, is causing devices to freeze not long after it's played.\n\n\nImage Credit: The Verge \n\nThe video is corrupt, and appears to be generating a loop which causes iOS 10 to crash, according to The Verge , which tested the glitch on several iPhones running versions of iOS 10.1.x or the iOS 10.2 beta. The issue first came to light on Reddit.\n\nNotably the crash takes about 10 seconds, during which people can do other things on their iPhone as the device gradually slows down. Once an iPhone freezes the only option is to reboot it, though it should work as normal once it recovers.\n\nApple has yet to announce a fix for the issue.\n\nThe company has had to deal with similar issues in the past, such as in 2015, when a text string sent through Messages was able to prevent people from reopening the app, or would crash an iPhone entirely.",

      "text": "Lewiston-Auburn | Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 8:36 am \nUpdated 11:20 a.m.: POLAND — Authorities said someone robbed the Big Apple convenience store early Tuesday at the five-way intersection of routes 26 and 11. Share E-mail this story Print this story Save this story Sponsor \nAndroscoggin County Sheriff Eric Samson said the store clerk was robbed by someone wearing a large, blue coat with a hood. The face appeared to be covered by a towel or bandana up to the eyes. \nThe person, whose gender hasn't been identified, but is believed to be white, entered the store shortly after 3 a.m., walked behind the counter, brandished a knife, and demanded cash and cigarettes from the clerk. \nThe suspect left with several cartons of cigarettes and an unknown amount of cash. The clerk was unharmed. \nA police dog found tracks that appeared to have led to a vehicle in which the suspect may have fled, Samson said. \nAuthorities have viewed surveillance video footage taken inside the store and plan to review it again at their Auburn office where they can enhance the playback quality with zoom features. They also collected surveillance video from outside the store and plan to review it later. \nThe adjacent McDonald's restaurant also had cameras active at the time of the robbery. \n\"There's a lot of surveillance video at that location,\" Samson said. \nTwo possible witnesses in addition to the clerk have been identified; one of them already has been interviewed by authorities. \nThis marks the third time the store has been robbed and the first time since it was rebuilt two years ago. Arrests were made in the other two robberies that resulted in successful prosecutions, Samson said. \nIn one of the two previous robberies, authorities used a tracking dog to eventually capture the robber, he said.",

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nApple announced its Black Friday sale for 2016. Black Friday is the only day of the year Apple offers discounts on its products, and the company skipped Black Friday altogether last year. Apple sent out an email to customers pointing to a placeholder page for Black Friday. That page has no details, but says, “Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.” Both the email and the placeholder page feature an Apple Watch with Friday, November 25th, marked on the face. Seems likely that Apple Watches will be included in the sale, but you never know with Apple.",

      "text": "Apple has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter.\nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn't been publicly announced.\nApple hasn't refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry.\nThe decision to disband the team indicates the company isn't currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans.\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS Routers are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. Apple currently sells three wireless routers, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule. The Time capsule doubles as a backup storage hard drive for Mac computers.\nThe products, which cost $99, $199, and $299, respectively, make up a small slice of Apple's revenue and are part of Apple's \"other products\" category on its financial statements. The category, which includes the Apple Watch and Apple TV, generated $11.1 billion in fiscal 2016, or about 5 percent of total sales.\nExiting the router business could make Apple's product ecosystem less sticky. Some features of the AirPort routers, including wireless music playback, require an Apple device like an iPhone or Mac computer. If the company no longer sells wireless routers, some may have a reason to use other phones and PCs.\nThe core of the technology in routers comes from chipmakers such as Broadcom Ltd. that advance Wi-Fi technology through developing the fundamental components. While router makers can differentiate the design of their products, the number of antennas and the software that controls them, they reliant on advances first made by chipmakers to be able to offer new, higher-performing models.\nApple's AirPorts have historically lagged behind those of companies such as D-Link Corp., Netgear Inc. and Belkin International Inc., which have rushed to adopt new standards. Apple, which has charged more for its routers, has focused more on integrating control of its devices into its computer operating system and industrial design. The company's decision to leave the business may be a boon for other wireless router makers.\nEarlier this year, Apple stopped making its own external monitors and in October introduced a new strategy by selling new high-resolution screens for professional users with LG Electronics Inc.",

      "title": "Is Apple’s Jony Ive done designing iPhones?",
      "text": "Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo \nEven though his soothing voice still fills Apple’s product ads, the company’s design chief, Jony Ive, may not actually be working on consumer products any longer. This speculation comes from pundits who believe Ive has turned to bigger things. Literally. \nJason Snell, who runs his blog Six Colors, was recently a guest in well-known Apple pundit John Gruber’s podcast “The Talk Show,” where he suggested that Jony Ive isn’t, and indeed hasn’t, been designing products like the new MacBook Pro or the iPhone 7. “I’ve heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture,” Snell said on the podcast, suggesting that Jony Ive is instead be working on the Apple Campus 2 project and new store designs with Angela Ahrendts. Apple Campus 2 is the company’s new “spaceship” campus that’s currently under construction. Is Jony Ive winding down at Apple? \nI suppose it would be weird if Jony Ive didn’t have a hand in the company’s largest physical design move ever — he very much does — but it does seem odd that Ive has stepped away from products. He’s well known for his design work and indeed has won various awards and is credited on hundreds of patents. \nPerhaps he’s looking for inspiration elsewhere and is bored with product work. This is purely speculation, but I wonder if this might be one of the reasons we haven’t seen a major change in iPhone design since the iPhone 6 was launched. The podcast says he may have been the one who suggested Apple make the gold Apple Watch, despite a lack of support from other executives inside the company who thought it wasn’t a good idea. Maybe he wants to create more exclusive products that aren’t made for mass consumption? We’re talking about a guy who designed an aluminum desk for a (RED) auction that Sotheby’s sold for $1.685 million , after all. \nThe podcast doesn’t give a definitive answer to Ive’s future and Snell admits that he “doesn’t know anybody that has insight to [the situation.]” Gruber said folks inside Apple “have the impression” that Ive has “either eased into a very different role or he’s either fading away.” The evidence for that is the recent $200 book that Apple launched , which is a celebration of product design. Is it possible this is a celebration of the final products Ive created, too? Apple hasn’t said, but it’s starting to sound very plausible. Take a listen to the podcast where Snell and Gruber dive deeper into the discussion.",

While AI is not necessarily a new field, the advent of supercomputers in out pockets made possible carrying the consumer side of it - virtual assistants like Siri or Google Now - always with us, and that is why the paces of AI development got fierce lately. During its iOS 10 presentation, Apple placed a lot more emphasis on the new features of its digital butler Siri than usual, while Google fought back with the Google Assistant in its new Pixel phones that can even do follow-up questions. Those AI-powered virtual helpers are basically striving for similar goals, but go about achieving them in a different manner, and while Siri is good at some things, Google Assistant may have the upper hand in others, and this handy infographic below will help you understand which does what better.

So, don't text it to your friends (unless you're a jerk).\nThe problem reportedly only occurs when the video is sent as a link rather transferred as a file, although one Reddit commenter on /r/Apple reported that he received the video as a file on WhatsApp and it also caused his phone to crash.\nMashable tested out the video that causes the bug, and it did indeed crash an iPhone 6S running iOS 10.1.1 when it was sent as a link via iMessage.\nThe problem appears to not be with iMessage, but how iOS handles corrupted videos.\nThe bug is similar but not related to another problem that plagued iPhones last year. In that instance, users who received a string of characters via text message saw their iPhones crash and automatically reboot. Apple addressed the issue through a system update.\nUntil Apple fixes the problem, try not to open any suspicious links sent to your iPhone. If you do click on the video by accident, hold down the power button and the home button at the same time to hard reset your phone.\nMashable has reached out to Apple for comment and will update this post if we hear back.\nBONUS: These self-driving buses could make owning a car totally pointless",

      "text": "Is your iPhone 6S randomly shutting down? Apple may owe you a new battery. The company said this week in a post on its website that some iPhone 6S owners are eligible for a free battery replacement because their phones unexpectedly cut their power even when they have enough charge. Apple did not offer many details on why the phones are shutting down, except to say that the problem is “not a safety issue” and that it affects a “very small number” of phones.\nA look at Apple’s support forums suggests that people have been reporting similar problems since at least 2015; users said their phones shut off and could not be restarted until they were plugged in again.\nThe replacement program was announced shortly after a state-approved consumer-protection group in China – a key market for Apple – asked the iPhone maker to address reports that some phones shut off even when their indicators said the phones were charged more than halfway. The Chinese Consumers Association said the issue affected the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6S, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nOnly iPhone 6S phones made between September and October 2015 are included in the program. Smartphone owners who have been having this problem should take their phones to an Apple Store or authorized repair shops to get the official replacement.\nAnd users should know: If there are other problems with the phone, such as a cracked screen, Apple will replace the battery free only if you fix (and pay for) those repairs first. The company said other problems with the phone can make it harder to replace the battery.\nIf you have already had your battery replaced because of this problem, you can contact Apple’s support team and ask for a refund.\nApple launched another replacement program last week after acknowledging that some of its iPhone 6 Plus models had what consumers have called “touch disease” – a long-standing issue in which an iPhone’s screen becomes unresponsive. But Apple did not offer a free fix for that problem, which the company said is caused by users’ dropping their phones repeatedly.\nApple is facing a lawsuit over the “touch disease” issue.\niphone",

      "title": "Apple's Chief Design Officer Tasked To Decorate A Christmas Tree In London's Claridge's",
      "text": "Comment Dolce Gabbana’s Christmas tree for Claridge’s 2014 \nApple's Chief Design Officer Sir Jonathan Ive's legacy is the signature minimalist look of the iPhone and iPod. In a surprising turn of event, Ive recently designed something completely unrelated to technology. Those who love Christmas trees are in for a shock with the outcome of Ive's design. \nLondon's 5-star hotel Claridge's tasked Ive to design their Christmas tree, which has been done for the past seven years. According to Engadget , Ive along with friend and famous industrial designer Marc Newson worked with Michael Howells on the 2016 Claridge's Christmas tree. Ive's trademark seemed to have been taken into account. \nIf you happen to travel to Claridge's, you will gaze at a Christmas tree devoid of any decorations. It's far from the usual Christmas tree with lights around it and gifts underneath. Though it may be unconventional for most who love Christmas trees, Ive and Newson made up for it. Claridge 's posted on its website that there are four-meter light boxes installed. (Photo: Marco Paköeningrat via Flickr)\nApple's Chief Senior Design Officer Jonathan Ive was tasked by London's Claridge's to design their iconic Christmas Tree. Ive went for a minimalist design, his trademark. \nApparently, these objects project \"black and white photographic images of snow covered silver birch trees.\" Those who walk through the hotel lobby will have the same experience when one is walking through a forest. This is caused by \"cast models of Scots pine, layered with both natural and photographed silver birch and fir trees.\" To top it all up, the canopy is of natural green pine. \nWhile moving away from the colorful and joyful feeling of the Christmas season, Ive and Newson described their design as \"recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\" They added that the somber mood creates an \"all-enveloping magical experience.\" \nThis is not the first time that Ive worked together with Newson. They have previously teamed up to create a customized grand piano and the Leica digital camera back in 2013, according to CNN Money . The latter was in support of the HIV/AIDS charity (RED). \nAs for the Claridge's Christmas tree, the hotel has guests to reinterpret it since 2009. Christopher Bailey's Christmas tree last year was covered with over 100 custom-made gold and silver metallic umbrellas and thousands of motions-sensor lights. \nBack in 2013 and 2014, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana designed the Christmas tree. Their theme was inspired by the designers' Italian heritage and childhood memories, respectively. In 2012, McQueens' Kally Ellis decorated the Christmas tree with magnolia branches and lichen moss. Lanvin's Alber Elbaz worked on it in 2011. He used his signature marionettes. The catch is, he chose to put a silk figurine of himself at the top of the Christmas tree. \nThe first two years of Claridge's Christmas tree, Dior's John Galliano was invited to design it. In 2009, Galliano opted for a tropical tree with snow leopard, dragonflies, and parrots. He switched it to an \"under the sea\" theme in 2010. The Christmas tree was filled with sparkling silver leaves, pink corals, seahorses, fish, anemones, starfish, and jellyfish. \nIve took the opposite route as he focused on the environment that the Christmas tree is in.",

      "text": "Fry's claims Apple's BeatsX earbuds due on Dec. 5 By Tuesday, November 22, 2016, 09:14 am PT (12:14 pm ET) Contrasting with another recent online listing, electronics retailer Fry's is now saying that Apple's BeatsX earbuds will ship on Dec. 5. A product page on the Fry's website notes that the company is currently accepting back orders with an estimated Dec. 5 target. The retailer is charging $149.95, as elsewhere. Last week, a B&H listing appeared indicating the earbuds will ship on Dec. 16 . The discrepancy implies that one or both websites are only making guesses, since such product launches tend to take place simultaneously across chains. The BeatsX are one of two missing products with Apple's W1 wireless chip that were promised to ship in time for Christmas. In fact the other, the AirPods, were originally expected to ship earlier this fall. The Beats Solo3 Wireless and Powerbeats3 Wireless are already on shelves. The W1 chip makes it easier to pair with Apple devices, while also improving battery life and range, in some cases as far as 400 feet. Topics:",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple Is Holding a Black Friday Shopping Event \nIf you’re hoping to get some deals on Apple products on Black Friday, the company might have you covered. \nApple has published a new page on its website teasing a Black Friday shopping event. Details are slim at the moment, but the company said on the page that it will be for one day only. The deals will apparently be available both online and in stores. Apple also sent an e-mail to customers on Tuesday with the same hints but no mention of deals. \nApple has always had a hot-and-cold relationship with Black Friday. For several years, the company would offer special deals on the hardware and accessories it sold online and in its stores. However, those deals were widely panned by critics who argued they were hardly deals at all. In years past, for instance, Apple has offered $100 off on Macs that cost thousands of dollars. The company has also offered gift cards with the purchase of a full-priced device. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nLast year, Apple sat out of the Black Friday festivities. The company’s senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts said at the time it wouldn’t offer any Black Friday promotions because “ being good to your employees will always be good for your business .” Ahrendts added she had hoped other retailers would “knock off” the Black Friday tradition that sees massive crowds flock to stores across the U.S. The day also requires employees to work long hours—something from which Ahrendts had signaled she’d want to move away. For more, read: Here Are the Best Black Friday Deals for Tech ; Here Are the Best Cyber Monday Deals for Tech \nHowever, Fortune on Tuesday called Apple AAPL retail stores across the U.S. and found that many will have special hours on Black Friday. While Apple will keep its stores closed on Thanksgiving, unlike many retailers, its brick-and-mortar locations will have extended hours on Black Friday. Many stores that regularly open at 10 a.m. on Fridays will open their doors at 8 a.m. on Black Friday. They’ll also be open a bit later, with one store saying it will be open until 10 p.m. that day—30 minutes later than normal. For more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIt’s unclear what made Apple change its mind about Black Friday. The company did not immediately respond for a request for comment on the move. But it appears that Apple will this year rejoin other retailers and offer deals and extended hours on one of the year’s biggest shopping days. \nIf you’re interested in seeing other deals offered on Apple products by third-party retailers, click here .

      "text": "Buying a new Apple laptop isn’t as simple as deciding between an Air or a Pro anymore.\nApple recently added three new MacBook Pros to its lineup, making the company’s notebook selection more diverse than ever. There’s the feature-packed new Pros, the still-worthwhile old Pros, the critic-favorite MacBook Air, and the ultra-portable 12-inch MacBook. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro is increasingly a worthy laptop replacement.\nSo which MacBook is right for you? Here’s a breakdown of how Apple’s laptops compare that can help you make a decision, whether you’re buying for yourself or a loved one:\nMacBook Pro \n\nThe MacBook Pro is generally a better choice for shoppers who plan to use their laptop for more than just basic word processing and web browsing. Professionals using processor-intensive software like Adobe Photoshop or Final Cut Pro may need the snappier performance the Pro offers. No matter which Pro model you choose, you’ll be getting a speedier processor, an option to add more memory (15-inch Pro models only come with the 16GB memory option, double that of the Air), and a sharper screen than the Air.\nApple now offers several Pro laptops to choose from: the new Touch Bar-enabled version (starting at $1,799 for 13-inch, $2,399 for 15-inch), a similar new Pro without the Touch Bar (starting at $1,499 and only available in 13-inch), and last year’s MacBook Pro (starting at $1,299 for 13-inch, $1,999 for 15-inch.)\nChoosing Between the 2016 vs. 2015 MacBook Pro \nThe previous MacBook Pro is a solid option for those looking to save some cash but also need more horsepower than the Air can provide. It’s $200 cheaper than the new non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro, and offers a brilliantly sharp screen, great battery life, and plenty of power.\nStill, the 2016 edition is probably a better choice for most people, unless you’re on a tight budget and really can’t get by with an Air. Nearly everything on the new MacBook Pro has been at least slightly improved, with faster performance, a thinner and lighter body, a more colorful screen and larger touchpad. But most importantly, going with the 2016 model and its newer processor helps future-proof you, ensuring your laptop won’t get outdated as quickly. That alone could be worth the extra $200.\nThere are other trade-offs to consider here as well. The new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar only comes with 2 USB-C ports, whereas the previous generation Pro includes two USB 3 ports, an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and a MagSafe charging slot. Translation? If you buy the new model, you’ll also probably have to spend extra cash on adapters to keep using older, non-USB-C accessories, like external monitors, camera card readers and so on. (USB-C is quickly becoming the standard , but we’re in the middle of a dongle-ridden transition period.)\nChoosing Between Touch Bar vs. Non-Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro \nThe new MacBook Pro’s biggest update is the Touch Bar , a touchscreen strip that sits just above the keyboard and replaces the standard function keys. The Touch Bar adds some convenience by displaying different buttons as you need them: If you’re sending an email through Apple’s Mail app, the Touch Bar may show keys for formatting text or transferring messages to folders. But when you’re watching a video in Safari, it may include a slider for scrubbing through footage. The Touch Bar-enabled MacBook also has a faster processor, but the difference may not be noticeable enough to influence a buying decision.\nApple MacBook Pro Touch Bar The Touch Bar is an intriguing concept that’s occasionally helpful, but for most people, it’s not enough to justify spending an extra $300. A far more useful addition is the Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button, which makes it possible to quickly log into your account, switch between user accounts, and shop with Apple Pay in Safari. Still, $300 is a steep cost for features that are more convenient than necessary, but if you’re intrigued by the Touch Bar, the boosted specs could make that cost worthwhile.\nIt’s also worth noting that if you want a 2016 MacBook Pro in the 15-inch size, which includes more powerful graphics and a bigger trackpad, you’ll have to opt for the Touch Bar version. The only other 15-inch MacBook Pro option is last year’s model.\nMacBook Air \nBrian Kersey—Getty Images The new 11-inch MacBook Air is displayed at the new Apple Store during a media preview on October 21, 2010 in Chicago, Illinois. The MacBook Air, starting at $999 and only available new in a 13-inch size, is now the cheapest option in Apple’s laptop lineup. With its long battery life, lightweight design, and solid performance, it’s still the best option for most people. But the question is: For how long will that be true? During Apple’s most recent Mac event, the company gave no indication that it plans to update the Air any further. Buying the Air may make sense now, but if Apple doesn’t upgrade it soon, that advice may change.\nThere are a few other drawbacks to consider about the MacBook Air. Most notably, its screen isn’t nearly as sharp as that on the MacBook Pro or 12-inch MacBook models. It also doesn’t include the improvements Apple has added to its more modern laptops, like the Force Touch trackpad and flatter keyboard (although the Air’s older keyboard is fantastic, perhaps even better.) The Air offers more variety than Apple’s newer notebooks in terms of ports (two USB 3, one Thunderbolt 2, and an SD card slot), which means most buyers won’t need to purchase extra dongles to use multiple peripherals or charge their phone while using an accessory. But it doesn’t include any USB-C ports, a factor that may limit its usefulness in the future.\nFor the price, the MacBook Air still offers enough computing prowess to meet basic needs without getting overwhelmed. Those seeking an ultralight laptop primarily for browsing the web, word processing, viewing photos, and streaming media will be satisfied with the Air. Its light weight and long-lasting battery make it particularly great for frequent travelers. All told, the MacBook Air is best for buyers in search of an Apple laptop with more power than the 12-inch MacBook that won’t cost as much as a Pro.\nMacBook (12-inch) \n\nApple’s 12-inch MacBook is its most portable and slimmest laptop, but it’s also very expensive for the level of performance it provides, starting at $1,299. Unlike Apple’s other laptops, the MacBook runs on one of Intel’s less powerful Core M processors, rather than its Core I lineup. These processors are designed to generate less heat, helping companies like Apple and others make extremely thin and light fan-less computers. This advantage is especially evident in the 12-inch MacBook, which is elegantly designed and highly portable. Carrying around the notebook, which weighs just over two pounds, feels more like toting around an iPad. It also includes a gorgeous screen as well as Apple’s new butterfly mechanism keyboard and Force Touch trackpad, similar to those on the latest MacBook Pro models.\nWith its less powerful processor, Apple’s 12-inch MacBook is mainly targeted at casual computer users looking for a highly portable laptop for browsing the web, working on documents and so on. But the Air is a better choice for most people. It’s cheaper, more powerful, and offers longer battery life than its 12-inch cousin. Plus, the 12-inch MacBook only comes with one USB-C port, which can be a nightmare if you have lots of accessories. Unless you truly need a lightweight laptop with an ultra-crisp display that’s smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air, the 12-inch model isn’t the best value.\nWhat About iPads? \nAnadolu Agency—Getty Images Shopper is seen using the new iPad Pro in the Apple store of the High-end shopping district of Omotesando in Tokyo, Japan on November 12, 2015. If portability and screen resolution are important to you, it’s worth your time to consider Apple’s iPad Pro as well. The smaller and more manageable 9.7-inch size starts at $599, and Apple sells its keyboard case separately for $149. That means for $850 — roughly $450 cheaper than the entry level 12-inch MacBook — you can get a 128GB 9.7-inch iPad Pro with Apple’s keyboard case.\nThere are major differences to consider, though. Most notably, the iPad Pro runs on iOS rather than macOS, so you’re not getting a full desktop experience. Nor does the iPad Pro include any ports other than its Lightning charging slot and a headphone jack. Its official keyboard accessory, meanwhile, isn’t as sturdy as the keyboards on Apple’s laptops. But it may be worth a look if you want something more affordable that’s easy to carry around for jotting down notes, watching Netflix and doing some light photo or video editing.",

      "text": "Philippe Lopez | AFP | Getty Images Apple is promoting a special one-day shopping event on Black Friday — but so far, the details are a mystery. \nThe company has posted a holiday gift guide, touting a one-day shopping event happening this Friday. But so far, the only promotions listed are free two-day delivery on in-stock items ordered by 5 p.m., and extended shopping hours. \nThere may be more to come, as Apple urges users to \"come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\" But for now, the page lists a gift guide of Apple's regularly priced items. CNBC has reached out to Apple for more details but has not heard back. \nStill, any promotion would be a departure for the tech giant, which holds few sales. It has, in the past, offered bundled gift cards, but has more or less stayed away from the holiday rush in recent years. \nMeanwhile, retailers have done their own discounts and promotions. This year, Target is offering 25 percent off Apple TV models , 20 percent off iPods, and sales on Beats headphones and iPads. Best Buy is offering $125 off iPads and $50 off Apple Watch Series 1, as well as offers on Macs.\nApple has promised investors that it will return to revenue growth , after reporting three straight quarters of iPhone sales that were lower year over year . Demand for the new iPhone 7 was stoked in part by aggressive promotions from wireless carriers this fall.",

      "text": "Is your iPhone 6S randomly shutting down? Apple may owe you a new battery. The company said this week in a post on its website that some iPhone 6S owners are eligible for a free battery replacement because their phones unexpectedly cut their power even when they have enough charge. Apple did not offer many details on why the phones are shutting down, except to say that the problem is \"not a safety issue\" and that it affects a \"very small number\" of phones.\nA look at Apple's support forums suggests that people have been reporting similar problems since at least 2015; users said their phones shut off and could not be restarted until they were plugged in again.\nThe replacement program was announced shortly after a state-approved consumer-protection group in China — a key market for Apple — asked the iPhone maker to address reports that some phones shut off even when their indicators said the phones were charged more than halfway. The Chinese Consumers Association said the issue affected the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6S, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nOnly iPhone 6S phones made between September and October 2015 are included in the program. Smartphone owners who have been having this problem should take their phones to an Apple Store or authorized repair shops to get the official replacement.\nAnd users should know: If there are other problems with the phone, such as a cracked screen, Apple will replace the battery free only if you fix (and pay for) those repairs first. The company said other problems with the phone can make it harder to replace the battery.\nIf you have already had your battery replaced because of this problem, you can contact Apple's support team and ask for a refund.\nApple launched another replacement program last week after acknowledging that some of its iPhone 6 Plus models had what consumers have called \"touch disease\" — a long-standing issue in which an iPhone's screen becomes unresponsive. But Apple did not offer a free fix for that problem, which the company said is caused by users' dropping their phones repeatedly.\nApple is facing a lawsuit over the \"touch disease\" issue.",

      "text": "0 \nHot on the heels of the launch of its iPhone 6 Plus “touch disease” repair program , Apple has announced another program for the iPhone 6s. \nApple is now offering a repair program for iPhone 6s models that “may unexpectedly shut down.” The company points out that this isn’t a safety issue, so you don’t have to worry about the battery harming you or your device. \nThis issue affects a limited number of devices that were manufacturer between September and October 2015. If you believe that your device has this unexpected shutdown issue, you can go to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider to have your phone’s eligibility checked. If it qualifies for a repair, you’ll get a free battery replacement. \nHave you or anyone you know been affected by this iPhone 6s battery shutdown issue? Via:",

      "text": "| License Photo \nIt will be an Apple Cup like few others. \nNo. 6 Washington will play at No. 23 Washington State on Friday, with the Pac-12 North title on the line for both teams. The game, which kicks off at 3:30 p.m. ET in Pullman, Wash., will mark just the sixth time since the AP poll debuted in 1936 that both teams are ranked. \nFor the Huskies (10-1 overall, 7-1), there is more than just a berth in the conference title game on the line. They could have a spot in the College Football Playoff with two more victories. \n\"I just want them to prepare like they have and go over and compete like they have, which I know they will,\" Washington coach Chris Petersen said of his team. \n\"We know it's like, 'All this hard work kind of comes down to this.' But it's really hard for me to say, like, 'OK, now we're really all-in on this.' I just think they've really been invested this whole year, every game. \n\"But it'll be exciting. They get the rivalry. They get that we're playing a heck of a team in a really hostile situation.\" \nWashington bounced back from its only loss, to USC, with a 44-18 win over Arizona State on Saturday. Washington State (8-3, 7-1) had its eight-game winning streak snapped with a 38-24 loss at Pac-12 South-leading Colorado. \nThere hasn't been so much on the line for both teams since 1981. Washington won that Apple Cup 23-10 to deny Washington State the Pac-10 title, which the Huskies won when USC beat UCLA on the same day. \nBoth Petersen and Cougars coach Mike Leach put their players off limits to the media this week. \n\"There's a lot of distractions. I don't want them distracted,\" Leach said. \"I want them focused in on just playing.\" \nAs for that stuff on the field, Washington will try to draw inspiration from last season's 45-10 win over Washington State, although that comes with a caveat. The Cougars didn't have quarterback Luke Falk. \n\"That always frustrated me (that Falk didn't play), because all the Cougar fans, they're like, 'Oh, if we had Luke Falk ...,'\" Huskies defensive tackle Elijah Qualls told the Seattle Times. \"Come on, man. I'm not going to lie: The dude is good. But 35 points? I don't know about that.\" \nIt will be a battle of two brilliant quarterbacks. \nFalk has 3,935 passing yards this season, fourth-most in Washington State single-season history. Falk, directing Leach's prolific Air Raid system, tops the nation in completions per game (34.6) and completion percentage (71.4). \nLeach said Monday he expects Falk to return for his senior season. \nWashington quarterback Jake Browning leads the Pac-12 with 37 touchdown passes -- one more than Falk -- and is fourth nationally in passing efficiency with a rating of 180.7. \n\"He does a really job from the neck up,\" Leach said of Browning. \"Him and Luke are very similar that way, I think.\" \nBoth quarterbacks have elite receivers. Washington State's Gabe Marks is the Pac-12 career leader with 301 receptions, including 74 this season, with 12 going for touchdowns. Ross has all kinds of speed, with 64 catches for 991 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nRoss has a sidekick in Dante Pettis, who has four 100-yard receiving games this season. Marks lost his main sidekick two games ago when receiver River Cracraft suffered a season-ending knee injury. \nWashington's offense is more traditionally balanced, as the Huskies have gone over 200 yards on the ground seven times this season, led by running back Myles Gaskin. \nWashington State is 114th nationally in rushing at 132.5 yards per game, but the Cougars can run the ball more effectively than most Leach teams behind the trio of Jamal Morrow, James Williams and Gerard Wicks. They have combined for 1,515 yards. \nWashington has lost two of its top defenders to season-ending injuries -- linebackers Joe Mathis and Azeem Victor -- but still managed to limit USC and Arizona State to 128 rushing yards on 63 carries in the past two weeks. \nThe Huskies are often able to generate a pass rush without blitzing, which would give them ample numbers in the back end to defend against Washington State's spread attack. Cornerbacks Sidney Jones and Kevin King, and safety Budda Baker, are postseason award candidates in one of the nation's best secondaries. \nWashington State is no slouch defensively. The Cougars, led up front by defensive end Hercules Mata'afa, are first in the Pac-12 against the run, allowing 129.7 yards per game. WSU also got back senior nose tackle Robert Barber last week. He had missed three games following legal entanglements.",

      "text": "Apple is replacing the batteries in iPhone 6S... | 27 minutes ago | Vote 0 0 Apple is replacing the batteries in iPhone 6S models that randomly shut off Apple Richard Drew,The Associated Press Some iPhone 6S owners are eligible for a free battery replacement because their phones unexpectedly cut their power even when they have enough charge. By Hayley Tsukayama Is your iPhone 6S randomly shutting down? Apple may owe you a new battery. The company said this week in a post on its website that some iPhone 6S owners are eligible for a free battery replacement because their phones unexpectedly cut their power even when they have enough charge. Apple did not offer many details on why the phones are shutting down, except to say that the problem is \"not a safety issue\" and that it affects a \"very small number\" of phones. A look at Apple's support forums suggests that people have been reporting similar problems since at least 2015; users said their phones shut off and could not be restarted until they were plugged in again. The replacement program was announced shortly after a state-approved consumer-protection group in China — a key market for Apple — asked the iPhone maker to address reports that some phones shut off even when their indicators said the phones were charged more than halfway. The Chinese Consumers Association said the issue affected the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6S, the Wall Street Journal reported. Only iPhone 6S phones made between September and October 2015 are included in the program. Smartphone owners who have been having this problem should take their phones to an Apple Store or authorized repair shops to get the official replacement. And users should know: If there are other problems with the phone, such as a cracked screen, Apple will replace the battery free only if you fix (and pay for) those repairs first. The company said other problems with the phone can make it harder to replace the battery. If you have already had your battery replaced because of this problem, you can contact Apple's support team and ask for a refund. Apple launched another replacement program last week after acknowledging that some of its iPhone 6 Plus models had what consumers have called \"touch disease\" — a long-standing issue in which an iPhone's screen becomes unresponsive. But Apple did not offer a free fix for that problem, which the company said is caused by users' dropping their phones repeatedly. Apple is facing a lawsuit over the \"touch disease\" issue.  ",

      "text": "  12:09pm CST | by Ahmed Humayun , in News | Apple \nWe will be giving you a benchmark comparison of Pixel/Pixel XL VS iPhone7/iPhone 7 Plus. Google has done an impressive job with the Pixel/Pixel XL phones. The recent event held by Google has actually gained much attention which will certainly be beneficial for Pixel Phones. Don't Miss: The Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad \nHowever from the performance perspective Apple does not have much to worry about. The early benchmarks received from Geekbench 4 tell us that Apple does not have to worry as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both beat the Pixel duo in single and multi-core tests. \nWhat is more surprising is that even old hardware such the iPhone SE and iPhone 6S outperform the Pixel duo. Google’s new hardware has been manufactured by HTC. From a software/hardware perspective the hardware is doing well. \nBut for those who are stricter on performance the real deal is on how the device performs. Below are some results obtained from the Geekbench 4 testing: \n• The Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones returned a single-core score of around 1550, and a multi-core return of around 4000. \n• Apple’s iPhone 7 showed a multi-core score of around 5500, and a single-core score of around 3500 \nThe Apple results are much higher than what the Google hardware can ever each. Even the Apple SE and iPhone 6S beat the Pixel phone in single-core performance. \nThis means Apple’s hardware in general is more powerful and has a higher raw processing capability than Google. These results do not confirm as to how the Pixel Phones will perform in the real world but the results can certainly be kept in mind while ordering. You May Like",
